Pictured on the right is the Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen in 
Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The Depot stores the artwork for 
the adjacent museum of the same name. The museum’s collection 
comprises more than 151,000 objects, only eight percent of 
which can be displayed in the museum. In Depot Boijmans Van 
Beuningen the public can enjoy the remainder of the collection. 

With fi ve diff erent climate zones and the invaluable nature of the 
collection, thermal effi  ciency and security were key considerations 
in the choice of building envelope solutions. Kingspan worked with 
the architects, MVRDV, to customise the optimal solution.

Global consumption has increased 
50% in the last 20 years.

2021 was an all-time high for global 
energy use. The world is facing a global 
climate crisis and we continue to add 
fuel to the fire. 82% of primary energy 
consumption continues to come from 
fossil fuels.

Energy  
Conservation
It is estimated that over 75% of the EU’s 
building stock is energy inefficient.

If we can make our buildings more 
efficient, we can save a considerable 
amount of energy annually, driving down 
the need for, and reliance upon, fossil fuel 
energy production.

Energy  
Transition
Solar energy is the most abundant, 
and one of the most renewable energy 
resources on earth. According to the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), 173,000 
terawatts of solar energy strike the earth 
continuously which is more than 10,000 
times the world’s total energy use.

Every community, indeed every building, 
can play a part in transitioning to 
smarter, renewable energy sources. 

Faced with energy shortfalls and 
high prices, governments have so far 
committed well over $500billion  
to shield consumers from the 
immediate impacts.

New policies in major energy markets will 
help propel annual clean energy investment 
to more than $2trillion by 2030 in the STEPS 
(Stated Policies Scenario), a rise of more 
than 50% from today.

Transition

In focus

THERE IS NO SINGLE 
PERFECT RENEWABLE 
ENERGY SOURCE TO 
TRANSITION TO.

Diversifi cation of the energy network is 
key to our future energy security.

Communities and individual buildings 
need to be able to sustainably serve 
their needs in energy and heat. In some 
places, that future is already here, and 
so is Kingspan.

Here are some of the ways Kingspan is supporting that transition:

Thermal energy at 
a municipal level
In a district heating system, the heat in 
your building, your neighbours’ buildings, 
and the nearby offi  ce, is all being piped 
from the same centralised source.

This centralisation is more effi  cient 
than heat being generated by each 
individual building.

The energy powering the heating system 
can come from renewable sources or 
waste heat from other industries such 
as data centres.

Delivering on strategy
This excellent result, against a backdrop of global uncertainty 
in many of our markets, demonstrates the success of our core 
strategy centred around the four key pillars of Innovation, Planet 
Passionate, Global, and Completing the Envelope. 

Our strong balance sheet enabled us to pursue investment 
opportunities that bolster this strategy. During the year, we 
achieved a new milestone in ‘Completing the Envelope’ by 
establishing a new global Roofing + Waterproofing division 
through the acquisition of Ondura Group, a global provider of 
roofing solutions, and Derbigum, a leading Belgian based provider 
of waterproofing membranes. In parallel, we have continued 
our organic global growth, with several new facilities either 
commissioned or in progress during the year including in Vietnam, 
Australia, Brazil and the US.  

We also continued to invest in new high performance technologies 
with the development of the A-rated AlphaCore® insulation 
board, and the new QuadCoreTM LEC (lower embodied carbon) 
insulated panel, both of which will be launched to market in early 
2023, and will help our end users to reduce the carbon footprint 
of the built environment. Throughout the year we continued to 
make meaningful progress in our Planet Passionate programme, 
including further advances in absolute carbon emission reduction 
across our global operations, full details of which will be published 
shortly in our 2022 Planet Passionate Sustainability Report.

Dividend 
Thanks to these positive results, the Board is pleased to 
recommend a final dividend of 23.8 cent per share, which if 
approved at the Annual General Meeting, will give a total dividend 
for the year of 49.4 cent (compared to 45.9 cent in the prior 
year). This is in line with the Company’s previously announced 
shareholder returns policy. If approved, the final dividend will be 
paid (subject to Irish withholding tax rules) on 9 May 2023 to 
shareholders on the register at close of business on 14 April 2023.

I extend my 
sincere thanks to 
management and 
all our colleagues 
across the business 
for your hard work 
and contribution to 
Kingspan’s success  
in 2022. 

Management and employees
Kingspan is a team of over 22,000 
talented and dedicated people. On 
behalf of the Board, I particularly 
want to welcome those who joined 
the business during this past year. 
They joined a pioneering team of 
colleagues and innovators who make 
a difference to our planet and the 
climate challenge every day. During 
2022, the Board and I were delighted 
to meet and hear from many of 
you on our trips to LATAM and the 
Nordics, amongst others.  

I extend my sincere thanks to 
management and all our colleagues 
across the business for your hard 
work and contribution to Kingspan’s 
success in 2022. I look forward to 
meeting many more of you from the 
Kingspan team on our site visits later 
this year.

Ukraine and Turkey
Like so many others, we were shocked 
as events unfolded in Ukraine last 
year. I particularly want to send 
my good wishes to our Ukrainian 
colleagues, their families and their 
loved ones. In response, Kingspan 
supported the establishment of five 
UNICEF Blue Dot Hubs, to provide 
support and protection to those 
fleeing the war. We also announced 
our proposed €200m investment in a 
new Building Technology Campus in 
Ukraine where we will manufacture 

a range of products to help meet 
Ukraine’s vision of rebuilding a low 
carbon built environment to the 
highest levels of energy-efficiency. 
We intend to establish this campus as 
soon as conditions permit, and indeed 
significant preparatory work is already 
under way.  

We were also deeply distressed by  
the recent earthquake in Turkey and 
Syria which has had a devastating 
impact on many of our colleagues 
in our Turkish facilities. Kingspan is 
already providing practical support 
to those on the ground, and on 
behalf of the Board, I extend our 
sincerest sympathies and support to 
all those affected.

Board governance
In last year’s Annual Report, I 
highlighted the Board’s key areas of 
focus around governance. Following 
on from that, the Board appointed 
Better Boards to carry out an 
independent review of the Board, into 
its effectiveness, culture, committees, 
and composition. The review found 
that the Board and its committees 
were working effectively, whilst also 
highlighting the need to further build 
diversity and international experience 
at Board level. The Board has adopted 
all the recommendations of the Better 
Boards report, including formally 
underpinning its commitment to 
improving diversity through the 
adoption of Kingspan’s Board Diversity 
Policy. Further details of Better Boards 
report and recommendations are set 
out in the Report of the Nominations 
& Governance Committee.

Board changes
During the year, we were delighted to 
welcome Senan Murphy to the Board 
as an independent non-executive 
director. Senan brings a wealth of 
industry and financial experience 
across multiple sectors including 
banking, building materials and 
renewable energy. We are also very 
pleased to announce the appointment 
of Louise Phelan, who will join 

the Board in April this year as an 
independent non-executive director. 
Louise is a highly respected business 
leader and adviser, with experience 
leading global organisations in 
both the renewable energy and 
finance sectors. We look forward to 
benefitting from their experience in 
the years ahead.

Following the conclusion of this 
year’s Annual General Meeting in 
April, both Michael Cawley and John 
Cronin will be retiring from the Board 
on the expiration of their terms of 
office. Both Michael and John have 
been valued Board and committee 
members over the past nine years.  
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank them both for their significant 
contributions to Kingspan during 
those years. 

Looking ahead
No doubt 2023 will bring fresh 
challenges to Kingspan and the wider 
global community. However, I remain 
confident that Kingspan’s strong 
balance sheet and management’s 
relentless focus on delivering on its 
strategy, will continue to build on 
the success of prior years in bringing 
sustainable long-term value to our 
stakeholders whilst supporting the 
climate change goals of our end users 
across the globe.

extended our exposure in insulation 
to pre-insulated pipe systems 
which service the district heating 
segment. Industrial insulation is a 
segment which contains signifi cant 
opportunity for Kingspan to expand 
in the future. The operation of 
buildings accounts for 28% of carbon 
emissions globally. While space 
heating is the largest consumer of 
energy in buildings, heating water 
and space cooling are also key energy 
consumers. Kingspan has innovative 
and ultra-performance products in 
both piping and ducting insulation. 

Data + Flooring 
Kingspan is the world’s largest supplier 
of raised access fl ooring and data 
centre airfl ow management systems. 
Raised access fl ooring is the most cost 
eff ective way of creating a fl exible 
working environment by utilising the 
fl oor void to manage the distribution 
of M&E services and HVAC systems. 
Our systems have many benefi ts 
including optimising overall building 
height, achieving faster construction 
with greater design fl exibility, enabling 
easier reconfi guration of a workspace, 
and improving indoor air quality.

Roofi ng + Waterproofi ng
Kingspan has a long established 
interest in developing a roofi ng 
and waterproofi ng segment to 
complement our insulation board 
off ering. Roofi ng membrane and 
roofi ng components are essential 
elements for the energy effi  ciency 
and water protection of a building 
envelope. Through the acquisitions 
of Ondura Group and Derbigum 
in 2022, Kingspan will have an 
annual run rate in this segment of c. 
€500m. Going forward we expect to 
off er single component membrane 
solutions and to also supply roof 
systems incorporating membrane 
and insulation, giving our customers 
increased warranty protection from a 
single trusted supplier.

Harness the power of the 
natural environment

Light + Air 
Kingspan Light + Air is established 
as a global leader providing a full 
suite of daylighting solutions, as well 
as natural ventilation and smoke 
management solutions, which 
complement our existing building 
envelope technologies. Thermal 
comfort, indoor air quality and natural 
daylighting are widely recognised as 
the most important factors aff ecting 
occupant wellbeing in buildings.

Our Strategic 
Pillars

Our business model and 
our strategic pillars 
enable the ongoing 
conversion to ultra-
performance building 
envelopes from outdated, 
ineffi  cient, methods of 
construction.

Innovation
Kingspan’s innovation agenda is driven across four 
key themes - performance, solutions, sustainability, 
and digitalisation. 
We have a persistent focus on iterative performance 
improvements in our current portfolio including 
characteristics relating to thermal, structural, 
sustainability, fi re and smoke. We innovate solutions 
to enable architects and building designers to create 
sustainable buildings, such as our integrated insulated 
panel with solar-PV, PowerPanel™. And by progressively 
surfacing our products digitally, we are making it easier to 
fi nd them, specify them, buy them and track them.

Planet Passionate
Our Planet Passionate agenda is inextricably linked 
with innovation. Planet Passionate is Kingspan’s 
10-year sustainability programme which aims to 
impact three big global issues – climate change, 
circularity and protection of our natural world. 
By setting ourselves challenging targets in the areas of 
carbon, energy, circularity and water, we aim to make 
signifi cant advances in both our business operations and 
our products.

Completing the Envelope 
Our strategy of ‘Completing the Envelope’ aims to 
take our innovation and sustainability DNA and apply 
them to a wider portfolio of products which are 
complementary to our current off ering. 
Our solutions driven approach deepens our relationships 
with our customers and extends the opportunities to make 
buildings better for the future.

Global
Kingspan is a truly global business, trading in
over 80 countries with 212 manufacturing sites 
across the globe. 
We aim to continue expanding globally to bring ultra-
performance building envelope solutions to markets which 
are at an earlier stage in their evolution to sustainable and 
effi  cient methods of construction.

Innovation 

     

PowerPanel™ 
PowerPanel™ is a fully integrated, 
factory manufactured, insulated 
panel with solar PV. The initial 
launch in the UK and Ireland 
shows encouraging early signs and 
preparation is now underway for 
production in additional regions.

QuadCoreTM (LEC)
Our Innovation and Planet Passionate 
teams worked in partnership to  
take signifi cant steps forward in the 
development of lower embodied 
carbon alternatives for our 
QuadCore™ insulated panel products 
produced in the UK and Ireland. 
QuadCore™ LEC will have c.17% 
lower embodied carbon (based on 
LCA modules A - C) when compared 
to the existing Quadcore™ insulated 
panel product. 

      

AlphaCore® 

Part of our R&D agenda is working 
and engaging with innovators 
and small-scale manufacturers 
of pioneering materials. In 2022 
this led to a breakthrough in the 
development of AlphaCore® which is 
currently building a specifi cation bank 
and is likely to advance further in the 
years ahead. 

Planet Passionate  

     
        

Internal carbon charge 
From the 1st of January 2023 each 
business unit will have an internal 
charge of €70 per tonne for all energy 
related carbon emissions (excluding 
process and biogenic emissions). 
This will help to further incentivise 
the rapid deployment of 
decarbonisation projects to support 
the achievement of our net zero 
carbon manufacturing target.

     

Energy and Carbon
2022 saw a reduction of 26% in Scope
1 & 2 carbon emissions from a 2020
baseline. This reduction was achieved
through reduction in use of high GWP 
blowing agents in North America, the 
implementation of new renewable 
energy contracts and the deployment 
of 18 new rooftop solar-PV projects 
across our business which have the 
capacity to generate 6.4 GWh of 
energy annually.

Expansion  

  

Roofi ng + Waterproofi ng
In 2022 Kingspan established its 
Roofi ng + Waterproofi ng division 
through the acquisition of Ondura 
Group and Derbigum. Roofi ng has 
been a targeted area of expansion 
as a complementary category to our 
energy effi  cient building envelope 
solutions. The 12-month revenue run 
rate for this newly established division  
should reach c. €500m. 

   
         

Bio-based Insulation
In March 2022, Kingspan completed 
the acquisition of Troldtekt, a wood 
fi bre acoustic insulation producer in 
Denmark, marking our fi rst signifi cant 
step into the ‘bio-based insulation’ 
category. This is an area in which we 
expect to make further advances in 
the foreseeable future.

     

Global 
We continued to expand organically 
in 2022, including breaking ground 
on our fi rst facility in South East Asia, 
Vietnam, late in the year. We have a 
signifi cant amount of planned new 
lines and facilities, which will add over 
10% to our current global footprint 
over the next three years. Within 
those plans is our ambition to invest 
over €200m in a Building Technology 
Campus in Ukraine.

Our Belief

Historically, construction has taken 
from nature with little consideration 
given to the finite resources available. 
Buildings were constructed without 
contemplating how they might 
impact future generations. We believe 
that buildings now and into the future 
need to deliver more than ever before. 
They must combat climate change by 
maximising energy efficiency through 
superior thermal performance while 
incorporating products that are 
lower in embodied carbon across 
their entire lifecycle. Using less 
energy is not enough; buildings 
should generate their own energy 
too. Buildings should be healthy and 
inspirational, optimising the benefits 
of daylight and clean air. They 
should be designed, constructed and 
operated to protect natural resources 
and conserve water as much as 
possible. Above all they must be safe, 
protecting people and property from 
fire and other natural hazards.

Our Culture and Values 

Kingspan has grown from a family 
business and many of the values 
associated with family businesses form 
the backbone of our culture today. 
The business has been built on trust 
in the integrity of our people and of 
our offering. We value this trust and 
recognise it as being fundamental 
to our ongoing success. We are 
entrepreneurial, collaborative, honest, 
and we stand behind a common cause 
– better buildings for a better world. 

We are innovative. We are the market 
leader in the field of high-performance 
building envelope solutions, which 
ensure lifetime carbon and resource 
savings. We have gained this position 
through a creative and solutions driven 
mindset, which continues to inform our 
innovation agenda today. 

We think long-term. The strategy 
of the business is driven by long-
term ambitions and not by quarterly 
performance. The success of this 
strategy can be seen in our long-term 
growth. This ethos is apparent in our 
multi-year commitments such as  
our 10-year Planet Passionate 
programme which will drive real, 
positive, impact for the environment 
and forms a common global goal 
across the business.

Code Of Conduct 

Kingspan expects the highest 
standards of integrity, honesty 
and compliance with the law from 
our employees, our directors and 
our partners, globally. We actively 
encourage our employees to speak 
out if they experience instances that 
are not in keeping with the principles 
outlined in our Code of Conduct. 

Over 95% of Kingspan employees 
have completed online training on our 
updated Code of Conduct since its 
launch in 2021. Our business success is 
inextricably linked to our behaviours, 
and our aspiration is to maintain a 
culture where our everyday actions are 
built on five core principles: 

 @ Clear, ethical and honest 
behaviours and communications;

 @ Compliance with the law; 

 @ Respect for the safety and 
wellbeing of colleagues; 

 @ Protection of our Group assets; 
and

 @ Upholding our commitment to a 
more sustainable future.

Chief  
Executive’s  
Review 
Gene M. Murtagh

Business Review 
The 2022 outcome for the Group as a 
whole was relatively pleasing given the 
accumulating uncertainty as the year 
progressed. Over-life carbon saved in 
buildings using insulation systems we 
manufactured in 2022 is an estimated 
173 million tonnes of CO2e, driving 
record revenue of €8.3bn and record 
trading profit of €833m. This was 
achieved at a time of exceptional 
inflation and unprecedented 
disruption in supply chains globally, 
which was less a feature in the latter 
part of the year.
The performance of individual markets and economies varied 
significantly with the Americas, Germany and Australasia the 
most stable for Kingspan, with much of Europe weaker. The 
pattern of trade was also at odds with prior periods where 
many of our routes to market built inventory in the earlier part 
of the year, largely out of caution, followed by industry-wide 
efforts to lower stock levels in the second half. 

Virtually all walks of life have been and will be further impacted 
by the prevailing energy cost and availability dynamics. This has 
understandably led to broader and growing concerns which may 
weigh on demand in the year or so ahead. Conversely, it has also 
generated an unprecedented impetus amongst governments 
and society in general to ensure measures are taken to curtail 
reliance on fossil fuel. Conservation in buildings is a key 
component of this given almost 40% of all global energy related 
carbon emissions emanate from buildings and construction. Our 
solutions can, and are, playing a meaningful long-term role in 
this process. 

Operational Summary
 @ Record year overall in a testing environment 

and a tougher second half.  

 @ Insulated Panels sales increase of 23% driven 
by raw material price growth and a 46% 
increase in global sales volume of QuadCoreTM. 
Ground-breaking Lower Embodied Carbon 
(LEC) insulated panel launched recently. 

 @ Insulation sales strongly ahead by 40% 
driven by inflation and acquisitions. District 
heating applications a standout performer. 
Significant progress on entry into the 
bio-based insulation category. AlphaCore® 
launching shortly. Technical insulation now 
comprising 35% of divisional revenue. 

 @ Roofing + Waterproofing platform embedded. 
Annualised revenue run rate in excess of 
€500m. Ondura Group acquisition completed 
in September 2022 following Derbigum 
acquisition and strategic minority investment 
of 24% in Nordic Waterproofing. 

 @ Technical insulation and roofing significantly 
increase the Group’s exposure to RMI. 

 @ Significant progress at Light + Air, with a sales 
increase of 27% and margins progressing year 
on year. 

 @ Strong performance in Data + Flooring 
with sales up 33% and a strong data centre 
solutions pipeline into 2023.

 @ Invested a total of €1.3bn in acquisitions, 
purchase of minority interest and capex 
during the year.

Planet Passionate and our impact
The vast majority of what we 
provide to the market enables 
others to dramatically reduce energy 
consumption and its related GHG 
emissions. That estimated impact 
during 2022 was 173 million tonnes of 
CO2e saved from insulation systems 
we sold during the year, taking into 
account their contributions over the 
life of the building infrastructure that 
they serve. 

Internally, our Planet Passionate 
initiative once again made 
tremendous progress, despite being 
hampered by supply issues, largely 
related to the procurement of solar 
panels from Asia. 

In summary, 18 solar PV projects were 
completed across our facilities during 
the year which will generate 6.4 GWh 
of renewable electricity annually. 
803 million PET bottle equivalent of 
recycled material was processed across 
the Group, and 14 rainwater harvesting 
systems were installed. In addition, 
58% of all new company funded cars 
in the year were replaced with zero 
emission vehicles, and our waste to 
landfill for the whole business reduced 
by 42% since 2020.

Investing in our future 
Between organic and inorganic 
initiatives, we invested a total of 
€1.3bn during the year. Capital 
projects, mainly focused on capacity 
expansion, amounted to €276m and 
included significant projects either 
completed or commenced in the US, 
Brazil, France, Germany, Vietnam and 
Australia. Preparatory work is also 

underway for the Ukraine Technology 
Campus that we announced last year. 
Understandably progress has been 
slow to date although we anticipate 
investing over €200m in the project 
over the next four years.

Acquisitions have long been a 
prominent feature of our strategy 
and in 2022 we invested a total 
of €1,054m, a record, in adding 
geographic footprint and new 
business lines to our portfolio 
including deferred consideration and 
a strategic minority investment. In 
total six transactions were completed, 
the largest of which was Ondura, a 
French headquartered global provider 
of roofing solutions. Together with 
Derbigum, this now forms the 
platform for expansion deeper into the 
Roofing + Waterproofing arena with 
combined annual run-rate revenues 
of approximately €500m entering 
the current year. In addition, we also 
acquired a 24% strategic holding in 
Nordic Waterproofing. 

Innovation at work 
The nucleus of our innovation 
agenda is focused on driving product 
improvement across thermal, 
renewable content, embodied 
carbon and fire performance, while 
also incorporating more bio-based 
solutions across our portfolio. 

PowerPanelTM and RooftricityTM made 
it to market during 2022 with very 
encouraging early signs. We have 
limited the launch to Ireland and 
the UK for the time being due to 
component supply constraints. Initial 
preparations are now underway for 

PowerPanelTM production enablement 
in the US, France and the Czech 
Republic, likely entering production 
sometime in 2024. 

Our QuadCoreTM LEC (Lowered 
Embodied Carbon) insulated panel 
launched recently, giving rise to an 
estimated 17% reduction in embodied 
carbon (in life cycle modules A - C) 
relative to existing product. We aim 
to achieve further reductions in 
embodied carbon as we progress 
towards our 2030 supply chain targets.  
This is an exciting new departure which 
we are confident will resonate strongly 
with our global blue chip client base 
and beyond.

QuadCoreTM 2.0 development 
is significantly advanced, and 
AlphaCore® is launching imminently 
following the acquisition of Calostat® 
technology in late 2022. Progress is 
also being made on the bio-based 
insulation front, albeit at a somewhat 
slower pace than we would like. 

Product and system integrity  
By the end of 2022, 26 of our sites 
were certified to ISO 37301, with a 
plan to have 58 sites certified to the 
standard by the end of 2023. ISO 
37301 is the leading global standard 
for establishing, developing and 
monitoring compliance systems. 
Our enhanced product integrity 
programme is now deeply embedded 
across the Group. To date, 133 of our 
sites have been audited by the Group 
Compliance and Certification Team. 
In addition, 651 third party external 
products and system audits took 
place throughout 2022.

Insulated Panels 

The global and diverse nature of 
this business was reflected in the 
broad and varying performances 
of the different regional businesses 
and trends. Overall, the trading 
result has demonstrated growth, 
albeit that volumes became more 
challenged during the second half. 

Advanced insulation cored products 
represented 85% of insulated 
panels sales volumes, whilst mineral 
fibre cored was 11% with older 
generation materials comprising the 
balance. QuadCore TM, our highly 

differentiated and unique core 
material, represented 17% of insulated 
panels volume, having grown by 46% 
over prior year. Further progress is 
anticipated during 2023. 

PowerPanelTM made its market 
entry, and we anticipate this family 
of ground-breaking solutions to 
feature prominently over the longer 
term. Supply chain consistency 
and reliability has been a challenge 
and we continue to explore ways of 
ensuring this is addressed.

1  Comprising underlying 
+17%, currency +4% and 
acquisitions +2%. Like-
for-like volume -7%.

Worldwide sales grew 
encouragingly by 40% over prior 
year. Much of the growth was 
delivered through pricing, and 
indeed the acquisitions added 
during 2022. Sales volumes 
in Logstor®, Kingspan’s main 
technical insulation platform and 
now 25% of the division, grew 
by 18% in the second half of the 
year which was the first like-
for-like period under Kingspan 
ownership. Insulation board 
activity represents approximately 
60% of the division with like-for-
like volume decreasing by 10% in 
the year. 

The two larger businesses acquired 
were Logstor (June 2021) and 
Troldtekt (April 2022), both Danish 
headquartered, but in entirely 
different markets with significant 
growth potential. Logstor, the larger 
of the two, focuses primarily on pre-
insulated pipes for district heating 
(and cooling) infrastructure, an area 

of ever-growing opportunity as  
the world accelerates towards  
clean power generation and 
distribution. Our capacity will be 
increased by 30% during the current 
year, and by a further 50% over 
the following three years. Troldtekt 
addresses both the acoustic and 
bio-based insulation segments. 
Again, we expect to grow capacity 
by 60% over the next two years 
or so reflecting the opportunity 
afforded by the extension of 
applications and geography. 

On the innovation and new product 
agenda, AlphaCore® launches 
imminently following the acquisition 
of Calostat® technology. An A-Class 
Optim-R® should reach market in 
early 2024. We are in the process of 
assembling the leadership and skills 
required to enter the stone wool 
segment which is part of our long-
established ambition to be the sole 
global provider of the ‘full spectrum’ 
of thermal solutions.

Light + Air

In 2022 this business delivered 
strong progress with revenue 
and trading profit both ahead, 
by 27% and 45% respectively. 
Notable growth was achieved 
in the Central European and 
Southern European businesses. 
North America also improved its 
performance, enhanced by the 
addition of the Solatube® product 
set and business model, which 
we anticipate rolling out more 
regionally across the US over  
the coming years.

As the Group grows, so too will the 
divisional structure that supports it. To 
that end, going forward the Light, Air 
and Water businesses will be reported 
as one enlarged division. Combining 
the service businesses of both, 
leveraging the online success at Water 
+ Energy, and having a wider global 
route to market and channel synergy 
will make this combination compelling 
over the longer term. The enlarged 
division will have real global scale and 
scope, with revenue run-rate expected 
to be approximately €1bn in 2023.

The maiden year for this new 
business was marked by two 
meaningful acquisitions, Ondura 
and Derbigum, acquired in 
September 2022 and June 2022 
respectively. 

The annualised revenue run rate 
is approximately €500m. This 
combination brings Kingspan into 
both flat and pitched roof membrane 
solutions, from the primary outer 
layer of the roof to the secondary 
underlay. In both applications, the 

core basis of our strategy is to create 
pull-through for Insulation products 
through a warranted system-sell. Early 
progress has been encouraging. From 
a roofing technology perspective, we 
intend to broaden our portfolio of 
waterproofing, and our geographic 
presence, through both organic and 
inorganic routes. The trading margin 
reported reflects acquisition and other 
related costs during 2022.

This business delivered a reasonably 
solid outcome for the year owing 
to some recovery of position in 
the Australian market, albeit 
with margin pressures elsewhere 
refl ecting a lag in the recovery of 
raw material infl ation.

Data + Flooring 

Strong progress was again achieved 
in the data solutions activity in 
this business as large scale cloud 
services infrastructure continued to 
expand globally, and as our share of 
those internal solutions grew. 

This trajectory and the active pipeline 
of live projects give us confi dence that 
further growth ought to be delivered 
during the current year.

Looking ahead 

2022 was a bumpy year with the 
strong performance in the fi rst 
half giving way to a more subdued 
environment in the second half of 
the year. The combination of war 
in Ukraine, the consequential steep 
energy and consumer infl ation, 
and an industry overstocked due 
to supply chain concerns were all 
factors that weighed on second 
half demand and performance.

The more recent performance of our 
business has diff ered signifi cantly by 
sector, end-market and geography. 
Within the mix of business there are 
strong sectors of out-performance led 
by a need for ultra-energy effi  ciency 
and lower carbon. This is a theme 
which is likely to play out more fully in 
the medium term as society grapples 

with the need for a step change in 
energy effi  ciency and de-carbonisation.

It is diffi  cult to look too far ahead 
in this environment. We anticipate 
delivering a broadly similar trading 
profi t in the fi rst quarter of 2023 to 
that of 2022, aided in part by the 
contribution from acquisitions. We 
are mindful of a more demanding 
comparative to come in the second 
quarter. Longer term, Kingspan is 
very well placed given the powerful 
combination of our global scale, 
diversity of our end-markets, strong 
innovation agenda and an ongoing 
societal drive for energy effi  ciency.

Financial  
Review
Geoff Doherty

The Financial Review 
provides an overview 
of the Group’s financial 
performance for the 
year ended 31 December 
2022 and of the Group’s 
financial position at  
that date. 

Overview of results
Group revenue increased by 28% to €8.3bn (2021: €6.5bn) and 
trading profit increased by 10% to €833.2m (2021: €754.8m) with 
a decrease of 160 basis points in the Group’s trading profit margin 
to 10.0% (2021: 11.6%). Basic EPS for the year was 329.5 cent 
(2021: 305.6 cent), representing an increase of 8%.

The Group’s underlying sales and trading profit growth by division 
are set out below:

Sales Underlying Currency Acquisition Total

Finance costs (net) 
Finance costs for the year increased 
by €1.4m to €37.7m (2021: €36.3m). 
The Group’s net interest expense on 
borrowings (bank and loan notes net 
of interest receivable) was €34.6m 
(2021: €32.2m). This increase reflects 
higher average gross debt levels in 
2022. In particular, this includes the 
interest expense relating to the two 
new acquisition related financing 
facilities with an aggregated value 
of €800m which were arranged and 
fully drawn in 2022. Lease interest of 
€4.7m (2021: €3.7m) was recorded 
for the year. €0.1m (2021: €0.2m) 
was recorded in respect of a non-
cash finance charge on the Group’s 
defined benefit pension schemes.

Taxation
The tax charge for the year was 
€130.6m (2021: €118.4m) which 
represents an effective tax rate of 
17.5% (2021: 17.2%). The increase in 
the effective rate reflects, primarily, 
the change in the geographical mix 
of earnings year on year.

Dividends 
The Board has proposed a final 
dividend of 23.8 cent (2021: 26.0 
cent) per ordinary share payable on 9 
May 2023 to shareholders registered 
on the record date of 14 April 2023. 
An interim dividend of 25.6 cent per 
ordinary share was declared during 
the year (2021: 19.9 cent). In summary, 
therefore, the total dividend for 2022 
is 49.4 cent compared to 45.9 cent 
for 2021. This payout is in line with our 
shareholder returns policy.

Retirement benefits 
The primary method of pension 
provision for current employees 
is by way of defined contribution 
arrangements. The Group has three 
legacy defined benefit schemes 
in the UK which are closed to new 
members and to future accrual. The 
total pension contributions to these 
schemes for the year amounted to 
€1.8m (2021: €nil) and the expected 
contributions for 2023 are €nil (2021: 
€nil). On 6 December 2022, the Group 
completed a bulk insurance annuity 
insurance policy ‘buy in’ for the 
Colt Life Assurance and Retirement 
Scheme (‘CLARS’). This buy-in ensures 
an insurance asset that fully matches 

the remaining pension liability and 
was net settled in cash for an amount 
of €15.9m in January 2023. There 
was no impact on profit before tax 
from this transaction. In addition, the 
Group has a number of smaller defined 
benefit pension liabilities in Mainland 
Europe. The net pension liability in 
respect of all defined benefit schemes 
was €49.5m as at 31 December 2022 
(2021: €28.0m) with the increase 
reflecting, primarily, a decrease in the 
value of scheme assets during the year 
partially offset by actuarial gains on 
scheme liabilities. 

Intangible assets and goodwill
Intangible assets and goodwill 
increased during the year by €685.5m 
to €2,687.3m (2021: €2,001.8m). 
Intangible assets and goodwill of 
€708.9m (2021: €418.9m) were 
recorded in the year relating to 
acquisitions completed by the Group. 
An increase of €9.0m (2021: increase 
of €50.9m) arose due to year end 
exchange rates used to translate 
intangible assets and goodwill other 
than those denominated in euro. 
There was an annual amortisation 
charge of €32.4m (2021: €29.5m).

Financial key performance 
indicators
The Group has a set of financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs) which 
are presented in the table below. 
These KPIs are used to measure the 
financial and operational performance 
of the Group and to track ongoing 
progress in achieving medium and 
long term targets to maximise 
shareholder return.

(a) Basic EPS growth. The growth in 
EPS is accounted for primarily by 
a 10% increase in trading profit 
partially offset by an increase in 
the Group’s effective tax rate by 
30 basis points to 17.5% and an 
increase in minority interest. The 
effective tax rate increased due to 
the geographical mix of earnings 
year on year. The minority interest 
amount increased reflecting 
the performance at the Group’s 
operations which have minority 
stakeholders.

(b) Sales performance of +28% 
(2021: +42%) was driven by a 16% 
increase in underlying sales, a 9% 
contribution from acquisitions 
and positive currency translation 
of 3%. The increase in underlying 
sales reflected a combination of 
strong year on year price growth 
due to raw material inflation offset 
by an overall reduction in volume 
particularly in the second half of 
the year as global construction 
markets eased.  

(c) Trading margin by division is set 
out below:

2022 2021

Insulated 
Panels 

10.6% 12.3%

Insulation 10.0% 12.4%
Roofing + 
Waterproofing

5.5% -

Light + Air 7.5% 6.5%
Water + Energy 5.4% 7.6%
Data + Flooring 12.0% 11.9%

 The Insulated Panels division trading 
margin decreased year on year 
reflecting the market mix of sales, 
inventory cost dynamics as well as 
negative operating leverage driven 
by year on year volume declines. 
The trading margin decrease in the 
Insulation division reflects, in the 
main, negative operating leverage 
associated with year on year 
volume declines and the category 
mix of sales. The increased trading 
margin in Light + Air reflects 
activity growth, investment in 
specification and other processes 
as the division continues to scale up. 

The Water + Energy trading margin 
decrease reflects lag in the recovery 
of inflation in the first half of the 
year. The trading margin in Data + 
Flooring is consistent year on year. 

(d) Free cashflow is an important 
indicator and reflects the amount 
of internally generated capital 
available for re-investment  
in the business or for distribution  
to shareholders.

 * Earnings before finance costs,

** Excludes working capital on   
 acquisition but includes working   
 capital movements since that point

 Working capital at year end  
was €1,195.9m (2021: €977.8m) 
and represents 14.5% (2021: 
13.8%) of annualised sales based 
on fourth quarter sales. This 
metric is closely managed and 
monitored throughout the year 
and is subject to a certain amount 
of seasonal variability associated 
with trading patterns and the 
timing of significant purchases 
of steel and chemicals. The 16% 
growth in underlying sales in 
2022 required a consequential 
investment in working capital to 
support the sales growth. The 
December 2022 working capital 
position is untypically high 
reflecting higher than normal 
inventory levels although these 
have been reducing through the 
second half. The business took the 
opportunity to build an element of 
buffer stocks earlier in the year due 
to availability constraints and has 
been steadily working through this 
in the second half as supply chain 
bottlenecks and pricing eased. We 
expect working capital levels to 
normalise further during 2023.

(e) Return on capital employed, 
calculated as operating profit 
divided by total equity plus net debt, 
was 15.9% in 2022 (2021: 19.5%)and 
was 16.5% with annualised impact 
of acquisitions. The decrease 
year on year reflects the 160bps 
reduction in trading margin and 
elevated levels of working capital. 
The creation of shareholder value 
through the delivery of long term 
returns well in excess of the Group’s 
cost of capital is a core principle of 
Kingspan’s financial strategy. 

(f) Net debt to EBITDA measures the 
ratio of net debt to earnings and at 
1.62x (2021: 0.88x) is comfortably 
less than the Group’s banking 
covenant of 3.5x in both 2022 and 
2021. The calculation is pre-IFRS 
16 in accordance with the Group’s 
banking covenants.

Acquisitions and capital expenditure 
During the year the Group made a 
number of acquisitions for a total 
upfront consideration of €887.0m.

In April 2022, the Group acquired 
100% of the share capital of Troldtekt, 
a Danish natural acoustic insulation 
producer. The total consideration, 
including net debt acquired amounted 
to €220.4m. 

In September 2022, the Group acquired 
100% of the share capital of Ondura 
Group, a French headquartered global 
provider of roofing membranes and 
associated roofing solutions, for a 
total consideration, including net debt 
acquired of €515.6m. 

The Group also made a number of 
smaller acquisitions during the year for a 
combined cash consideration of €151.0m:

 @ The Roofing + Waterproofing division 
acquired 100% of the share capital 
of Derbigum, a Belgian producer of 
waterproofing membranes for a total 
consideration, including net debt 
acquired of €95.0m in June 2022;

 @ The Insulated Panels division 
acquired 100% of the share capital of 
THU Perfil in February 2022 and 100% 
of the share capital of Invespanel in 
Spain in September 2022;

Key financial covenants
The majority of Group borrowings 
are subject to primary financial 
covenants calculated in accordance 
with lenders’ facility agreements 
which exclude the impact of IFRS 16:

 @ A maximum net debt to EBITDA 
ratio of 3.5 times; and 

 @ A minimum EBITDA to net interest 
coverage of 4 times.  

The performance against these 
covenants in the current and 
comparative year is set out above.

Investor relations 
Kingspan is committed to 
interacting with the international 
financial community to ensure a 
full understanding of the Group’s 
strategic plans and its performance 
against these plans. During the year, 

the executive management and 
investor team presented at 11 capital 
market conferences and conducted 
624 institutional one-on-one and 
group meetings. 

Share price and market 
capitalisation 
The Company’s shares traded in 
the range of €43.60 to €106.65 
during the year. The share price at 
30 December 2022 was €50.58 (31 
December 2021: €105.00) giving a 
market capitalisation at that date 
of €9.2bn (2021: €19.0bn). Total 
shareholder return for 2022 was 

-51.5% (2021: +84%).

Financial risk management 
The Group operates a centralised 
treasury function governed by a 
treasury policy approved by the 
Group Board. This policy primarily 

covers foreign exchange risk, credit 
risk, liquidity risk and interest rate 
risk. The principal objective of the 
policy is to minimise financial risk 
at reasonable cost. Adherence to 
the policy is monitored by the CFO 
and the Internal Audit function. The 
Group does not engage in speculative 
trading of derivatives or related 
financial instruments.

Climate related disclosures are required 
under the EU Taxonomy Regulation 
(Sustainable finance taxonomy - 
Regulation (EU) 2020/852) and by the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD). The disclosures

year in respect of the Group’s net loss 
on the complete divestment of its 
Russian operations.

Capital structure and Group financing
The Group funds itself through a 
combination of equity and debt. Debt 
is funded through syndicated bank 
facilities and private placement loan 
notes. The primary bank debt facility is 
a €800m sustainability linked Revolving 
Credit Facility arranged in May 2021, 
maturing in May 2026, and which was 
undrawn at year end. The Revolving 
Credit Facility was increased by €100m 
in December 2022 under the facility’s 
accordion clause. 

In April 2022, the Group arranged two 
additional banking finance facilities 
with an aggregate value of €800m 

(€500m maturing in April 2024, €300m 
in April 2025). The facilities were fully 
drawn at year end.

In addition, as part of the Group’s 
debt funding structure, the Group  
has total private placement loan 
notes of €1,322.0m (2021: €1,377.1m) 
which have a weighted average 
maturity of 5.7 years (31 December 
2021: 6.4 years).

The weighted average term, as at  
31 December 2022, of all drawn debt 
was 4.1 years (31 December 2021:  
6.3 years). 

The Group has significant available 
committed undrawn facilities and 
cash balances which, in aggregate, 
were €1.45bn at 31 December 2022  
(31 December 2021: €1.3bn).

Compliance Committee are set out in detail in the Report of the 
Audit & Compliance Committee on page 110.

The Board monitors the Group’s risk management systems 
through its consultation with the Audit & Compliance Committee 
but also through the Group’s divisional monthly management 
meetings, where at least two executive directors are present. 
Business risks and trends are the focus of each division’s monthly 
management meeting, where divisional business performance 
is also assessed against budget, forecast and prior year. Key 
performance indicators are also used to benchmark operational 
performance for all manufacturing sites.

In addition to this ongoing assessment of risk within the divisions, 
the Audit & Compliance Committee oversees an annual risk 
assessment for the Group whereby each divisional management 
team is formally asked to prepare a detailed risk assessment for 
their business. This assessment involves evaluating group-wide 
risks, as put forward by the Board, and presenting additional risks 
that are specific to their business.

While it is acknowledged that the Group faces a variety of risks, 
the Board, through the processes set out above, has identified the 
following principal risks and uncertainties that could potentially 
impact upon the Group’s short to medium term strategic goals:

Risk & Risk 
Management 

Volatility in the macro environment
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

Kingspan products are targeted at both the 
residential and non-residential (including 
industrial, retail, commercial, public sector 
and high rise offices) construction sectors. 
As a result, demand is dependent on 
activity levels which may vary by geographic 
market and is subject to the usual drivers of 
construction activity (i.e. general economic 
conditions and volatility, Brexit, pandemics, 
political uncertainty and wars in some regions, 
interest rates, business/consumer confidence 
levels, supply chain disruption, unemployment, 
and population growth).

While construction markets are inherently 
cyclical, changing building and environmental 
regulations continue to act as an underlying 
positive structural trend in demand for many 
of the Group’s products.

The exposure to cyclicality or downturn of any one construction market 
is partially mitigated by the Group’s geographic diversification, by end 
application and by product.

As set out in the Business Model & Strategy, the Group has mitigated 
this risk through diversification as follows:

 @ an established globalisation strategy resulting in 212 global 
manufacturing sites and a commercial presence in more than 80 
countries;

 @ the launch of new innovative products and an approach of continual 
improvements to existing product lines; and

 @ acquisitions made during the year enhance the geographic and 
product diversification of the Group.

The full details of these diversifications are set out in the Business Model 
& Strategy section of this Annual Report.

Product failure
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

A key risk to the Kingspan business is the 
potential for functional failure of our product 
which could lead to health, safety and security 
issues for both our people and our customers.

The Kingspan brand is well established and is 
a key element of the Group’s overall marketing 
and positioning strategy. In the event of a 
product failure, the Kingspan brand and/or 
reputation could be damaged and if so, this 
could lead to a loss of market share.

Dedicated structures and processes are in place to manage and monitor 
product quality controls throughout the business:

 @ New products go through rigorous internal testing at the Group’s 
Global Innovation Centre, IKON, and the industry leading Kingspan 
Fire Engineering Research Centre prior to proceeding to a certification 
process which is undertaken by internationally recognised and 
independent authorities, before being brought to market.

 @ The Group appointed a Head of Compliance & Certification, reporting 
to the Group CEO, to ensure a rigorous approach to certification, 
testing and product compliance across the Group and to ensure 
consistent and robust application of processes centred around our 
core commitment to product safety. The Group Product Compliance 
team completed the audit of 98 manufacturing sites in 2022.

 @ A Group Marketing Integrity Manual (MIM) has been designed to 
incorporate the Group Code of Conduct as well as the incoming UK 
Code for Construction Product Information. The MIM establishes a 
compliance framework for product marketing materials and websites. 
Compliance with the MIM is subject to audit by the Group Internal 
Audit function under a dedicated audit programme.

 @ The Group’s Product Compliance function has been accredited to 
the leading independent standard in compliance, ISO 37301. 26 
manufacturing sites are already certified to ISO 37301 with a further 
32 sites to be certified in 2023.

 @ The terms of reference for the Audit & Compliance Committee include 
oversight of the product compliance agenda.

 @ Our businesses employ quality control specialists and operate strict 
policies to ensure consistently high standards are maintained in 
addition to the sourcing and handling of raw materials.

 @ The construction of a dedicated Kingspan Fire Engineering Research 
Centre using Kingspan products allows for more expedient and 
significant testing to take place.

 @ Effective training is delivered to our employees.
 @ Proactively monitor the public policy, regulatory and legislative 

environment.

As a leading building supplies 
manufacturer in a highly 
competitive international 
environment, Kingspan is 
exposed to a variety of risks 
and uncertainties which are 
monitored and controlled 
by the Group’s internal risk 
management framework.

Failure to innovate
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

Failing to successfully manage and compete 
with new product innovations, changing 
market trends and consumer tastes could have 
an adverse effect on Kingspan’s market share, 
the future growth of the business and the 
margins achieved on the existing product line.

 @ Innovation is one of Kingspan’s four strategic pillars to increasing 
shareholder value and therefore plays a critical role within the Group.

 @ There is a continual review of each division’s product portfolios at 
both the executive and local management level to ensure that they 
target current and future opportunities for profitable growth.

 @ The Group’s innovation strategy is intertwined with its Planet 
Passionate sustainability strategy. Ambitious Planet Passionate goals 
require the Group to invest in expanding its existing range of highly 
sustainable building products and establish market leading supply 
chains for sustainable raw materials.

 @ This risk is further mitigated by continuing innovation and 
compelling marketing programmes. The launch of the IKON Global 
Innovation Centre in 2019 has served to enhance the capabilities of 
the Group to innovate.

 @ The Kingspan Fire Engineering Research Centre enables large 
scale fire testing to industry regulation standards thereby 
accelerating the pace of innovation and certification on the path to 
commercialisation. 

 @ Kingspan also has a deep understanding of changing consumer 
and industry dynamics in its key markets and continues to 
refine its omnichannel customer centric approach, enabling 
management to respond appropriately to issues which may 
impact business performance.

Laws and regulations
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

Kingspan is subject to a broad range of existing 
and evolving governance requirements, 
environmental, health and safety and other 
laws, regulations and standards which affect 
the way the Group operates. Non-compliance 
can lead to potential legal liabilities and curtail 
the development of the Group.

 @ Kingspan’s in-house legal team is responsible for monitoring changes 
to laws and regulations that affect the business and is supported  
by external advisors. Issued policies include, but are not limited to, 
the following:  
- Sanctions Compliance Policy 
- Anti-Fraud, Bribery and Corruption Policy 
- Competition Law Compliance 
- Directors’ Guidance Policy

 @ A comprehensive framework of policies is in place that set out the 
ways employees and suppliers are expected to conduct themselves.

 @ The Group’s publicly available Code of Conduct sets out the 
fundamental principles which it requires all its directors, officers, and 
employees to adhere to in order to meet those standards.

 @ Training is provided through a variety of mediums in key areas of 
legal and regulatory compliance, including a suite of mandatory 
training for those that join Kingspan.

 @ A robust whistleblowing process is in place that allows the 
anonymous reporting through an independent hotline of any 
suspected wrongdoing or unethical behaviour, including reporting 
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. All reported 
cases are investigated, and findings reported to the Audit & 
Compliance Committee.

Climate change
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

Kingspan’s products provide a solution to help 
mitigate climate change, particularly with 
respect to reducing carbon emissions in the 
built environment. Climate change is therefore 
both an opportunity and a risk for Kingspan.

Climate risks within our business include 
regulatory changes, substitution risk should we 
fail to maintain our market leading offering, 
rising energy or carbon prices within our own 
operations or in our supply chain, and physical 
risk to our operations or those of our suppliers.

Transforming building and construction is an important element of 
addressing the climate crisis as they represent approximately 39% of 
global greenhouse gas emissions. Kingspan is uniquely placed to help 
support the decarbonisation of the building sector via our extensive 
offering of high-performance, energy saving systems and solutions.

Risks relating to climate change are managed through a multi- 
disciplinary, and company wide, risk management process.

Examples of how climate change risks are mitigated include:

Planet Passionate 
 @ Following the successful completion of our Net Zero Energy 

programme (our programme that focused on reducing energy 
consumption and increasing renewable energy use where possible), 
Kingspan launched the next stage of our sustainability journey in 
2020, our 10-year Planet Passionate programme, which includes 12 
ambitious targets in the areas of Carbon, Energy, Circularity and 
Water. This strategic agenda will enable significant advances in the 
sustainability of both our business operations and our products.

Innovation 
 @ Our innovation agenda is inextricably linked with our Planet 

Passionate programme, helping us to drive market leading products 
in the areas of carbon savings and sustainability. Innovation is 
supported through ongoing investments such as the opening of the 
IKON Global Innovation Centre in 2019.  

 @ In 2022, our insulation products sold globally are estimated to 
save 173 million tonnes of CO2e over their lifetime. In addition, we 
estimate 48 billion litres of rainwater will be harvested over the 
lifetime of the tanks we produced and we recycled 803 million waste 
plastic bottles in to our manufacturing processes.

Digitalisation 
 @ Digital adoption is a key factor to enabling more efficiency and 

sustainability in manufacture, delivery, construction and operations 
of our built environment.

 @ Enhanced digitalised processes for customer engagement provide 
faster and deeper insight into the sustainability demands of our 
customers.  

 @ Under the leadership of the Group Director of Digital, our 2022 
Building Information Modelling (BIM) & Digital Innovation 
Programme drove the enhancement and introduction of several 
tools to improve the workflows of our customers. Utilising the latest 
digital technologies, Kingspan aims to empower its customers and 
partners with tailored digital solutions. 

Global Presence 
 @ Kingspan operates out of 212 manufacturing sites across the globe, 

diversifying our physical risk from climate change. We have also built 
relationships with a wide range of global supply partners to limit the 
reliance on any one supplier or even a small number of suppliers.

Business interruption (including IT continuity)
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

Kingspan’s performance is dependent on 
the availability and quality of its physical 
infrastructure, its proprietary technology, its 
raw material supply chain, and its information 
technology. The safe and continued operation 
of such systems and assets are threatened by 
natural and man-made perils and are affected 
by the level of investment available to improve 
them.

The building industry is going through some 
significant change with respect to building 
regulations and codes. The risks associated 
with misunderstanding some of the potential 
changes and the nature of our product set are 
more prevalent today.

Any significant or prolonged restriction to its 
physical infrastructure, the necessary raw 
materials or its IT systems and infrastructure 
could have an adverse effect on Kingspan’s 
business performance.

 @ Kingspan insists on industry leading operational processes and 
procedures to ensure effective management of each facility. The 
Group invests significantly in a rigorous programme of preventative 
maintenance on all key manufacturing lines to mitigate the risk of 
production line stoppages.

 @ The impact of production line stoppages is also mitigated by 
having business continuity plans in place to allow for the transfer of 
significant volume from any one of our 106 plants in the Insulated 
Panels division or 43 plants in the Insulation division to another in the 
event of a shutdown.

 @ In addition, and as part of our consequential loss insurance, 
Kingspan is subject to regular reviews of all manufacturing sites by 
external risk management experts, with these reviews being aimed 
at optimising Kingspan’s risk profile.

 @ Kingspan continues to focus on developing, enhancing, and 
protecting its IP portfolio. As a global leader in building envelope 
solutions, Kingspan considers its IP security to be paramount.

 @ In addition to trade secret policies and procedures, Kingspan has 
developed appropriate IP strategies to protect and defend against 
infringements.

 @ To reduce Kingspan’s exposure to raw material supply chain issues, 
Kingspan retains strong relationships with a wide range of raw 
material suppliers to limit the reliance on any one supplier or even a 
small number of suppliers.

 @ Kingspan continues to inform all stakeholders of the characteristics 
of our product offerings, their appropriate application and benefits, 
to limit the risk of misunderstanding within the building industry.

 @ Kingspan’s IT infrastructure is constantly reviewed and updated to 
meet the needs of the Group. Procedures have been established for 
the protection of this infrastructure and all other IT related assets. 
These include the development of IT specific business continuity 
plans, IT disaster recovery plans and back-up delivery systems, to 
reduce business disruption in the event of a major technology failure.

Credit risks and credit control
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

As part of the overall service package, 
Kingspan provides credit to customers and  
as a result there is an associated risk that  
the customer may not be able to pay 
outstanding balances.

At the year end, the Group was carrying 
a receivables book of €1,136.8m (2021: 
€1,022.9m) expressed net of provision for 
default in payment. This represents a net 
risk of 14% (2021: 16%) of sales. Of these net 
receivables, approximately 60% (2021: 61%) 
were covered by credit insurance or other 
forms of collateral such as letter of credit and 
bank guarantees.

 @ Each business unit has rigorous procedures and credit control 
functions for managing its receivables and takes appropriate action 
when necessary.

 @ Trade receivables are primarily managed through strong credit 
control functions supplemented by credit insurance to the extent 
that it is available. All major outstanding and overdue balances 
together with significant potential exposures are reviewed regularly 
and concerns are discussed at monthly meetings at which the 
Group’s executive directors are present.

 @ Control systems are in place to ensure that credit authorisation 
requests are supported with appropriate and sufficient 
documentation and are approved at appropriate levels in  
the organisation.

Employment development and retention
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

The success of Kingspan is built upon effective 
management teams committed to achieving 
a superior performance in each division. Failure 
to attract, retain or develop these teams could 
have an impact on business performance.

 @ Kingspan is committed to ensuring that the necessary procedures 
are in place to attract, develop and retain the skill levels needed to 
achieve the Group’s strategic goals. These procedures include strong 
recruitment processes, succession planning, remuneration reviews, 
including both long and short term incentive plans, and targeted 
career development programmes.

 @ Kingspan’s leadership team holds an annual Talent Forum each year 
to review succession plans, metrics on key positions hired throughout 
the year and to forecast future talent gaps as part of our human 
capital risk assessment.

 @ In 2021 we redesigned and relaunched Kingspan’s Internal Career 
Portal which provides an open and transparent forum for Kingspan 
employees to learn about and apply for career opportunities across 
all our businesses worldwide. It has a wealth of information about 
the types of roles and skills that are in demand to deliver on our 
strategic objectives.

 @ Graduates participated in our Yours to Shape development 
programme which was in its sixth consecutive year in 2022. The 
objective of the programme is to provide new graduates with a 
network to collaborate across the Group and develop the capabilities 
to drive their career in Kingspan. It spans 12-months of interactive 
workshops, peer coaching, masterclasses with senior executives and 
assignments on the Promote e-learning platform.

 @ PEAK (Programme for Executive Acceleration in Kingspan) was 
launched in 2018 and is targeted at middle to senior managers who 
are currently, or will soon commence, managing a team. It aims to 
increase leadership diversity by deepening and widening the pool 
of potential senior leaders to match the increasing scale and global 
nature of the business. 

 @ An Advanced Management Programme was launched in 2021 in 
partnership with INSEAD’s executive business school in France. This 
new programme supports Kingspan’s senior leaders on engaging 
with enterprise level goals in a more collaborative way while 
transforming their leadership capabilities to drive significant long 
term growth.

Health and safety
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

The nature of Kingspan’s operations can expose 
its contractors, customers, suppliers and other 
individuals to potential health and safety risks.

Health and safety incidents can lead to loss of 
life or severe injuries.

A robust health and safety framework is in place throughout the Group’s 
operations requiring all employees to complete formal health and safety 
training on a regular basis.

 @ The Group monitors the performance of its health and safety 
framework and takes immediate and decisive action where non-
adherence is identified.

 @ The development of a strong safety culture is driven by management 
and employees at every level and is a core part of doing business 
with integrity.

Fraud and cybercrime
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

Kingspan is potentially exposed to fraudulent 
activity, with particular focus on the Group’s 
online banking systems, online payment 
procedures and unauthorised access to 
internal systems.

 @ The Group issues extensive guidance and policies, which include 
critical process and control policies for the mitigation of fraud risk, 
and they must be effectively adopted by all Group businesses.  

 @ The Group internal audit programme includes rigorous tests of 
financial controls and general IT controls to ensure they align with 
Group policies that mitigate fraud risk.

 @ All fraud and cybercrime attempts, successful and unsuccessful, are 
reported to the Group Audit & Compliance Committee.  

 @ The Group’s cyber strategy is designed by a multi-discipline Group IT 
function with input from external expertise and our Group Head of 
Cyber Security. The Group Head of Cyber Security is responsible for 
owning and executing the Group’s cyber security strategy to ensure 
critical assets and technologies are protected against cyber risk.

 @ Our Cyber Security Roadmap, published internally in 2022, sets out 
the phased milestones for the implementation of improved cyber 
risk policies and projects over a period of 30 months to enhance the 
Group’s security posture.

 @ Pro-active cyber security services are in place which provide 
global 24/7 critical security services that include managed threat 
protection (Security Information and Event Management - SIEM), 
managed detection and incident response services, including access 
to trusted and experienced cyber security advisors.

 @ Group Internal Audit & Compliance function perform cyber audits 
with dedicated audit programmes in addition to separate audits of 
IT general controls. Findings of cyber audits are reported to the  
Audit & Compliance Committee and outputs form part of enhanced  
IT policies. 

 @ Mandatory implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) on 
all internet facing and business critical services group-wide.

 @ High frequency phish testing performed globally.
 @ Kingspan corporate assets can be swiftly ‘auto-contained’ in  

the event of a significant cyber security incident to limit the  
business impact.

Acquisition and integration of new businesses
Risk and impact Actions to mitigate

Acquisitive growth is an important element 
of Kingspan’s development strategy. A failure 
to execute and properly integrate significant 
acquisitions and capitalise on the potential 
synergies they bring may adversely affect 
the Group.

 @ All potential acquisitions are rigorously assessed and evaluated, 
both internally and by external advisors, to ensure any potential 
acquisition meets Kingspan’s strategic and financial criteria.

 @ This process is underpinned by extensive integration procedures 
and the close monitoring of performance post acquisition by both 
divisional and Group management.

 @ New acquisitions are categorised as higher risk from a financial 
controls, IT general controls, and product compliance perspective 
and are therefore subject to greater internal audit focus in the initial 
12 month period post-acquisition.  

 @ Kingspan also has a strong track record of successfully integrating 
acquisitions and therefore management has extensive knowledge in 
this area which it utilises for each acquisition.

Kingspan is driven by a belief 
that advanced materials and 
methods of construction hold 
the answer to some of the great 
challenges that our planet and 
society face.

From products that insulate better while creating more 
internal space, to those that harness more natural 
daylight, we are dedicated to extending the limits of 
ultra-performance envelope design with a core focus 
on energy effi  ciency. We have innovated a portfolio 
of advanced products and solutions for architects 
and building owners which enable them to construct 
buildings that consume less resources, future proofi ng 
their investment, generating returns through enhanced 
internal space and operational performance, and 
facilitating effi  cient construction through thinner, 
lighter and safer to handle materials. Increasingly 
we are enhancing our service and solutions through 
digitalising our off er. By surfacing all of our products 
digitally, we’re making it easier to fi nd them, specify 
them, buy them, build with them and track them.

Kingspan’s insulation systems, sold in 2022, will save 
an estimated 771 million MWh of energy or 173 million 
tonnes of CO2e over their lifetime.

Today, the construction and operation of buildings 
together account for 40% of energy related carbon 
emissions. The energy effi  ciency of buildings is 
therefore fundamental in combating climate change. 
Our advanced building envelope solutions help 
building owners to reduce energy emissions. Our 
solutions also help to enhance occupant health and 
wellbeing through improved thermal comfort, natural 
daylighting, natural ventilation, and increased space.

Ensuring the safe performance and 
use of our products is central to our 
approach to product development, 
testing, support and marketing.

At Kingspan we have implemented 
a global product compliance 
and marketing programme that 
ensures the accuracy of our product 
information, operating to the ISO 
37301 global compliance standard 
and underpinned by a culture of 

integrity, honesty and compliance 
with the law. 

In late 2022, we introduced a 
new global Environmental Claims 
Guide to ensure that all marketing 
claims relating to the sustainability 
performance of our products are 
robust and support our group vision 
of making a meaningful impact on 
decarbonisation and circularity in the 
built environment.

In parallel, we are developing and

Conduct, which has been rolled out 
to all employees across the Group. 
The Kingspan Code of Conduct 
incorporates a whistleblower policy 
which was enhanced in 2021 with 
higher visibility in all manufacturing 
sites across the Group.

To support product compliance 
at senior management levels, a 
new group-wide Directors’ Duties 
handbook was introduced in February 
2022 with associated training. 

The Group Compliance and

The safety of those working with our 
products, and living in buildings that 
have used our products, is absolutely 
paramount at Kingspan.

A cornerstone of our global 
compliance programme has been 
the opening of Kingspan’s new Fire 
Engineering Research Centre (FERC) 
in Holywell, Wales which has enabled 
a signifi cant increase in the frequency 
and scope of fi re testing of products. 
The testing carried out at FERC is also 
building a bank of knowledge which 
is helping to ensure that fi re safety 
continues to be central to Kingspan 
product innovation.

Fire safety is often reduced to a 
simplistic “combustible” versus “non-
combustible” defi nition, based on a 
small-scale test. Important factors 
such as building design, installation 
methodology and the interaction of 
the diff erent materials in the actual 
system are not tested in small-scale 
materials classifi cation testing. 

Hence, our approach to the safe use 
of our insulation and insulated panel 
products in buildings is founded on 
the principle that system testing is the 
best way to assess fi re performance 
of any roof or cladding system, 
regardless of the classifi cation of the 
insulation materials used.

A wide range of Kingspan insulated 
panels carry an FM (FM Global) or 
LPCB (Loss Prevention Certifi cation 
Board) Approval, both of which are 
system testing regimes developed 
by the insurance industry. These 
approvals provide objective third-
party testing, which is underpinned 
by quarterly, bi-annual and annual 
factory surveillance audits (depending 
on the region) to verify compliance. 
Independent certifi cation bodies take 
samples of insulated panels from 
our factories and send them to their 
own laboratories for fi re testing to 
verify ongoing compliance. These 
independent audits also include 
assessments of change control, 
formulations, processing parameters, 
labelling and internal testing.

The Kooltherm® range of insulation 
boards and KoolDuct® pre-insulated 
ductwork are manufactured with a 
phenolic insulation core, which has 
been proven to off er superior fi re 
and smoke performance to other 
commonly used rigid thermoset 
insulants.

A comprehensive range of building 
facade systems incorporating our 
insulation board and insulated panels 
products have successfully passed 
large-scale facade tests around 
the globe including, but not limited 
to, NFPA 285 (North America), 
LEPIR II (France), SP 105 (Nordics), 
AS 5113 (Australia), ISO 13785-2 
(Czech Republic) and MSZ 14800-
6 (Hungary). As it relates to large 
scale fi re tests, there are a total of 
15 systems incorporating Kooltherm®

which have met the requirements 
of BR135 when tested to BS 8414 
(UK) and there are 6 insulated panel 
based systems that have met the 
requirements of BR 135 when tested 
to BS 8414.

During 2022, a total of 651 third party 
external products and system audits 
were carried out, providing reassurance 
on the safety of our products.

The Group Compliance Manual, 
which was fi rst published in January 
2021 and covers all aspects of 
the processes which have been 
implemented across the Kingspan 
Group, includes the requirement for a 
Register of External Certifi cates and 
Test Reports for each product. 

In 2021, the Marketing Integrity 
Manual (MIM) was launched to ensure 
that the information in the Product 
Compliance Register is represented 
truthfully and accurately in product 
marketing information.

The Marketing Integrity Manual is 
built on 11 principles aligned with 
the UK Code of Construction 
Product Information. The overall 
programme includes:

@ Group MIM e-learning which 
has been rolled out across all 
marketing team members. 

@ Fire Approvals e-learning which 
has been rolled out for appropriate 
marketing team members. 

@ A Skills, Knowledge, Experience 
and Behaviour (SKEB) competency 
assessment model which has 
been introduced with associated 
training and strict rules for 
publishing product information. 

@ A sign-off  approvals process which 
has been implemented for our 
new global website infrastructure.

Furthermore, an internal ISO 37301 
accredited auditing team has been 
appointed specifi cally for the MIM 
programme.

Planet 
Passionate 

Increasingly our customers want 
solutions which not only enable 
them to preserve resources, 
but solutions which are also 
sourced and manufactured in an 
environmentally responsible way.

In December 2019 Kingspan launched the next 
phase of our sustainability journey, our Planet 
Passionate programme. Through this programme we 
are working with our suppliers and throughout our 
business to meet our ambitious goals in the areas 
of carbon, energy, circularity and water. In an eff ort 
to reduce a key source of carbon in construction, 
embodied carbon, we are targeting Net Zero Carbon 
Manufacturing by 2030 and a 50% reduction in 
carbon intensity from our primary suppliers by 2030. 

Our Global Head of Innovation works together with 
our Global Head of Sustainability, and our CEO, to 
ensure that product development is closely aligned 
with our Planet Passionate objectives. 

In 2021, we chose to voluntarily update our existing 
science-based targets. These more ambitious targets 
were approved by the Science-Based Initiative in June 
2021 and classifi ed our ambition as aligned with a 
1.5°C future.

Carbon & Energy

Through our Planet Passionate programme, we 
aim to enable low carbon buildings, not only in 
the operational phase but also in the upfront and 
construction phase. 2022 highlights include:   

@ Internal carbon charge: From the 1st of 
January 2023 each business unit will have 
an internal charge of €70 per tonne for all 
energy related emissions (excluding process 
and biogenic emissions) emitted. This will help 
to further incentivise the rapid deployment 
of decarbonisation projects to support 
the achievement of our Net Zero Carbon 
manufacturing target. 

@ Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions: A 37% reduction was 
achieved in 2022 via the implementation of new 
renewable energy contracts, deployment of solar 
PV systems and reduction in the use of high Global 
Warming Potential (GWP) blowing agents. 

@ Scope 3 GHG emissions: A key facet of our 
decarbonisation plan is to reduce our upstream 
carbon emissions, particularly as they relate to 
our purchased goods and services which in 2022 
accounted for over 86% of our total value chain 
emissions. We have had signifi cant engagement 
with our key raw material suppliers and tracking 
of their decarbonisation plans, and we had over 
50 meetings on supply chain engagement in 2022. 
One outcome of the engagement programme was 
our increased investment in H2 Green Steel which 
aims to produce steel with 95% reductions in CO2 
emissions compared to traditional steelmaking.

This is a clear signal to the market about what 
we expect from our suppliers over the short to 
medium term.

@ Product: In 2022, we launched our new 
QuadCore™ LEC insulated panel which has over 
50% recycled content by weight and an estimated 
embodied carbon reduction of 17% carbon 
(across LCA modules A - C) versus the existing 
QuadCore™ insulated panel product.

@ Zero emission cars: We installed an additional 
82 new EV charging stations across our business, 
bringing the total number of systems to 198 in 
2022. In addition, we converted 58% of our annual 
replacement cars to zero emissions cars.

@ Renewable energy use: 19 new renewable energy 
projects that came online in 2022 will produce 
more than 9.9 GWh of energy annually. We 
also made signifi cant progress with our energy 
suppliers, converting 24 electricity contracts (63 
GWh) to renewable electricity.

@ On-site renewable energy generation: We 
deployed 18 new rooftop solar-PV projects across 
our business that will generate 6.4 GWh annually. 

Water

As a manufacturer of solutions to harvest and 
recycle water, we recognise the need for future 
water security and the protection of our natural 
water systems. 

@ In 2022, we installed 14 rainwater harvesting 
systems across our business, adding 40 million 
litres to our capacity. In total, we harvested 
26.4 million litres of rainwater during the year. 

@ We are delighted to announce our 3-year 
partnership with the Clearbot Project to 
support the removal of waste from rivers in 
Kerala, India. Established in 2019, Clearbot 
is a clean tech start-up with an ambitious 
mission: to restore the balance between 
humanity and the oceans. Clearbot creates 
unmanned, electric, emissions-free robots. 
These robots tackle challenges including - 
inspection and monitoring, intervention and 
cleaning of urban waterways. 

@ Clearbot Neo, which will be in use in Kerala, 
can collect up to 15 litres of oil and 200 
kilograms of fl oating trash per day.

Circularity

We are embedding circularity principles within our 
operations and product development processes 
to support the transition to a circular economy 
within the built environment

@ Product certifi cation: Kingspan Data + 
Flooring has been awarded the prestigious 
Cradle to Cradle certifi cation at Bronze level, 
based on an impartial and independent 
evaluation of material health, material 
reutilisation, renewable energy, water 
stewardship and social fairness. 

@ Product: In 2022 Kingspan Data + Flooring 
developed its new RMG 600+ raised access 
fl oor product which will have 97% recycled 
content by weight (an increase of 17% from 
this exiting RMG600 product). This product is 
due to launch in Q1 2023.

@ Waste reduction: We recycled 63% of our 
waste in 2022 and we continued our research 
into ways to minimise waste. Recycling trials 
are ongoing to investigate ways in which 
Kingspan factory waste could be reutilised to 
add value to other industries while helping us 
divert waste from landfi ll. 

@ Recycling: We have plans for two glycolysis 
chemical recycling facilities underway, with 
the fi rst to start construction in Q2 2023.

People 
Passionate 

Attract, Retain and Develop
What has been achieved at 
Kingspan would not be possible 
without the people that work 
hard every day to drive the 
business forward. A dynamic 
and motivated workforce is 
key to delivering the future 
growth strategy of the business. 

For this reason, talent is at the heart of future 
planning at Kingspan. Kingspan’s leadership 
team holds an annual Talent Forum to review 
succession plans, metrics on key positions 
hired throughout the year and to forecast 
future talent gaps as part of our human capital 
risk assessment.

During 2022 Kingspan continued to 
invest in developing leader capability 
and strengthening and deepening 
our talent pipelines to support 
workforce sustainability. Our people 
play a critical role in delivering our 
purpose and strategy, aligned to our 
values. Customer centricity is at the 
heart of our leadership development, 
underpinned by our focus on high 
performance and continuous 
innovation. We encourage our 
leaders to grow their careers in 
line with the growth of the Group. 
At Kingspan we are more than 
aware of the key role leaders play in 
achieving our strategy including our 
Planet Passionate goals. Our formal 
leadership development programmes 
are designed to equip our business 
leaders to drive the achievement of 
our mission to accelerate a net zero 
emissions future with the wellbeing 
of people and planet at its heart.  

Yours to Shape - Graduate 
Attraction and Development
To continue to build leadership 
pipelines Kingspan further invested 
in our global graduate attraction 
and development programme, 
Yours to Shape. Over 190 graduates 
completed the programme since it 
was launched in its current format.  
The programme’s objective is to 
support the successful transition 
of graduates from university to 
Kingspan, create an international 
collaborative network within the 
Group and develop the capabilities 
to drive their career in Kingspan 
forward. As a result of the global 
attraction campaign, 45 participants 
were hired for all divisions around the 
world. It is clear from the campaign 
that graduates are consistently 
attracted to Kingspan for its active 
and practical focus on sustainability. 
This year we attended University 
Career Fairs in-person and virtually 
across all regions. In line with our 
Planet Passionate goals, to off set 
our carbon emissions produced by 
attending each of these Career Fairs 
we partnered with Naturefund to 

plant a tree in Costa Rica for every 
person who registered their interest 
in our Graduate Programme at 
each Career Fair. This provided the 
students with an opportunity to 
give back to the planet and make 
a diff erence in the fi ght against 
climate change. As a result, we are 
committed to planting 500+ trees 
in Costa Rica on behalf of students 
across the globe.

The development programme spans 
12-months of virtual and in-person 
workshops and assignments, peer 
coaching and masterclasses with 
senior executives. In 2022 the fi rst 
half of the programme was all 
delivered virtually and by the second 
half in-person learning events were 
possible. Graduates visited our Joris 
Ide head quarters in Belgium as 
well as continuing their in-person 
learning workshops.  

Each year the graduates work in 
cross-functional, regional teams and 
work on diverse business projects. 
The criteria for projects are that 
they must be innovative, aligned 
to Kingspan strategic priorities 
which includes sustainability and 
have a commercial benefi t. In 
2022 six projects were showcased 
to senior leaders in IKON and the 
presentations were live streamed 
to our facilities around the world.  
The level of innovation and the 
integration of sustainability into the 
projects was inspiring. The projects 
will be taken forward for further 
assessment with an aspiration of 
integration into the existing product 
range. Divisions have also taken 
forward innovative ideas to conserve 
energy and reduce waste.

The Yours to Shape programme is a 
key pillar for Kingspan’s leadership 
development strategy. As talented 
people continue to join and develop 
fulfi lling careers the longer-term 
high performance of the Group is 
safeguarded. 

Programme for Executive 
Acceleration in Kingspan (PEAK)
The PEAK programme was launched 
in 2018. This is an accelerated 
development programme focused 
on supporting the transition to a 
more senior leadership position. The 
core objective of the programme 
is to deepen Kingspan’s leadership 
strength to match the increasing 
scale and global nature of the 
business. An executive sponsor 
partners with participants during 
the programme, sharing leadership 
challenges and encouraging open 
discussion to learn together. Over 
125 executives have participated in 
PEAK with over 50% of participants 
being promoted in the business soon 
after completing the programme. 
PEAK strengthens cross divisional 
relationships, as well as enabling 
further integration of executive talent 
from recent acquisitions.  

Developing Leaders as 
Coaches (DLAC)
During 2022 Kingspan continued 
the Developing Leaders as Coaches 
programme. This is a cross divisional 
programme which focuses on 
developing leaders’ coaching 
capability with the aim of being 
more eff ective in critical people 
conversations. This has led to the 
development of a Kingspan Code of 
Coaching which clarifi es the rules 
of engagement and aligns with 
the Company’s core values and 
Code of Conduct. In Q4 of 2022 we 
rolled out a Developing Leadership 
Coaching Capability Programme 
similar to DLAC. This time it was an 
international programme hosting 
participants from Ireland, UK and 
throughout Europe. We will continue 
to roll out this programme next year 
to ensure the ongoing development of 
formal coaching skills and consistency 
of practice globally. In parallel, we 
continue to assign internal coaches 
and mentors to sponsor high potential 
managers with particular emphasis on 
accelerating emerging female leaders 
to senior leadership positions.

Equal opportunities, employee 
rights and diversity 
Kingspan is committed to providing 
equal opportunities from recruitment 
and appointment, training and 
development to appraisal and 
promotion opportunities for a 
wide range of people, free from 
discrimination or harassment and in 
which all decisions are based on work 
criteria and individual performance. 
We see diversity and inclusiveness as 
an essential part of our productivity, 
creativity and innovation. Diversity 
is widely promoted within Kingspan, 
46% of our most recent graduate 
programme are female and 25% of 
our senior executive team, reporting  
to the CEO, are female.

In Autumn 2021, we launched 
Planet Passionate Communities, 
the philanthropic arm of our 10-
year Planet Passionate programme. 
At the heart of Planet Passionate 
Communities is an ambition to create 
a positive legacy as a business. 

Locally, our businesses are devoting 
their time and resources to support 
community projects. The idea: to 
build a world that’s powered by 
renewable energy, has net-zero 
carbon, manages water sustainably, 
and protects the earth’s valuable 
resources by reducing, re-using 
and recycling. 

On a global level, we’ve joined 
forces with GOAL, the international 
humanitarian response agency, in 
a fi ve-year partnership that will 
make lives better for some of the 
world’s most vulnerable people. 
Over these fi ve years, we will be 

providing them with the expertise, 
products and fi nancial contributions 
- all combining to €1.5m to develop 
critical infrastructure in healthcare 
and education with sustainability 
at its core. All in a rapid response to 
complex global issues. 

More about GOAL
Humanitarian aid agency GOAL 
was founded in 1977 and is 
headquartered in Dublin. Over 
the last four decades, you’ll fi nd 
GOAL has responded to major 
humanitarian crisis after crisis. 
Today, it’s working with vulnerable 
communities in 15 countries to help 
those facing poverty, confl ict, hunger 
and climate change. GOAL brings 
emergency food and shelter when a 
crisis strikes; expertise and resources 
to strengthen healthcare systems; 
training leading to meaningful work 
and income; and education and 
support to fi ght hunger.

Puerto Cortés Hospital Honduras 
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit 
Honduras, the Public Hospital of 
Puerto Cortés was nominated as the 
fi rst line of response. When Hurricane 
Eta and Hurricane Iota storms hit 
later the same year, it became clear 
that the hospital simply couldn’t 
cope. The chosen solution gave a 
chance for GOAL and Kingspan to 
join forces in building a new, state of 
the art hospital wing just 10 meters 
away from the existing Hospital. 
With 12 new beds, shared equally 
between a female and a male ward, 
this would add capacity for providing 
critical care to patients. The new Sayri 
Molina wing, named after a GOAL 
employee who lost her life to the 
pandemic, will use a combination of 
Kingspan’s building envelope panel 
solutions for walls and roofs, and 
Cleanroom Modular Unit technology 
(prefabricated panels) providing 
hygienic and safe rooms.

Our policies 

Aims 
@ Comply with all local laws in the 

countries we operate in. 

@ Ensure supply chain accountability. 

Modern slavery 
Slavery and human traffi  cking are 
abhorrent crimes and we all have a 
responsibility to ensure that they do not 
continue. At Kingspan we pride ourselves 
on conducting our business ethically 
and responsibly. 

The Modern Slavery Act 2015 became 
UK legislation and required all large UK 
companies and businesses who supply 
goods or services in the UK to publish a 
slavery and human traffi  cking statement 
each fi nancial year on their website. 
Kingspan is fully committed to ensuring 
that modern slavery is not taking place in 
our business or any of our supply chains. 
We adopted and published our policy 
statement at the end of 2016 and all our 
businesses are responsible for ensuring 
supplier compliance with the legislation. 

Supply chain engagement 
Kingspan continues to develop its 
ethical and environmental strategy for 
procuring materials and services. We 
seek to build and maintain long term 
relationships with key suppliers and 
contractors to ensure that they are 
aligned to the same goals and standards 
as Kingspan, to address strategic global 
issues, emerging trends and ultimately 
our customer needs. This approach has 
divisional and regional variances based 
on the local requirements and materials, 
but is built on core social, ethical and 
environmental standards. In all cases 
we aim to foster an environment of 
collaboration. In 2022, we adopted and 

published our Group Supplier Policy 
which sets out our expectations of 
suppliers in terms of business practices 
and integrity, ethical employment 
practices, anti-corruption and bribery 
and environmental responsibility.  

EcoVadis
In late 2021, Kingspan subscribed to 
EcoVadis. The EcoVadis sustainability 
management platform will help us to 
monitor and track our suppliers ESG 
performance, promote transparency, 
reduce risk and identify areas for 
improvement. EcoVadis is a sustainability 
rating platform which assesses a 
company supply chain network 
under environmental, ethics, labour 
and human rights, and sustainable 
procurement criteria. The outcome of 
the assessment process is a company 
scorecard which provides an overall ESG 
performance rating of the supplier. In 
2022, we began the roll out of EcoVadis 
questionnaire requests across our key 
supplier base. To date we have received 
score cards that cover 41% of our key 
supply base by spend.

Customer experience programme 
Our Customer Experience programme is 
all about capturing what, how and why 
our customers experience the things they 
do. During 2022 we received feedback 
from over 14,500 customers in over 
90 countries. As customer experience 
becomes more important in a digital 
world, our feedback programme gives 
us a means to hear what our customers 
have to say about their experience with 
us, keeps our fi nger on the pulse and 
provides us with the insights to develop 
and drive new digital technologies to 
help make meaningful change happen.

77The BoardDirectors’ Report76 Kingspan Group plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022



In 2022, the committee appointed 
Better Boards to carry out an 
independent evaluation of the Board, 
including its effectiveness, Board 
culture, Board committees, and 
Board composition and diversity. The 
timing of this review was important, 
as it followed my appointment in 
2021 as independent Chairman of the 
Board, and also precedes a period of 
transition for the Board whereby a 
number of long serving non-executive 
directors are due to retire in the near-
term. The external evaluation process 
gave valuable insights into the Board 
and its committees, and a summary 
of the Better Boards’ report and 
recommendations are set out later in 
this report.

At Kingspan, we have always 
welcomed shareholder feedback 
and, where feasible, we seek to 
incorporate that feedback into our 
decision making and reporting. 
During the year, I was delighted to 
have the opportunity to engage with 
our shareholders in relation to our 
strategy, governance, remuneration 
and sustainability proposals. I wrote 
to shareholders representing over 
70% of the register, and was very 
pleased to meet with several of our 
top shareholders to gain a greater 
understanding of some of the matters 
raised at our Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’). A key topic of discussion 
with shareholders was the future 
composition and diversity of our 
Board, which has culminated in the 
adoption of Kingspan’s Board Diversity 
Policy. Further details of our response 
to these shareholder engagements 
are set out later in this report.

I would like to thank all of those who 
provided their feedback to the Board 
during our various engagements, and 
I look forward to continuing these 
conversations both in the run up to 
and following our AGM this year.

Report of the Nominations  
& Governance Committee
Jost Massenberg

Dear Shareholder

I am pleased to present 
the 2022 Nominations & 
Governance Committee 
report covering the work and 
activities of the committee 
during the year. 

The Kingspan Board recognises that the values, integrity and 
behaviours that shape our culture and corporate governance 
are the foundation of long-term success. We are committed to 
ensuring that our long-term ambitions go hand in hand with high 
standards of corporate governance, in line with the principles 
of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. We continually 
enhance our corporate governance practices and disclosures to 
ensure we not only meet the standards expected of us but, more 
importantly, we promote the success of the business for all of our 
stakeholders. We consistently strive to ensure that our reporting 
continues to be meaningful in detailing how we integrate the UK 
Corporate Governance Code’s principles into our decision making, 
and we have made enhancements to our governance processes, 
based on our purpose, values, and strategy, all of which contribute 
to reducing business risk for stakeholders. At the heart of all these 
endeavours is an entrepreneurial Board that adheres to high 
standards of governance.

During the year, I was delighted to have the 
opportunity to engage with our shareholders 
in relation to our strategy, governance, 
remuneration and sustainability proposals.

Further details of the Board renewal 
process, and the key outcomes of the 
Better Boards review are outlined later 
in this report.

Board responsibilities  
There is a clear division of 
responsibilities within the Group 
between the Board and executive 
management, with the Board 
retaining control of key strategic and 
other major decisions. The Chairman 
leads the Board and is responsible for 
its overall effectiveness in directing 
the Company. One of the key roles 
of the Chairman in doing so is 
promoting a culture of objectivity, 
openness and debate. In addition, 
the Chairman facilitates constructive 
Board relations and the effective 
contribution of all non-executive 
directors, and ensures that directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear 
information.

The balance of skills, background and 
diversity of the Board contributes to 
the effective leadership of the business 
and the development of strategy. 
The Board’s composition is central 
to ensuring all directors contribute 
to discussions. As outlined below, 
the Board continues to review its 
composition to ensure appropriate 

refreshment and renewal on an on-
going basis. 

As a means of fostering open dialogue 
and director engagement, the 
non-executive directors, led by the 
Senior Independent Director, meet 
without the Chairman present at 
least annually. Likewise, the Chairman 
holds meetings with the non-executive 
directors without the executives 
present. Each of these settings lends 
itself to a level of scrutiny, discussion 
and challenge, in a collaborative 
atmosphere.

All directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. Where necessary or 
requested, directors can also avail of 
independent third-party advice on 
Company issues or relevant Board 
matters – including, but not limited 
to matters such as remuneration 
and succession. The Company 
has procedures whereby all new 
directors receive formal induction 
and familiarisation with Kingspan’s 
business operations, sustainability 
matters and systems on appointment, 
including trips to manufacturing sites 
with in-depth explanations of the 
processes involved at the site.

Workforce engagement 
The Board recognises the importance 
of engaging with all of our key 
stakeholders, as set out in Provision 
5 of the Code. Elsewhere in this 
Annual Report we have detailed the 
long-lasting partnerships we have 
developed with customers, suppliers 
and communities. We are also aware 
of the value of engagement with 
our workforce. Our people are key 
to developing and delivering on our 
strategy, and are fundamental to our 
long-term success.  

Linda Hickey is appointed as the 
director responsible for workforce 
engagement to facilitate the 
channelling of employee views to 
Board discussions. During the year, 
she had the opportunity to hear 
employee views on a range of topics 
through participation in our graduate 
development programme, and by 
meeting employees on site during 
Board visits. In 2022 we worked with our 
employee representatives to establish 
a European Works Council which will 

provide a structure to engage with 
our employees at a European level on 
the development of the business, as 
well as employment, investments and 
transnational issues. The first meeting 
of the European Works Council will 
take place in the first half of 2023, 
and we look forward to constructive 
engagement with our employee 
representatives through this forum. 
In 2023 Kingspan will be launching 
its People Passionate programme 
across all its businesses which will 
develop wider employee engagement 
across the Group on a broad range 
of issues including culture, vision, 
health and well-being, and training 
and development. These processes of 
engagement will allow the Board to 
consistently assess and monitor the 
evolution of the Company’s corporate 
culture, while promoting the ability of 
the workforce to provide feedback.

Shareholders’ meetings and rights 
The Company operates under the 
Irish Companies Act 2014 (the ‘Act’). 
This Act provides for two types of 
shareholder meetings: the AGM 
with all other meetings being called 
Extraordinary General Meetings 
(‘EGM’).

The Company must hold an AGM 
each year in addition to any other 
shareholder meeting in that year. 
The AGM is an important forum for 
shareholders to meet with and hear 
from Company directors. The ordinary 
business of an AGM is to receive and 
consider the Company’s Annual Report 
and statutory financial statements, 
to review the affairs of the Group, to 
elect directors, to declare dividends, 
to appoint or reappoint auditors and 
to fix the remuneration of auditors 
and directors. At the 2022 AGM, 
shareholders were provided with the 
facility to attend and participate 
either in person, by proxy or on-line 
using the latest technology platforms.  
Kingspan is committed to a continuing 
engagement with shareholders at and 
around our AGM. 

The Chairman of the Board of 
Directors presides as chairman of every 
general meeting and in his absence, 
one of the directors present will act 
in the capacity of chairman. The 
quorum for a general meeting shall be 
not less than three members present 

in person or by proxy and entitled to 
vote. All ordinary shares rank pari 
passu and carry equal voting rights. 
Every member present in person or by 
proxy shall upon a show of hands have 
one vote and every member present 
in person or by proxy shall upon a poll 
have one vote for each share of which 
they are the holder. In the case of an 
equality of votes, both on a show of 
hands and at a poll, the Chairman 
shall have a casting vote. Further 
details of shareholders rights with 
respect to the General Meetings are 
set out in the Shareholder Information 
section of this Annual Report.

Board diversity 
At our AGM last year, there were 
approx. 24% of votes cast against the 
re-election of the Chairman to the 
Board. Both prior to and following 
the AGM the Company engaged 
extensively with shareholders to 
develop a deeper understanding 
of any concerns shareholders may 
have. The Company wrote out to 
shareholders representing over 70% 
of the register, with the Chairman 
and the Senior Independent Director 
also meeting several of the top 
shareholders to discuss matters arising 
from the AGM.  It was clear from these 
shareholder engagements that the 
vote primarily reflected shareholders’ 
views about Board refreshment 
and diversity.

The Board has now adopted a Board 
Diversity Policy, which supports the 
recommendations set out in the 
Hampton-Alexander Review on gender 
diversity. The Board intends to:

 @ increase female representation 
on the Board over the coming 
years to achieve the best practice 
benchmark of a minimum 40% 
representation of both genders; 
and

 @ increase the international 
representation on the Board.

A copy of the Board’s policy is 
available on the Group’s website 
www.kingspan.com. The Board 
intends to achieve these objectives 
through future appointments as the 
Board is refreshed, having regard 
for the need to maintain a stable 
and effective Board during the 
transition period. To this end, three 

of the last five non-executive director 
appointments have been female. The 
Board currently comprises nine male 
and three female (25%) directors 
(including the Senior Independent 
Director), which will change to seven 
male and four female (36%) following 
the appointment of Louise Phelan 
and the retirement of Michael Cawley 
and John Cronin at our forthcoming 
AGM. This will meet the target set 
by the Irish Government’s Balance 
for Better Business of 33% female 
representation on Boards by 2023, 
as the Company moves progressively 
towards the gender and international 
diversity targets set out in our Board 
Diversity Policy.

Board composition and renewal 
Kingspan is committed to the on-
going refreshment and renewal 
of the Board, which is essential to 
bring fresh thinking and constructive 
challenge to the Board’s decision 
making. The Nominations & 
Governance Committee leads the 
process for Board appointments while 
ensuring plans are in place for orderly 
succession to both the Board and 
senior management positions. 

In considering candidates for 
appointment as non-executive 
directors, the committee remains 
guided by the principle that all 
appointments will be made based 
on merit and skills, whilst having 
regard to our Board Diversity Policy, 
including, diversity of gender, age, 
nationality and ethnicity. The Board 
believes that international skills and 
experience are equally as important 
as nationality, and will have 
regard to both factors in making 
appointments.

In 2022, the committee led the 
search for the appointment of a new 
independent non-executive director.  
In considering the appointment, the 
committee had regard to the planned 
changes to the Board in the near-
term, particularly the prospective 
retirement of Michael Cawley as a 
non-executive director and current 
chair of the Audit & Compliance 
Committee. The committee agreed 
the criteria for the new appointment, 
to include relevant financial skills, a 
background in industry, and broad 
international experience (particularly 

in the Americas). The committee 
considered whether or not to engage 
a firm of consultants to assist in 
the process of recruiting the new 
non-executive director, and agreed 
that in order to ensure best fit with 
the Company, it would use the 
extensive knowledge and contacts 
of the committee to identify suitable 
candidates.  

The committee maintains a pool 
of potential candidates, and after 
considering Senan Murphy’s skillset, 
which comprises more than 30  
years’ experience in international 
business across multiple industries 
including building materials, 
renewable energy, financial services 
and banking, he was considered the 
most suitable candidate. Mr Murphy’s 
appointment broadens the skillset 
and diversity of the Board while 
reflecting our increasingly global 
footprint as a business.

Aligning succession planning 
to Kingspan’s wider strategy is 
a cornerstone of strong Board 
governance, and has been, and 
will continue to be, a focus of the 
committee. A fundamental aspect 
of overseeing appointments to 
senior management remains the 
development of a diverse leadership 
pipeline. Among Kingspan’s senior 
management team, 25% of senior 
leadership roles reporting directly to 
the CEO are held by females, which 
compares to the target set by the 
Irish Government’s Balance for Better 
Business of 26% females in senior 
leadership roles by 2022. Furthermore, 
this year 28% and 34% of attendees 
on Kingspan’s senior management and 
graduate development programmes 
respectively were female, and 76% 
and 41% of the participants in the 
respective programmes were from 
an international (non UK/Irish) 
background, as Kingspan is attracting 
more and more diversity into senior 
leadership roles.

Key strengths and relevant experience 
of each Director are set out on pages 
75 to 77, and a breakdown of the 
background and principal skills and 
experience of the non-executive 
directors on the Board is set out in the 
table overleaf.

*In particular, with respect to Kingspan’s markets, raw materials and Planet Passionate strategy.

The policy stipulates that directors 
are required to avoid situations where 
they have, or could have, a direct or 
indirect interest that conflicts, or may 
conflict, with the Company’s interests. 
Directors are required to give notice 
of any potential situational and/or 
transactional conflicts, which will then 
be notified to and considered by the 
Board. In deciding what approach to 
take, the Board will consider: 

 @ whether the conflict needs to be 
avoided or simply documented; 

 @ whether the conflict will 
realistically impair the director’s 
capacity to impartially participate 
in decision-making; 

 @ the possibility of creating an 
appearance of improper conduct 
that might impair confidence in, or 
the reputation of, the Company; 
and 

 @ any measures that may be taken 
to avoid or mitigate the potential 
conflict. 

Directors are not allowed to 
participate in such considerations or 
to vote regarding their own conflicts.

Effectiveness and independence  
The committee has reviewed the 
size and performance of the Board 
during the year and this process 
occurs annually. The Board continues 
to ensure that each of the non-
executive directors, remain impartial 
and independent in order to meet the 
challenges of the role. Throughout 
the year, more than half of the Board 
(58%), comprised independent non-
executive directors. Linda Hickey is 
the Senior Independent Director on 
the Board. The Senior Independent 
Director provides a sounding board 
for the Chairman and serves as an 
intermediary for the other directors 

and shareholders when necessary. 
The directors consider that there is 
strong independent representation 
on the Board.

The Board has had due regard to 
various matters which might affect, or 
appear to affect, the independence of 
certain directors. The Board considers 
that each of the non-executive 
directors on the Board, excluding 
Paul Murtagh, are independent. 

When considering John Cronin’s 
independence, the Board noted 
that he was previously a partner 
at McCann FitzGerald, one of the 
Company’s legal advisers, from 
which he retired in March 2021. The 
Board also had regard to Mr. Cronin’s 
experience as an accomplished 
corporate lawyer who adds important 
legal and regulatory experience to 
the Board. In these circumstances the 
Board continues to be satisfied that 
Mr Cronin remains fully independent, 
and that there was no material 
relationship, financial or otherwise, 
which might influence his judgement. 

In assessing the independence of 
Linda Hickey, the Board had due 
regard to her length of service on the 
Board, and to her previous position 
as a senior executive at Goodbody 
Stockbrokers, one of the Company’s 
corporate brokers, from which she 
retired in April 2019. Having regard to 
the continuing evolution of the Board, 
the committee agreed to extend 
the term of Ms Hickey for a period 
of up to three years to 2025 (subject 
to annual re-election at the AGM) 
in order to maintain a stable and 
effective Board during the period. In 
assessing Ms Hickey’s independence, 
the committee formed the view that 
she has always expressed a strongly 
independent voice at the Board and 

its committee meetings, including the 
Remuneration Committee of which 
she is chair, and that she has always 
exercised her judgement as a non-
executive director, and as the Senior 
Independent Director, independent 
of any other relationships within 
the Board. The Board also took into 
account her unrivalled experience 
in capital markets and governance, 
which is hugely valuable to the 
Company and its shareholders, and 
concluded that her independence was 
not affected.

External commitments 
Directors may serve on other 
boards provided they continue 
to demonstrate the requisite 
commitment to discharge their 
duties effectively. The committee 
reviews the extent of the directors’ 
other interests on an ongoing basis 
throughout the year. The committee 
is satisfied that each of the directors 
commits sufficient time to their duties 
in relation to the Company. The 
Chairman and each of the directors 
have also confirmed that they have 
sufficient time to fulfil their obligations 
to the Company.

The committee will continue to 
keep under review the external 
commitments of all directors.

Board evaluation  
Kingspan has in place formal 
procedures for the evaluation of its 
Board, committees and individual 
directors. The purpose of this formal 
evaluation is to ensure that the 
Board of Directors (on a collective 
and individual basis) is performing 
effectively and to ensure stakeholder 
confidence in the Board. The 
Chairman reviews the performance of 
the Board, and the conduct of Board 
and committee meetings annually, 
and an externally facilitated review 
of the Board’s general corporate 
governance is carried out in every 
third year. 

The Chairman conducts his review 
through a series of one to one 
meetings with each of the executive 
and non-executive directors, as well 
as by receiving feedback through the 
Senior Independent Director of the 
non-executive directors’ collective 
views on the workings of the Board.

An external independent evaluation 
of the Board’s performance was 
carried out in 2022 by Better Boards.  
The review format included a 
questionnaire completed by all Board 
members, a review of the Board 
papers, and a series of one to one 
interviews conducted with each of the 
executive and non-executive directors.  
The evaluation also measured the 
Board against selected peers.

The key areas of focus for the review 
were: Board leadership; Board culture; 
the Board committees; and Board 
composition and diversity. The results 
of the review were discussed by the 
Committee and presented to the 
Board at its meeting in December 
2022. Overall the results were very 
positive, with the conclusion that 
the Board operates effectively, that 
there was a seamless transition to 
the new Chair, and that the Audit & 
Compliance Committee was effective 
in overseeing product compliance in 
line with its new terms of reference. 

The review addressed in particular 
the Board’s composition and 
diversity, and noted that the Board 
was evolving, with a number of 
long serving non-executive directors 
due to retire in the near-term. 
In addition the review addressed 
succession planning for the roles of 
Senior Independent Director and the 
Workforce Engagement Director, and 
the need to ensure continuity across 
both roles. The review recommended 
that the Board should adopt a formal 
Board Diversity Policy setting out its 
commitment to improving diversity 
on the Board, and that it should 
proactively use upcoming Board 
vacancies to respond to gender 
and diversity targets, having regard 
for the need to maintain a stable 
and effective Board during the 
transition period.

A number of other themes for further 
consideration were also proposed, as 
summarised below: 

 @ Chairman to use one to one 
meetings with directors to 
maintain Board effectiveness;

 @ Board to seek on-going assurance 
of consistency of Kingspan culture 
throughout the Group;

 @ Enhanced reporting from sub-
committees to the Board; and

 @ Effective succession planning and 
induction process for the Board over 
near-term, including for the role of 
the Senior Independent Director.

The Board has endorsed all the 
recommendations of the Better Boards 
report, and has adopted the Board 
Diversity Policy referred to above. The 
Board will monitor progress against 
the agreed action plan designed to 
further enhance Board effectiveness.

Conflicts of interests  
The Board recognises the importance 
of independent representation to the 
effective functioning of the Board, as 
well as providing scrutiny and (where 
necessary) challenge to management, 
as part of an effective governance 
framework. The committee has 
adopted a Conflicts of Interest Policy 
which guides all decisions of the Board 
when actual or potential conflicts of 
interest might arise.

Remuneration philosophy and policy
Kingspan’s philosophy is to pay for 
performance and delivery of strategy, 
based on simple straightforward 
metrics, aligned with the interests of 
shareholders and wider stakeholders’ 
interests.

During 2022, I reached out to over 70% 
of our shareholder register, and was 
very pleased to have the opportunity to 
meet with many of our most significant 
shareholders, to discuss with you 
Kingspan’s remuneration philosophy 
and our policy proposals as we worked 
towards the triennial renewal of our 
policy at our 2022 Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’). Many of you shared 
your feedback with us, both in writing 
and in discussion with the Company, 
and this has been very helpful in 
formulating the final shape of our 
updated Remuneration Policy.

During our extensive consultations 
with shareholders both before and 
again after the AGM, we highlighted 
the significant increase in scale 
and complexity of the business 
over the three years since our last 
Remuneration Policy was approved in 
2019. Shareholders were, in general, 
supportive of our proposed policy 
changes, although some expressed 
concerns about including the flexibility 
to grant restricted shares in our 
recruitment policy, as well as the 
quantum and timing of the changes 
to the LTIP limits. The committee was 
very grateful for these shareholder 
responses and has incorporated that 
feedback into its decision-making as 
explained below.

The committee considered the 
feedback received, as well as its 
responsibility to develop a remuneration 
policy that is appropriate for the 
strategic development of the entire 
Kingspan Group, whilst also balancing 
the expectations of shareholders. In 

response to the feedback received, 
the committee:

 @ did not include the proposed 
restricted share units (which had 
been considered as a potential 
recruitment tool) as part of the 
updated Remuneration Policy;

 @ granted PSP awards to the CEO 
at 225% of base salary, and at 
200% of base salary for the other 
executive directors, as proposed 
in last year’s Report of the 
Remuneration Committee;

 @ confirmed that there is no 
current intention for any further 
step-change increases in PSP 
award levels; and

 @ agreed to engage with shareholders 
and consider their feedback before 
implementing any increase above 
250% of salary during the current 
term of the Remuneration Policy.

As shareholders will know, Kingspan 
has delivered significant year on 
year earnings per share growth and 
long term shareholder returns. An 
important part of the committee’s 
policy review was to ensure that our 
executive directors continued to be 
incentivised and fairly rewarded for 
this growth and the returns delivered 
to shareholders. The committee, 
as part of the policy review, looked 
carefully at both the levels and 
structure of remuneration. Our 
remuneration packages are weighted 
significantly towards variable pay with 
particular focus on the long-term as 
demonstrated by our CEO’s maximum 
annual bonus opportunity of 150% of 
salary and long-term PSP award of 
225% of salary. Incentivising longer 
term sustainable performance was 
very much the committee’s objective in 
the review of our remuneration policy 
and the increase in PSP award levels. 
The committee’s policy review took a 
prudent approach to increasing pay 

Report of the 
Remuneration Committee 
Linda Hickey

Dear Shareholder

On behalf of the 
Remuneration 
Committee, I am 
pleased to present 
the 2022 Report 
on Directors’ 
Remuneration.

levels, whilst noting that the executive 
directors’ remuneration packages 
remain below those in comparable Irish 
and UK listed businesses.

We were pleased that our updated 
Remuneration Policy was supported 
by almost 80% of shareholders who 
voted at last year’s AGM, and at the 
same time the committee received 
97% support for the Report of the 
Remuneration Committee at our AGM. 
Further details of our shareholder 
engagements during the year are set 
out later in this report.

2022 business performance and 
pay outcomes
2022 was another record year for 
Kingspan, despite challenging market 
conditions. Management delivered 
significant progress across its key 
strategic pillars, increasing geographic 
expansion and market penetration 
both organically and through 
acquisition, completing the envelope 
through the establishment of the new 
Roofing + Waterproofing division, and 
continued new product development 
introducing new and innovative 
building solutions. The result was that 
Group revenues increased to €8.3bn 
(up 28%), and trading profit was 
€833m (up 10%). Earnings Per Share 
(‘EPS’), a key performance measure 
used to determine the executives’ 
performance-related pay, increased to 
329.5 cent (up 8% over prior year), a 
new record for Kingspan.

For 2022, all of our executive directors 
received basic salary increases of 4.5% 
which was in line with the general 
workforce increases for the markets in 
which they are based, except for Russell 
Shiels. As outlined in last year’s Annual 
Report, in 2020 the committee carried 
out a review of Russell Shiels’ role and 
responsibilities, and noted that this 
had increased significantly in recent 
years as a result of recent organic 
and inorganic expansion particularly 
in LATAM. The committee agreed to 
incrementally adjust Mr Shiels’ package 
over the period 2021/2022, and for 
2022 awarded Mr Shiels a 4% increase 
in salary above US inflation (giving 
a total increase of 10%) to reflect 
his increased responsibilities in the 
Americas. The committee is satisfied 
that these changes have properly 
aligned Mr Shiels’ package with his 

increased responsibilities and no further 
adjustment is required.

Annual bonus payments to the 
executive directors for 2022 of between 
82% and 86% of maximum reflect the 
Group’s strong financial performance in 
the year, combined with the results of 
the non-financial measure of the Net 
Promoter Score (NPS). Details of the 
targets set and performance against 
them are set out later in this report.

At the same time a combination of 
external factors, including the war in 
Ukraine and increased inflation leading 
to general market uncertainty, have 
taken a toll on Kingspan’s share price, 
with Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) 
for the 2020 PSP awards over the 
three-year performance period to 31 
December 2022 being broadly flat at 
1.4%. This resulted in a below median 
TSR performance against our selected 
peer group. As a result the TSR portion 
of the PSP awards did not vest, while 
the strong long-term EPS growth of 
61% over the three-year period resulted 
in 50% of the total 2020 PSP awards 
vesting during 2023.

The committee considered business 
performance during 2022, as well as 
over the longer three-year performance 
period for the 2020 PSP awards, and 
is comfortable that the formulaic 
outcome of the incentives appropriately 
reflects Group performance as well 
as individual contribution and that 
no discretion to adjust is necessary. In 
particular, the committee reviewed 
the share price at the time the 2020 
PSP awards were granted (€61.80) to 
see if market movements had created 
a windfall gain for the executives over 
the last three years. Noting that the 
share price at the time of grant was 
higher than the three month average 
prior to grant and also higher than the 
31 December 2022 share price (€52.29), 
the committee concluded that there 
were no excess gains that required the 
committee to consider a scale back of 
the vesting levels.

2023 remuneration
The executive directors will receive basic 
salary increases of 3% in 2023, which is 
below general workforce increases of 
c. 4.5% to 6%, depending on region. In 
determining the appropriate salaries 
for the executive directors for 2023, the 

committee had regard to the increases 
awarded to the global workforce, 
particularly in the UK and Ireland, 
Western Europe and North America, 
where the rates of pay for the general 
workforce are set locally, and in some 
cases are dictated by local legislation. 
In some countries the businesses have 
responded to the widespread cost of 
living crisis by also making additional 
one-off payments to the workforce. 
The committee considers that the 3% 
increase awarded to the executive 
directors, which is substantially 
below general workforce increases, 
is appropriate in the current high 
inflationary environment.

Pension benefits continue to fall for all 
of the executive directors in line with the 
previously approved plan, to closer align 
with workforce levels.

The annual bonus maximum 
opportunity and PSP award levels 
remain unchanged from prior year for 
2023. As the performance measures 
remain aligned with the Group’s 
strategy, they are also unchanged. The 
targets we have set reflect stretching 
performance goals in an uncertain and 
challenging period ahead. Under the 
policy approved by shareholders at 
last year’s AGM, the committee may 
adjust the 2023 PSP awards that vest 
if it considers the formulaic outcome 
is not representative of the underlying 
performance of the Company, 
investor experience or employee 
reward outcome.

Conclusion
Kingspan’s strong performance in a 
challenging trading environment is 
reflected in the incentive outcomes for 
2022. The decisions that the committee 
has made, both in respect of our 
remuneration policy and the operation 
of that policy for 2023, are in line 
with our commitment to ensure that 
our remuneration framework drives 
superior performance and reflects the 
evolving needs of stakeholders.

I hope that you will join the Board in 
approving the resolution on the Report 
of the Remuneration Committee at the 
AGM on 28 April 2023.

As outlined in last year’s 
Annual Report, Russell 
Shiels received a base 
salary increase of 10% 
to refl ect his increased 
responsibilities, with 
the other executives 
receiving a base salary 
increase of 4.5% in line 
with those awarded to 
the general workforce.

As provided by the approved remuneration policy, the 
maximum annual bonus potential for the executive 
directors is 150% of base salary, which remains 
unchanged. The CEO and CFO’s annual bonus is based on 
the achievement of Group EPS performance targets and, 
additional non-fi nancial NPS targets. For Divisional MDs, 
bonuses are based on a combination of stretching profi t 
targets for their respective divisions, plus an element 
of Group EPS targets and, additional non-fi nancial 
NPS targets.

The 2022 targets and fi nal outturns of the annual 
performance bonuses are detailed on page 99.

The Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) awards vesting in 
February 2023, relate to awards granted in 2020. These 
awards were subject to EPS growth and relative TSR 
performance targets measured over the three year period 
from 2020 to 2022. Target and actual outturns are set 
out on page 100.

Prior to confi rming the pay-outs, the committee 
undertook an evaluation of whether vesting levels 
refl ected Group performance, individual contribution 
and any wider circumstances over the three year

The executive directors

rates of c. 4.5% to 6%,

Rationale: These 
increases take account

pressures that the 
business is experiencing 
in almost all markets.

The committee has determined that there will be no 
material changes to the bonus framework for 2023. The 
measures will remain unchanged and maximum bonuses 
will be capped at 150% of salary.

Rationale: The bonus scheme has proven eff ective at 
driving a relentless focus on profi tability, while extending 
the measures to include NPS, a core part of sustainable 
value creation.

As approved at the AGM in 2022, awards will be made at 
225% of base salary to the CEO and 200% of base salary 
for the other executive directors.

Rationale: As the business continues to grow at an 
exceptional rate, it is important to continue to drive 
superior returns and remain competitive.

Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy

This section of the report outlines the 
current policy for the remuneration of 
the Company’s directors. The current 
remuneration policy was approved by 
shareholders at the AGM on 29 April 
2022 and is set out in full in the 2021 
Annual Report, and can be found 
on the Company’s website at www.
kingspan.com.

Our remuneration philosophy
At Kingspan, we have developed a 
clear philosophy around remunerating 
and incentivising employees at all 
levels of the organisation. As detailed 
in prior reports, the principles 
against which we determine our 
approach to remuneration, and make 
decisions, are:

 @ Pay for performance ensuring 
that variable remuneration is 
only paid for strong performance 
and maximum payouts will 
only be realised for truly 
exceptional performance.

 @ Simplicity so that executives and 
shareholders can understand our 
pay arrangements without overly 
complex rules.

 @ Transparency so that it is 
objectively transparent with 
high levels of disclosure in the 
Annual Report.

 @ Alignment with shareholders by 
delivering a significant proportion 
of remuneration through equity, 
and by setting executive share 
ownership guidelines.

This approach cascades through the 
organisation and has played a key role 
in driving the growth of the business 
and significant value creation for 
stakeholders over the years.

The committee has considered the key parameters set out by the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), 
which we believe our principles are aligned to:

Matters Explanation
Clarity The policy is clear, uncomplicated and well understood by the executive 

directors. It is based on measures aligned to strategy.

Simplicity Aligned with our existing principle of simplicity, with clear and focused 
incentive plans that do not incorporate excessive measures.

Risk The policy is designed to discourage inappropriate risk taking and to ensure 
that it is not rewarded. This is achieved by an appropriate balance between 
short-term and long-term incentive plans and the introduction of non-
financial metrics, with clawback and recovery provisions and the ability of the 
committee to utilise discretion to adjust formulaic outcomes.

Predictability Incentive plans are subject to established limits, with objective targets and 
straight line vesting dictating payouts.

Proportionality Aligned with our principle of pay-for-performance, so that any pay is fully 
proportional to performance and stakeholder experience.

Alignment to culture Our high performance culture is designed to drive superior returns for 
shareholders, whilst the introduction of sustainability measures embeds our 
Planet Passionate goals throughout the business.

The policy for the key elements of an executive director’s remuneration is set out in the table below:

Key element Operation Opportunity and measures
Fixed remuneration
Base Salary
To attract and retain the 
best global talent of the 
calibre required to deliver 
the Group’s strategy.

Base salaries are reviewed annually by 
the Remuneration Committee in the last 
quarter of each year. A broad assessment 
of individual and business performance 
is used by the committee as part of the 
salary review. Increases will generally be 
in line with increases across the Group, 
but may be higher or lower in certain 
circumstances to reflect performance, 
changes in remit, roles and responsibilities, 
or to allow newly appointed executives to 
move progressively towards market norms.

Any increase will typically be in line with 
those awarded to the broader employee pay 
environment. The committee has discretion 
to award higher increases in circumstances 
that it considers appropriate, such as a 
change in role or responsibility.

Benefits
To provide benefits which 
are competitive with 
the market.

In addition to their base salaries, executive 
directors’ benefits include but are not 
limited to life and health insurance, the use 
by the executive directors of company cars 
(or a taxable car allowance) and relocation 
or similar allowances on recruitment, each 
in line with typical market practice.

Benefits are set at a level which the 
committee considers appropriate in light of 
the market and depending on the role and 
an individual’s circumstances.

Pensions
To provide a retirement 
benefit which is 
competitive with 
the market.

Kingspan operates a defined contribution 
pension scheme for executive directors. 
Pension contributions are calculated on 
base salary only. Alternatively, Kingspan 
may pay a cash amount subject to all 
applicable employee and employer payroll 
taxes and social security.

Incumbent executive director pensions will be 
reduced to 10% of salary by the end of 2024.
Newly appointed executive directors’ will be 
capped at the rate applicable in the relevant 
market.

Variable remuneration
Annual performance 
bonus
To reward the delivery of 
short-term performance 
targets and business 
strategy, satisfied in 
cash and deferred 
share awards, aligning 
management interests 
with shareholders and the 
longer term performance 
of the Group.

Executive directors receive an annual 
performance related bonus based on the 
attainment of financial and non-financial 
targets set prior to the start of each year.
Bonuses are paid on a sliding scale if the 
targets are met. Maximum bonus is only 
achieved if ambitious incremental growth 
targets are achieved.

No more than 100% of salary can be 
delivered in cash through the bonus plan. 
Any performance related bonus achieved 
in excess of the cash amount is satisfied 
by the grant of share awards, which are 
deferred for two years.

The committee has discretion to adjust 
formulaic bonus outcomes in line with  
the Code.

The maximum potential bonus for the 
executive directors is 150% of base salary.

The committee selects stretching 
performance targets each year, which are 
based on a mix of:

 @ Group profit targets;

 @ Divisional financial performance;

 @ Net Promoter Score (Customer NPS).

Bonus payment for financial targets is 0% 
at threshold. Bonus is paid on a straight line 
basis for achieving each point on the NPS 
target scale.

At Kingspan, we have 
developed a clear philosophy 
around remunerating and 
incentivising employees at all 
levels of the organisation.

Kingspan Group plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 Report of the Remuneration Committee 9392 Directors’ Report



Key element Operation Opportunity and measures
Variable remuneration (continued)
Long-term 
incentive plan (LTIP)
To reward the sustained
strong performance 
and delivery of Group 
strategic objectives over 
the longer term. Aligns 
the interests of executive 
directors and senior 
managers with those of 
the Group’s shareholders 
and recognises and 
rewards value creation 
over the longer term.

Executive directors are entitled to 
participate in Kingspan’s Performance 
Share Plan (PSP). Under the terms of the 
PSP, performance shares are awarded 
to the executive directors and the senior 
management team. The performance 
shares will vest after three years only if 
the Group’s underlying performance has 
improved during the 3-year performance 
period, and if certain financial and non-
financial ESG targets are achieved over the 
performance period.
The awards are subject to a two-year post 
vesting holding period.

The maximum award level under the policy 
is 300% of salary. The committee will not 
increase awards above 250% of salary in the 
current policy period without first engaging 
with its largest investors and considering the 
feedback received.

For 2023 the CEO will receive a maximum 
annual award over shares with a market 
value of 225% of base salary, and the other 
executive directors will receive awards over 
shares with a market value of 200% of  
base salary.

Prior to granting an award, the Committee 
sets performance conditions which it 
considers to be appropriately stretching. The 
performance conditions for the PSP awards 
to be granted in 2023 are based on a mix of:

 @ EPS growth;

 @ TSR outperformance; and

 @ Achievement of the Group’s Planet 
Passionate targets.

On achieving the threshold performance 
level for the EPS and TSR measures, 25% of 
the relevant element of the award will vest, 
0% of the Planet Passionate award vests on 
threshold. Vesting is on a straight-line basis 
between threshold and maximum levels of 
performance.

The policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration is as follows:

Key element Operation Opportunity
Non-executive 
director fees
To reflect time 
commitment, experience 
and responsibilities, and 
to attract and retain high 
calibre non-executive 
directors by offering 
a market competitive 
fee level.

Non-executive director fee levels are 
reviewed annually.

The Chairman receives a single fee for 
all their responsibilities.

Other non-executive directors receive 
a basic board membership fee. The 
Chair of Board committees and the 
Senior Independent Director receive an 
additional fee for this role.

Non-executive directors are entitled 
to the reimbursement of reasonable 
business expenses including any tax 
(grossed up) that may be payable on 
those expenses.

Fees for non-executive directors are within the 
limits set by the shareholders from time to time, 
with a current aggregate limit of €975,000.

The following are key structural aspects of the remuneration policy in relation to the directors’ remuneration contracts:

Clawback and malus
Ensures an appropriate 
balance between 
risk and reward.

Covers material misstatement of financial results, material breach of executive’s 
employment contract, error in contract, failure of risk management, corporate failure, 
wilful misconduct, recklessness and or fraud resulting in serious damage to the financial 
condition or business reputation of the Company.

The period within which clawback and malus can be operated is 2 years from payment of 
annual bonus and/or vesting of LTIP awards.

Shareholding guideline
Ensures alignment 
between the interests of 
executive directors and 
shareholders.

200% of salary to be achieved through the retention of at least 50% of all vested variable 
pay awards (subject to sales to meet taxes). Achievement of guideline is measured 
through beneficially owned shares only.

For new appointees, the committee may consider it appropriate to require a percentage of 
the annual bonus paid to be deferred into shares (rather than just bonus in excess of 100% 
of salary), in order to achieve this guideline.

Post cessation of 
employment and 
general shareholding 
requirements
Ensures alignment 
between the interests 
of executive directors 
and shareholders.

All executive directors are subject to a post-employment shareholding requirement of the 
lower of (i) shares or equity interests held on cessation, and (ii) 200% of salary, for 2 years 
post-employment.

Achievement is measured through beneficially owned shares, and the retention of vested 
deferred share and LTIP awards (subject to sales to meet taxes).

Approach to 
recruitment
To attract an executive 
director of the calibre 
required to shape and 
deliver the Group’s 
business strategy.

In exceptional circumstances, such as to facilitate recruitment, the committee may 
exercise its discretion and grant LTIPs up to a maximum of 400% of salary.

Termination - 
Notice Periods

Each of the executive directors has a service contract with the Company which provides for 
12 months’ notice of termination by the Company (or, at the discretion of the Company, 
payment for all or part thereof) and 6 or 12 months by the director and it is the Company’s 
policy that notice periods will not exceed 12 months. The service contracts do not include 
any provision for compensation for loss of office, other than the notice period provisions 
set out above. There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control and there are no 
specific severance arrangements.

The committee’s policy in relation to termination of service contracts is to deal with each 
case on its merits having regard to the circumstances of the individual, the termination of 
employment, any legal advice received and what is in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders.

Termination - Annual 
Incentive Bonus and 
Long Term Incentive 
Plans

Annual bonuses and PSP awards are dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant 
plans. At the discretion of the committee (and normally where the individual has served a 
minimum of 6 months of the bonus year), a pro-rata bonus may become payable at the 
normal payment date for the period of service subject to full year performance targets 
being met.

The default treatment for share based awards is that any unvested award will lapse on 
termination of employment. However, under the rules of the Performance Share Plan, in 
certain prescribed circumstances (e.g. “good leaver”), awards are eligible to vest subject to 
the performance conditions being met over the normal performance period (or a shorter 
period at the Committee’s discretion) and with the award being reduced by an amount to 
reflect the proportion of the vesting period not actually served.

(1) Russell Shiels’ remuneration is denominated 
in USD, and has been converted to Euro 
at the following average rates USD:1.0544 
(2021: 1.1828).

(2) The Group operates a defined contribution 
pension scheme for executive directors. 
Certain executives have elected to 
receive part of their prospective pension 
entitlement as a non-pensionable cash 
allowance in lieu of the pension benefit 
foregone, subject to all applicable employee 
and employer payroll taxes.

(3) Benefits principally relate to health 
insurance premiums and company cars/car 
allowances. In the case of Russell Shiels the 
cost of life insurance and permanent health 
benefit is also included.

(4) The annual incentive amount is earned for 
meeting clearly defined EPS growth, divisional 
profit and NPS targets. Details of the bonus 
plan and targets are set out on page 98 of 
the Report of the Remuneration Committee.

(5) Long-Term Incentives are granted annually 
pursuant to the Kingspan Group Performance 
Share Plan (PSP). Details of the PSP scheme 
and targets are set out on page 100 of the 
Report of the Remuneration Committee.

(6) The value of the 2020 LTIP award that will 
vest in 2023 has been calculated using 
the average share price for December 
2022, being €52.29. The calculation for 
this award will be adjusted in next years’ 
annual report to reflect the share price 
on the date of vesting (24/02/2023). The 
share price decreased from the date of 
grant (share price: €61.80) to the share 
price used to determine the vesting value 
(share price: €52.29).

(7) The value of the 2019 LTIP award that vested 
in 2022 has been calculated using the share 
price at the date of vesting (25/02/2022) of 
€85.66. The share price increased from the 
date of grant (share price: €38.80) to the 
date of vesting (share price: €85.66).

(8) Non-executive directors receive a base fee 
of €75,000 per annum, plus an additional 
fee of €15,000 for chairmanship of Board 
committees, as well as for the Senior 
Independent Director. They do not receive 
any pension benefit, or any performance or 
share based remuneration.

(9) Senan Murphy was appointed as a non-
executive director on 1 October 2022.

(10) Bruce McLennan and Eugene Murtagh both 
retired as non-executive directors on 30 April 
2021.

Kingspan Group plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 Report of the Remuneration Committee 9796 Directors’ Report



Base salary
All of the executive directors, except 
for Russell Shiels, received basic salary 
increases for 2022 of 4.5% which was 
in line with the general workforce 
increases for the markets in which 
they are based and within the overall 
global workforce range of c.3% to 
6%. As outlined in last year’s Annual 
Report, in 2020 the committee carried 
out a review of Mr Shiels’ role and 
responsibilities, and noted that this 
had increased significantly in recent 
years as a result of recent organic 
and inorganic expansion particularly 
in LATAM. The committee agreed 

to incrementally adjust Mr Shiels’ 
package over the period 2021/2022, 
and awarded Mr Shiels a 4% increase 
over US inflation in 2022 (giving 
a total increase of 10%) to reflect 
his increased responsibilities in the 
Americas. The committee is satisfied 
that these changes have properly 
aligned Mr Shiels’ package with his 
increased responsibilities and no 
further adjustment is required.

Pension
As outlined in previous Annual 
Reports, all executive directors’ 
contractual pension contributions 

will be reduced to 10% of base salary 
by the end of 2024. This approach 
was adopted by the committee 
and subsequently supported by 
shareholders following feedback on 
the 2019 Remuneration Policy. While 
recognising that certain shareholders 
may have differing expectations on 
the timing of the pension reductions, 
the committee believes this approach 
fairly and appropriately balances 
the legacy contractual entitlement 
of each of the executive directors 
with the general expectations of 
shareholders and wider stakeholders.

2022 performance related bonus
In 2022 all executive directors were 
eligible for a maximum performance 
related bonus opportunity of up to 
150% of base salary. The CEO and 
CFO’s annual performance related 
bonuses were based principally (93% 
of total opportunity) on Group EPS 
growth targets over prior year, with 
the maximum annual performance 
related bonus being payable on the 
achievement of 110% Group EPS 
growth over prior year. The committee 
considered this to be a stretching 
target, particularly in light of the 
global market conditions that were 
evident from the end of the prior 
year. The achievement of record 
EPS growth in such a challenging 
environment was an excellent 
result both individually and by the 
organisation as a whole, and resulted 
in the CEO and CFO achieving 87.5% 
of their maximum bonus opportunity 
against this metric.

For each of the Divisional MDs, 
up to 46.5% of their total bonus 
opportunity was based on achieving 
stretching divisional profit targets, 
with maximum bonus being payable 
on the achievement of 5% divisional 

profit growth. Strong divisional 
performance resulted in 100% of the 
maximum bonus opportunity being 
achieved by the Divisional MDs in 
respect of these financial metrics. 
Additional commentary on each of 
the divisions’ performance is set out in 
the Chief Executive’s Review. A further 
46.5% of the Divisional MDs’ total 
bonus opportunity was payable on the 
achievement of the same stretching 
Group EPS targets as for the CEO 
and CFO, ensuring a healthy balance 
between incentivising divisional and 
Group growth.

Up to 7% of each of the executive 
directors’ total bonus opportunity 
(i.e. 10% of base salary) was based 
on achieving Group or divisional Net 
Promoter Score® (“NPS”) targets. 
NPS is a measure of both brand 
loyalty and brand advocacy and 
is one of many metrics we use to 
measure customer experience as part 
of the global Voice of the Customer 
programme.  As the programme 
has scaled, an external review by an 
independent third party has been 
introduced who validates the NPS 
scores and underlying methodology. 
The overall Group NPS score for the 

year was 41, which was somewhat 
behind prior year and at the lower 
end of target, whilst at a divisional 
level NPS scores varied with some 
showing improvements but others 
falling below target. This reflects in 
part the impacts experienced by 
supply chain shortages, the difficulties 
of passing on high raw material 
cost inflation during the year, and 
the ambitious targets set by the 
committee for this important metric 
of strategic performance.

Each executive’s performance against 
targets, and bonus achieved, is set out 
in the table adjacent. The committee 
was satisfied that the formulaic 
outturn of the bonus plan for 2022 was 
an accurate reflection of underlying 
company performance, individual 
contribution and a holistic evaluation 
of wider circumstances. In particular, 
the committee considered the 
record financial performance of the 
Group, and the substantial growth in 
headcount and operational footprint.

All bonuses earned in excess of 100% 
of base salary will be satisfied by the 
grant of share awards, which are 
deferred for two years.

Performance Share Plan
In 2020, the committee granted PSP Awards that were 50% based on EPS 
growth targets and 50% based on TSR targets as outlined below.

Weighting Targets Performance Payout  
(% of max.)

EPS 50% 6% -12% CAGR 17.2% CAGR 100%

TSR 50% Median to 
Upper Quartile

43rd percentile 0%

The peer group against which TSR performance was measured was as follows:

Armstrong World Industries Inc LafargeHolcim Ltd

Boral Ltd Mowhawk Industries Inc

Compagnie de Saint Gobain S.A. Owens Corning Inc.

Cornerstone Building Brands Inc Rockwood Intl. A/S

CRH plc Sika AG

Geberit AG Travis Perkins plc

Grafton Group plc Wienerberger AG

The committee reviewed the extent to 
which the vesting targets in respect 
of the PSP Awards granted in 2020 
had been met by reference to the EPS 
and TSR targets over the three-year 
performance period to 31 December 
2022. The committee noted that 
a combination of external factors, 
including the war in Ukraine and 
increased inflation leading to general 
market uncertainty had impacted 
Kingspan’s share price, with TSR 
over the three-year performance 
period being broadly flat at 1.4%. 
This resulted in a below median TSR 
performance against the selected peer 
group. As a result the TSR portion of 
the 2020 PSP awards did not vest. At 

the same time, strong long-term EPS 
growth of 61% over the three-year 
period resulted in the EPS targets being 
exceeded and 50% of the total 2020 
PSP awards vesting. In addition, and 
in line with the approach to reviewing 
bonus payouts, the committee 
reviewed overall performance and 
stakeholder experience during the 
three-year period up to 31 December 
2022. Following a review of the vesting 
levels, the committee was satisfied 
that they reflected company and 
individual performance over the three-
year period.

In respect of PSP awards granted 
during the year, the committee 

implemented the increase in the level 
of awards as flagged in last year’s 
Remuneration Policy and Report 
as approved at the 2022 AGM. The 
committee granted awards to the 
CEO equivalent to 225% of base 
salary, and 200% of base salary 
for the other executive directors 
(increased from 200% and 175% of 
salary respectively). There are no 
increases to award levels for 2023 and 
following shareholder engagement 
and feedback, the committee has 
agreed not to increase PSP award 
levels above 250% of salary during 
the current policy period without 
first engaging with shareholders and 
considering their feedback.

Implementation of 
Remuneration Policy 
for 2023

The core principles of our 
remuneration philosophy as outlined 
earlier, frame our approach to 2023, 
namely reward for high-performance, 
simplicity, transparency and 
alignment with shareholders.

Base salary and pension
Notwithstanding the highly 
inflationary environment, the 
executive directors will receive basic 
salary increases of 3% in 2023, which 
compares with general workforce 
increases of c.4.5% to 6%, depending 
on region. In determining the 
appropriate salaries for the executive 
directors for 2023, the committee had 
regard to the rates awarded to the 
global workforce, particularly in the 
UK and Ireland, Western Europe and 
North America, where the rates of 
pay for the general workforce are set 
locally, and in some cases are dictated 
by local legislation. In some countries 
the businesses have responded to the 
widespread cost of living crisis by also 
making additional one-off payments 
to the workforce. The committee 

considers that the 3% increase 
awarded to the executive directors, 
which is substantially below general 
workforce rates, is appropriate in the 
current high inflationary environment.

As outlined previously, pension 
contributions of all incumbent 
executives are being reduced 
incrementally to 10% by December 
2024 with rates applicable for 2023 
set out in the table on page 98.

Annual bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity  
for all the executive directors remains 
at 150% of salary (unchanged 
from 2022). Up to 100% of salary 
earned through the bonus plan is 
delivered in cash, and any bonus 
earned in excess of that amount 
is deferred into shares in the 
Company for two years. For 2023, 
the committee has set stretching 
targets based on the budget for 
the year and market expectations, 
noting the continuing backdrop of 
high inflation rates impacting the 
construction market sentiment 
globally. Targets are commercially 
sensitive and will be disclosed 
retrospectively with performance 
against them in the 2023 Report of 
the Remuneration Committee.

Performance share awards
For 2023, the CEO will receive a PSP 
award over shares with a market 
value of 225% of base salary, and 
the other executive directors will 
receive PSP awards over shares with a 
market value of 200% of base salary. 
These grant levels are unchanged 
from prior year. As outlined above, 
following shareholder engagement 
and feedback, the committee has 
agreed not to increase PSP award 
levels above 250% of salary during 
the current policy period without 
first engaging with shareholders and 
considering their feedback. Overall, 
the annual bonus and long-term 
performance incentive opportunity, 
at up to 375% of salary in aggregate, 
remains below arrangements at 
similarly sized UK and Irish businesses.

The committee reviews annually the 
performance framework for the PSP 
scheme. For the 2023 PSP Awards, 
the committee has selected the same 
performance measures as the 2022 
awards based 45% on EPS growth, 
45% on relative TSR and 10% on our 
ESG Planet Passionate goals. The peer 
group against which TSR performance 
will be measured is set out in the 
below table.

Peer group for 2023 grant for PSP awards:

Armstrong World Industries Inc Masco Corporation
Boral Ltd Mohawk Industries Inc
Builders Firstsource Inc Owens Corning Inc
Carlisle Construction Materials LLC Recticel NV
Compagnie de Saint Gobain SA Rockwool Intl. AS
CRH plc Sika AG
Grafton Group plc Wienerberger AG
Lafarge Holcim Ltd  

The committee reviewed the 
suitability of the constituent members 
of the PSP peer group, and noted 
that Cornerstone Building Brands 
Inc had delisted during the year, and 
also agreed to remove Geberit AG 
and Travis Perkins plc as they were no 
longer considered best fit as peers.  
The committee then considered 
potential replacements to add to 
the TSR peer group, having regard to 
market sector, size and geography 

and agreed to select Builders 
Firstsource Inc, Carlisle Construction 
Materials LLC, Masco Corporation 
and Recticel NV as replacements with 
effect for all future PSP grants.

The committee also reviewed 
the EPS targets to ensure they 
included significant stretch over 
the performance period ahead and 
are aligned with our principles of 
alignment and pay-for-performance. 

Having regard to the uncertain 
macro environment affecting our 
end-markets globally, and the record 
level of EPS achieved in prior year, the 
committee considered that target 
EPS growth of 3% to 6% compound 
over the three-year performance 
period was a proper stretch target 
and appropriately aligned with our 
risk appetite as well as internal and 
external forecasts.

External advisors
The Remuneration Committee obtained advice during the year from independent remuneration consultants Korn Ferry. 
Korn Ferry is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to its Code of Conduct, and all advice is 
provided in accordance with this code. Korn Ferry also provided some leadership and development services to Kingspan 
during the year. The committee concluded that the associated fee for the provision of this service was not material 
and would not affect Korn Ferry’s independence and objectivity. Accordingly, the committee is satisfied that the advice 
obtained was objective and independent.

Shareholder engagement
The committee always welcomes 
shareholder feedback and seeks to 
incorporate that feedback, where 
feasible, into its decision making 
and response.

During the year the committee 
engaged extensively with 
shareholders. Firstly, in advance of the 
2022 AGM we contacted shareholders 
representing c. 70% of the register 
and the committee Chair met and 
spoke the majority of our top 10 
shareholders, sharing with them our 
draft Remuneration Policy proposals. 
Whilst there was general support 
from shareholders for the proposed 
changes, following this engagement 
the draft policy was amended on the 
basis of feedback received to omit the 
proposed restricted share units (which 
had been considered as a potential 
recruitment tool), before being put to 
shareholders for approval. At the AGM, 
the updated Remuneration Policy was 
supported by our shareholders, with 
almost 80% of the votes cast in favour 
of the Policy, and at the same time 
the committee was pleased to receive 
97% support for the Report of the 
Remuneration Committee.

Following the AGM the committee 
engaged once more with our 
shareholders, writing out to those 
representing over 70% of the register, 
and the committee Chair met 
with several of our most significant 
shareholders, receiving feedback 
overall from shareholders representing 
45% of the register. In engaging with 
shareholders around the AGM, we 
developed a clear understanding of the 
concerns of those who voted against 
the updated Remuneration Policy, as 

well as those who supported it. While 
many shareholders acknowledged 
the significant increase in the scale 
and complexity of the business during 
recent years, some shareholders 
expressed concerns about the increase 
in the maximum LTIP award level in 
the policy and timing of the changes. 
Having considered the feedback, the 
committee noted its responsibility 
to develop a remuneration policy 
that is appropriate for the strategic 
development of the entire Kingspan 
Group, whilst also balancing 
the external expectations of 
some shareholders.

During the one to one engagements 
with the Chair, most of the feedback 
indicated that shareholders were 
primarily concerned about the 
maximum award level in the 
policy and not the actual level of 
increases proposed for 2022 PSP 
awards. Therefore, the committee 
implemented the increase in the 
level of PSP Awards as proposed for 
2022, and will make PSP awards at 
the same level for 2023, being an 
award of 225% of base salary for 
the CEO, and 200% of base salary 
for the other executive directors 
(increased from 200% and 175% of 
salary respectively). As a response to 
feedback received on the maximum 
policy limit, the committee has 
agreed not to increase PSP award 
levels above 250% of salary during 
the current policy period without first 
engaging again with shareholders 
and considering their feedback. The 
committee is very grateful to those 
shareholders who engaged with 
the Company during the year, and 
whose feedback has helped shape our 
current Remuneration Policy.

The committee always 
welcomes shareholder 
feedback and seeks 
to incorporate that 
feedback, where 
feasible, into its 
decision making 
and response.

Michael Cawley 

As chairman of the Audit &

Role and 
Responsibilities 
The Board has established an

effectiveness of the processes and 
controls associated with product 
certification and the marketing of the 
Group’s products.

The committee’s role and 
responsibilities are set out in the 
committee’s Terms of Reference 
which are available from the 
Company and are displayed on the 
Group’s website (www.kingspan. 
com). The Terms of Reference are 
reviewed annually and amended 
where appropriate. During the 
year the committee worked with 
management, the external auditors, 
Group Internal Audit, and other 
members of the senior management 
team in fulfilling these responsibilities.

The Audit & Compliance Committee 
report deals with the key areas

Board also includes a review of the 
committees. Any recommendations 
raised in relation to the Audit & 
Compliance Committee are acted 
upon in a formal and structured 
manner. No issues were identified for 
the year ended 31 December 2022.

Financial reporting 
The committee is responsible for 
monitoring the integrity of the 
Group’s financial statements and 
reviewing the financial reporting 
judgements contained therein. The 
financial statements are prepared by 
a finance team with the appropriate 
qualifications and expertise. 

The committee confirmed to the 
Board that the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

In respect of the year to 31 December 
2022, the committee reviewed:

 @ the Group’s Trading Updates 
issued in April, June and 
November 2022;  

 @ the Group’s Interim Report for the 
six months to 30 June 2022; and 

 @ the Preliminary Announcement 
and Annual Report to 31 
December 2022.

In carrying out these reviews, the 
committee:

 @ reviewed the appropriateness 
of Group accounting policies 
and monitored changes to, and 
compliance with, accounting 
standards on an ongoing basis; 

 @ discussed with management 
and the external auditor the 
critical accounting policies and 
judgements that had been 
applied; 

 @ compared the results with 
management accounts 
and budgets, and reviewed 
reconciliations between these and 
the final results; 

 @ discussed a report from the 
external auditor at that meeting 
identifying the significant 
accounting and judgemental 
issues that arose in the course of 
the audit; 

 @ considered the management 
representation letter requested by 
the external auditor for any non-
standard issues and monitored 
action taken by management as a 
result of any recommendations;

 @ discussed with management 
future accounting developments 
which are likely to affect the 
financial statements; 

 @ reviewed the budgets and 
strategic plans of the Group to 
ensure that all forward looking 
statements made within the 
Annual Report reflect the actual 
position of the Group; and 

 @ considered key areas in which 
estimates and judgement had 
been applied in preparation of the 
financial statements including, 
but not limited to, a review of fair 
values on acquisition, the carrying 
amount of goodwill, intangible 
assets and property, plant and 
equipment, litigation and warranty 
provisions, recoverability of trade 
receivables, valuation of inventory, 
hedge accounting treatments, 
treasury matters and tax matters.

The committee 
confirmed to the 
Board that the 
Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced, 
and understandable 
and provides the 
information necessary 
for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s 
position and 
performance, business 
model and strategy.

 
The primary areas of judgement 
considered by the committee in 
relation to the Group’s 2022 financial 
statements, and how they were 
addressed by the committee are set 
out overleaf. 

Each of these areas received 
particular focus from the external 
auditor, who provided detailed 
analysis and assessment of the 
matter in their report to the 
committee. 

In addition, the Internal Audit team 
reviews the businesses covered in 
its annual Internal Audit Plan, as 
agreed by the committee, and 
reports its findings to the Audit & 
Compliance Committee throughout 
the year. These internal audit reviews 
are focused on areas of judgement 
such as warranty provisions, trade 
receivables and inventory, and provide 
the committee with information on 
the adequacy and appropriateness of 
provisions in these areas.

Kingspan Group plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 113112 Directors’ Report Report of the Audit & Compliance Committee



Primary areas of 
judgement

Committee activity 

Adequacy of warranty 
provisions

The committee reviewed the judgements applied by management in assessing both specific 
and risk based warranty provisions at 31 December 2022. The committee reviewed and 
discussed with management the monthly reports presented to the Board which set out, 
for each of the Group’s divisions, warranty provisions and warranty costs and analyse these 
costs as a percentage of divisional sales. Warranty provisions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis throughout the year in conjunction with the internal audit process. The committee 
was satisfied that such judgements were appropriate and the risk had been adequately 
addressed.

Recoverability of 
trade receivables and 
adequacy of provision

The committee reviewed the judgements applied by management in determining the 
provision for expected credit loss at 31 December 2022. The committee reviewed and 
discussed with management the monthly board report which sets out aged analysis of gross 
receivables balances and associated provisions for expected credit loss and reviewed security 
(including credit insurance) that is in place. Expected credit loss provisions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis throughout the year in conjunction with the internal audit process. The 
committee was satisfied that such judgements were appropriate and the risk had been 
adequately addressed.

Accounting for 
acquisitions

Total acquisition consideration in 2022 amounted to €887.0m. The committee discussed 
with management and the external auditors the accounting treatment for newly acquired 
businesses, and the related judgements made by management, and were satisfied that the 
treatment in the Group’s financial statements was appropriate. 

Consideration of 
impairment of 
goodwill

The committee considered the annual impairment assessment of goodwill prepared by 
management for each Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) using a discounted cash flow analysis 
based on the strategic plans approved by the Board, including a sensitivity analysis on key 
assumptions. The primary judgement areas were the achievability of the long term business 
plans and the key macroeconomic and business specific assumptions. In considering 
the matter, the committee discussed with management the judgements made and the 
sensitivities performed. Further detail of the methodology is set out in Note 10 to the 
financial statements. 

EY also provided the committee with their evaluation of the impairment review process. 

Kingspan completed 6 acquisitions during the financial year. The measurement of goodwill is 
not yet finalised for all acquisitions but the methodology of the assessments of such items of 
goodwill was presented to the committee and the results were deemed appropriate.

Valuation of inventory 
and adequacy of 
inventory provision

The committee reviewed the valuation and provisioning for inventory at 31 December 2022. 
The main area of judgement was the level of provisioning required for slow moving and 
obsolete inventory. The committee reviewed and discussed with management the monthly 
board report which sets out, for each of the Group’s divisions, gross inventory balances and 
associated obsolescence provision including an analysis by inventory, category and ageing. 
Inventory provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis throughout the year in conjunction 
with the internal audit process. The committee was satisfied that such judgements were 
appropriate, and the risk had been adequately addressed.

Taxation Provisioning for potential current tax liabilities and the level of deferred tax asset recognition 
in relation to accumulated tax losses are underpinned by a range of judgements. The 
committee addresses these issues through a range of reporting from senior management 
and a process of challenging the appropriateness of management’s views including the 
degree to which these are supported by professional advice from external legal and other 
advisory firms. This assessment was conducted in line with the provisions of IFRIC 23. The 
Group’s accounting manual sets out detailed policies that prescribe the methodology to be 
used by management in calculating the above provisions. Each division formally confirms 
compliance with these policies on an annual basis. The committee was satisfied that such 
judgements were appropriate, and the risk had been adequately addressed.

 

External auditor 
The Audit & Compliance Committee 
has responsibility for overseeing the 
Group’s relationship with the external 
auditor including reviewing the audit 
team, the quality and effectiveness of 
their performance, their external audit 
plan and process, their independence 
from the Group, their appointment 
and their audit fee proposals.

Performance and audit plan 
Following the completion of 
the 2021 year end audit, the 
committee carried out a review of 
the effectiveness of the external 
auditor and the audit process. This 
review involved discussions with both 
Group management and internal 
audit, and feedback provided 
by divisional management. The 
committee continues to monitor the 
performance, independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors 
and takes this into consideration 
when making its recommendations 
to the Board on the remuneration, 
the terms of engagement and the 
re-appointment, or otherwise, of the 
external auditors. 

Prior to commencement of the 
2022 year end audit, the committee 
approved the external auditor’s 
work plan and resources and agreed 
with the auditor’s various key areas 
of focus, including accounting for 
acquisitions, warranty provisions and 
revenue recognition. 

During the year the committee met 
with the external auditor without 
management being present. This 
meeting provided the opportunity for 
direct dialogue and feedback between 
the committee and the auditor, where 
they discussed inter alia some of the 
key audit management letter points.

EU audit reform 
The regulatory framework for the 
Group’s statutory audit is governed 
by EU legislation under Directive 
2014/56/EU and Regulation EU No. 
537/2014. EU Audit reform legislation 
is applicable in the Member States of 
the European Union, including Ireland. 
Under this legislation, Kingspan Group 
plc is considered a Public Interest 
Entity (“PIE”). Key developments 
falling from the implementation of 
this legislation are:

 @ a requirement that the PIE 
changes its statutory auditor every 
ten years (following rotation, the 
statutory audit firm cannot be 
reappointed for four years); 

 @ a requirement that certain 
procedures are followed for the 
selection of the new statutory 
auditor; and 

 @ restrictions on the entitlement 
of the statutory auditing firm to 
provide certain non-audit services. 

Kingspan Group plc has fully 
complied with such EU Audit Reform. 
With regards audit firm rotation, EY, 
has been the external auditor since 
the financial year commencing 1 
January 2020.

Independence and objectivity  
The committee is responsible for 
ensuring that the external auditor is 
objective and independent. EY was 
appointed as the Group’s auditor on 1 
May 2020, following a formal tender 
process in which several leading global 
firms submitted written tenders and 
delivered in-person presentations. The 
lead audit partner is rotated every five 
years and is currently Pat O’Neill. 

The committee received confirmation 
from the external auditor that they 
are independent of the Group under 
the requirements of the IAASA Ethical 
Standard for Auditors (Ireland) 2020. 

The external auditor also confirmed 
that they were not aware of any 
relationships between the Group and 
the firm or between the firm and 
any persons in financial reporting 
oversight roles in the Group that may 
affect its independence. 

Non-audit services  
To further ensure independence, 
the committee has a policy on the 
provision of non-audit services by 
the external auditor that seeks to 
ensure that the services provided by 
the external auditor are not, or are 
not perceived to be, in conflict with 
auditor independence. By obtaining 
an account of all relationships 
between the external auditor and 
the Group, and by reviewing the 
economic importance of the Group 
to the external auditor by monitoring 
the audit fees as a percentage 
of total income generated from 
the relationship with the Group, 
the committee ensured that the 
independence of the external 
audit was not compromised. The 
committee’s policy on the provision 
of non-audit services by the Group’s 
external auditor is fully compliant with 
EU Audit Reform legislation.

An analysis of fees paid to the 
external auditor, including the  
non-audit fees, is set out in Note  
6 and below:

Internal audit & compliance 
The committee reviewed and agreed 
the annual internal audit plan, which 
the committee believes is appropriate 
to the scope and nature of the Group. 
The internal audit plan is risk based, 
with all divisions audited every year, 
and all new businesses audited within 
12 months of acquisition. 

The committee reviewed reports 
from the Head of Internal Audit 
& Compliance at its quarterly 
meetings. These reports enable the 
committee to monitor the progress 
of the internal audit plan, to discuss 
key findings and the plan to address 
them in addition to status updates of 
previous key findings. 

The committee is responsible for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and does 
so based upon discussion with 
Group management, the Group’s 
external auditor and feedback 
provided by divisional management. 
The committee was satisfied 
that the internal audit function is 
working effectively, improves risk 
management throughout the Group 
and that the internal audit function 
team is sufficiently resourced in 
addition to having the adequate level 
of experience and expertise. 

The terms of reference of the Audit 
& Compliance Committee were 
extended in December 2020 to include 
oversight of the processes around 
product certification and product 
marketing. The Head of Internal Audit 
& Compliance also reports to the 
committee in this regard.

Risk management and internal 
controls
The Audit & Compliance Committee 
has been delegated, from the Board, 
the responsibility for monitoring the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of risk management and internal 
control. The Audit & Compliance 
Committee monitors the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
processes through detailed discussions 
with management and executive 
directors, the review and approval 
of the internal audit reports, which 
focus on the areas of greatest risk 
to the Group, and the external audit 
reports, as part of both the year end 

audit and the half year review process, 
all of which highlight the key areas 
of control weakness in the Group. 
All weaknesses identified by either 
internal or external audit are discussed 
by the committee with Group 
management and an implementation 
plan for the targeted improvements 
to these systems is put in place. The 
implementation plan is overseen by 
the Group Chief Financial Officer and 
the committee is satisfied that this 
plan is being properly executed.

As part of its standing schedule of 
business, the committee carried out 
an annual risk assessment of the 
business to formally identify the key 
risks facing the Group. Full details 
of this risk assessment and the key 
risks identified are set out in the Risks 
& Risk Management section of this 
Annual Report on pages 49 - 54. 

These processes, which are used by 
the Audit & Compliance Committee 
to monitor the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of risk management 
and internal control, are in place 
throughout the accounting period 
and remain in place up to the date of 
approval of this Annual Report. 

The main features of the Group’s 
internal control and risk management 
systems that specifically relate to 
the Group’s financial reporting and 
accounts consolidation process are 
set out in the Report of the Directors 
on page 120.

Product compliance & certification 
With effect from December 2020, 
the Audit & Compliance Committee 
has responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the processes and 
controls associated with product 
compliance and monitoring the culture 
of compliance across the Group.

The Group product compliance 
framework can be split into two 
categories:

1. Compliance of products with 
product specific laws and 
regulations, testing, certification 
and accreditation; and

2. The accuracy and consistency of 
product marketing materials.

The Group Product Compliance & 
Certification Team, led by the Group 
Head of Compliance & Certification, 
is independent of divisional 
management and performs the 
following functions:

 @ Supports compliance governance 
across the Group in implementing 
policies, processes, and procedures 
to ensure continued improvement 
in management systems. This 
includes ownership of the Group 
Product Compliance Policy;

 @ Performs extensive audits of 
processes and controls associated 
with product compliance and the 
monitoring of compliance across 
the Group; and

 @ Leads the Group Compliance 
Management System (CMS) which 
has achieved the international ISO 
37301 standard.

The Audit & Compliance Committee 
meet with the Group Head of 
Compliance & Certification for 
updates on the Group’s compliance 
and certification agenda. This 
includes updates on the product 
compliance audit schedule and the 
results of completed audits as well 
as reviewing the Group Compliance 
Auditing Guidelines. The Audit & 
Compliance Committee also visit sites 
with the Group Product Compliance 
& Certification team to better 
understand the product compliance 
culture at an operational level.

The Audit & Compliance Committee 
also meet regularly with the Group 
Head of Internal Audit & Compliance 
in relation to product marketing 
compliance matters. Following the 
adoption of the Group Marketing 
Integrity Manual in September 
2021, the Group Internal Audit Plan 
includes specific audits, performed 
by appropriately trained internal 
auditors, of product marketing 
compliance with the Group Marketing 
Integrity Manual.

The Audit & Compliance Committee 
noted the following product 
compliance highlights in 2022:

 @ An additional 17 sites have been 
accredited with the leading 
international compliance 
standard, ISO 37301. This now 
brings the total number of sites 
with this accreditation to 26 with 
a plan to have 58 sites certified to 
the standard by the end of 2023.

 @ Updated Group Compliance 
Auditing Guidelines issued.

 @ 98 internal product compliance 
audits were conducted by the 
Group Product Compliance and 
Certification team.

 @ 651 external product compliance 
audits were conducted by 
independent certification bodies.

 @ 19 product marketing audits were 
performed by the Group Internal 
Audit & Compliance team.

 @ ISO 37301 education and training 
systems launched.

 @ Incorporation of newly acquired 
businesses into the Compliance 
Management System (CMS).

 @ Recruitment of additional 
compliance experts for Group 
Internal Audit and Group 
Compliance & Certification teams.

 @ Divisional Compliance Managers 
reporting to Group Compliance & 
Certification team monthly. 

 @ Product compliance registers in 
place across all divisions.

 
Whistleblowing procedures
The Group has a Code of Conduct, full 
details of which are available on the 
Group’s website (www.kingspan.com). 

Based on the standards set out 
in this Code of Conduct, the 
Group employs a comprehensive, 
confidential, and independent 
whistleblowing service to allow all 
employees to raise their concerns 
about their working environment and 
business practices. This service then 
allows management and employees 

to work together to address any 
instances of fraud, abuse, and other 
misconduct in the workplace.

Any instances of fraud, abuse 
or misconduct reported on the 
whistleblowing service are reported 
to the Head of Internal Audit & 
Compliance and the Company 
Secretary, who ensure each incident 
is appropriately investigated and 
then report to the committee details 
of the incident, key control failures, 
any financial loss and actions for 
improvement. All reports through 
the whistleblower line and all fraud 
attempts are presented at each Audit 
& Compliance Committee meeting. 

During the year, the committee 
reviewed the Group’s whistleblowing 
process and were satisfied with the 
design and operating effectiveness of 
the process.

Innovation 
At Kingspan, innovation is a core pillar 
of our strategy and we view it as a 
key strategic advantage. We believe 
building industry traditions must 
be challenged through innovation 
in advanced materials and digital 
technologies in order to achieve a net 
zero emissions future.

We have innovated a portfolio of 
advanced products and solutions for 
architects and building owners which 
enable them to construct buildings 
that consume less resources. Future 
proofing their investment, generating 
returns through enhanced internal 
space and operational performance, 
and facilitating efficient construction 
through thinner, lighter and safer to 
handle materials. Increasingly we are 
enhancing our service and solutions 
through digitisation. By surfacing 
our products digitally, we’re making 
it easier to find them, specify them, 
buy them, build with them and  
track them.

In the year ended 31 December 
2022, the Group’s research and 
development expenditure amounted 
to €60.3m (2021: €40.9m). Research

Internal control and risk 
management systems  
The Board confirms that there is 
an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing any 
significant risks faced by the Group. 
This process has been in place for 
the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the financial 
statements, and it is regularly 
reviewed by the Board in compliance 
with ‘Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting’ issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council.

The Board has delegated 
responsibility to the Audit & 
Compliance Committee to monitor 
and review the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
processes, including the financial, 
operational and compliance controls. 
This is done through detailed 
discussions with management and 
the executive directors, the review 
and approval of the internal audit 
reports, which focus on the areas of 
greatest risk to the Group, and the 
external audit reports, as part of both 
the year end audit and the half year 
process, all of which are designed 
to highlight the key areas of control 
weakness in the Group. Further 
details of the work conducted by the 
Audit & Compliance Committee in 
this regard is detailed in the Report of 
the Audit & Compliance Committee 
contained in this Annual Report.

The main features of the 
Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems that relate 
specifically to the Group’s financial 
reporting processes are:

 @ Budgets and strategic plans 
are approved annually by the 
Board and compared to actual 
performance and forecasts on a 
monthly basis;

 @ Sufficiently sized finance 
teams with appropriate level of 
experience and qualifications 
throughout the Group;

 @ Formal Group Accounting Manual 
in place which clearly sets out the 
Group financial policies in addition 
to the formal controls;

 @ Formal IT and treasury policies and 
controls in place;

 @ Centralised tax and treasury 
functions;

 @ Sales are submitted and reviewed 
on a weekly basis whilst full 
reporting packs are submitted and  
reviewed on a monthly basis; and

 @ Internal audit function review 
financial controls and report 
results/findings on a quarterly 
basis to the Audit & Compliance 
Committee.

The main features of the Group’s 
internal control and risk management 
systems that relate specifically to the 
Group’s consolidation process are:

 @ The review of reporting packages 
for each entity as part of the year 
end audit process;

 @ The reconciliation of reporting 
packages to monthly 
management packs as part of 
the audit process and as part of 
management review;

 @ The validation of consolidation 
journals as part of the 
management review process and 
as an integral component of the 
year end audit process;

 @ The review and analysis of results 
by the Chief Financial Officer and 
the internal auditors with the 
management of each division;

 @ Consideration by the Audit & 
Compliance Committee of the 
outcomes from the annual risk 
assessment of the business; and

 @ The review of internal and external 
audit management letters by 
the Chief Financial Officer, Head 
of Internal Audit & Compliance 
and the Audit & Compliance 
Committee and the follow up of 
any critical management letter 
points to ensure issues highlighted 
are addressed.

In addition, the remit of the Audit & 
Compliance Committee also includes 
reviewing the effectiveness of the 
controls and processes relating to 
product compliance by:

 @ Reviewing reports from the Group 
Head of Compliance relating to 
product compliance, certification 
and accreditation, including 
implementation status of the 
Group’s ISO 37301 Compliance 
Management Systems targets;

 @ Auditing compliance with the 
Group Marketing Integrity Manual 
incorporating the CCPI best 
practice principles; and

 @ Monitoring the culture of 
compliance across the Group.

are managed are set out in the Risk 
& Risk Management section of this 
Annual Report.

Rights and obligations attaching 
to the ordinary shares 
The Company has no securities in 
issue conferring special rights with 
regards control of the Company. 

All ordinary shares rank pari passu, 
and the rights attaching to the 
ordinary shares (including as to voting 
and transfer) are as set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association 
(“Articles”). The Articles also contain 

the rules relating to the appointment 
and removal of directors, rules relating 
to amending the Articles, the powers 
of the Company’s directors and in 
relation to issuing or buying back by 
the Company of its shares. A copy of 
the Articles may be found on www.
kingspan.com or may be obtained on 
request from the Company Secretary. 

Holders of ordinary shares are 
entitled to receive duly declared 
dividends in cash or, when offered, 
additional ordinary shares. In the 
event of any surplus arising on the 
occasion of the liquidation of the 
Company, shareholders would be 
entitled to a share in that surplus  
pro rata to their holdings of  
ordinary shares.

Holders of ordinary shares are entitled 
to receive notice of and to attend, 
speak and vote in person or by proxy, 
at general meetings having, on a 
show of hands, one vote, and, on a 
poll, one vote for each ordinary share 
held. Procedures and deadlines for 
entitlement to exercise, and exercise 
of, voting rights are specified in 
the notice convening the general 
meeting in question. There are no 
restrictions on voting rights except in 
the circumstances where a “Specified 
Event” (as defined in the Articles) 
shall have occurred and the directors 

have served a Restriction Notice on 
the shareholder. Upon the service of 
such Restriction Notice, no holder 
of the shares specified in the notice 
shall, for so long as such notice shall 
remain in force, be entitled to attend 
or vote at any general meeting, either 
personally or by proxy.

Holding and transfer of  
ordinary shares 
The ordinary shares may be held in 
either certificated or uncertificated 
form (through the Euroclear Bank 
system or (via a holding of CDIs) the 
CREST system).

Save as set out below, there is no 
requirement to obtain the approval of 
the Company, or of other shareholders, 
for a transfer of ordinary shares. The 
directors may decline to register (a) 
any transfer of a partly-paid share to a 
person of whom they do not approve, 
(b) any transfer of a share to more 
than four joint holders, (c) any transfer 
of a share on which the Company 
has a lien, and (d) any transfer of a 
certificated share unless accompanied 
by the share certificate and such other 
evidence of title as may reasonably be 
required. The registration of transfers 
of shares may be suspended at such 
times and for such periods (not 
exceeding 30 days in each year) as the 
directors may determine.

Transfer instruments for certificated 
shares are executed by or on behalf 
of the transferor and, in cases where 
the share is not fully paid, by or on 
behalf of the transferee. Transfers of 
uncertificated shares may be effected 
by means of a relevant system in the 
manner provided for in the Regulation 
(EU) No. 909/2014 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 23 
July 2014 (the “CSD Regulations”) 
and the rules of the relevant system. 
The directors may refuse to register 
a transfer of uncertificated shares 
only in such circumstances as may 
be permitted or required by the CSD 
Regulations.

Rules concerning the appointment 
and replacement of the directors 
and amendment of the  
Company’s Articles 
Unless otherwise determined by 
ordinary resolution of the Company, 
the number of directors shall not be 
less than two or more than 15. 

Subject to that limit, the shareholders 
in general meeting may appoint any 
person to be a director either to fill a 
vacancy or as an additional director. 
The directors also have the power to 
co-opt additional persons as directors, 
but any director so co-opted is under 
the Articles, required to be submitted 
to shareholders for re-election at the 
first Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)
following his or her co-option.

The Articles require that at each 
AGM of the Company one-third 
of the directors retire by rotation. 
However, in accordance with 
the recommendations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the 
directors have resolved they will all 
retire and submit themselves for re-
election by the shareholders at the 
AGM to be held on 28 April 2023.

The Company’s Articles may be 
amended by special resolution (75% 
majority of votes cast) passed at 
general meeting.

Powers of directors including 
powers in relation to issuing or 
buying back by the Company 
of its shares 
Under its Articles, the business of 
the Company shall be managed by 
the directors, who exercise all powers 

of the Company as are not, by the 
Companies Acts or the Articles, 
required to be exercised by the 
Company in general meeting. 

The directors are currently authorised 
to issue a number of shares equal to 
the authorised but as yet unissued 
share capital of the Company on such 
terms as they may consider to be in 
the best interests of the Company, 
under an authority that was conferred 
on them at the AGM held on 29 
April 2022. The directors are also 
currently authorised on the issue of 
new equity for cash to disapply the 
strict statutory pre-emption provisions 
that would otherwise apply, provided 
that the disapplication is limited to 
the allotment of equity securities in 
connection with (i) any rights issue 
or any open offer to shareholders, 
or (ii) the allotment of shares not 
exceeding in aggregate 5% of the 
nominal value of the Company’s 
issued share capital, or (iii) for the 
purpose of financing (or refinancing) 
an acquisition or other capital 
investment of a kind contemplated 
by the UK Pre-Emption Group not 
exceeding in aggregate 5% of the 
nominal value of the Company’s 
issued share capital. Both these 
authorities expire on 29 July 2023 
unless renewed and resolutions to 
that effect are being proposed at the 
AGM to be held on 28 April 2023.

The Company may, subject to the 
Companies Acts and the Articles, 
purchase any of its shares and may 
either cancel or hold in treasury 
any shares so purchased, and may 
re-issue any such treasury shares on 
such terms and conditions as may 
be determined by the directors. The 
Company shall not make market 
purchases of its own shares unless 
such purchases have been authorised 
by a special resolution passed by 
the members of the Company at a 
general meeting. At the AGM held on 
29 April 2022, shareholders passed 
a resolution giving the Company, or 
any of its subsidiaries, the authority 
to purchase up to 10% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary shares. 
At the AGM to be held on 28 April 
2023, shareholders are being asked to 
renew this authority. 

Miscellaneous 
There are no agreements between 
shareholders that are known to 
the Company which may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or voting rights.

Certain of the Group’s banking 
facilities include provisions that, in 
the event of a change of control of 
the Company, could oblige early 
prepayment of the facilities. Certain 
of the Company’s joint venture 
arrangements also contain provisions 
that would allow the counterparty 
to terminate the agreement in 
the event of a change of control 
of the Company. The Company’s 
Performance Share Plan contains 
change of control provisions which 
allow for the acceleration of the 
exercise of awards in the event of a 
change of control of the Company. 

There are no agreements between 
the Company and its directors 
or employees providing for 
compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or 
otherwise) that occurs because of a 
takeover bid.

Company at the date of this report

123Directors’ Report Report of the Directors122 Kingspan Group plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022



Financial Instruments
In the normal course of business, 
the Group has exposure to a variety 
of financial risks, including foreign 
currency risk, interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and credit risk. The 
Company’s financial risk objectives 
and policies are set out in Note 20 of 
the Financial Statements.

Political Donations
Neither the Company nor any of its 
subsidiaries have made any political 
donations in the year which would 
be required to be disclosed under the 
Electoral Act 1997 (2021: €nil).

Subsidiary Companies
Kingspan is a truly global business, 
trading in over 80 countries with 212 
manufacturing sites across the globe.

The Company’s principal subsidiaries 
and substantial undertakings at 
31 December 2022, country of 
incorporation and nature of business 
are listed on pages 193 to 194 of this 
Annual Report. 

The Company does not have any 
branches outside of Ireland. 

Significant Events Since Year End
There have been no significant events 
since the year end which would 
require adjustment to, or disclosure in 
this report.

Going Concern
The directors have reviewed budgets 
and projected cash flows for a period 
of not less than 12 months from 
the date of this Annual Report, and 
considered its net debt position and 
capital commitments, available 
committed banking facilities and 
other relevant information including 
the economic conditions currently 
affecting the building environment 
generally and the Group’s Strategic 
Plan. On the basis of this review the 
directors have concluded that there 
are no material uncertainties that 
would cast significant doubt over the 
Company’s and the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. For 
this reason, the directors consider 
it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.

Viability Statement
In accordance with Provision 31 of 
the 2018 UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the directors are required to 
assess the prospects of the Company, 
explain the period over which we 
have done so and state whether we 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet liabilities 
as they fall due over this period of 
assessment.

The directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over the 
three-year period to February 2026.

The directors concluded that three 
years was an appropriate period for 
the assessment, having had regard to:

 @ the Group’s rolling Strategic Plan 
which extends to 2026; 

 @ the Group’s long-term funding 
commitments, some of which fall 
to be repaid during the period;  

 @ the inherent short-cycle nature of 
the construction market including 
the Group’s order bank and 
project pipeline; and

 @ the potential impact of macro-
economic events and political 
uncertainty in some regions.

It is recognised that such future 
assessments are subject to a level 
of uncertainty that increases with 
time, and therefore future outcomes 
cannot be guaranteed or predicted 
with certainty.

The Group Strategic Plan is approved 
by the Board, building upon the 
several divisional management plans 
as well as the Group’s strategic 
goals. It is based on a number of 
cautious assumptions concerning 
macro growth and stability in our 
key markets, and continued access 
to capital to support the Group’s 
ongoing investments. The strategic 
plan is subject to stress testing which 
involves flexing a number of the main 
assumptions underlying the forecast 
in severe but reasonable scenarios.  
Such assumptions are rigorously 
tested by management and the 
directors. It is reviewed and updated 
annually and was considered and 
approved by the Board at its meeting 
in October 2022.

In making this assessment, the 
directors have considered the resilience 
of the Group, taking account of its 
current position and the principal 
risks facing the business as outlined in 
the Risk & Risk Management Report 
contained in this Annual Report, and 
the Group’s ability to manage those 
risks. The risks have been identified 
using a top-down and bottom-up 
approach, and their potential impact 
was assessed having regard to the 
effectiveness of controls in place to 
manage each risk. In assessing the 
prospects of the Group such potential 
impacts have been considered as have 
the mitigating factors in place.  

Based on this assessment the 
directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will  
be able to continue in operation  
and meet its liabilities as they fall  
due over the three-year period of 
their assessment.

Directors’ Responsibility Statement
Each of the directors whose names 
and functions are set out in the Board 
section of this Annual Report confirm 
their responsibility for preparing the 
Annual Report and the consolidated 
and Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable Irish law 
and regulations. 

Company law in Ireland requires 
the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the directors have to 
prepare the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union (EU). The 
directors have elected to prepare 
the Company financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and as applied by the 
Companies Act 2014. The financial 
statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities and financial 
position of the Group and Company 
as at 31 December 2022 and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing those financial 
statements, the directors are 
required to: 

 @ select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;

 @ make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;

 @ state whether applicable IFRSs 
have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial 
statements; and

 @ prepare the financial statements 
on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Company, and the Group as a 
whole, will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for 
keeping accounting records which 
disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of 
the Group and the Company and 
which enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2014 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation.

They are responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 

The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the Republic of Ireland governing 
the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.  

In accordance with Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 
2007 and the Transparency Rules of 
the Financial Regulator, the directors 
confirm that to the best of their 
knowledge: 

 @ the Group financial statements 
and the Company financial 
statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Group and 
Company; and 

 @ the Report of the Directors 
includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of 
the business and the position of 
the Group and Company, together 
with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

Kingspan is truly a 
global business, trading 
in over 80 countries 
with 212 manufacturing 
sites across the globe.

In accordance with Section 225 (2)(b) 
of the Act, the directors confirm that

the steps that they should or ought 
to have taken as a director in order 
to make himself or herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to

So far as the directors are aware, 
there is no relevant information of 
which the Group’s statutory auditor  
is unaware.  

Auditor
In accordance with Section 383(2) 
of the Companies Act 2014, the 
Company’s auditor, EY, will continue

Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the Members of Kingspan Group plc

Report on the audit of the 
financial statements

Opinion
We have audited European Single Electronic 
Format financial statements (‘the financial 
statements’) of Kingspan Group plc (‘the 
Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the 
Group’) for the year ended 31 December 
2022, which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows, the Company 
Statement of Financial Position, the 
Company Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Company Statement of Cash Flows and 
notes to the financial statements, including 
the summary of significant accounting 
policies set out in note 1. The financial 
reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is Irish law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2014.

In our opinion:

 @ the Group financial statements give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities and financial position of the 
group as at 31 December 2022 and of 
its profit for the year then ended;

 @ the Company financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities and financial position of the 
Company as at 31 December 2022;

 @ the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union;

 @ the Company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2014; and

 @ the Group financial statements and 
Company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2014 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(Ireland) (ISAs (Ireland)) and applicable 
law. Our responsibilities under those 

standards are further described in the 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group 
and Company in accordance with ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of financial statements in Ireland, including 
the Ethical Standard as applied to public 
interest entities issued by the Irish Auditing 
and Accounting Supervisory Authority 
(IAASA), and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to 
going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we 
have concluded that the Directors’ use of 
the going concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the financial statements 
is appropriate. Our evaluation of the 
Directors’ assessment of the Group and 
parent company’s ability to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting included:

 @ We confirmed our understanding 
of management’s going concern 
assessment process and also engaged 
with management early to ensure 
all key factors were considered in 
their assessment;

 @ We obtained management’s going 
concern assessment, including 
the cash forecasts and covenant 
calculations for the going concern 
period, which covers a period of at 
least 12 months from the date the 
financial statements are authorised 
for issue;

 @ We considered the appropriateness 
of the methods used to calculate 
the cash forecasts and covenant 
calculations and determined through 
inspection and testing of the 
methodology and calculations that the 
methods utilised were appropriately 
sophisticated to be able to make an 
assessment for the Group;

 @ We considered the mitigating factors 
included in the cash forecasts and 
covenant calculations that are 
within the control of the Group. This 
included our review of the Group’s 
non-operating cash outflows and 
evaluating the Group’s ability to 
control these outflows as mitigating 
actions if required. We also verified 
credit facilities available to the Group;

 @ We have performed reverse stress 
testing in order to identify what factors 
would lead to the Group utilising all 
liquidity or breaching the financial 
covenants during the going concern 
period; and

 @ We reviewed the Group’s going 
concern disclosures included in the 
annual report in order to assess that 
the disclosures were appropriate 
and in conformity with the 
reporting standards.

We have observed that the impact of 
the Covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing 
war in Ukraine has not had a detrimental 
impact on the Group which has seen 
an increase in trading profit in all of its 
five legacy operating segments during 
2022. The Group continued to generate 
significant operating cash flows of €692 
million in 2022. The Group is not expected 
to be significantly impacted by Covid-19 
or the ongoing war in Ukraine in the going 
concern assessment period. Further, the 
Group has access to significant liquidity. 
The majority of the Group’s long-term 
funding commitments (83% or €1.1 
billion) matures after February 2025. At 31 
December 2022, the Group has unrestricted 
cash and cash equivalents of €0.65 billion 
and unused committed debt facilities of up 
to €0.8 billion from a revolving bank credit 
facility expiring in May 2026.

Conclusion
Based on the work we have performed, 
we have not identified any material 
uncertainties relating to events or 
conditions that, individually or collectively, 
may cast significant doubt on the Group 
and parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern for a period of at least 
twelve months from when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.

In relation to the Group and Company’s 
reporting on how they have applied the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to the Directors’ statement 
in the financial statements about whether 
the Directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities 
of the Directors with respect to going 
concern are described in the relevant 
sections of this report. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is not 
a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.

Overview of our audit approach

Key audit matters  @ The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
 » Warranty provisions
 » Revenue recognition
 » Accounting for significant acquisitions

Audit scope  @ We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 26 components and performed audit 
procedures on specific balances for a further 35 components

 @ We performed procedures at a further 21 components that were specified by the Group audit team in 
response to specific risk factors

 @ The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 74% of the Group’s Profit 
before tax adjusted for the Non trading item, 72% of the Group’s Revenue and 81% of the Group’s Total Assets

 @ ‘Components’ represent business units across the Group considered for audit scoping purposes

Materiality  @ Overall Group materiality was assessed to be €38.2 million which represents approximately 5% of Profit before 
tax adjusted for the Non trading item.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Risk Our response to the risk Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee

Warranty provisions  
(2022: €181.5 million,  
2021: €142.7 million)

The Group’s business involves the sale of 
products under warranty, some of which use 
new technology and applications. Due to the 
nature of its product offering, the Group has 
significant exposure to warranty claims which 
are inherently uncertain in nature. Management 
are required to exercise significant judgement 
with regard to warranty provision assumptions. 
Given the level of judgement required, there is a 
significant risk that warranty provisions may be 
over or understated.

Changes in these assumptions, which may 
be subject to management override, can 
materially affect the levels of provisions recorded 
in the financial statements due to the higher 
estimation uncertainty on the Group’s costs of 
repairing and replacing, or otherwise making 
reparations for the consequences of, product 
that is ascertained to be faulty.

Refer to the Audit and Compliance Committee 
Report (page 110); the Statement of Accounting 
Policies (page 145); and note 21 of the Group 
Financial Statements (page 178).

We performed audit procedures that included 
understanding the Company’s process for 
recording and monitoring potential warranty 
claims incorporating management’s review of 
significant assumptions used in the provision 
calculation and the

recording of the resulting amounts (including 
walkthroughs of the design and implementation 
of relevant controls); consideration of the nature 
and basis of the provision; review and assessment 
of correspondence in relation to specific claims; 
progress on individual significant claims; and 
relevant settlement history of claims and 
utilisation of related provisions.

We tested the validity, completeness and accuracy 
of the data used in the calculations of product 
return rates. We evaluated and challenged the 
Group’s assumptions in relation to potential failure 
rates, considering past failure rates, the costs 
estimated for remediation, examining related 
settlements where necessary. We considered 
whether alternative rates to those employed by 
management might be more appropriate.

We substantively tested material movements in 
the provisions, including warranty provisions arising 
on acquisitions, and considered the accounting 
for movements in the provision balances and 
the related disclosures for compliance with 
IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets.

The above procedures are performed both locally 
and by the Group audit team.

Our observations included an 
outline of the range of audit 
procedures performed, the key 
judgements involved and the 
results of our testing.

We also provided our 
assessment of the level of 
subjectivity involved in warranty 
provision estimates.

Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee

Revenue recognition 
(2022: €8,340.9 million, 
2021: €6,497.0 million)

The Group has a number of revenue 
streams with different revenue 
recognition policies across its divisions.

There is a significant risk that revenue 
may be recognised in an incorrect period 
as a result of management accelerating 
revenue recognition to achieve revenue 
targets or forecasts.

Refer to the Audit and Compliance 
Committee Report (page 110); the 
Statement of Accounting Policies (page 
145); and note 2 of the Group Financial 
Statements (page 154).

We performed procedures on revenue at all relevant in-
scope components, as outlined in further detail in the 
‘Tailoring the scope’ section below.

Detailed transactional testing of revenue recognised 
throughout the year was performed, commensurate 
with the higher audit risk assigned to revenue.

Dependent on the nature of the revenue recognised 
at each component, we obtained an understanding of 
each in-scope component’s revenue recognition policy 
and how it was applied, including a walkthrough of 
the design and implementation of relevant controls; 
examined supporting documentation including 
customer contracts, statements of works or purchase 
orders, sales invoices, customer balance confirmations 
and cash receipts. In addition, we performed cut-off 
procedures, revenue journal testing and customer 
balance confirmations. In some components data 
analytics procedures were also performed.

We audited key financial statement disclosures for 
compliance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers.

Our observations included an 
overview of the risk, outline of the 
audit procedures performed, the 
judgements we focused on and the 
results of our testing.

Accounting for 
significant acquisitions

Significant acquisitions identified during 
the year relate to Troldtekt in Denmark 
(consideration of

€220.4 million), Derbigum in Belgium 
(consideration of €95.0 million) and 
Ondura Group in France (consideration of 
€515.6 million).

There is a risk of improper accounting for 
the treatment of acquired businesses, 
due to the level of estimation uncertainty 
included in management’s assessments.

Specifically, fair value adjustments 
to property, plant and equipment 
(PP&E) and the need for complex and 
judgemental valuation techniques 
to be utilised, the recognition and 
valuation of fair value adjustments 
to provisions recorded in the opening 
balance sheets, require significant 
estimates and judgements to be made 
by management.

Refer to the Audit and Compliance 
Committee Report (page 110); the 
Statement of Accounting Policies (page 
145); and note 23 of the Group Financial 
Statements (page 179).

We obtained an understanding of the Group’s 
process for accounting for acquisitions, including a 
walkthrough of the design and implementation of 
relevant controls.

We completed detailed procedures on the opening 
balance sheets, purchase price allocations and fair 
value adjustments. We reviewed key agreements 
including the share purchase agreements for 
each acquisition to understand the key terms and 
conditions. We identified the key assumptions and 
judgements made by management and challenged 
the appropriateness thereof by reference to external 
information, where available.

In respect of the recognition and valuation of the 
fair value adjustments to PP&E and provisions, we 
examined how the Group identified all material 
adjustments, obtained related evidence and examined 
the key assumptions and calculations used to 
ensure they were recorded in accordance with IFRS 3 
Business Combinations.

We also performed an evaluation of any experts 
engaged by management and sought assistance 
from our own specialists where necessary. Whilst our 
procedures were principally focused on recognition 
and valuation, we also assessed the completeness of 
recorded provisions.

We also considered the adequacy of the 
related disclosures.

Our procedures were focused 
on Troldtekt and Derbigum with 
limited work on Ondura given the 
timing of this acquisition.

Our observations included an 
outline of the range of audit 
procedures performed, and the 
results of our related testing, 
including the fact that the 
purchase price allocations 
for all three acquisitions were 
preliminary to the extent disclosed 
in the related financial statements 
footnote, that the provisional 
fair value adjustments made in 
the preliminary allocations did 
not result in material fair value 
adjustments, subject to the 
necessary finalisation of the fair 
value reviews and purchase price 
allocations. Our planned audit 
procedures in respect of significant 
acquisitions were completed 
without exception.

Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality 
in planning and performing the audit, 
in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and in forming 
our audit opinion.

Materiality
Materiality is the magnitude of an omission 
or misstatement that, individually or 
in the aggregate, could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial 
statements. Materiality provides a basis for 
determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures.

We determined materiality for the Group 
to be €38.2 million (2021: €34.5 million), 
which is approximately 5% of Group’s 
Profit before tax adjusted for the Non 
trading item. Profit before tax is a key 
performance indicator for the Group and 
is also a key metric used by the Group in 
the assessment of the performance of 
management. We therefore considered 
the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted 
for the Non trading item to be the most 
appropriate performance metric on which 
to base our materiality calculation as 
we consider it to be the most relevant 
performance measure to the stakeholders 
of the Group.

@ Group's Pro�t before tax adjusted for the Non trading item - €763.1m
@ Materiality of €38.2m (5% of materiality basis)

Starting Basis

Adjustments

Materiality

@ Group's Pro�t before tax - €746.6m

@ Non-trading item - loss of €16.5m

We determined materiality for the 
Company to be €13.5 million (2021: €14.1 
million), which is approximately 1% of 
total equity.

During the course of our audit, we 
reassessed initial materiality and 
considered that no further changes to 
materiality were necessary.

Performance materiality
Performance materiality is the application 
of materiality at the individual account 
or balance level. It is set at an amount 
to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate 
of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, 
together with our assessment of the 
Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement was that performance 
materiality should be set at 50% (2021: 
50%) of our planning materiality, namely 
€19.1 million (2021: €17.25 million). We 
have set performance materiality at this 
percentage based on our assessment of 
the risk of misstatements, both corrected 
and uncorrected.

Audit work at component locations for the 
purpose of obtaining audit coverage over 
significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total 
performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is 
based on the relative scale and risk of the 
component to the Group as a whole and 
our assessment of the risk of misstatement 
at that component.

In the current year, the range of 
performance materiality allocated 
to components was €3.5 million to 
€5.25 million (2021: €3.0 million to 
€5.625 million).

Reporting threshold
Reporting threshold is an amount below 
which identified misstatements are 
considered as being clearly trivial. We 
agreed with the Audit Committee that we 
would report to them all uncorrected audit 
differences in excess of €1.91 million, which 
is set at approximately 5% of planning 
materiality, as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.

We evaluate any uncorrected 
misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality 
discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in 
forming our opinion.

An overview of the scope of our 
audit report

Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our 
evaluation of materiality and our allocation 
of performance materiality determine 
our audit scope for each entity within the 
Group. Taken together, this enables us 
to form an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements.

In determining those components in 
the Group at which we perform audit 
procedures, we utilised size and risk criteria 
in accordance with ISAs (Ireland).

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the Members of Kingspan Group plc (continued)

In assessing the risk of material 
misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had 
adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial 
statements, we selected 93 components 
covering entities across Europe, the 
Americas, the Middle East and Australia, 
which represent the principal business units 
within the Group.

Of the 93 components selected, we 
performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of 26 components 
(‘full scope components’) which were 
selected based on their size or risk 
characteristics. For the remaining 
35 components (‘specific scope 
components’), we performed audit 
procedures on specific accounts within 
that component that we considered had 
the potential for the greatest impact on 
the significant accounts in the financial 
statements either because of the size of 
these accounts or their risk profile.

In addition to the 61 components 
discussed above, we selected a further 
21 components where we performed 
procedures at the component level that 
were specified by the Group audit team 
in response to specific risk factors. Also, 
we performed review procedures at an 
additional 11 components.

The reporting components where we 
performed either full or specific scope 
audit procedures accounted for 74% of 
the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted 
for the Non trading item, 72% of the 
Group’s Revenue and 81% of the Group’s 
Total Assets.

The full scope components contributed 
45% of the Group’s Profit before tax 
adjusted for the Non trading item, 48% 
of the Group’s Revenue and 62% of 
the Group’s Total Assets. The specific 
scope components contributed 29% of 
the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted 
for the Non trading item, 24% of the 
Group’s Revenue and 19% of the Group’s 
Total Assets.

The components where we either 
performed procedures that were specified 
by the Group audit team in response 
to specific risk factors or review scope 
procedures contributed 7% and 2% 
respectively of the Group’s Profit before 
tax adjusted for the Non trading item 
from continuing operations, 1% and 5% 
respectively of the Group’s Revenue and 
0% and 2% respectively of the Group’s 
Total Assets. The audit scope of these 
components may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the 
component but will have contributed to 
the coverage of significant accounts tested 
for the Group.

Of the remaining components, which 
together represent 17% of the Group’s 
Profit before tax adjusted for the Non 
trading item, none is individually greater 
than 1% of the Group’s Profit before tax 
adjusted for the Non trading item. For 
these components, we performed other 
procedures, including analytical review, 
confirmation of cash balances, testing of 
consolidation journals and intercompany 
eliminations and foreign currency 
translation recalculations to respond to any 
potential risks of material misstatement to 
the Group financial statements.

The charts below illustrate the 
coverage obtained from the work 
performed by our audit teams based on 
continuing operations.

Involvement with component teams
In establishing our overall approach to 
the Group audit, we determined the type 
of work that needed to be undertaken 
at each of the components by us, as the 
Group audit engagement team, or by 
component auditors from other EY global 
network firms or non-EY firms operating 
under our instruction. Of the 26 full scope 
components, audit procedures were 
performed on 4 of these directly by senior 
members of the Group audit team and 
on 22 by component audit teams. For the 
specific scope components, where the work 
was performed by component auditors, 
we determined the appropriate level of 
involvement to enable us to determine 
that sufficient audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
Group as a whole.

We issued detailed instructions to each 
component auditor in scope for the Group 
audit, with specific audit requirements 
and requests across key areas. The Group 
audit team have completed a programme 
of planned visits designed to ensure that 
senior members of the Group audit team, 
including the Audit Engagement Partner, 
visit a number of overseas locations. 
During the current year’s audit cycle, 
visits were undertaken by the primary 
audit team to component teams in 
the Netherlands, UK, Denmark, Germany, 
France. The Group audit team performed 
virtual visits in respect of our other key 
component teams in Poland and the UAE. 
These visits involved discussing the audit 
approach and any issues arising with the 
component team and holding discussions 
with local management and attending 
closing meetings.

The primary team interacted regularly with 
the component teams where appropriate 
during various stages of the audit, reviewed 
key working papers and were responsible 
for the scope and direction of the audit 
process. This, together with the additional 
procedures performed at Group level, gave 
us appropriate evidence for our opinion on 
the Group financial statements.

Other information
The Directors are responsible for the 
other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the 
Annual Report other than the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, 
we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the 
financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. If we identify 
such material inconsistencies or apparent 
material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements 
or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report 
that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

In this context, we also have nothing to 
report in regard to our responsibility to 
specifically address the following items 
in the other information and to report as 
uncorrected material misstatements of the 
other information where we conclude that 
those items meet the following conditions:

 @ Fair, balanced and understandable 
(set out on pages 125 and 126) – the 
statement given by the Directors that 
they consider the Annual Report and 
financial statements taken as a whole 
is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s and the parent company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy, is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge obtained in the audit; or

 @ Audit Committee reporting (set out 
on pages 110 to 117) – the section 
describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us 
to the Audit Committee or is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or

 @ Directors’ statement of compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(set out on page 80) – the parts of the 
Directors’ statement required under the 
Listing Rules relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions 
specified for review by the auditor in 
accordance with the Listing Rules of 
Euronext Dublin and the UK Listing 
Authority do not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Opinions on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2014
Based solely on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, we report that:

 @ in our opinion, the information given 
in the Directors’ Report, other than 
those parts dealing with the non- 
financial statement pursuant to the 
requirements of S.I. No. 360/2017 on 
which we are not required to report in 
the current year, is consistent with the 
financial statements; and

 @ in our opinion, the Directors’ Report, 
other than those parts dealing with the 
non-financial statement pursuant to 
the requirements of S.I. No. 360/2017 
on which we are not required to report 
in the current year, has been prepared 
in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2014.

We have obtained all the information and 
explanations which, to the best of our 
knowledge and belief, are necessary for the 
purposes of our audit.

In our opinion the accounting records of 
the Company were sufficient to permit 
the financial statements to be readily 
and properly audited and the Company 
Statement of Financial Position is in 
agreement with the accounting records.

Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
Based on the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and its 
environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material 
misstatements in the Directors’ Report.

The Companies Act 2014 requires us 
to report to you if, in our opinion, the 
disclosures required by sections 305 to 312 
of the Act, which relate to disclosures of 
Directors’ remuneration and transactions, 
are not complied with by the Company. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.

We have nothing to report in respect 
of section 13 of the European Union 
(Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity 
Information by certain large undertakings 
and groups) Regulations 2017, which 
require us to report to you if, in our opinion, 
the Company has not provided in the 
non-financial statement the information 
required by Section 5(2) to (7) of those 
Regulations, in respect of year ended 31 
December 2021.

The Companies Act 2014 also requires 
us to report to you if, in our opinion, the 
Company has not provided the information 
required by Section 1110N in relation to its 
remuneration report for the financial year 
31 December 2021. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.

The Listing Rules of the Irish Stock 
Exchange require us to review:

 @ the Directors’ statement, set out on 
pages 124 and 125, in relation to going 
concern and longer-term viability

 @ the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement on page 80 relating to 
the Company’s compliance with 
the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the Irish 
Corporate Governance Annex specified 
for our review

 @ certain elements of disclosures in the 
report to shareholders by the Board on 
Directors’ remuneration

Respective responsibilities

Responsibilities of Directors for the 
financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibility Statement set out on pages 
125 and 126, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the 
applicable financial reporting framework 
that they give a true and fair view, and for 
such internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Group or the 
parent company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.

Explanation to what extent the audit 
was considered capable detecting 
irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are 
instances of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations. We design procedures 
in line with our responsibilities, outlined 
above, to detect irregularities, including 
fraud, that could reasonably be expected 
to have a material effect on the financial 
statements. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement due to fraud is 
higher than the risk of not detecting one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
deliberate concealment by, for example, 
forgery or intentional misrepresentations, 
or through collusion. In addition, the 
further removed any non-compliance 
is from the events and transactions 
reflected in the financial statements, the 
less likely it is that our procedures will 
identify such non-compliance. The extent 
to which our procedures are capable of 
detecting irregularities, including fraud 
is detailed below. However, the primary 
responsibility for the prevention and 
detection of fraud rests with both those 
charged with governance of the Company 
and management.

Our approach was as follows:

 @ We obtained an understanding of 
the legal and regulatory frameworks 
that are applicable to the Group 
across the various jurisdictions 
globally in which the Group operates. 
We determined that the most 
significant are those that relate to 
the form and content of external 
financial and corporate governance 
reporting including company law, 
tax legislation, employment law and 
regulatory compliance

 @ We understood how Kingspan Group 
plc is complying with those frameworks 
by making enquiries of management, 
internal audit, those responsible for 
legal and compliance procedures 
and the Company Secretary. We 
corroborated our enquiries through 
our review of the Group’s Compliance 
Policies, board minutes, papers 
provided to the Audit Committee 
and correspondence received from 
regulatory bodies

 @ We assessed the susceptibility of 
the Group’s financial statements to 
material misstatement, including 
how fraud might occur, by meeting 
with management, including within 
various parts of the business, to 
understand where they considered 
there was susceptibility to fraud. We 
also considered performance targets 
and the potential for management to 
influence earnings or the perceptions 
of analysts. Where this risk was 
considered to be higher, we performed 
audit procedures to address each 
identified fraud risk. These procedures 
included testing manual journals and 
were designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial 
statements were free from fraud 
or error

 @ Based on this understanding we 
designed our audit procedures to 
identify non-compliance with such 
laws and regulations. Our procedures 
included a review of board minutes 
to identify any non-compliance with 
laws and regulations, a review of the 
reporting to the Audit Committee on 
compliance with regulations, enquiries 
of internal and external legal counsel 
and management

A further description of our responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements is 
located on the IAASA’s website at: http://
www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6-
458b-9b8f- a98202dc9c3a/Description_
of_auditors_responsibilities_for_audit.
pdf This description forms part of our 
auditor’s report.

Other matters which we are 
required to address
We were appointed by the Board of 
Directors following the AGM held on 1 May 
2020 to audit the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2020 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period of 
total uninterrupted engagement including 
previous renewals and reappointments of 
the firm is three years.

The non-audit services prohibited by 
IAASA’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or Company and we remain 
independent of the Group and Company in 
conducting our audit.

Our audit opinion is consistent with the 
additional report to the Audit Committee.

The purpose of our audit work and 
to whom we owe our responsibilities
Our report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
section 391 of the Companies Act 2014. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s 
members, as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.

1 Statement of Accounting Policies

General information
Kingspan Group plc is a public limited 
company registered and domiciled in 
Ireland. Its registered number is 70576 and 
the address of its registered office is Dublin 
Road, Kingscourt, Co Cavan.

The Group’s principal activities comprise 
the manufacture of insulated panels, rigid 
insulation boards, technical insulation, 
architectural facades, roofing and 
waterproofing solutions, data and flooring 
technology, daylighting and ventilation 
systems and water and energy solutions.
The Group’s Principal Subsidiaries and 
Substantial Undertakings are set out on 
page 193 to 194.

Statement of compliance
The consolidated and Company financial 
statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and their 
interpretations issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as 
adopted by the EU and those parts of 
the Companies Acts 2014, applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation.

The Company has availed of the exemption 
in Section 304 of the Companies Act 2014 
and has not presented the Company 
Income Statement, which forms part of 
the Company’s financial statements, to its 
members and the Registrar of Companies.

Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis, 
under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by:

 @ measurement at fair value of share 
based payments at initial date 
of award;

 @ certain financial assets (including 
derivative financial instruments) and 
deferred contingent consideration 
recognised and measured at fair value; 
and

 @ recognition of the defined benefit 
liability as plan assets less the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation.

The accounting policies set out below 
have been applied consistently to all years 
presented in these financial statements, 
unless otherwise stated.

These consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared in Euro. The Euro is the 
presentation currency of the Group and the 
functional and presentation currency of 
the Company.

The Group uses a number of Alternative 
Performance Measures (APMs) throughout 
these financial statements to give 
assistance to investors in evaluating the 
performance of the underlying business 
and to give a better understanding of 
how management review and monitor the 
business on an ongoing basis. These APMs 
have been defined and explained in more 
detail on page 190 to 192.

Basis of consolidation
The Group consolidated financial 
statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and its 
subsidiary undertakings.

Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the 
Group. The Group controls an entity when it 
is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are included in the Group 
financial statements from the date on 
which control over the entity is obtained 
and cease to be consolidated from the 
date on which control is transferred out of 
the Group.

Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup transactions and balances, 
and any unrealised gains arising from such 
transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the 
same manner as unrealised gains, but only 
to the extent that there is no evidence 
of impairment.

Segment reporting
The Group’s accounting policy for 
identifying segments is based on internal 
management reporting information that 
is routinely reviewed by the Board of 
Directors, which is the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (CODM) for the Group.

The measurement policies used for the 
segment reporting under IFRS 8 Operating 
Segments are the same as those used in 
the consolidated financial statements. 
Segment results that are reported to the 
CODM include items directly attributable 
to a segment as well as those that can 
be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Unallocated items comprise mainly 
corporate assets, finance income and 
expenses and tax assets and liabilities.

The Group has determined that it has six 
operating segments: Insulated Panels, 
Insulation, Water + Energy, Data + Flooring, 
Light + Air and Roofing + Waterproofing.

Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue exclusive 
of sales tax and trade discounts which 
would occur over time or at a point in 
time. The Group uses the five-step model 
as prescribed under IFRS 15 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers on the Group’s 
revenue transactions. This includes the 
identification of the contract, identification 
of the performance obligations under 
same, determination of the transaction 
price, allocation of the transaction price to 
performance obligations and recognition of 
revenue. Typically, individual performance 
obligations are specifically called out in 
the contract which allows for accurate 
recognition of revenue as and when 
performances are fulfilled.

The Group has generally concluded 
that it is the principal in its revenue 
arrangements, because it typically controls 
the goods or services before transferring 
them to the customers.

1 Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)
The Group has identified a number 
of revenue streams where revenue is 
recognised at a point in time and/or over 
time. These are detailed below:

Supply only contracts
The point of recognition arises when the 
Group satisfies a performance obligation by 
transferring control of a promised good or 
service to the customer, which could occur 
over time or at a point in time. Revenue 
is recognised at the time of delivery at 
the delivery address (where Kingspan 
is to deliver the goods to the delivery 
address) or at Kingspan’s works (where the 
customer is to collect the goods) or, if the 
customer wrongfully fails to take delivery 
of the goods, the time when Kingspan has 
tendered delivery of the goods. Invoicing 
occurs at the point of final delivery of 
the product or performance obligation, 
at which point a right is established for 
unconditional consideration as control 
passes to the customer. Typically, payment 
terms are 30 days from the end of the 
month in which the invoice is raised.

Supply and install projects
If a contract requires the Group to install 
or commission a product and the product 
can be separated or sold separately from 
the installation service and the contract 
specifically separates the performance 
obligations then the product only supply 
element is recognised in line with the 
criteria set out in the supply only policy. The 
installation element is recognised over time 
in line with the milestones set out in the 
contract. If there is significant integration 
provided for in the contract then a single 
purchase order is identified and the 
revenue is recognised over time.

Service and maintenance
Where the Group provides a post-sale 
Service and Maintenance offering the 
revenue associated with this separately 
identifiable performance obligation is 
initially recognised in deferred income. The 
revenue is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement as each site visit occurs.

Research and Development
Expenditure on research and development 
is recognised as an expense in the period in 
which it is incurred. An asset is recognised 
only when all the conditions set out in IAS 
38 Intangible Assets are met.

Non trading items
Non trading items refer to certain 
items, which by virtue of their nature 

and amount, are disclosed separately 
in order for the user to obtain a proper 
understanding of the financial information.  
Non-trading items include gains or 
losses on the disposal or acquisition 
of businesses and material related 
acquisition and integration costs, and 
material impairments to the carrying 
value of intangible assets or property, 
plant and equipment. It is determined by 
management that each of these items 
relate to events or circumstances that are 
non-recurring in nature.

Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for 
using the acquisition method as at the 
date of acquisition.

In accordance with IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations, the fair value of 
consideration paid for a business 
combination is measured as the aggregate 
of the fair values at the date of exchange 
of assets given and liabilities incurred or 
assumed in exchange for control. The 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the acquired entity are measured at 
fair value as at the acquisition date. 
When the initial accounting for a business 
combination is determined, it is done so on 
a provisional basis with any adjustments 
to these provisional values made within 
12 months of the acquisition date and are 
effective as at the acquisition date.

To the extent that deferred consideration 
is payable as part of the acquisition cost 
and is payable after one year from the 
acquisition date, the deferred consideration 
is discounted at an appropriate interest 
rate and, accordingly, carried at net 
present value (amortised cost) in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position. The discount component is then 
unwound as an interest charge in the 
Consolidated Income Statement over the 
life of the obligation.

Where a business combination agreement 
provides for an adjustment to the cost 
of a business acquired contingent on 
future events, other than put options held 
by non-controlling interests, the Group 
accrues the fair value of the additional 
consideration payable as a liability at 
acquisition date. This amount is reassessed 
at each subsequent reporting date 
with any adjustments recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.

If the business combination is achieved 
in stages, the fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in 

the acquiree is re-measured at the 
acquisition date through the Consolidated 
Income Statement or the Consolidated 
Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income.

For each business combination, the Group 
elects whether to measure the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree at fair 
value or at the proportionate share of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Transaction costs are expensed to the 
Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.

Put options held by non-controlling 
interest shares
Any contingent consideration is measured 
at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
Where a put option is held by a non-
controlling interest (“NCI”) in a subsidiary 
undertaking, whereby that party can 
require the Group to acquire the NCI’s 
shareholding in the subsidiary at a future 
date, but the NCI retains present access 
to the results of the subsidiary, the Group 
applies the present access method of 
accounting to this arrangement. The Group 
recognises a contingent consideration 
liability at fair value, being the Group’s 
estimate of the amount required to settle 
that liability and a corresponding reserve 
in equity. Any subsequent remeasurements 
required due to changes in fair value of the 
put liability estimation are recognised in 
the Put Option Liability Reserve in equity.

Goodwill
Goodwill arises on business combinations 
and represents the difference between 
the fair value of the consideration and 
the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets of a subsidiary at the 
date of acquisition.

The Group measures goodwill at the 
acquisition date as:

 @ the fair value of the consideration 
transferred; plus

 @ the recognised amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree; 
plus

 @ if the business combination is achieved in 
stages, the fair value of the pre-existing 
equity interest in the acquiree; less

 @ the net recognised amount (generally 
fair value) of the identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed.

Following initial recognition, goodwill is 
measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For The Year Ended 31 December 2022

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For The Year Ended 31 December 2022

1 Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value.

Cost is based on the first-in, first-out 
principle and includes all expenditure 
incurred in acquiring the inventories and 
bringing them to their present location 
and condition.

 @ Raw materials are valued at 
the purchase price including 
transport, handling costs and net of 
trade discounts.

 @ Work in progress and finished goods 
are carried at cost consisting of direct 
materials, direct labour and directly 
attributable production overheads and 
other costs incurred in bringing them 
to their existing location and condition.

Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price less costs to 
completion and appropriate marketing, 
selling and distribution costs.

A provision is made, where necessary, in all 
inventory categories for obsolete, slow-
moving and defective items.

Income tax
Income tax in the Consolidated Income 
Statement represents the sum of current 
income tax and deferred tax not recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity.

Current tax
Current tax represents the expected tax 
payable or recoverable on the taxable 
profit for the year using tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted, or substantively 
enacted, at the reporting date and taking 
into account any adjustments from 
prior years. Liabilities for uncertain tax 
treatments are recognised in accordance 
with IFRIC 23 Uncertainty Over Income Tax 
Treatments and are measured using either 
the most likely amount method or the 
expected value method – whichever better 
predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.

Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is provided using liability 
method on temporary differences at the 
reporting date. Temporary differences are 
defined as the difference between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated 
financial statements. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are not subject to discounting 
and are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period in which 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled 
based on tax rates and tax laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date.

The Group offsets deferred tax assets 
and deferred tax liabilities only if it has a 
legally enforceable right to set off current 
tax assets and current tax liabilities and 
the deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority on either the 
same taxable entity or different taxable 
entities which intend either to settle 
current tax liabilities and assets on a net 
basis, or to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously, in each 
future period in which significant amounts 
of deferred tax liabilities or assets are 
expected to be settled or recovered.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences (i.e. 
differences that will result in taxable 
amounts in future periods when the 
carrying amount of the asset or liability is 
recovered or settled).

Deferred tax assets are recognised in 
respect of all deductible temporary 
differences (i.e. differences that give 
rise to amounts which are deductible 
in determining taxable profits in future 
periods when the carrying amount of the 
asset or liability is recovered or settled), 
carry-forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which to offset 
these items.

The carrying amounts of deferred tax 
assets are subject to review at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent 
that future taxable profits are considered 
to be inadequate to allow all or part of any 
deferred tax asset to be utilised.

Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are recognised as a component of tax 
income or expense in profit or loss, 
except where they relate to items that 
are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case 
the related deferred tax is also recognised 
in other comprehensive income or equity, 
respectively.

Grants
Grants are initially recognised as deferred 
income at their fair value when there is a 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be 
received, and all relevant conditions have 
been complied with.

Capital grants received and receivable in 
respect of property, plant and equipment 
are treated as a reduction in the cost of 
that asset and thereby amortised to the 
Consolidated Income Statement in line with 
the underlying asset.

Revenue grants are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement to offset 
the related expenditure.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries held by the 
Parent Company are carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is provided on a straight line 
basis at the rates stated below, which are 
estimated to reduce each item of property, 
plant and equipment to its residual value 
by the end of its useful life:

Freehold buildings 2% - 2.5% on cost

Plant and machinery 4% to 20% on cost

Fixtures and fittings 10% to 20% on cost

Computer equipment 12.5% to 33% on cost

Motor vehicles 10% to 25% on cost

Freehold land is stated at cost and is not depreciated.

1 Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill 
acquired is allocated to each of the cash 
generating units expected to benefit from 
the combination’s synergies. The cash 
generating units represent the lowest 
level within the Group which generate 
largely independent cash inflows and 
these units are not larger than the 
operating segments (before aggregation) 
determined in accordance with IFRS 8 
Operating Segments.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the 
same level as the goodwill is monitored 
by management for internal reporting 
purposes, which is at the individual cash 
generating unit level.

Goodwill is subject to impairment testing 
on an annual basis and at any time during 
the year if an indicator of impairment is 
considered to exist. The goodwill impairment 
tests are undertaken at a consistent time 
each year. Impairment is determined by 
assessing the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit to which the goodwill 
relates. Where the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount, an impairment loss is 
recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Impairment losses arising 
in respect of goodwill are not reversed 
following recognition.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the 
attributable amount of goodwill, not 
previously written off, is included in the 
calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.

Intangible Assets 
(other than goodwill)
Intangible assets separately acquired 
are capitalised at cost. Intangible assets 
acquired as part of a business combination 
are capitalised at fair value as at the date 
of acquisition.

Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets, which have finite useful lives, 
are carried at cost or initial fair value 
less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses.

The amortisation of intangible assets is 
calculated to write off the book value of 
intangible assets over their useful lives on 
a straight-line basis on the assumption of 
zero residual value. Amortisation charged 
on these assets is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.

The carrying amount of intangible assets 
is reviewed for indicators of impairment 
at each reporting date and is subject 
to impairment testing when events or 
changes of circumstances indicate that the 
carrying values may not be recoverable.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Customer relationships 2 - 6 years

Trademarks & Brands 2 - 12 years

Patents 8 years

Technological know how  
and order backlogs

1 - 10 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and 
residual values are reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted as necessary.

Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency
The individual financial statements of 
each Group company are measured 
and presented in the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which 
the company operates, the functional 
currency. The Group financial statements 
are presented in Euro, which is the 
Company’s functional currency.

Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rates at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated to the functional currency 
at the exchange rates at the reporting 
date. All currency translation differences 
on monetary assets and liabilities are 
taken to the Consolidated Income 
Statement, except when deferred in equity 
as qualifying net investment hedges, 
which are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on the acquisition of a foreign entity 
are initially translated at the exchange 
rate at the date of acquisition and then 
subsequently these assets and liabilities are 
treated as part of a foreign entity and are 
translated at the closing rate.

Exchange rates of material currencies used were as follows:

Average rate Closing rate
Euro = 2022 2021 2022 2021

Pound Sterling 0.853 0.860 0.886 0.838
US Dollar 1.054 1.183 1.067 1.133
Canadian Dollar 1.370 1.483 1.444 1.442
Australian Dollar 1.517 1.575 1.569 1.558
Czech Koruna 24.562 25.642 24.143 24.851
Polish Zloty 4.685 4.565 4.680 4.588
Hungarian Forint 391.09 358.52 400.190 368.89
Brazilian Real 5.442 6.381 5.632 6.309

Foreign operations
The Income Statement, Statement of 
Financial Position and Cash Flow Statement 
of Group companies that have a functional 
currency different from that of the 
Company are translated as follows:

 @ Assets and liabilities at each reporting 
date are translated at the closing rate 
at that reporting date.

 @ Results and cash flows are translated 
at actual exchange rates for the year, 
or an average rate where this is a 
reasonable approximation.

All resulting exchange differences 
are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
accumulated as a separate component of 
equity, the Translation Reserve.

On disposal of a foreign operation, any 
such cumulative retranslation differences, 
previously recognised in equity, are 
reclassified to the Consolidated Income 
Statement as part of gain or loss 
on disposal.



Kingspan Group plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 Financial Statements 151150

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For The Year Ended 31 December 2022

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For The Year Ended 31 December 2022

1 Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)
The estimated useful lives and residual 
values of property, plant and equipment 
are determined by management at 
the time the assets are acquired and 
subsequently, re-assessed at each 
reporting date. These lives are based on 
historical experience with similar assets 
across the Group.

In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of 
Assets, the carrying values of property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed at 
each reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. 
An impairment loss is recognised 
whenever the carrying value of an asset 
or its cash generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount.

Impairment losses are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. Following 
the recognition of an impairment loss, 
the depreciation charge applicable to the 
asset or cash-generating unit is adjusted to 
allocate the revised carrying amount, net 
of any residual value, over the remaining 
useful life.

Assets under construction are carried at 
cost less any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation of these assets commences 
when the assets are ready for their 
intended use.

Leases
The Group recognises right of use assets 
representing its right to use the underlying 
assets and lease liabilities representing its 
obligation to make lease payments at the 
lease commencement date. The right of 
use assets are initially measured at cost, 
and subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. The cost of the right of use asset 
consists of the initial measurement 
of the lease liability, any initial direct 
costs incurred in entering into the lease, 
restoration costs and any payments made 
on or before the lease commencement 
date, net any lease incentives received.

Depreciation is provided on a straight line 
basis over the period of the lease, or useful 
life if shorter.

Lease liabilities are measured at the 
present value of the future lease payments, 
discounted at the Group’s incremental 
borrowing rate. Subsequent to the initial 
measurement, the lease liabilities are 
increased by the interest cost and reduced 
by lease payments made.

The right of use assets and lease liabilities 
are remeasured when there are changes in 
the assessment of whether an extension 
option is reasonably certain to be exercised 
or a termination option is reasonably 
certain not to be exercised or where there 
is a change in future lease payments as 
a result of a change in an index or rate. 
The Group applies judgement when 
determining the lease term where renewal 
and termination options are contained in 
the lease contract.

The Group applies the short-term lease 
recognition exemption to leases that 
have a lease term of 12 months or less 
from the commencement date. The 
Group also applies the lease of low-value 
assets recognition exemption to leases 
of equipment that are considered to be 
low value. Lease payments on short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets are 
recognised as an expense on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.

Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates defined contribution 
and defined benefit pensions schemes.

Defined contribution pension schemes
The costs arising on the Group’s defined 
contribution schemes are recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement in 
the period in which the related service 
is provided. The Group has no legal or 
constructive obligation to pay further 
contributions in the event that these plans 
do not hold sufficient assets to provide 
retirement benefits.

Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group’s net obligation in respect 
of defined benefit plans is calculated 
separately for each plan by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in 
the current and prior periods, discounting 
that amount and deducting the fair value 
of any plan assets.

The calculation is performed annually by 
a qualified actuary using the projected 
unit credit method. When the calculation 
results in a benefit to the Group, the 
recognised asset is limited to the total of 
any unrecognised past service costs and 
the present value of economic benefits 
available in the form of any future refunds 
from the plan or reductions in future 
contributions to the plan.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit 
liability or asset, which comprise actuarial 
gains and losses, the return on plan assets 
(excluding interest) and the effect of the 
asset ceiling, are recognised immediately in 
other comprehensive income.

The Group determines the net interest 
expense on the net defined benefit liability 
or asset by applying the discount rate 
used to measure the defined benefit 
obligation at the beginning of the annual 
period to the then net defined benefit 
liability or asset, taking into account any 
changes in the net defined benefit liability 
or asset during the period as a result of 
contributions and benefit payments. Net 
interest expense and other expenses related 
to defined benefit plans are recognised in 
profit or loss.

When the benefits of a plan are changed 
or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting 
change in benefit that relates to past 
service or the gain or loss on curtailment 
is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
The Group recognises gains and losses on 
the settlement of a defined benefit plan 
when the settlement occurs.

Provisions
A provision is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position when the Group has a present 
constructive or legal obligation as a result 
of a past event and it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefit will be required 
to settle the obligation and the amount of 
the obligation can be estimated reliably.

A specific provision is created when a 
claim has actually been made against the 
Group or where there is a known issue at a 
known customer’s site, both relating to a 
product or service supplied in the past. In 
addition, a risk-based provision is created 
where future claims are considered incurred 
but not reported. The warranty provision 
is based on historical warranty data and a 
weighting of all possible outcomes against 
their associated probabilities.

Specific provisions will generally be aged as 
a current liability, reflecting the assessment 
that a current liability exists to replace or 
repair product sold on foot of an accepted 
valid warranty issue. Only where the liability 
is reasonably certain not to be settled 
within the next 12 months, will a specific 
provision be categorised as a long-term 
obligation. Risk-based provisions will 
generally be aged as a non-current liability, 
reflecting the fact that no warranty claim 
has yet been made by the customer.

1 Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)
Provisions which are not expected to 
give rise to a cash outflow within 12 
months of the reporting date are, where 
material, determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows. The unwinding 
of the discount is recognised as a 
finance expense.

Dividends
Final dividends on ordinary shares are 
recognised as a liability in the financial 
statements only after they have been 
approved at the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company. Interim dividends on 
ordinary shares are recognised when they 
are paid.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents principally 
comprise cash at bank and in hand and 
short term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.

Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, principally 
interest rate and currency swaps, are used 
to hedge the Group’s foreign exchange and 
interest rate risk exposures.

Derivative financial instruments are 
recognised initially at fair value and 
thereafter are subsequently remeasured 
at their fair value. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date. The fair value 
of these instruments is the estimated 
amount that the Group would receive 
or pay to terminate the swap at the 
reporting date, taking into account current 
interest and currency exchange rates 
and the current creditworthiness of the 
swap counterparties.

The Group designates all of its derivatives 
in one or more of the following types 
of relationships:

i. Fair value hedge: Hedges the exposure 
to movements in fair value of 
recognised assets or liabilities that are 
attributable to hedged risks.

ii. Cash flow hedge: Hedges the Group’s 
exposures to fluctuations in future 
cash flow derived from a particular risk 
associated with recognised assets or 
liabilities or forecast transactions.

iii. Net investment hedge: Hedges the 
exchange rate fluctuations of a net 
investment in a foreign operation.

At inception of the transaction, the Group 
documents the relationship between 
the hedging instruments and hedged 
items, including the risk management 
objectives and strategy in undertaking 
the hedge transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at 
inception and on an ongoing basis, as to 
whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective 
in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 
flows of hedged items.

Fair value hedge
Any gain or loss resulting from the re-
measurement of the hedging instrument 
to fair value is reported in the Consolidated 
Income Statement, together with any 
changes in the fair value of the hedged 
asset or liability that are attributable to 
the hedged risk. The gains or losses of a 
hedging instrument that are in hedge 
relationships with borrowings are included 
within Finance Income or Finance Expense 
in the Consolidated Income Statement. In 
the case of the related hedged borrowings, 
any gain or loss on the hedged item 
which is attributable to the hedged risk is 
adjusted against the carrying amount of 
the hedged item and is also included within 
Finance Income or Finance Expense in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, the adjustment to 
the carrying amount of the hedged item is 
amortised on an effective interest basis to 
the Consolidated Income Statement with 
the objective of achieving full amortisation 
by maturity of the hedged item.

Cash flow hedge
The effective part of any gain or loss 
on the derivative financial instrument 
is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and presented in the Cash 
Flow Hedge Reserve in equity with the 
ineffective portion being recognised within 
Finance Income or Finance Expense in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. If a hedge 
of a forecasted transaction subsequently 
results in the recognition of a financial 
asset or a financial liability, the associated 
gains and losses that were recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income 
are reclassified into profit or loss in the 
same period or periods during which the 
asset acquired or liability assumed affects 
profit or loss. For cash flow hedges, other 
than those covered by the preceding 
statements, the associated cumulative 
gain or loss is removed from other 
comprehensive income and recognised in 

the Consolidated Income Statement in the 
same period or periods during which the 
hedged forecast transaction affects profit 
or loss. The ineffective part of any gain 
or loss is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when 
a hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. The 
cumulative gain or loss at that point 
remains in other comprehensive income 
and is recognised when the transaction 
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income is transferred to the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the period.

Net investment hedge
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of the 
hedge is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and presented in the Translation 
Reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating 
to the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in either Finance Income 
or Finance Expense in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. Cumulative gains or 
losses remain in equity until disposal of the 
net investment in the foreign operation 
at which point the related differences are 
reclassified to the Consolidated Income 
Statement as part of the overall gain or 
loss on sale.

Financial Assets
On initial recognition, a financial asset is 
classified as measured at amortised cost 
and subsequently measured using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method and 
subject to impairment. Financial assets 
may also be initially measured at fair 
value with any movement being reflected 
through other comprehensive income or 
the Consolidated Income Statement.

On initial recognition of an equity 
investment that is not held for trading, 
the Group may irrevocably elect to present 
subsequent changes in the investment’s 
fair value in other comprehensive income. 
This election is made on an investment-by-
investment basis.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For The Year Ended 31 December 2022

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For The Year Ended 31 December 2022

1 Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)
The Group applies the simplified approach 
for expected credit losses (ECL) under IFRS 
9 Financial Instruments, which requires 
expected lifetime losses to be recognised 
from initial recognition of receivables. 
Under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, 
the Group uses an allowance matrix to 
measure Expected Credit Loss (ECL) 
of trade receivables from customers. 
Loss rates are calculated using a “roll 
rate” method based on the probability 
of a receivable progressing through 
successive chains of non-payment to 
write-off. The rates are calculated at a 
business unit level which reflects the risks 
associated with geographic region, age, 
mix of customer relationship and type of 
product purchased.

Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities held for trading are 
measured at fair value through the profit 
and loss, and all other financial liabilities 
are measured at amortised cost unless the 
fair value option is applied.

Finance Income
Finance income comprises interest income 
on funds invested and any gains on 
hedging instruments that are recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Interest income is recognised as it accrues 
using the effective interest rate method.

Finance Expense
Finance expense comprises negative 
interest charged on cash balances held 
in certain currencies, interest payable on 
borrowings calculated using the effective 
interest rate method, fair value gains and 
losses on hedging instruments that are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the net finance cost of the 
Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, 
lease interest and the discount component 
of the deferred consideration which is 
unwound as an interest charge in the 
Consolidated Income Statement over the 
life of the obligation.

Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to 
qualifying assets, as defined in IAS 23 
Borrowing costs, are fully capitalised during 
the period of time that is necessary to 
complete and prepare the asset for its 
intended use. Other borrowing costs are 
expensed to the Consolidated Income 
Statement in the period in which they 
are incurred.

Share-Based Payment Transactions
The Group grants equity settled share 
based payments to employees through the 
Performance Share Plan and the Deferred 
Bonus Plan.

The fair value of these equity settled 
transactions is determined at grant date 
and is recognised as an employee expense 
in the Consolidated Income Statement, 
with the corresponding increase in equity, 
on a straight line basis over the vesting 
period. The fair value at the grant date is 
determined using a combination of the 
Monte Carlo simulation technique and the 
Black Scholes model, excluding the impact 
of any non-market conditions. Non-
market vesting conditions are included 
in the assumptions about the number 
of options that are expected to vest. At 
each reporting date, the Group revises its 
estimates of the number of options that 
are likely to vest as a result of non-market 
conditions. Any adjustment from this 
revision is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.

Where the share based payments give 
rise to the issue of new share capital, the 
proceeds received by the Company are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) 
and share premium (where applicable) 
when the share entitlements are exercised. 
Where the share-based payments give 
rise to the re-issue of shares from treasury 
shares, the proceeds of issue are credited 
to share premium.

The Group does not operate any cash-
settled share-based payment schemes or 
share-based payment transactions with 
cash alternatives as defined in IFRS 2.

Treasury Shares
Where the Company purchases its own 
equity share capital, the consideration 
paid is deducted from total shareholders’ 
equity and classified as treasury shares 
until such shares are cancelled or reissued. 
Where such shares are subsequently sold 
or reissued, any consideration received 
is included in share premium account. 
No gains or losses are recognised on the 
purchase, sale, cancellation or issue of 
treasury shares.

Non-controlling interest
Non-controlling interests represent the 
portion of the equity of a subsidiary not 
attributable either directly or indirectly to 
the parent company and are presented 
separately in the Consolidated Income 
Statement and within equity in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position, distinguished from shareholders’ 
equity attributable to owners of the 
parent company.

Accounting Estimates 
and Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies, as set out on pages 
145 to 153, management are required 
to make estimates and judgements 
that could materially affect the Group’s 
reported results or net asset position.

The preparation of the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and 
the accompanying disclosures, and 
the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions 
and estimates could result in outcomes 
that require a material adjustment 
to the carrying amount of assets or 
liabilities in future periods. The Group 
has considered the impact of climate 
change on the consolidated financial 
statements, including the carrying value of 
assets, the useful economic life of assets, 
and provisions.

The areas where key estimates and 
judgements were made by management 
and are material to the Group’s reported 
results or net asset position, are as follows:

Impairment (Note 10)
The Group is required to review assets for 
objective evidence of impairment.

It does this on the basis of a review of the 
budget and rolling 5 year forecasts (4 year 
strategic plan, as approved by the Board, 
plus year 5 forecasted by management), 
which by their nature are based on a series 
of assumptions and estimates.

1 Statement of Accounting Policies (continued)
The Group has performed impairment 
tests on those cash generating units which 
contain goodwill, and on any assets where 
there are indicators of impairment. The key 
assumptions associated with these reviews 
are detailed in Note 10. The Group also 
considered the potential impact of climate 
change. This is an area of estimation 
and judgement.

Guarantees & warranties (Note 21)
Certain products carry formal guarantees 
of satisfactory functional and aesthetic 
performance of varying periods following 
their purchase. Local management 
evaluate the constructive or legal 
obligation arising from customer feedback 
and assess the requirement to provide for 
any probable outflow of economic benefit 
arising from a settlement. This is an area of 
estimation and judgement.

Recoverability of trade receivables 
(Note 15)
The Group provides credit to customers 
and as a result there is an associated risk 
that the customer may not be able to pay 
outstanding balances.

Under IFRS 9 the Group uses an allowance 
matrix to measure Expected Credit Loss 
(ECL) of trade receivables from customers. 
Loss rates are calculated using a “roll rate” 
method based on the probability of a 
receivable progressing through successive 
chains of non-payment to write-off. The 
rates are calculated at a business unit 
level which reflects the risks associated 
with geographic region, age, mix of 
customer relationship and type of product 
purchased. This is an area of estimation 
and judgement.

Valuation of inventory (Note 14)
Inventories are measured at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. The Group’s 
policy is to hold inventories at original cost 
and create an inventory provision where 
evidence exists that indicates net realisable 
value is below cost for a particular item 
of inventory. Damaged, slow-moving or 
obsolete inventory are typical examples of 
such evidence. This is an area of estimation 
and judgement.

Leases (Note 17)
The Group has applied judgement to 
determine the lease term of contracts that 
include termination and extension options. 
If the Group is reasonably certain to 
exercise such options, the relevant amount 
of right of use assets and lease liabilities 
are recognised.

The Group has also applied judgement in 
determining the incremental borrowing 
rates (IBR). The incremental borrowing 
rate is the rate of interest that a lessee 
would expect to incur on funds borrowed 
over a similar term and security to obtain a 
comparable value to the right of use asset 
in the relevant economic environment. The 
Group estimates the IBR using observable 
inputs (such as market interest rates) when 
available and makes certain entity-specific 
estimates (such as country risk and entity 
specific credit rating) as required.

Business Combinations (Note 23)
Business combinations are accounted 
for using the acquisition method which 
requires that the assets and liabilities 
assumed are recorded at their respective 
fair values at the date of acquisition. The 
application of this method requires certain 
estimates and assumptions relating, in 
particular, to the determination of the fair 
values of the acquired assets and liabilities 
assumed at the date of acquisition.

For intangible assets acquired, the Group 
bases valuations on expected future cash 
flows. This method employs a discounted 
cash flow analysis using the present value 
of the estimated cash flows expected to 
be generated from these intangible assets 
using appropriate discount rates and 
revenue forecasts. The period of expected 
cash flows is based on the expected useful 
life of the intangible asset acquired.

Measurement of deferred contingent 
consideration and put option liabilities 
related to business combinations require 
assumptions to be made regarding profit 
forecasts and discount rates used to arrive 
at the net present value of the potential 
obligations. The Group has considered 
all available information in arriving at 
the estimate of liabilities associated 
with deferred contingent consideration 
obligations. This is an area of estimation 
and judgement.

Income taxes (Note 8)
The Group is subject to income tax 
in numerous jurisdictions. Significant 
judgement is required in determining the 
worldwide provision for income taxes. 
There are many transactions for which the 
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. 
The Group recognises liabilities based on 
estimates of whether additional taxes 
will be due. Once it has been concluded 
that a liability needs to be recognised, the 
liability is measured based on the tax laws 
that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted at the end of the reporting period. 
The amount shown for current taxation 
includes an estimate for uncertain tax 
treatments where the Group considers it 
probable that uncertain tax treatments 
will not be accepted by tax authorities 
and the estimate is measured using either 
the most likely amount method or the 
expected value method, as appropriate, 
prescribed by IFRIC 23. Where the final tax 
outcome of these matters is different from 
the amounts that were initially estimated, 
such differences will impact the income tax 
and deferred tax provisions in the period in 
which such determination is made.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against 
which the unused tax losses and unused 
tax credits can be utilised. The Group 
estimates the most probable amount of 
future taxable profits, using assumptions 
consistent with those employed in 
impairment calculations, and taking into 
consideration applicable tax legislation in 
the relevant jurisdiction. These calculations 
also require the use of estimates and 
judgement.

Deferred Contingent Consideration 
(Note 19)
Measurement of put option liabilities 
require assumptions to be made regarding 
profit forecasts and discount rates used 
to arrive at the net present value of the 
potential obligations. The Group has 
considered all available information 
in arriving at the estimate of liabilities 
associated with put option obligations. 
This is an area of estimation.

2 Segment Reporting
In identifying the Group’s operating segments, management based its decision on the product supplied by each segment and the fact 
that each segment is managed and reported separately to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. These operating segments are monitored 
and strategic decisions are made on the basis of segment operating results.

The Group established a new division, Roofing + Waterproofing, during the financial year. This encompasses the Group’s waterproof 
membrane roofing solutions activities which has resulted from the acquisition of Ondura Group and Derbigum during the financial year. 
There were no operations or activities in 2021 that are related to the new segment and therefore no changes have been made to the 
comparatives in relation to the new division.

Operating segments
The Group has the following six operating segments:

Insulated Panels Manufacture of insulated panels, structural framing and metal facades.

Insulation Manufacture of rigid insulation boards, technical insulation and engineered timber systems.

Light + Air Manufacture of daylighting, smoke management, ventilation systems and service activities.

Water + Energy Manufacture of energy and water solutions and all related service activities.

Data + Flooring Manufacture of data centre storage solutions and raised access floors.

Roofing + Waterproofing Manufacture of roofing and waterproofing solutions for renovation and new construction of buildings.

The disaggregation of revenue by geography is set out in more detail on page 156.

The segments specified above capture the major product lines relevant to the Group.

The combination of the disaggregation of revenue by product group, geography and the timing of revenue recognition capture the key 
categories of disclosure with respect to revenue. Typically, individual performance obligations are specifically called out in the contract 
which allow for accurate recognition of revenue as and when performances are fulfilled. Given the nature of the Group’s product set, 
customer returns are not a significant feature of our business model. No further disclosures are required with respect to disaggregation of 
revenue other than what has been presented in this note.

Inter-segment transfers are carried out at arm’s length prices and using an appropriate transfer pricing methodology. As inter-segment 
revenue is not material, it is not subject to separate disclosure in the above analysis. For the purposes of the segmental analysis, corporate 
overheads have been allocated to each division based on their respective revenue for the year.

4 Employees (continued)
The fair values of options granted under the PSP scheme during the current and prior year were determined using the Black Scholes Model 
or the Monte Carlo Pricing Model as appropriate. The key assumptions used in the model were as follows:

2022 Awards 2021 Awards 2021 Awards

22 February 2022 23 August 2021 24 February 2021

Share price at grant date €88.60 €96.16 €61.0
Exercise price per share €0.13 €0.13 €0.13
Expected volatility 36.7% 35.9% 35.6%
Expected dividend yield 1.25% 0.42% 0.51%
Risk-free rate (0.2%) (0.8%) (0.7%)
Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years

The resulting weighted average fair value of options granted in the year was €61.55 (2021: €51.41).

As set out in the Report of the Remuneration Committee, the number of options that will ultimately vest is contingent on market 
conditions such as Total Shareholder Return and non-market conditions such as the Earnings Per Share of the Group and its Net Promotor 
Score (NPS). Market conditions were taken into account in determining the above fair value, and non-market conditions were considered 
when estimating the number of shares that will eventually vest. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility 
of the Group and peer company share prices over the previous 3 years. The Report of the Remuneration Committee sets out the current 
companies within the peer group.

Deferred Bonus Plan
As set out in the Report of the Remuneration Committee, the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) is intended to reward incremental performance 
over and above the growth targeted by the annual performance related bonus. Any DBP bonus earned for such incremental performance 
is satisfied by the payment of deferred share awards. These shares are held for the benefit of the individual participants for two years 
without any additional performance conditions. These shares vest after two years but are forfeited if the participant leaves the Group 
within that period.

During the year, 21,438 (2021: nil) awards were granted under the DBP and 2,272 (2021: 15,718) awards were exercised. 21,438 awards 
remain outstanding at 31 December 2022. A charge of €0.9m was recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for 2022 (2021: 
€1.5m).

In accordance with the Statement of Accounting Policies (Share-Based Payment Transactions) and Note 4, the Performance Share Plan 
accounting charge of €3.5m (2021: €3.1m) is the fair value expense, accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2, of equity settled share-based 
payments attributable to directors for the period. The fair value of each equity settled share-based payment is determined at grant date 
and is recognised as an employee expense in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Pursuant to the Companies Act 2014 and related guidance, the Report of the Remuneration Committee reports share-based payments 
which vested in the period, and they are measured at market value rather than fair value. This explains differences between the total 
Directors’ Remuneration expense of €11.2m in this Note and the total Director’s Remuneration expense of €9.3m in the Report of the 
Remuneration Committee.

Aggregate gains of €4.9m (2021: €2.9m) were realised with respect to share options exercised by directors during the financial year. 
Details of the number of share options exercised by each director, the market value of the shares on the date of exercise, and the exercise 
price are included in the Performance Share Plan section of the Report of the Remuneration Committee.

A detailed analysis of directors’ remuneration is contained in the Report of the Remuneration Committee.

Total income tax expense 130.6 118.4

The total tax charge in future periods will be affected by any changes to the corporation tax rates in force in the countries in which the 
Group operates. Changes in the geographical mix of future earnings will also impact the total tax charge.

The methodology used to determine the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions is set out in Note 1 ‘Statement of 
Accounting Policies’.

The total value of deductible temporary differences which have not been recognised is €31.8m (2021: €23.7m) consisting mainly of tax 
losses forward. €0.1m (2021: €0.3m) of the losses expire within 5 years while all other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

No provision has been made for tax in respect of temporary differences arising from unremitted earnings of foreign operations as there 
is no commitment to remit such earnings and no current plans to do so. Deferred tax liabilities of €19.6m (2021: €16.1m) have not been 
recognised for withholding tax that would be payable on unremitted earnings of €391.3m (2021: €322.2m) in certain subsidiaries.

Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated, at acquisition, to CGUs that are expected to benefit from synergies in that 
combination. The CGUs are the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for internal management 
reporting purposes and are not larger than the operating segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

The Group has established a new division, Roofing + Waterproofing, during the financial year. This encompasses the Group’s waterproof 
membrane roofing solution activities which has resulted from the acquisition of Ondura Group and Derbigum during the financial year. 
On that basis and following an assessment of the Group’s CGUs, Roofing + Waterproofing is listed as a separate CGU below. A total of 12 
(2021: 11) CGUs have been identified and these are analysed between the six business segments in the Group as set out below. Assets and 
liabilities have been assigned to the CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis.

Significant goodwill amounts
Management has assessed that, in line with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, there are five CGUs that are individually significant (greater than 
10% of total goodwill) that require additional disclosure and are as follows:

Panels

The goodwill allocated to these 5 CGUs (2021: 4 CGUs) accounts for 79% (2021: 74%) of the total carrying amount of €2,495.5m (2021: 
€1,908.6m). The remaining goodwill balance of €514.0m (2021: €505.7m) is allocated across the other 7 CGUs (2021: 7 CGUs), none of 
which are individually significant. Similar assumptions and techniques are applied on the impairment testing of these CGUs.

None of the individually significant CGUs are included in the “Sensitivity analysis” section as it is not considered reasonably possible that 
there would be a change in the key assumptions such that the carrying amount would exceed value-in-use. Consequently, no further 
disclosures have been provided for these CGUs.

Impairment testing
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to the above CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. 
Impairment of goodwill occurs when the carrying value of the CGU is greater than the present value of the cash that it is expected to 
generate (i.e. the recoverable amount). The Group reviews the carrying value of each CGU at least annually or more frequently if there is 
an indication that a CGU may be impaired.

The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined from value-in-use calculations. The forecasts used in these calculations are based 
on a 4 year financial plan approved by the Board of Directors, plus year 5 as forecasted by management, and specifically excludes any 
future acquisition activity. They include assumptions regarding future organic growth with cash flows after year 5 assuming to continue 
in perpetuity at a general growth rate of 2% to 5% (Panels LATAM 5%), reflecting the relevant CGU market growth. The use of cash flows 
in perpetuity is considered appropriate in light of the Group’s established history of earnings growth and cash flow generation, its strong 
financial position and the nature of the industry in which the Group operates.

The value in use calculation represents the present value of the future cash flows, including the terminal value, discounted at a rate 
appropriate to each CGU. The real pre-tax discount rates used range from 9.2% to 18.4% (2021: 7.4% to 17.7%). These rates are based on 
the Group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for risk, and are consistent with external sources of information. 

The cash flows and the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are determined based on the historical performance of the 
Group, its strong current financial position as well as management’s knowledge and expectation of future trends in the industry. Expected 
future cash flows are, however, inherently uncertain and are therefore liable to material change over time. The key assumptions used in the 
value in use calculations are subjective and include projected EBITDA margins, net cash flows, discount rates used and the duration of the 
discounted cash flow model. Net cashflows incorporate the estimated capital expenditure required to meet the Group’s Planet Passionate 
targets.

Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis was performed by adjusting cash flows by 20%, the discount rate by 17%, the average operating margin of each 
division by over 25% and by reducing the long-term growth rate to 1.5%. Each test resulted in a positive recoverable amount for each CGU 
under each approach. Management believes, therefore, that any reasonable change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the 
carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount, thereby giving rise to an impairment.

The Group’s core funding is provided by six (2021: six) private placement loan notes; one (2021: one) USD private placement totalling 
$200m (2021: $200m) maturing in December 2028 and five (2021: five) EUR private placements totalling €1.1bn (2021: €1.2bn) which will 
mature in tranches between March 2023 and December 2032. The notes have a weighted average maturity of 5.7 years (2021: 6.4 years). 

The primary bank debt facility is a €800m revolving credit facility, which was undrawn at year end, and which matures in May 2026. The 
revolving credit facility was increased by €100m in December 2022 under the facility’s accordion clause. 

In April 2022, the Group arranged two additional banking finance facilities with an aggregate value of €800m (€500m maturing April 
2024, €300m maturing April 2025). The facilities were fully drawn at year end.

Included in cash at bank and in hand are overdrawn positions of €1,456.8m (31 December 2021: €1,439.8m). These balances form part of 
a notional cash pool arrangement and are netted against cash balances of €1,480.2m (31 December 2021: €1,463.6m). The net cash pool 
balance of €23.4m (31 December 2021: €23.8m) is included in the cash and cash equivalents balance above. There is a legal right of offset 
between these balances and the balances are physically settled on a regular basis.

More details of the Group’s loans and borrowings are set out in Note 20.

Net debt, which is an Alternative Performance Measure, is stated net of interest rate and currency hedges which relate to hedges of debt. 
Foreign currency derivative assets of €0.4m (2021: €0.3m) and foreign currency derivative liabilities of €nil (2021: €nil) which are used 
for transactional hedging are not included in the definition of net debt. Lease liabilities recognised due to the implementation of IFRS 16 
and deferred contingent consideration have also been excluded from the calculation of net debt which is consistent with the terms and 
conditions of the covenants as set out in the Group’s external borrowing arrangements.

Included in the amounts paid during the period was a payment of €36.6m to acquire the remaining 15% of shares in Bacacier which were 
held by a non-controlling interest.

For each acquisition for which deferred contingent consideration has been provided, an annual review takes place to evaluate if the 
payment conditions are likely to be met. For the purposes of the fair value assessments all of the put option liabilities are valued using 
the option price formula in the shareholder’s agreement and the most recent financial projections. These are classified as unobservable 
inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements and the quantitative sensitivity analysis are shown in the 
table below:

The amount of the deferred contingent consideration and put liability that have been recognised are arrived at by the application of a 
range of outcomes and associated probabilities in order to determine the carrying amounts.

Liabilities in the range of €nil (2021: €nil) to €15.7m (2021: €24.1m) could arise with respect to potential deferred contingent consideration 
obligations and €nil (2021: €nil) to €171.4m (2021: €178.2m) with respect to potential put option obligations.

19 Deferred Contingent Consideration (continued)
The put option in the shareholders’ agreement with non-controlling shareholders of Isoeste is exercisable from 2023. The undiscounted 
expected cash outflow is estimated to be €157.2m (2021: €134.8m).

The put option in the shareholders’ agreement with non-controlling shareholders of PanelMET has been exercisable since 2022. The 
undiscounted expected cash outflow is estimated to be €6.4m (2021: €6.1m).

The put option in the shareholders’ agreement with non-controlling shareholders of Kingspan Jindal has been exercisable since 2022. The 
undiscounted expected cash outflow is estimated to be €10.1m (2021: €14.0m).

In the case of Isoeste, PanelMET and Kingspan Jindal, call options rest over the remaining shareholding held by non-controlling interests, 
which are exercisable by the Group in a very limited range of circumstances. No value has been attributed to these call options.

20 Financial Risk Management and Financial Instruments

Financial Risk Management
In the normal course of business, the Group and Company have exposure to a variety of financial risks, including foreign currency risk, 
interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group’s and Company’s focus is to understand these risks and to put in place policies 
that minimise the economic impact of an adverse event on the Group’s performance. Meetings are held on a regular basis to review the 
result of the risk assessment, approve recommended risk management strategies and monitor the effectiveness of such policies.

The Group’s and Company’s risk management strategies include the usage of derivatives (other than for speculative transactions), 
principally forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps.

Liquidity risk
In addition to the high level of free cash flow, the Group operates a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-
term debt together with short-term debt, cash and cash equivalents, to enable it to meet its liabilities when due.

The Group’s core funding is provided by a number of private placement loan notes totalling €1,322.0m (2021: €1,377.1m). The notes have a 
weighted average maturity of 5.7 years (2021: 6.4 years).

The primary bank debt facility is a €800m revolving credit facility, which was undrawn at year end and which matures in May 2026. The 
Revolving Credit Facility was increased by €100m in December 2022 under the facility’s accordion clause. 

In April 2022, the Group arranged two additional banking finance facilities with an aggregate value of €800m (€500m maturing April 
2024, €300m maturing April 2025). The facilities were fully drawn at year end.

Both the private placements and the banking facilities (revolving credit facility and two additional banking facilities) have an interest 
cover test (EBITDA: Net interest must not be less than 4 times) and a net debt test (Net debt: EBITDA must not exceed 3.5 times). These 
covenant tests have been met for the covenant test period to 31 December 2022.

The Group also has in place a number of uncommitted bilateral working capital facilities to serve its working capital requirements. These 
facilities total €64.0m (2021: €65.2m) and are supported by a Group guarantee. Core funding arrangements arise from a wide and varied 
number of institutions and, as such, there is no significant concentration of liquidity risk.

20 Financial Risk Management and Financial Instruments (continued)
For provisions, the carrying amount represents the Group’s best estimate of the expected future outflows. As it does not represent a 
contractual liability at the year end, no amount has been included as a contractual cash flow.

Deferred contingent consideration, which includes any put option liabilities, is valued using the relevant agreed multiple of the expected 
future EBITDA in each acquired business which is appropriately discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimated fair value 
of deferred contingent consideration would decrease if EBITDA was lower or if the risk adjusted discount rate was higher. The range of 
outcomes are set out in Note 19.

The actual future cash flows could be different from the amounts included in the tables above, if the associated obligations were to 
become repayable on demand as a result of non-compliance with covenants or other contractual terms. No such non-compliance 
is envisaged.

Market Risks
Foreign exchange risk
There are two types of foreign currency risk to which the Group is exposed, namely transaction risk and translation risk. The objective of 
the Group’s foreign currency risk management strategy is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters. As 
set out below the Group uses derivatives to manage foreign exchange risk. Transactions involving derivatives are carried out in accordance 
with the Treasury policy. The Group seeks to apply hedge accounting, where practicable, to manage volatility in profit or loss.

Transaction risk
Apart from transaction risk on debt, this arises where operating units have input costs or sales in currencies other than their functional 
currencies. These exposures are internally hedged as far as possible. Group policy is to hedge up to a maximum of 75% of a forecast 
exposure. Material exposures are hedged on a rolling 12 months basis. The Group’s principal exposure relates to GBP and USD, with less 
significant exposures to certain central European currencies.

In addition, where operating entities carry monetary assets and liabilities at year end denominated other than in their functional currency, 
their translation at the year end rates of exchange into their functional currency will give rise to foreign currency gains and losses. The 
Group seeks to manage these gains and losses to net to nil.

Based on current cash flow projections for the businesses to 31 December 2023, it is estimated that the Group is long GBP95m (2021: long 
GBP67m) and short US$9m (2021: long US$8m). At 31 December 2022 these amounts were unhedged. 

Translation risk
This exists due to the fact that the Group has operations whose functional currency is not the Euro, the Group’s presentational currency. 
Changes in the exchange rate between the reporting currencies of these operations and the Euro, have an impact on the Group’s 
consolidated reported result. For 2022, the impact of changing currency rates versus Euro compared to the average 2021 rates was 
negative €24.7m (2021: positive €123.1m). The key drivers of the change year on year are the movements in GBP and USD. In common with 
many other international groups, the Group does not currently seek to externally hedge its translation exposure.

Sensitivity analysis for primary currency risk
A 10% volatility of the EUR against GBP and USD in respect of transaction risk in the reporting entities functional currency would impact 
reported after tax profit by €10m (2021: €8.0m) and equity by €9m (2021: €8.0m).

Interest rate risk
The Group has an exposure to movements in interest rates on its debt portfolio, and on its cash and cash equivalent balances and 
derivatives. The Group policy is to ensure that at least 40% of its debt is fixed rate.

In respect of interest bearing loans and borrowings, the following table indicates the effective average interest rates at the year end and 
the periods over which they mature. Interest on interest bearing loans and borrowings classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of 
less than one year. The table further analyses interest bearing loans and borrowings by currency and fixed/floating mix.

facilities established in 2022.

Credit risk
Credit risk encompasses the risk of financial loss to the Group of counterparty default in relation to any of its financial assets. The Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset:

Cash & cash equivalents 649.3 641.4
Trade receivables 1,262.3 1,110.3
Derivative financial assets 0.4 0.3

Trade receivables arise from a wide and varied customer base spread across various activities, end users and geographies, and as such 
there is no significant concentration of credit risk. The Group’s credit risk management policy in relation to trade receivables involves 
periodically assessing the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored and a significant element of credit risk is covered by credit insurance or other forms of 
collateral such as letters of credit or bank guarantees.

At the year end, the Group was carrying a receivables book of €1,136.8m (2021: €1,022.9m) expressed net of provision for default in 
payment. This represents a net risk of 14% (2021: 16%) of sales. Of these net receivables, approximately 60% (2021: 61%) were covered by 
credit insurance or other forms of collateral such as letter of credit and bank guarantees.

Insulation customers 237.3 207.1
Other customers 269.5 210.7

1,262.3 1,110.3

The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure Expected Credit Loss (ECL) of trade receivables from customers. The ECL simplified 
approach has been adopted.

Loss rates are calculated using a roll rate method based on the probability of a receivable progressing through successive chains of non-
payment to write-off. The rates are calculated at a business unit level which reflects the risks associated with geographic region, age, mix 
of customer relationship and type of product purchased. The identifiable loss pertaining to cash positions is immaterial.

There are no material trade receivables written off during 2022 (2021: €nil) which are still subject to enforcement activity.

The increase in the expected credit loss allowance during 2022 reflects sales growth during the year.

Fair value hierarchy
Financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value are analysed between those based on quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities (Level 1), those involving inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or 
indirectly (Level 2); and those involving inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (Level 3) as set out 
in Note 19.

Normally, the derivatives entered into by the Group are not traded in active markets. The fair values of these contracts are estimated 
using a valuation technique that maximises the use of observable market inputs, e.g. market exchange and interest rates (Level 2). All 
derivatives entered into by the Group are included in Level 2 and consist of foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and 
cross currency interest rate swaps.

Capital Management Policies and Procedures
The Group employs a combination of debt and equity to fund its operations. As at 31 December the total capital employed in the Group 
was as follows:

2022
€m

2021
€m

Net debt 1,539.6 756.1
Equity 3,395.5 2,959.3

Total Capital Employed 4,935.1 3,715.4

The Board’s objective when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain the confidence of investors, creditors 
and the market. The Board monitors the return on capital (defined as total shareholders’ equity plus net debt), and targets a return in excess 
of 20% together with a dividend level that is compatible with industry norms, but which also reflects any exceptional market conditions.

The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the 
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. The Group actively manages foreign currency and interest rate exposure, as 
well as actively managing the net asset position, in order to create bottom line value. This necessitates the development of a methodology 
to optimise the allocation of financial resources on the one hand and the return on capital on the other.

The Board closely monitors externally imposed capital restrictions which are present due to covenants within the Group’s core banking facilities.

There were no material changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.

The Group manufactures a wide range of insulation and related products for use primarily in the construction sector. Some products 
carry formal guarantees of satisfactory performance of varying periods following their purchase by customers and a provision is carried in 
respect of the expected costs of settling warranty and guarantee claims which arise. The Group in the course of its operations can be party 
to claims, litigation or enforcement actions. Both the number of claims and the cost of settling the claim are sensitive to change. In most 
cases, a reasonably reliable estimate can be made based on a range of possible outcomes. If the extent and cost of settling a claim or 
potential claim or enforcement action is not yet reasonably determinable, no provision is made until such a reliable estimate can be made. 
Provisions are reviewed by management on a regular basis, and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate of the economic outflow. If it 
is no longer probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, the related provision is reversed.

For the non-current element of the provision, the Group anticipates that these will be utilised within three years of the reporting date. 
Discounting of the non-current element has not been applied because the discount would be immaterial.

23 Business Combinations
A key strategy of the Group is to create and sustain market leading positions through acquisitions in markets it currently operates in, 
together with extending the Group’s footprint in new geographic markets. In line with this strategy, the principal acquisitions completed 
during the year was as follows:

consideration, including net debt acquired amounted to €220.4m.

In September 2022, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ondura Group, a French headquartered global provider of roofing 
membranes and associated roofing solutions, for a total consideration, including net debt acquired of €515.6m.

The Group also made a number of smaller acquisitions during the year for a combined cash consideration of €151.0m:

 @ The Roofing + Waterproofing division acquired 100% of the share capital of Derbigum, a Belgian producer of waterproofing 
membranes for a total consideration, including net debt acquired of €95.0m in June 2022;

 @ The Insulated Panels division acquired 100% of the share capital of THU Perfil in February 2022 and 100% of the share capital of 
Invespanel in Spain in September 2022;

 @ The Insulation division acquired the assets of Calostat in the UK in September 2022.

The table below reflects the provisional fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in respect of the acquisitions completed during the 
year. Any amendments to fair values will be made within the twelve month period from the date of acquisition, as permitted by IFRS 3,

*Included in Other are certain immaterial remeasurements of prior year accounting estimates as a result of the finalisation of the 
assignment of fair values to identifiable net assets.

The acquired goodwill is attributable principally to the profit generating potential of the businesses, together with cross-selling 
opportunities and other synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the acquired businesses into the Group’s existing business.

In the post-acquisition period to 31 December 2022, the businesses acquired during the current year contributed revenue of €252.0m and 
trading profit of €21.6m to the Group’s results.

The full year revenue and trading profit had the acquisitions taken place at the start of the year, would have been €8,762.6m and 
€875.7m respectively.

The gross contractual value of trade and other receivables as at the respective dates of acquisition amounted to €132.4m. The fair value of 
these receivables is €127.3m, all of which is recoverable, and is inclusive of an aggregate impairment provision of €5.1m.

There is €Nil of goodwill (2021: €34.5m) which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The Group incurred acquisition related costs of €8.3m (2021: €9.4m) relating to external legal fees and due diligence costs. These costs 
have been included in operating costs in the Consolidated Income Statement.

The initial assignment of fair values to identifiable net assets acquired has been performed on a provisional basis due to the relative size 
of the acquisitions and the timing of the transactions. Any amendments to these fair values within the twelve-month timeframe from the 
date of acquisition will be disclosable in the 2023 Annual Report, as stipulated by IFRS 3.

31 Guarantees And Other Financial Commitments

(i) Guarantees and contingencies
The Group’s principal debt facilities are secured by means of cross guarantees provided by Kingspan Group plc. These include drawn private 
placement notes of US$200m (2021: US$200m) and €1,134.5m (2021: €1,200.5m), an undrawn bank facility of €800m (2021: €700m) and 
two additional banking finance facilities with an aggregated value of €800m drawn in 2022.

Kingspan Group plc has guaranteed the relevant debts of certain of its Dutch and German subsidiaries in accordance with Article 403, 
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and Section 264 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) respectively. The respective entities have 
therefore availed of the exemption from preparing and filing audited financial statements and management reports in the Netherlands 
and Germany.

32 Pension Obligations
The Group operates defined contribution schemes in each of its main operating locations. The Group also has a number of defined benefit 
schemes in the UK and mainland Europe.

Defined contribution schemes
The total cost charged to profit or loss of €32.3m (2021: €26.3m) represents employer contributions payable to these schemes in 
accordance with the rules of each plan. An amount of €5.3m (2021: €4.4m) was included at year end in accruals in respect of defined 
contribution pension accruals.

Defined benefit schemes / obligations
The Group has three defined benefit schemes in the UK, all of which are closed to new members and to future accrual. The total pension 
contributions to these schemes for the year amounted to €1.8m (2021: €nil) and the expected contributions for 2023 are €nil (2021: 
€nil). On 6 December 2022, the Group executed a €150.8m bulk insurance annuity insurance policy ‘buy in’ for the Colt Life Assurance 
and Retirement Scheme (‘CLARS’). This buy-in ensures that an insurance asset fully matches the remaining pension liability. Therefore 
for this particular scheme the Group is no longer exposed to the pension risks as outlined below. As the scheme was in an accounting 
surplus position, the impact of this transaction was to record a re-measurement loss of €28.1m within the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. There was no impact on profit before tax from this transaction.

The Group also has pension obligations in mainland Europe which are accounted for as defined benefit obligations. These obligations have 
been accounted for in line with the Group’s existing pension obligations whereby companies are not required to fund independent schemes 
for post employment benefit obligations. Instead, commencing from the date the employee becomes eligible to receive the income 
stream, this obligation is satisfied from available cash resources of the relevant employing company. A provision has been made for the 
unfunded liability. €1.7m of pension entitlements have been paid to retired former employees during the year (2021: €1.6m).

The pension costs relating to all of the above defined benefit obligations are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified 
actuaries. In the case of the three UK legacy schemes, the most recent actuarial valuations were performed as of 31 December 2022. 
In general, actuarial valuations are not available for public inspection; however, the results of valuations are advised to members of the 
various schemes.

The UK and European defined benefit schemes expose the Group to the following risks:

Interest Rate Risk: The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the Group’s defined benefit liabilities are set with 
reference to corporate bond yields. A decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the schemes’ defined benefit obligation. Such 
movements in bond yields would result in volatility in the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inflation Risk: A significant proportion of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation therefore higher inflation will result 
in a higher defined benefit obligation (subject to the appropriate caps in place to protect the schemes against extreme inflation). This is 
however expected to be offset to an extent by an increase in the value of the Group’s holdings in liability driven investments (LDI)-type 
plan assets.

Longevity Risk: The present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is calculated with reference to the mortality of scheme 
members, both during and after employment. If scheme members live longer than expected, the scheme’s benefits will need to be paid for 
longer, increasing the scheme’s defined benefit obligation.

The directors note that the Group’s UK defined benefit schemes are also exposed to the following significant risk:

Asset Volatility: The Group’s defined benefit obligations are calculated using discount rates set with reference to corporate bond yields. 
The schemes’ assets comprise of equities, bonds, property and LDI, all of which may fluctuate significantly in value. These assets are 
expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.

The extent of the Group’s obligation under these schemes is sensitive to judgemental actuarial assumptions, of which the principal 
ones are set out below. It is not considered that any reasonable sensitivity analysis on these assumptions would materially alter the

It is noted that the ‘Funded Schemes’ relate to the wholly and partly funded UK schemes and 3 partially funded immaterial European 
schemes. The ‘Un-funded Schemes’ covers all other European DBOs.

The table below gives an indication of the impact of a change in the principal actuarial assumptions on the funded defined benefit 
scheme liabilities.

Funded Schemes Mortality assumptions Increase by 1 year Increase by 3% Increase by 4%

Un-Funded Schemes Mortality assumptions Increase by 1 year Increase by 4% -6% Increase by 4% - 6%

The sensitivity analyses above have been determined on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined benefit obligation as 
a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. The sensitivity analyses are based on a 
change in a significant assumption, keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analyses may not be representative of an 
actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation from one another.

comprise the board of directors (executive and non-executive directors) who manage the business and affairs of the Company. As 
identified in the Report of the Remuneration Committee, the directors, other than the non-executive directors, serve as executive 
officers of the Group. Key management personnel compensation is set out in Note 7. Dividends of €1.0m were paid to other key

Alternative Performance Measures (continued)Alternative Performance Measures

The Group uses a number of metrics, which are non-IFRS measures, to monitor the performance of its operations.

The Group believes that these metrics assist investors in evaluating the performance of the underlying business. Given that these metrics 
are regularly used by management, they also give the investor an insight into how Group management review and monitor the business on 
an ongoing basis.

The principal Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) used by the Group are defined as follows:

Trading profit
This comprises the operating profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement before intangible asset amortisation and non 
trading items. This equates to the Earnings Before Interest, Tax and Amortisation (“EBITA”) of the Group. Trading profit is used by 
management as it excludes items which may hinder year on year comparisons.

Trading margin 10.0% 11.6%

EBITDA
The Group has updated its definition of EBITDA as earnings before finance expenses, income taxes, depreciation, amortisation and non 
trading items. In the prior year the Group did not record a non trading item and therefore it was not reflected in the definition of EBITDA.

Free cash flow
Free cash flow is the cash generated from operations after net capital expenditure, interest paid, income taxes paid and lease payments 
and reflects the amount of internally generated capital available for re-investment in the business or for distribution to shareholders.

Banking Covenants
The Net debt:EBITDA and the EBITDA:Net Interest ratios disclosed in this report are calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of the covenants as set out in the Group’s external borrowing arrangements. Therefore, EBITDA and Net Interest are adjusted to exclude 
the impact of IFRS 16 Leases for these calculations.

Net debt
Net debt represents the net total of current and non-current borrowings, current and non-current derivative financial instruments, 
(excluding foreign currency derivatives which are used for transactional hedging), and cash and cash equivalents as presented in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Lease liabilities recognised due to the implementation of IFRS 16 and deferred contingent 
consideration have also been excluded from the calculation of net debt. Consistent with the 2021 APMs, this definition is in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of the covenants as set out in the Group’s external borrowing arrangements.

Total shareholder return (TSR)
Total shareholder return (TSR) is a key performance metric for the Performance Share Plan (PSP).

The methodology for calculating the total shareholder return assumes the following: the open price is set as the closing price of the final 
trading day prior to the beginning of the performance period; the close price is set as the closing price on the final trading day of the 
performance period; the calculation assumes all dividends are reinvested on the ex-dividend date, at the closing price on that day.

Aligned with our Planet Passionate 
strategy, we are committed to 
producing an environmentally 
conscious Annual Report. To reduce 
our environmental impact, this report 
is printed on 100% recycled pre- and 
post-consumer waste, forest-certified, 
carbon-balanced paper.
Recycling paper reduces waste that would otherwise go to landfill. 
This, in turn, reduces the carbon based emissions that would have 
been released through landfill degradation. The effects of climate 
change and growing pressures on the planet’s limited resources 
necessitate the move towards a low-carbon circular economy. 
Paper is a truly sustainable product, and recycled paper is an 
absolute example of a circular product in action.
