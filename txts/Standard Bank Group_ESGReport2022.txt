As an African financial services institution 
operating in 20 countries on the continent 
and several international markets, we are 
committed to listening to diverse views, 
understanding competing priorities, and 
working together with stakeholders to 
create relationships based on trust, 
mutual respect and shared value creation.

We became a founding signatory to the 
UNEP FI Principles for Responsible 
Banking (PRB) in September 2019 and, 
subsequently, co-chair of the Banking 
Board, which is responsible for overseeing 
effective implementation of the Principles. 
As per the Principles, we commit to 
ensuring that we align our strategy to 
be consistent with and contribute to 
individuals’ needs and society’s goals, 
as expressed in the UN sustainable 
development goals (SDGs), the Paris 

Agreement, and relevant national and 
regional frameworks, including the AU’s 
Agenda 2063, and sustainable banking 
frameworks in our countries of operation. 
We have identified seven impact areas 
linked to our core business activities in 
which we believe we can make the 
greatest positive contribution. 

By placing the interests of our customers 
and clients at the centre of our decision-
making, we ensure that we act in 
accordance with what is good for these 
constituencies and what is good for the 
group. By ensuring that the economic 
value we generate for our shareholders is 
underpinned by the creation of value for 
society, we build trust and long-term 
relationships with our clients and 
motivate and inspire our employees. 
By contributing to the prosperity of 

African economies, we grow our client 
base and potential markets, and by 
thinking long-term, we ensure that our 
markets remain viable and prosperous 
into the future. 

Our Report to Society provides 
information about our SEE impacts, and 
how we're working with our clients and 
other stakeholders to encourage 
sustainable business practices and create 
shared prosperity for current and future 
generations. 

This report focuses on our approach 
to ESG management, and the material 
issues that have the potential to impact 
our ability to deliver our strategic priorities 
and create value for our stakeholders. It 
describes the work we’ve done over the 
past few years to strengthen ESG risk 

Message from the  
Standard Bank Group chairman

management, and the associated systems, 
policies, processes and oversight capacity 
we’ve put in place. 

We are delighted that our employee 
engagement scores continue to reflect 
very high levels of engagement, 
motivation, support and empowerment 
across the group. This report provides 
information about ongoing initiatives to 
ensure that our workforce reflects and 
celebrates the diversity of our African 
continent and our progress against 
targets. We also cover the training 
and skills development programmes that 
are helping our people remain competitive 
in a rapidly changing, rapidly digitising 
world of work.

Nonkululeko Nyembezi, Chairman, SBG

Standard Bank is committed to driving sustainable 
and inclusive economic growth across Africa.  
This commitment is underpinned by our purpose, 
Africa is our home, we drive her growth, and by our 
SEE value driver, which requires us to ensure that 
our business activities create net positive social, 
economic and environmental (SEE) impact.

ESG issues are top of the global 
agenda, and Standard Bank is no 

exception. We are committed to 
listening to diverse views, 

understanding competing priorities, 
and working together with 

stakeholders to create relationships 
based on trust, mutual respect and 

shared value creation.

This report discusses our approach to 
conduct and notes the refresh of our 
group code of ethics and conduct in 2022 
to better reflect our commitment to 
creating positive social, economic and 
environmental impacts. It also covers the 
measures we have in place to ensure the 
protection of information and privacy and 
guard against cybercrime and all forms of 
financial crime. 

It includes information about challenges 
experienced by the group during 2022, 
including lapses in the reliability of our 
digital channels and isolated incidents of 
misconduct. These challenges received 
urgent and extensive attention from 
the board and executive management 
during 2022, and we are satisfied that 
appropriate and effective action has 
been taken to address gaps and 
strengthen controls. 

The group is very clear that, if we are to 
successfully drive Africa’s growth, we 
need to tackle economic and 
environmental risks and impacts in an 
holistic and integrated manner. 
Understanding the costs and benefits 

associated with each of these risks and 
impacts is crucial to enable decision-
making that creates a net positive impact. 
The report provides information on how 
we’re managing environmental and social 
risks in respect of who we do business 
with and how we do business, including in 
relation to our client relationships, the 
projects we finance, and our suppliers and 
service providers. Our progress against 
our climate policy and targets, and the 
work we’re doing to better understand 
our risk exposure and our financed 
emissions, is reported in our  Climate-
related financial disclosures. 

Effective engagement with our diverse 
stakeholders is critical to identify and 
understand our material risks and impacts, 
and to ensure our strategy is aligned to 
deliver against the expectations of our 
clients, regulators and shareholders. We 
welcome your feedback.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY
Africa is our home, we drive her growth 
Our commitment to creating positive SEE impact and ensuring effective ESG risk management supports responsible business 
citizenship, underpins our code of ethics and conduct, and creates shared value for the group and society. We depend on effective 
ESG risk management to achieve SEE impact, and deliver our purpose of driving sustainable and inclusive growth in Africa.

MAXIMISE POSITIVE IMPACT
EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE AND  
RISK MANAGEMENT

We aim to maximise positive SEE impacts  
of our business activities and minimise  

negative impact 

We have robust governance frameworks and controls 
in place to manage the environmental, social and 
governance risks associated with our business 

Our adoption of SEE as a strategic value 
driver reflects the commercial opportunity to 
grow earnings and market share by providing 

products and services that meet the 
development needs of Africa and Africa’s people

Our ESG risk management is informed by regulatory 
requirements in our countries of operation, and voluntary 
frameworks such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights, and global standards governing 
environmental and social (E&S) risk management 
including the International Finance Corporation (IFC)  
Performance Standards and Equator Principles.

ESG risk management helps us to minimise and 
mitigate potential negative impacts to society and 
the environment arising from our operations, who we 
do business with and what we finance

We recognise effective ESG risk management as a 
competitive and strategic differentiator

Our SEE commitments align with the UN 
Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), 

Paris Agreement, UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), Agenda 2063, 
and Nationally Determined Contributions 

in our countries of operation

Understanding our material issues 
Our material issues are those that matter most to our stakeholders and 
providers of capital; and that impact on our ability to create value in the 
short, medium and long term. We measure ourselves and our ability to 
achieve our strategic aspirations against six strategic value drivers. 
We have identified the material issues with the potential to impact these 
value drivers, and we have strategies and performance indicators in 
place to ensure we manage these effectively. 

 � The economic, social and environmental context in which we operate 
 � Risks, threats and opportunities facing our business as identified through our 

enterprise risks process
 � Assessment of priority ESG risks as identified by internal stakeholders.
 � The expectations and concerns of our diverse stakeholders, as identified through 

various engagement mechanisms 
 � How we impact on society and the environment, with a focus on our seven SEE 
impact areas. 

We use the concept of double materiality to ensure we understand both how 
material issues may impact on our business, across our six value drivers, and 
how our business materially impacts society. This approach is crucial to ensure 
we deliver both attractive financial outcomes and positive SEE impacts. To 
identify and interrogate our material issues, we consider: 

Engaging our stakeholders  
and understanding our  
material issues

STANDARD BANK GROUP    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT 2022

18401_SBG_ESG • Proof 20 • 31 March 2023

Engaging our stakeholders
Our stakeholders
Our stakeholders are those individuals, groups, and organisations 
that materially affect or could be materially affected by our business 
activities, products, services and performance. They include 

 � Our clients
 � Our employees 
 � Our regulators
 � Our shareholders 
 � Our partners and service providers
 � The communities in which we operate.

Why we engage
Our stakeholders provide us with the resources and capital 
we need to achieve our strategy and purpose; influence 
the environment in which we operate our business; and 
confer legitimacy on our activities. Proactive engagement 
provides us with insights that help shape our strategy 
and inform identification of our material issues and 
enables us to manage and respond to stakeholder 
concerns and minimise reputational risk.

How we engage
We are committed to listening to and constructively 
engaging with all legitimate stakeholders. Given the scale 
of our operations and the diversity of our stakeholders, we 
have adopted a de-centralised stakeholder engagement 
approach. Executives and managers engage regularly with 
diverse stakeholders on relevant issues. The group 
corporate citizenship team (GCC) supports effective 
stakeholder engagement across the group, including 
through direct engagement with stakeholder groups, and 
raising awareness of the need for consistent application of 
our stakeholder engagement principles. 

How we monitor and oversee stakeholder 
engagement 
Executives and managers report material stakeholder 
priorities and concerns to GCC. GCC presents a quarterly 
report to the social and ethics management committee, 
and the social and ethics board committee. These 
committees provide oversight of engagements and 
emerging issues. The group social and ethics board 
committee approves the identification of the group’s 
material issues, taking into account stakeholder 
engagements, and ensures that these are incorporated 
into annual reporting.

We assess the quality of our relationships and 
engagements with our stakeholders based on the nature of 
the relationship, how constructive our dialogues are and 
the outcomes of our relationship metrics over time. The 
complexity and scale of our relationships mean that the 
overall relationship quality for each stakeholder group 
fluctuates over time and with each engagement. Our 
reported outcomes are therefore only indicative of a 
point-in-time assessment. 

Stakeholder engagement 
principles
Stakeholder engagement is 
governed by our group stakeholder 
engagement principles. The 
principles provide a guideline for 
our operations across geographical 
areas, while recognising the need to 
accommodate local contexts. We 
developed the principles in 
consultation with our regional and 
country chief executive officers 
across Africa. We are committed to: 

 � Constructive engagement, 
listening to concerns and 
suggestions with an open mind 

 � Being transparent in our 
engagements 

 � Responding appropriately to 
legitimate concerns 

 � Being accessible 
 � Ensuring that our code of ethics 

and conduct and our values 
underpin and inform our 
engagements.

We also have guidelines and 
policies in place to govern our 
engagements with specific groups 
of stakeholders. These ensure that 
group representatives have an 
appropriate mandate for 
engagement, and that potential 
conduct and reputational risks are 
managed.

Our material 
issues
While our material issues 
evolve over time, the broad 
themes are relatively stable. 
We undertook an in-depth 
review of our material issues in 
2020, a period of substantial 
upheaval and uncertainty 
owing to the onset of the 
Covid-19 pandemic. This 
included engagement with 
diverse stakeholders, internally 
and externally, to identify new 
and emerging priorities. 

Since then, we have made 
minor adjustments to our 
material issues, to reflect 
changes in the global operating 
environment, the growing 
urgency of the climate crisis, 
evolving stakeholder priorities, 
and industry developments. 
These updates were reviewed 
and approved by the group 
social and ethics committee 
and, subsequently, the group 
board. Based on our 
understanding of group and 
stakeholder priorities, we 
defined our material issues in 
2022 as follows:

ESG governance
Board’s role 
Our board is responsible for guiding the 
group's strategy, overseeing our progress 
against our strategic priorities and value 
drivers, including the delivery of positive 
SEE impact, and assessing the 
effectiveness of our risk management 

processes, including ESG risk. It sets the 
tone from the top, and monitors our 
adherence  to our code of ethics and 
conduct, applicable laws and regulations 
and relevant non-binding rules and 
standards. Board committees meet 
quarterly and provide feedback to the full 

board. Responsibilities in respect of ESG 
risk management are delegated to several 
board sub-committees. 

We continue to improve the depth and 
breadth of ESG skills on the board and 
available to the board. During 2022, our 

boards in Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Lesotho, 
Mauritius, Namibia, Uganda and 
Zimbabwe, together with the Standard 
Bank Insurance (SIL) board and 
management, participated in ESG 
training, including climate risk training.

Governance issues, including ethics 
and conduct, prevention of financial 
crime, information security and  
cybersecurity, and engagement with 
diverse stakeholders 

First line: Business is responsible for analysing, 
acknowledging and managing the risk it incurs in 
conducting its activities.

Second line: Risk management functions 
identify, measure, monitor and report risk on an 
enterprise-wide basis, independently from the 
first line.

Third line: Internal audit conducts risk-based 
and general audits to provide assurance to the 
board that the overall governance framework, 
including the risk governance framework, is 
effective and that policies and processes are in 
place and consistently applied.

Social issues, including respect for 
human rights, labour practices, health 
and safety, financial inclusion and our 
impacts on communities

Environmental issues, including 
impacts on natural resources, 
biodiversity, and climate-related risks 
and opportunities. 

Management’s role 
Executive oversight 
Our ESG risk governance framework 
provides executive management with an 
integrated view of our ESG risks. It defines 
structures and accountability for the 
oversight, governance and execution of 
ESG risk management, including:

Our three lines of management model sets out the 
responsibilities of individuals and teams to ensure that 
risks are adequately considered and managed. 

Group risk committees oversee the implementation of 
the ESG risk governance framework, and report to the 
relevant board committees. ESG risk management is 
integrated into the group’s risk management framework. 
All identified material risks are prioritised and monitored 
through indicators or other qualitative measures. We 
continue to leverage data and develop intuitive risk 
management processes, supported by digitisation. 
Breaches of risk thresholds are escalated to the 
appropriate governance structures.

We integrate respect for human rights into our day-to-day operations and in the 
way we do business. This includes:

 � Providing a work environment for our people that respects their human rights. 
This commitment is reflected in our people policies and practices, including our 
code of ethics and conduct, our human rights statement, and policies governing 
diversity and inclusion, harassment in the workplace, discrimination in the 
workplace, sexual harassment in the workplace, occupational health and safety 
and whistleblowing. 

 � Exercising due diligence in deciding who we do business with and understanding 
the potential human rights impacts of our business relationships, purchasing, 
lending and investing. 

 � Combating financial crime and corruption in all its forms, including extortion, 
bribery, and money laundering

 � Adhering to the Equator Principles in project financing
 � Monitoring ESG risk in our supply chain 
 � Encouraging our clients, suppliers and business partners to avoid human rights 

infringements in their businesses. 

We seek to avoid causing human rights infringements and being complicit in the 
human rights infringements of other parties. We do not tolerate slavery, forced 
labour or human trafficking in any form and will never knowingly be party to any 
activity that would violate the modern slavery laws, rules and requirements that 
apply to us. 

We require all employees to report any alleged or suspected human rights 
violations to the appropriate leadership structures or via the group’s  
  whistleblowing hotline. We take appropriate steps where we discover, or are 
made aware, that we have caused or contributed to actual or perceived human 
rights abuses. This may include disciplinary action, exiting a business relationship, 
or constructive engagement to promote better practice. 

Principles and frameworks
Our ESG risk management framework is supported by our code of ethics and conduct 
and related policies and standards, our third-party code of conduct, our human rights 
statement, our exceptions list, our E&S risk governance standard and policy, and our 
whistleblowing policy. 

Code of ethics and conduct 
Our group code of ethics and conduct guides our decision-making, behaviours and 
interactions with our diverse stakeholders. It informs how we conduct ourselves in 
terms of how we treat one another, our clients and other stakeholders and how we 
manage our impacts on society and the environment. It informs group policies, 
standards and risk management controls. We updated the code in 2022 to ensure that 
our focus on achieving positive SEE impacts is effectively reflected. 
  Ethics and Conduct for more information.

Third-party code of conduct
We require all third parties contracted to provide services to the group to attest to the 
group’s third-party code of conduct, which is based on the group code of ethics and 
conduct. Failure to comply with the third-party code of conduct is regarded as a 
violation of the terms of contract and may result in termination of the contract.  
  Procurement and Third-Party Risk Management for more information

Human rights statement
We are committed to respecting the human rights of people involved in and impacted by 
our business. This commitment includes our employees, our suppliers and service 
providers, and the people impacted by the projects and businesses we finance. We 
define human rights as the basic and universal rights that underpin each person’s 
inherent freedom, dignity, and equality, as outlined in the UN Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work. We align with the UN Principles for Business and Human 
Rights in terms of understanding our role in ensuring that human rights are respected.

Exceptions list 
Our  exceptions list specifies activities for which no entity within Standard 
Bank Group will provide banking or lending facilities.

E&S risk governance standard and policy
Our E&S risk governance standard sets out the group’s  E&S risk 
management framework, which provides for the governance, identification, 
measurement, management and reporting of E&S risks associated with the 
group’s activities. The standard is supported by the group E&S risk policy, which 
details how the framework should be implemented. The standard and policy 
apply to the group's banking business1, in relation to our business, commercial 
and corporate clients. They also apply to products such as loans, trade finance, 
project finance, debt and equity market services. 

Group environmental and social risk (GESR) is responsible for reviewing, 
updating and ensuring the effective implementation of the standard and policy. 
Our E&S risk management processes are based on international good practice 
and align with the requirements of the Equator Principles, the IFC Performance 
Standards, and the Principles for Responsible Banking. As a member of the 
Equator Principles Association, Standard Bank commits to evaluate and actively 
avoid and mitigate any negative social or environmental impacts when we lend 
or provide advisory services to a project. 

Group climate policy
Our  climate policy commits the group to achieving net zero for financed 
emissions by 2050, and for scope 1 and 2 emissions for our own operations by 
2030 for newly built facilities and 2040 for existing facilities. Our climate policy 
takes the African environmental, social, and economic context as its starting 
point. We aim to support a just energy transition to a lower carbon economy, to 
support efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change and to improve access 
to reliable and sustainable energy sources, a critical factor in Africa’s economic 
growth and poverty alleviation. 

We are working with our clients to support their climate transitions and enable 
the adoption of mitigation and adaptation strategies. 

Whistleblowing 
We have a comprehensive process in place to enable employees and external 
stakeholders, including service providers and impacted communities, to raise concerns 
if they become aware of behaviours or actions that they believe are not in line with the 
group’s values and code of ethics and conduct. 

If an employee has any concerns about a behaviour or incident that they believe 
deviates from the group's values or code of ethics and conduct, they are required to 
report these. Employees and external stakeholders should report any actual and/or 
suspected acts of unlawful, irregular or unethical behaviour by the group, our 
employees, suppliers or third parties, under the provisions of the group's 
whistleblowing policy. We encourage our stakeholders to raise concerns and make 
disclosures in good faith, and in a transparent manner, without fear of victimisation or 
prejudice. 

A whistleblower is not expected to prove the truth of an allegation but will need to show 
that there are enough grounds of concern that it is reasonable to suspect unlawful, 
irregular or unethical conduct. 

Whistleblowers are encouraged to use available reporting channels and provide 
sufficient information to enable an investigation to take place. No whistleblower shall be 
disadvantaged when reporting legitimate concerns in good faith or on the basis of a 
reasonable belief. Our whistleblowing policy provides for the protected disclosure of 
any attempted, suspected or actual unlawful, irregular or unethical behaviour that 
employees come across in the group in terms of South Africa’s Protected Disclosures 
Act, 2014. 

Our policy includes the process to follow if the whistleblower encounters adverse 
reaction on making a disclosure. The group is not obliged to protect a whistleblower 
who makes a false disclosure in bad faith or maliciously, or who unfairly or unjustly 
discredits another person. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken in these cases.

The group provides various reporting channels for employees and other 
stakeholders to report concerns about unethical or unlawful behaviour. 

 � Employees: Information on our whistleblowing policy and processes is 
readily available to all employees. Through regular email communications 
and training interventions, we actively encourage employees to use these 
channels if they have any concerns. All internal reports and disclosures 
are treated on a case-by-case basis. We offer different levels of 
confidentiality and anonymity depending on the whistleblower’s 
preference. If the whistleblower requests that their identity be kept 
confidential or anonymous, this request will be respected. The group will 
always protect the whistleblower’s identity. Employees may raise 
concerns or report issues via: 

 – Group investigation and fraud risk (GIFR) or the head of investigations 
and fraud risk in-country 

 – People and culture 
 – Line managers 
 – The group’s independent, confidential  whistleblowing hotline 
 – Persons or bodies external to the group, as defined by the policy. 

 � External stakeholders: External stakeholders are encouraged to use the 
whistleblowing hotline. Emails can be sent to: whistleblowingline@
tip-offs.com. External stakeholders may also make a report to a legal 
representative, with the object of and while obtaining legal advice; to 
relevant regulatory bodies, or a prescribed person or body that the 
whistleblower reasonably believes would usually deal with these matters.

Issues which may be reported to the whistleblowing hotline include: 
 � Behaviour that is likely to cause financial harm or reputational damage to 

the group, including breaches of group policies and procedures 
 � Failure to comply with the applicable country domiciled law 
 � Abuse of human rights 
 � Any instance or suspected instance of injustice 
 � Discrimination, harassment, victimisation, bullying or sexual misconduct 
 � Danger to the health and safety of an individual 
 � Environmental damage 
 � Abuse of power or authority 
 � Fraud, theft, bribery or corruption 
 � Abuse of group or client resources and assets 
 � Misrepresentation of information 
 � Mismanagement or maladministration 
 � Deliberately concealing information about any of the above. 

Investigations 
All reports received via the whistleblowing hotline are referred to GIFR, who 
assesses the reports and determines appropriate action. Where appropriate 
and where cases fall outside GIFR mandate, cases may be referred to other 
corporate functions, such as people and culture, or the relevant head of 
business unit or country. 

GIFR acknowledges receipt of disclosures made via the whistleblowing hotline 
in writing and informs the whistleblower (or the whistleblowing hotline if the 
matter was raised anonymously) whether or not the matter will be investigated. 
A decision not to investigate may be taken if insufficient information is provided 
by the whistleblower, or the allegations do not impact the group or our 
employees, for example. 

If a decision to investigate is made, GIFR will also communicate, where 
possible, the timeframe in which investigations will be completed or updates 
provided. Feedback timelines as provided by the Protected Disclosures 
Amendment Act 2017 are applied and adhered to. GIFR conducts investigations 
in an independent and objective manner. All reasonable steps are taken to 
ensure that all aspects of the matter and associated evidence are examined. 

When investigations are concluded, feedback is provided to the whistleblower 
or to the whistleblowing hotline. Findings of matters that were referred to other 
business units for assessment are also reviewed by GIFR, and GIFR provides 
feedback on these matters to the whistleblower or the whistleblowing hotline. 
Due to confidentiality, details of the investigation outcome are not provided but 
rather feedback that confirms the necessary action in accordance with the 
group’s policies.

Ethics, conduct and fair outcomes for clients

We published the group’s revised group code of ethics and conduct, 
which reflects the three pillars of our approach to ethics in action.

97% of group employees completed training based on the group 
code of ethics and conduct.

We adopted a new approach to conduct risk reporting to enable 
stronger oversight by board and executive committees. 

We undertook an initial assessment to identify our material human 
rights risks and impacts in respect of our employees, our clients, our 
supply chain and the communities impacted by our services. 

Conduct risk remained within risk appetite, as assessed by the 
various lines of business. Conduct-related breaches were addressed 
within specific business areas.

We revised the complaints management framework and standards 
to align to client expectations and the Conduct Standard for Banks, 
established a dedicated complaints management team, streamlined 
our systems and strengthened ownership and accountability, and 
enhanced reporting and monitoring.

We achieved a 43% improvement in the resolution of complaints, 
increased the proportion of complaints resolved within 72 hours by 
43% and improved the average turnaround time to handle complaints 
by 78%.

Principles and 
frameworks
Our  code of ethics and conduct guides our 
decision-making, behaviours and interactions with 
our diverse stakeholders, and how we manage our 
impacts on society and the environment. It 
provides the benchmark against which we assess 
our performance, as individuals and a group. It is 
based on three pillars, linked to our purpose and 
values. 

It aligns with global and national regulatory and 
governance standards across our countries of 
operation. It helps us ensure that we conduct 
ourselves lawfully and within the legal frameworks 
of the countries in which we operate. It aims to 
empower us to make principle-based decisions, 
and to encourage honest and robust discussion to 
determine the appropriate course of action in any 
situation.

Our code is applicable to all Standard Bank 
employees (full-time and part-time) and 
consultants. It applies to our board members, 
including non-executives, and to employees of our 
subsidiaries, except where the subsidiary has its 
own code of ethics which aligns with Standard 
Bank’s code. The code informs our group policies, 
standards and risk management controls.

Adherence to the values, principles and

Managing risk incidents  
and breaches 
Every area of the business is required to identify any behaviour that 
is contrary to the group’s culture and ethics and to take disciplinary 
action in line with conduct risk management standards, in 
conjunction with relevant people and culture partners. 

Any breach of the group’s code of ethics and conduct can be a 
failure to comply with the code is a violation of terms of 
employment, which may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and 
including dismissal.

In 2022, a small number of employees (0.2% of group 
employees) were involved in the inappropriate activation of 
MyMo accounts in South Africa. The group acted quickly to 
investigate the matter and implement internal disciplinary 
processes. As at 8 March 2023, 89 employees had been 
dismissed. There was no disadvantage to customers. 
Following a thorough investigation, the group is satisfied 
that this was an isolated incident that it is not indicative of 
any wider issue related to conduct, sales practices or 
incentive structures. The large majority of group employees 
continue to show deep understanding of and adherence to 
the group’s code of ethics and conduct. We have reviewed 
our conduct training to identify opportunities for 
improvement and have received positive feedback from 
employees to the revisions we have implemented.

Fair outcomes  
for clients
Conduct risk is the risk of inappropriate 
execution of business activities resulting in 
adverse impacts to our clients, markets or 
the group itself.

The includes governance arrangements, 
business models, product development, 
sales practices, treating clients fairly 
outcomes, and remuneration and incentive 
structures. Our approach to conduct aims 
to ensure that the group maintains a client 
centric culture focused on achieving fair 
client outcomes.

Conduct risk management 
We place our clients at the centre of our 
business activities and aim to ensure that 
our decisions support the delivery of fair 
client outcomes. We are committed to 
treating all clients objectively and fairly and 
applying policies equitably to all, 
regardless of individual differences. We do 
not tolerate unfair discrimination on any 
grounds. The group has no appetite for 
unfair client outcomes arising from 
inappropriate judgement and conduct in 
the execution of our business activities, or 
wilful breaches of regulatory requirements.

Our code of ethics and conduct is 
supported by our comprehensive approach 
to conduct risk management. We have 
adopted a culture-led approach to 
managing conduct. Conduct risk 
management is integrated into all relevant 
group policies and processes and 
managed as part of the group’s non-
financial risk management framework.  
Our conduct risk policy sets out the 
requirements for timely identification, 
reporting, escalation, and remediation 
when conduct risk is identified. 

Conduct risk is governed by conduct 
oversight committees within client 
segments and corporate functions, 
together with the social and ethics 
management committee and group social 
and ethics committee. Conduct oversight 
committees are responsible for: 

 � Promoting sound culture and conduct 
standards 

 � Identifying emerging trends in conduct 
and behaviour 

 � Aligning conduct risk management with 
regulatory requirements and business 
objectives 

 � Monitoring and interrogating conduct 
risk management information and 
indicators 

 � Identifying conduct risk specific to their 
business and taking appropriate risk 
mitigating actions 

 � Reporting conduct risk management 
information and material control issues 
to enable the board and executive 
management to exercise oversight and 
management. 

All areas of the business submit quarterly 
conduct dashboards to executive 
management. The dashboards include 
information about risks, complaints and 
grievances received via various channels, 
investigations, breaches and remedial 
actions taken. The dashboards are 
reviewed by the social and ethics 
management committee and group social 
and ethics board committee. 

All client segments and corporate 
functions must regularly assess the impact 
of changes on conduct risk exposure 
arising from new product development, 
third-party relationships, regulatory trends, 
business models and material system and 
process changes. 

Product design and delivery 
The group is committed to providing our 
products and services honestly, fairly, with 
due skill, care and diligence, and in the 
interest of clients. We provide clients with 
clear, transparent and appropriate product 
information, including information on 
features and risks. We provide all relevant 
disclosures before, during and at final 
contract for the product or service. We 
ensure information provided to clients is 
factually correct, in plain language and not 
misleading, and adequate and appropriate 
in the circumstances, taking account of the 
established or reasonably assumed level of 
knowledge of the client. We provide 
information timeously to give the client 
reasonably sufficient time to make an 
informed decision. We ensure client needs 
and eligibility of products are identified 
through a robust and objective evaluation 
process and consider clients’ individual 
circumstances and ability to bear 
associated costs or risks when providing 
products and services.

Products are subject to ongoing review, 
monitoring and reporting of product 
performance and suitability, including at 
monthly product risk and compliance 
committees and the product governance 
committee. We identify and implement 
product changes and enhancements based 
on ongoing and regular feedback from 
employees, including frontline employees, 
and customers. We analyse client 
satisfaction index (CSI) results, net 
promoter scores (NPS) and complaint data 
regularly to identify potential areas for 
improvement. We provide specific product 
training for sales employees and third-party 
suppliers within authorised roles.

Fair pricing
We provide our customers with clear information 
regarding fees and costs payable. Relevant 
committees oversee pricing considerations, annual 
pricing reviews and other business as usual reviews. 
Pricing reviews take into account customer insights 
obtained through surveys, complaints and feedback 
received through relationship managers, together with 
information regarding the competitive environment, 
regulatory guidance, and cost to serve. Group 
compliance participates in pricing approval processes, 
to ensure that customers are treated fairly. 

Advertising and marketing 
The marketing and communication (MC) risk and 
conduct committee oversees that group’s MC operating 
model and is responsible for the management of risk 
within MC, including ensuring adherence to the group 
code of ethics and conduct. The committee meets 
quarterly. 

Material advertising and communications campaigns or 
initiatives are presented at a weekly campaign council 
forum. The forum provides feedback on issues such as 
regulatory compliance, customer relevance, brand 
alignment and clarity. The forum, together with business, 
group legal and group compliance, all play a part in the 
advertising approval process, helping to ensure the 
achievement of fair customer outcomes and compliance 
with all disclosure requirements. While the development 
of advertising is outsourced, no outsourced supplier is 
mandated to place advertisements on our behalf and 
advertisements may not be placed without the group’s 
approval process being followed.

We subscribe to South Africa’s Advertising Regulatory 
Board’s (ARB) code of advertising practice. The ARB is 
an independent body set up and paid for by the 

marketing communication industry to ensure that its 
system of self-regulation works in the public interest.  
The code is based on the international code of 
advertising practice, prepared by the International 
Chamber of Commerce. The ARB code is amended from 
time to time to meet the changing needs the industry 
and society.

Customers may opt out of any and all forms of digital 
and direct marketing. We differentiate between 
marketing material and critical operational 
communication. For example, should our banking 
systems experience an outage, we will still communicate 
relevant information to clients such as the status of the 
outage, alternative means of banking, and progress on 
resolving the issue.

Responding to client complaints
Our complaints management system is modelled on the principles of fairness, accessibility, responsiveness and 
efficiency. Our complaints management policy is designed to comply with applicable regulatory obligations across 
the group, ensuring that the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders are clearly set out and the requirements 
for complaints management procedures are documented. The policy applies to all employees of the group, 
regardless of location or business unit. It reflects the group’s minimum requirements. It may be supplemented by 
additional requirements in a local jurisdiction, or by a business policy or procedure. 

Each business area has a complaints management framework, underpinned by standards for the effective 
resolution of complaints. Each area also has a complaint resolution system (CRS) that enables the capturing and 
management of complaints. All employees responsible for the capturing, management and resolution of 
complaints receive relevant training. Each business area’s complaints management procedure is publicly available. 
Business areas maintain management information in respect of all complaints and use this for root cause analysis 
to ensure appropriate action is taken to address areas of concern. When compensating a client, the principles of 
treating customers fairly and all other relevant legislation are considered.

CHNW has a dedicated team responsible for monitoring and oversight of adherence to the 
complaints management framework and a dedicated complaints management team responsible 
for complaints management, detection and prevention. The executive complaints management 
team deals with complaints and disputes referred to them internally as well as informal referrals 
from the Ombudsman for Banking Services (OBS),  while the complaints resolution centre deals 
with complaints logged directly by customers.

SBSA's  retail business has an independent and 
impartial internal Customer Dispute Adjudicator 
(CDA), mandated to resolve disputes between the bank 
and customers by means of adjudication, taking into 
account the law, equity, industry codes and good 
banking practice. 

Disputes that may be escalated to the office of the CDA 
include those referred by relevant OBS, FAIS Ombud, the 
Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), and other 
regulatory bodies, consumer bodies and Ombud’s 
offices, which SBSA's Complaints Resolution Centre 
(CRC) cannot resolve. 

The CDA does not have jurisdiction in respect of 
decisions to grant credit (commercial discretion); pricing 
(fees and charges unless the complaint relates to the 
incorrect application of SBSA’s fee structure); material 
disputes of fact that cannot be resolved on a balance of 
probabilities; disputes best suited to an alternative forum 
(such as a court of law due to complexity); corporate and 
investment banking related disputes; and offshore 
banking services and solutions unless the dispute is 
escalated by the FAIS Ombud’s office.

Formal OBS complaints closed in favour of clients include 
complaints where there was no liability, negligence or 
maladministration on the part of SBSA however the bank 
settled these matters as a gesture of goodwill.

2022 Accolades 
In 2022, Standard Bank’s Enterprise Architecture (EA) team was one of three 
recipients of Forrester’s 2022 EA award, for excellence in executing an enterprise 
wide, outcomes-driven EA practice that puts customers at the centre. The team was 
recognised for developing a model that evolves our business towards a platform 
organisation, enabling integrated teams to deliver client-centred solutions aligned to 
our technology strategy. Business structures and capabilities have been configured 
to meet future customer and employee needs with adaptivity, creativity, and 
resilience, while our architecture community forums enable continuous collaboration 
to leverage best EA practices. 

Reliability of digital transaction channels 

We made structural and process changes in response to material system 
outages in the first half of 2022, enabling us to improve system stability and 
resilience. We experienced no material incidents in the second half of the year. 

No client impacting cyber incidents or cyber related losses were experienced 
in 2022.

Our response and recovery times significantly improved in the second half of 
the year. We can successfully failover (switch to a standby system) in the 
event of near misses, mitigating the risk of outages and impacts to the client.

In South Africa, our customer NPS scores across all digital channels 
showed improvement in the second half of 2022. 

We improved our communications approach in the event of outages 
experienced, to ensure that we can effectively and timeously engage impacted 
customers.

Group technology had positive engagements with the group board, regulators 
and investors, to ensure clear understanding of what caused the outages in 
early 2022, and what we have done to improve system resilience.

Principles and frameworks
Back to Basics 
The stability, security and speed of our IT systems is central to our 
ability to deliver against our purpose and strategy. Our priorities 
include: 

 � Improving the reliability of the group’s critical business processes 
and services

 � Implementing advanced level observability (the ability to measure a 
system's current state based on the data it generates)

 � Streamlining processes for real-time decision-making and 
production oversight

 � Using a risk sensitive approach to change management, baseline 
service availability and performance levels 

 � Fully understanding the root causes of incidents, implementing 
effective mitigation and ensuring no repeat causes

 � Working with our strategic third-party partners on system health 
reviews.

Risk incidents and 
breaches 
In the first half of 2022, we experienced six material 
outages. Four of these incidents took place during April 
and May in South Africa.  

While the security and confidentiality of our clients' 
information was never at risk, these outages caused 
significant inconvenience and frustration for our 
customers, and impacted negatively on our brand and 
reputation. 

We identified and fixed the root causes of these 
incidents and implemented corrective actions to 
strengthen system stability and resilience. While it is not 
possible to totally avoid outages, we have implemented 
changes to systems, processes and culture to ensure 
that incidents are escalated quickly and effectively, and 
that services can be restored quickly, thereby 
minimising the impact on clients. 

In the second half of 2022, we experienced no 
significant incidents with seven successive months of 
month-end technology stability.

We improved our communications approach in the 
event of outages, to ensure that communications are 
effectively directed to impacted customers. This 
includes two-way communication on SBG mobile, 
in-platform communications via internet banking and 
the mobile app, clear communication of alternative 
channels should one or more channels experience 
difficulties, and information about available helplines. 

Employee responsibilities 
Core elements of our approach to strengthening system 
stability and security include recognition that we are one 
united team, bringing together a wealth of diverse 
experience and skills; a focus on transparency and open 
communication; a commitment to escalate any issues 
rapidly to ensure fast recovery; and a strong sense of 
accountability and pride in our work.

Information security,  
data privacy and cybersecurity 

We increased client awareness of cyber risks through programmes on 
social media, email and SMS communications and posters in branches,  
and conducted cyber risk masterclasses and board sessions for  
corporate clients. 

We improved the mean-time-to-detect and mean-time-to-respond to 
cyber incidents across all legal entities.

We introduced DigiME to reduce digital fraud and impersonation and 
minimise client losses and achieved over 2.1 million registrations.

In South Africa, we matured the SA data privacy and protection office to 
ensure compliance with new regulatory frameworks.

We launched an online information risk masterclass series as part of  
our non-financial risk (NFR) skills development programme. 

We detected and successfully mitigated several attempted cyber threats, 
leading to zero material incidents for the year.

fundamental human right and apply robust 
processes to give effect to the right to privacy. 
This requires constant vigilance in respect of 
information risk, cyber risk, client privacy, 
technology risk and third-party risk. 

 � We are committed to safeguarding clients’ data 
and money from cyber threats. Cyber risk 
receives extensive focus from the board and 
executives.

We manage data privacy, information security and 
cybersecurity within the framework of the following 
policies and standards: 

 � The code of ethics and conduct requires all 
employees to protect the confidentiality of client 

information, protect group intellectual property 
and disclose information on intellectual property 
to relevant parties on a need-to-know basis only.

 � The enterprise-wide risk management 
framework incorporates cyber and information 
risk types as material risks to be managed. 

 � The information risk governance standard 
sets out minimum requirements for information 
risk management and the philosophy of 
information risk, including data privacy risk, to 
be adopted across the group. It ensures 
alignment between interconnected risk types, 
such as cyber risk and technology risk. 

 � The information risk policy sets out principles 
and minimum requirements to manage risk to all 
types of information assets, in all formats, owned 
by or entrusted to the group throughout the 
information lifecycle, including information in 
motion, information in use and information at 
rest. It applies to all employees and third parties, 
including independent service providers. 

 � The data privacy operating standard applies 
to the processing of all personal information 
relating to prospective, existing and former data 
subjects, including clients, employees, third 
parties, natural persons or juristic persons. It 
deals with the protection of personal information 
throughout its lifecycle, from originate through 
to use, retain and dispose. 

 � The cyber resilience standard defines roles 
and responsibilities for managing cyber risk and 
enables accurate measurement and reporting of 
the status of cybersecurity controls. 

Information risk is the risk of accidental or intentional 
unauthorised use, access, modification, disclosure, dissemination 
or destruction of information resources, which would compromise 
the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and 
which would potentially harm the business. 

 � Data privacy risk is the accidental or intentional compromise 
and/or unlawful processing of Personally Identifiable 
Information at any point during its lifecycle, which would 
potentially cause harm to the business and/or data subject. 

Cyber risk is the risk of a digital attack on the bank’s systems for 
financial gain, either directly through attacks on payment systems, 
or indirectly through stolen data or extortion.

The group information risk governance standard and 
cybersecurity resilience standard are aligned with international 
best practice, including the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) 27000 series; ISO 27018 and 29100; 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Privacy 
Framework; King IV Report on Corporate Governance; Information 
Security Forum (ISF) Standard of Good Practice (SoGP) for 
Information Security; Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard; Data Administration Management Association Data 
Management Body Of Knowledge; The Bank for International 
Settlements' Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures 
and the International Organization of Securities Commissions 
(CPMI-IOSCO) Guidelines for Cyber Resilience.

Data privacy 
We are committed to protecting the 
personal information of clients, third 
parties and employees. We apply robust 
processes to give effect to the right to 
privacy. Our data privacy approach 
incorporates the requirements of all 
relevant privacy legislation and regulation 
and industry standards and codes, across 
our countries of operation. This includes 
General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR), and South Africa’s Protection of 
Personal Information Act (POPIA), Data 
Privacy and Promotion of Access to 
Information Act (PAIA) and Code of 
Banking Practice. Legislative and 
regulative requirements per jurisdiction 
are identified and embedded into 
applicable risk management processes. 

We adhere to the following principles 
when processing personal information:

 � Privacy is top of mind in all our business 
activities and projects and remains our 
responsibility.

 � We only collect the personal 
information that we need, we collect it 
lawfully and process it based on the 
lawful grounds provided by legislation.

 � We always keep our customers 
informed and ensure they know what 
personal information we need, and why 
we need it.

 � We empower and enable our customers 
to access and update their personal 
information at any time. Requests from 
data subjects to amend or delete their 
personal information may be made via 
our customer service channels or 
directly to the information officer.

 � We do not process customers’ personal 
information beyond the purpose for 
which we originally collected it.

 � We treat the personal information we 
collect through our various channels as 
private and confidential. Our privacy 
statement and cookie notice apply 
when using these channels.

 �   The Standard Bank Group 
privacy statement addresses the 
requirements of the various 
jurisdictions in which we operate. 

 �   The SBSA privacy statement 
incorporates national legislative and 
regulatory requirements. 

 � Both statements provide clarity for data 
subjects (including clients, prospective 
clients and third parties) in terms of 
how we use, respect and treat personal 
information; and how they may exercise 
their rights in relation to their personal 
information. 

Information security 
 � Information assets must be identified and documented in the formal 

information asset register.
 � Formal ownership of information assets must be assigned and 

accountability taken for protecting confidentiality, integrity and 
availability.

 � Information must be protected throughout its lifecycle and retained 
and destroyed in accordance with legal, regulatory and industry 
requirements where applicable.

 � Information must be classified into levels of sensitivity and protected 
accordingly, throughout its footprint (wherever it exists and whatever 
the form) and the footprint must be documented.

 � Access to information assets must be managed on a need-to-know 
and need-to have basis. Logical and physical access will be granted 
only to ensure the effective execution of official responsibilities and 
accordance with the role. 

 � Full accountability must be implemented for all identified high risk 
profiles and roles. 

 � Risks to our information are reported at various governance and risk 
committees.

Cybersecurity 
Cyber risk is governed by the group chief 
information security officer (CISO), who is 
responsible for creating, measuring and 
monitoring the cybersecurity strategy and 
programme. The CISO provides regular updates to 
the board on the group’s cyber risk posture. The 
board gets independent assurance through 
internal and external audits of the cyber resilience 
controls. The board also mandates bi-annual 
assessments of the cyber strategy by global 
cybersecurity experts. The most recent 
assessment was conducted by Arete Advisors, a 
US based cyber incident response firm.

The group information security function is 
responsible for upholding a culture of security 
across the group, fulfilling regulatory requirements 
and providing a robust control environment, all 
centred on maintaining our clients’ trust in our 
digital platforms. We continue to invest in 
improved capabilities to predict, prevent, detect 
and respond to cyber incidents. We gather cyber 
threat intelligence, which is shared across the 
group to enable risk mitigation and inform 
improvements to the cyber resilience programme.

Cyber risk issues and trends are reported monthly 
to relevant management and risk forums: 

 � The CISO provides updates on information 
security matters to the board via the group 
information technology committee and the 
group non-financial risk committee, on a 
quarterly basis. 

 � The cyber resilience programme employs a 
continuous testing/continuous monitoring 
strategy to ensure the security profile is 
maintained. Testing includes technology testing 
(vulnerability scanning, penetration testing), 
people testing (mandatory training, security 

awareness and mock phishing campaigns) and response 
testing (cyber incident simulations, disaster recovery 
testing) to stress test security capabilities. Monitoring 
includes using machine learning and data analytics to 
continuously measure the effectiveness of controls across 
the group. 

 � These measures provide a near real-time view of the cyber 
risk profile and have been incorporated into the group value 
metrics. 

 � We run monthly awareness campaigns on the latest threats 
and risks. As part of the continuous testing approach, mock 
phishing campaigns are run against every employee at least 
once a year.

Standard Bank employs nearly 300 dedicated cybersecurity 
experts across the group, one of the largest corporate 
security teams on the continent. Security skills are 
continuously developed to keep up with the latest 
technology trends, tools and techniques used by attackers. 
We contribute to the larger security community by 
participating in industry cyber risk forums, extending our 
cyber risk management experience to our partners, service 
providers and third parties, and supporting internal and 
industry-led security skills development initiatives to 
improve the shortfall of cybersecurity skills across the 
continent.

The group non-financial risk management 
policy requires that all operational risk incidents 
must be identified and reported within 
stipulated time frames and recorded in the RMP 
(risk marketplace). All employees are 
responsible for reporting level 1 and 2 
operational risk incidents as soon as possible 
and at least within 48 hours after the incident 
has been identified. Other incidents must be 
reported within 30 days of discovery. Incidents 
are centrally recorded in the RMP system to 
enable root cause analysis, reporting and 
appropriate closure. 

All information risk incidents must be reported, 
escalated and handled in accordance with 
relevant group policies. The group differentiates 
between information incidents and data privacy 
breaches to support our external regulatory 
reporting obligations. The impact of incidents 
and breaches are assessed against a materiality 
matrix as part of our broader non-financial risk 
management framework.

We investigate all reported incidents of privacy 
infringements and loss of client data. Data 
privacy officers are responsible for ensuring 
that data privacy breaches are reported to 
regulators in a timely manner and in 
accordance with regulatory requirements (in 

South Africa breaches are reported in line with 
POPIA). The Information Regulator (or similar 
regulating body) and data subjects are notified 
in instances where there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that the personal information 
of a data subject has been accessed or acquired 
by an unauthorised person. Client complaints 
are addressed swiftly, with a focus on giving the 
best possible service to our clients. If an 
information incident or data privacy breach 
occurs at a third-party supplier or service 
provider, Standard Bank will act to ensure that 
the impact on our clients is mitigated. 

Cyber incidents are coordinated by a central 
cybersecurity team. As part of the response, a  
cybersecurity incident response team (CSIRT) 
is convened, including representatives from 
business, risk and technology. The group 
maintains dedicated cyber insurance cover for 
additional protection against common cyber 
threats.

Disciplinary or legal action may be taken against 
any employees or third parties who do not 
comply with group information risk and cyber 
risk policies. Where such non-compliance 
constitutes gross misconduct by an employee, it 
may result in dismissal. 

Risk incidents and breaches

Metrics 
 � Detected and successfully 

mitigated several attempted 
cyber threats, with zero 
material incidents. Learnings 
from these incidents are 
incorporated into the cyber 
resilience strategy. 

 � Four significant data privacy 
breaches over the past two 
years, all of which occurred via 
third parties. We worked with 
the relevant third parties to 
mitigate risks and address the 
root causes of the incidents. 
No fines or penalties were 
imposed against the group. 

 � 276 privacy complaints, 
most of which related to 
correction of information or 
correspondence sent to 
incorrect recipient.

Validation  
and audit 
Internal audit conducts information 
and cyber risk related reviews 
annually to test security and 
vulnerability of systems and 
processes affecting user data. 
Standard Bank positively attested 
to the 2021 SWIFT Customer 
Security Programme (CSP) 
requirements, validated through an 
external audit. Internal audit 
reviewed compliance with the 2022 
CSP requirements. Security 
controls are reviewed annually as 
part of the combined assurance 
audit of the group’s financial results. 
Cyber risk management is also part 
of the scope of this external audit.

The group has pursued certification 
of specific technology infrastructure 
where it is regulated:

 � ISO27000 certification for the 
Shared Africa Regions Core 
Banking Platform

 � ISO27000 certifications for Core 
Banking for Uganda, Nigeria and 
Ghana

 � PCI-DSS certifications for Ghana, 
Nigeria, Namibia.

These are re-audited periodically to 
maintain the certification.

Third-party responsibilities 
The group proactively manages third-party risk. Third parties are onboarded through a rigorous process designed to assess the third party across 
various risk dimensions. The group has created an external party information risk management policy that outlines the minimum 
expectations from our third parties in protecting our information. It applies to all third parties, including independent service providers and is 
aligned to the group information risk policy and principles. All third parties processing or accessing group information are required to read and 
attest to the policy as part of the procurement onboarding process. Data protection and data privacy clauses are also included in contract 
agreements with third parties. Where third parties provide digital solutions, the third party must ensure security requirements are met, in line with 
the cyber resilience standard. Contracts also include a ‘right to audit’ clause, allowing for periodic assessments of the third parties.

Combating financial crime

We successfully enhanced transaction monitoring and 
screening systems, resulting in improved AML/CFT and 
sanctions detection capabilities across multiple jurisdictions. 

We partnered with an artificial intelligence solution service 
provider to complement existing detection and investigation 
systems and platforms.

98% of group employees successfully completed mandatory 
compliance training on AML/CTF and anti-bribery and 
corruption.

98% of employees successfully completed role-specific 
mandatory compliance training on AML.

99.5% of employees completed role-specific tax evasion 
training.

We submitted our first six-month action plan and progress 
report to the South African Reserve Bank Prudential 
Authority in June 2022, and our updated progress in 
September 2022, as part of South Africa's response to the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report.

About 8 000 independent service providers undertook 
training using the Standard Bank Independent Service 
provider training portal.

2022 highlights

STANDARD BANK GROUP    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT 2022

39



The group’s programmes to combat financial 
crime are designed and managed by group 
anti-financial crime (GAFC) and are implemented 
in all jurisdictions where the group has business 
operations. The functions of GAFC include 
oversight of the group’s measures in respect of 
anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist 
financing (CTF), counter proliferation financing 
(CPF), anti-bribery and corruption (ABC), 
prevention of the facilitation of tax evasion and 
fraud detection and risk mitigation. 

Employees take individual responsibility for 
acting to combat financial crime in all its 
forms. Employees are required to report 
concerns or incidents internally using 
appropriate channels, including the independent 
and confidential whistleblowing hotline. We 
report suspicious and unusual transactions to 
the relevant authorities in accordance with local 
regulatory requirements.

The group requires all employees, board 
members and contractors to undertake 
mandatory compliance training to ensure 
awareness of our anti-financial crime policies and 
processes. These courses must be completed 
annually. Training ensures that our employees are 
aware of and sensitive to risks and are informed 
about the reporting processes they must follow if 
they become aware of any suspicious activity. We 
use behavioural science and scenarios in our 
training, to support appropriate behaviours. 

The assessments are designed to meet 
regulatory requirements and are supplemented 
by an evaluation form for continuous 
improvement feedback and analysis of question-
level data to identify areas where additional 
reinforcement may be necessary. Where 

necessary, we may deploy targeted training in specific 
areas or on specific issues, to address any emerging 
issues or concerns and support any required 
behaviour change. Our objective is to ensure that our 
employees are able to use the knowledge gained from 
compliance training to make informed decisions in 
their daily work. In addition to the core mandatory 
compliance training, employees in roles that are 
assessed as being exposed to a higher risk from 
money laundering and terrorist financing are required 
to complete role-specific training. These courses 
must be also completed annually.

Our inclusive training strategy ensures that visually 
impaired employees are provided with appropriate 
training solutions. 

Our board members at group and country level 
receive specialised training, online or in-person. 

 We require specific categories of third parties to 
undergo relevant mandatory compliance training and, 
where applicable, role-specific training courses 
according to the service they provide and the 
potential associated compliance risks. We track 
completion to ensure the relevant training is 
undertaken. In 2022, approximately 8 000 
independent service providers used the Standard 
Bank Independent Service provider training portal.

We use a reporting dashboard for compliance training 
to track real-time completion status across all 
business lines. Completion rates provide a group-wide 
risk and conduct value driver metric. We expect the 
group to maintain a completion rate of 95% for all 
mandatory compliance training at any given time. We 
track the outcomes of regulatory inspections and 
interaction, to ensure that required enhancements to 
our compliance management and control frameworks  
are implemented.

Principles and frameworks

Group money laundering control 
policy and group financial 
sanctions and counter-terrorist 
financing (CTF) policy
Our AML and CTF frameworks and policies are informed by the FATF 
Recommendations and are designed to comply with statutory and 
regulatory obligations in all our countries of operation. AML/CTF 
legislation is continually evolving, and our operations align their AML/
CTF risk management and compliance programmes to these changes as 
they occur. Our policies and processes ensure that: 

Risks arising from money 
laundering, terrorist financing and 
contravention of financial sanctions 
are well understood, mitigated, and 
proactively managed 

We protect the group’s 
reputation and integrity by 
taking all reasonable 
measures to prevent the 
use of its products and 
services for money 
laundering and terrorist 
financing purposes, or for 
the circumvention of 
financial sanctions 

Appropriate levels of client due 
diligence are applied to mitigate 
risks effectively

We detect, investigate and report suspicious activity and all other 
reportable transactions to the competent authorities. Employees within 
the financial crime management unit (FCMU) report suspicious 
transactions to the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) via the goAML 
platform. 

Each jurisdiction/business unit is responsible for the drafting and 
maintenance of a risk management and compliance programme 
(RMCP) in accordance with the group’s policies and standards. In South 
Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FIC Act) takes a risk-based 
approach to compliance in respect of the AML/CTF regulatory 
framework. As per the requirements of the Act, the group has 
developed, documented, implemented and maintains an RMCP that 
demonstrates our ability to effectively identify and mitigate money 
laundering and terrorist financing risk. 

STANDARD BANK GROUP    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT 2022

Following the publication of the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 
Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) in 
October 2021, South Africa was 
placed in a one-year observation 
period. The country submitted its 
post observation follow-up report 
to the FATF in October 2022. The 
report sought to demonstrate 
progress against the MER 
recommendations, in order to 
avoid identification as a jurisdiction 
“placed under increased 
monitoring” (FATF greylisting). 
Supervisory bodies engaged 
private sector stakeholders during 
this period to identify and execute 
actions that could contribute to 
the progress report. Standard 
Bank submitted its first six-month 
action plan and progress report to 
the South African Reserve Bank 
Prudential Authority in June 2022, 
and our updated progress in 
September 2022. 

In February 2023, the FATF 
announced that South Africa  
had been grey-listed, despite the 
67 Recommended Actions being 
reduced to eight strategic 
deficiencies where more progress 
is required. The country continues 
to work towards resolving the 
shortcomings identified by FATF. 
The general expectation is for 
countries to have addressed most 
(if not all) of the deficiencies that 
are identified in their mutual 
evaluation reports within a 
three-year period.

Employee responsibilities 
 � All group board members, employees and 

contractors are required to complete AML/
CTF training and comply with AML/CTF 
requirements. All employees, board 
members, and third-party service providers 
have access to the group’s training 
platform, to enable completion of 
mandatory training. 

 � Specialised training is provided to areas 
that are assessed as being higher risk from 
an AML/CTF perspective. Examples include 
AML/CTF risks inherent to trade finance 
activity, and training in relation to the 
vulnerabilities of non-profit organisations 
from a terrorist financing perspective.

 � All employees must report suspicious or 
unusual transactions, using the reporting 
processes and tools that the group makes 
available. 

Third-party 
responsibilities 

 � Third-party agents 
and service providers 
are required to 
complete AML/CTF 
training and comply 
with all AML/CTF 
requirements. Any 
external third-party 
performing services 
on the group’s behalf 
is required to comply 
with the group’s 
anti-financial crime 
policies. 

Industry initiatives 
 � Standard Bank Group is a member of the South African Anti-Money Laundering Taskforce (SAMLIT), a 

public private partnership between accountable institutions, the FIC and law enforcement authorities. 
Representation is at three levels, namely:

 – SAMLIT steering committee, a decision-making body of SAMLIT. Standard Bank is a member.
 – The Expert Working Group (EWG), a collaboration of SAMLIT members focused on advancing the 
understanding of certain money laundering/terrorist financing matters of interest. Standard Bank 
contributes to the expert working groups on Illegal Wildlife Trafficking, Modern Slavery and Human 
Trafficking, Terrorist Financing and Corruption, and chairs the EWG on Narcotics.

 – Targeted Operations Group, a collaboration of impacted members, focusing on specific operational 
matters commonly identified as important and urgent. We contribute operationally to several 
targeted operations groups. 

Account closures 
Banks are required by national and international laws 
to take steps to prevent themselves from being used 
for the purposes of money laundering, terrorist 
financing or other unlawful activities. This requires 
banks to take a risk-based approach to customer due 
diligence prior to establishing a new relationship with a 
customer, to conduct enhanced due diligence on 
high-risk customers such as politically exposed 
persons, to conduct ongoing monitoring of these 
customers’ transactions to understand the source and 
application of funds and to report suspicious 
transactions to the Financial Intelligence Centre. Banks 
are required to have policies, procedures and risk 
assessment tools in place to govern the closing of a 
customer’s bank account or exiting a customer 
relationship. 

In South Africa, the Report of the Judicial Commission 
of Inquiry into State Capture recommended that 
relevant existing legislation governing banks be 
amended to introduce the principle of affording the 
customer an opportunity to be heard into the process 
of the banks’ termination of accounts, or if warranted, 
a new piece of legislation be enacted to introduce the 
requirement of fairness. 

Board responsibilities 
The group board is 
accountable for ensuring 
compliance with the group

Anti-bribery and corruption policy 
We manage our bribery and corruption risk in accordance with local and international 
statutory and regulatory requirements, while benchmarking our frameworks against 
global best-practice guidance such as the OECD's Guidance for Multinational 
Enterprises, the ISO 37001 International Standard, and guidance issued by the 
Wolfsberg Group, the United Nations and the World Bank. The group has a 
zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. 

The policy applies to all entities and employees of the group, and third parties acting on 
behalf of the group. It emphasises that the group prohibits the giving or receiving of 
bribes, and the making of facilitation payments by any associated person. 
(Facilitation payments are usually relatively small payments made to facilitate or expedite 
routine action by public officials, to which the payer of the facilitation payment has a legal 
or other entitlement for example, the issuing of a required permit or licence). It also 
provides guidance to employees regarding the appropriate response to payments 
extorted under duress. 

The policy reflects the group’s minimum requirements in respect of ABC controls, 
including but not limited to aspects such as gifts, entertainment, donations and 
procurement. It may be supplemented in a local jurisdiction or business area where more 
stringent legislative or regulatory requirements apply. 

The group conducts periodic ABC risk assessments. All client segments and subsidiaries 
of the group are within scope, with a focus on areas that are perceived to be higher risk. 
The outcomes of this risk assessment, which include the action plan detailing areas and 
controls that need to be enhanced, are shared with the relevant board committees that 
take overall responsibility for the ABC compliance programme. The group monitors the 
effectiveness of the ABC controls on an ongoing basis, and continually improves the 
effectiveness of the ABC compliance programme.

Our anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) policy commits us to: 

Employee responsibilities 
All employees are required to adhere to group policies and  
procedures, and all regulatory requirements to prevent bribery and 
corruption. Employees are required to detect, report, monitor and 
respond appropriately to any incidents that may occur.

 � Pre-employment screening is conducted prior to the appointment of 
any employee.

 � All employees must complete mandatory ABC general awareness 
training annually. 

 � Employees in roles that are considered higher risk also receive 
specialised, role-specific training on an annual basis.

 � Every employee must attest to the fact that they understand how the 
ABC policy applies to their roles and responsibilities. 

 � Employees are required to report any requests for bribes or facilitation 
payments. Reporting channels include line managers, the group 
investigations and fraud risk team (GIFR) and the whistleblowing 
hotline. We allow for anonymous reporting. We prohibit victimisation 
and protect anyone who makes a report in good faith from suffering 
prejudice.

Incidents 
The group has not been subjected to any kind of legislative or 
regulatory sanction for bribery and corruption infringements during 
the last five years.

Third-party responsibilities 
 � Risk-based due diligence is conducted prior to the appointment of 

any third party.
 � The group’s ABC policy requirements are made available to our 

third parties as required.
 � ABC training and communication is made available to third parties, 

following a risk-based approach. 
 � Specific contractual clauses regulate adherence to relevant 

anti-corruption legislation by third parties of the group and provide 
the group with contractual remedies should such activity be 
detected. 

 � Reporting channels made available to third parties include 
relationship managers and the whistleblowing hotline.

Prohibit bribery and 
corruption and ensure that 
an anti-bribery and 
corruption culture  
is established and 
maintained

Establish and maintain 
reasonable and proportionate 
measures to prevent bribery 
and corruption, and to detect, 
report, monitor and respond 
appropriately to any incidents 
that may occur

Conduct business with 
integrity, transparency 
and openness,  
and in compliance with 
applicable laws and 
Standard Bank’s values and 
code of ethics and conduct.  

STANDARD BANK GROUP    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT 2022

Employee responsibilities 
 � All employees, associated 

persons and third parties must 
raise concerns and report all 
attempted, suspected, and 
actual fraud. Reporting 
channels include line 
managers, GIFR, the 
whistleblowing hotline or the 
FraudStop process. We allow 
for anonymous reporting. We 
prohibit victimisation and 
protect anyone who makes a 
report in good faith from 
suffering prejudice.

 � Employees are subject to 
mandatory anti-fraud training 
every two years. The board is 
provided with annual refresher 
training on the principles of the 
anti-fraud policy. 

Fraud is defined as unlawful and 
intentional misrepresentation committed 
to secure an unfair or unlawful gain. Fraud 
includes but is not limited to application 
fraud, card fraud, procurement fraud, 
employee fraud, digital fraud, insurance 
fraud and transaction fraud. 

The group has policies and processes 
in place to mitigate fraud risk and is 
committed to continuous improvement of 
these measures. In 2020 we implemented 
a centralised fraud risk management 
capability, strengthening our proactive, 
preventative and responsive approach to 
fraud risk management and ensuring a 
consistent client experience across the 
group. GIFR investigates all fraud events 
(internally and externally reported) and 
provides recommendations on fraud 
controls to remediate gaps identified. 

We continue to invest in raising 
customer and employee awareness of 
fraud risk, using channels which include 
email, internet banking pop-ups, updates 
on our websites and social media, and 
onsite fraud awareness presentations to 
our corporate clients. Our initiatives 
educate customers and employees on 
current scams and tactics, warn them on 
what to look for, and provide information 
on how to protect themselves. 

Industry initiatives 
We continue to work closely with law 
enforcement, The South African Banking 
Risk Information Centre (SABRIC), The 
South African Fraud Prevention Services 
(SAFPS), The Insurance Crime Bureau 
(ICB) and the banking industry to 
collaborate in the fight against fraud. 
These collaborative efforts have led to 
several arrests and convictions.

Third-party responsibilities 
 � Third parties are subject to a change 

risk management process that 
incorporates their anti-fraud posture, 
amongst other aspects.

Incidents 
 � Incidents of fraud are on the rise due to 

the increased adoption of digital channels, 
higher volumes of online shopping and the 
emergence of non-bank distribution 
channels, and the difficult economic 
environment. 

 � Clients remain susceptible to fraud due to 
the sophistication of scams introduced by 
fraudsters, that lure clients into divulging 
sensitive banking information. 
E-commerce fraud is largely driven by 
vishing and phishing scams, whereby 
customers are tricked into compromising 
their card details. 

 � We have strengthened the authentication 
security protocols for card-based 
e-commerce transactions and have 
implemented the 3DSecure 2.0 industry 
protocols to improve fraud prevention and 
detection capability on card transactions. 
This resulted in a year-on-year reduction in 
card fraud losses. 

 � We have also implemented stronger 
authentication controls to reduce digital 
fraud. This incorporates the use of 
biometrics to log onto the digital channels.

Market abuse 
framework 
The group seeks to maintain the highest 
standards of professional conduct when 
undertaking financial market transactions, 
communicating with market participants 
and handling confidential information. Our 
market abuse control framework aims to 
ensure that the group and our employees 
support the orderly, fair and transparent 
functioning of the financial market, 
encourage its integrity and contribute to 
the enhancement of financial stability in 
the markets within which we operate. The 
framework aims to ensure that there are 
adequate and effective controls in place 
to prevent, manage and/or mitigate 
market abuse risk.

Market abuse includes insider trading, 
unlawful publication of inside information, 
prohibited trading practices and 
publishing of false, misleading or 
deceptive statements, promises and/or 
market forecasts. 

Incidents of non-compliance with the 
market abuse policy are investigated by 
the group market abuse surveillance 
compliance function with the assistance 
of the relevant local group investigations, 
operational risk and other relevant 
functions. Failure to adhere to the policy 
may lead to disciplinary action and 
possible dismissal.

Employee responsibilities 
 � When undertaking financial market 

transactions, communicating with 
market participants or handling 
confidential information, employees 
must consider whether their conduct, 
or the conduct of other parties, could 
amount to any actual or potential 
instances of market abuse. 

 � Employees must be aware of and 
adhere to all market abuse related laws 
and regulations that apply within the 
jurisdictions in which they are located, 
act or transact or where they facilitate 
transactions on behalf of others 

 � Any employee who reasonably 
suspects that any conduct could lead 
to or has led to possible market 
abuse or non-compliance with this 
policy, must timeously notify the 
Group Market Abuse Surveillance 
Compliance function, or the 
independent anonymous ethics and 
fraud hotline.

 � Employees must complete 
mandatory training on the market 
abuse policy and related policies. 

Incidents 
 � In South Africa, the group is a party to an ongoing case lodged by the 

Competition Commission. The group remains of the view that there is no 
wrongdoing on our part. The parties argued their various technical dismissal and 
exception applications before the Competition Tribunal in December 2021.

The group has a zero-tolerance approach to the facilitation of tax evasion. Our 
prevention of the facilitation of tax evasion policy ensures that reasonable procedures to 
prevent the facilitation of tax evasion are in place. All allegations of facilitation of tax 
evasion are investigated and actioned. We raise awareness of our facilitation of tax 
evasion policy and processes with our clients, suppliers and service providers through 
explicit clauses in relevant agreements.

Employee responsibilities 
 � All employees must annually complete 

the group's personal conduct course, 
which includes a section on tax 
evasion.

 � The bank's employees are not 
permitted to provide tax advice.

 � Areas of the bank that are perceived as 
being higher risk, receive specialised 
training. 

All employees are required to:
 � Identify transactions considered as 

higher risk for tax evasion and refer 
these to the corporate offences 
advisory team (within group financial 
crime compliance) and group tax for 
consideration. 

 � Report suspicion of the facilitation of 
tax evasion to GIFR. Concerns can also 
be reported via the whistleblowing 
hotline.

 � File a suspicious transaction report (or 
suspicious activity report) where tax 
evasion or the facilitation of tax 
evasion is suspected or identified. 

Prevention of the facilitation  
of tax evasion policy

Incidents 
 � The group has not been 

subjected to any investigation or 
regulatory sanction for 
facilitation of tax evasion during 
the past five years.

Third-party responsibilities 
 � Risk-based due diligence is 

conducted prior to the 
appointment of any  
third party.

 � Specific contractual clauses 
regulate adherence to relevant 
tax legislation by third parties of 
the group, and provide the group 
with contractual remedies 
should such activity be detected.

A conflict of interest arises in any activity or 
transaction to which any group entity is a party, or for 
which any group entity provides services, where:

 � The interests of the group and our client conflict/are 
incompatible 

 � The personal interests of an employee or agent of 
the group conflict/are incompatible with those of 
our client

 � The personal interests of an employee or agent of 
the group conflict/are incompatible with those of 
the group. 

Our conflicts of interest control framework ensures 
that conflict of interest risk is adequately managed. 
The framework provides for processes, procedures 
and mechanisms to identify, prevent and manage 
conflicts of interest to:

 � Ensure the fair treatment of clients
 � Ensure that conflicts of interest are managed fairly
 � Maintain a sound financial environment
 � Prevent the misuse of need-to-know information
 � Protect the good reputation of Standard Bank Group 

and the industry.

We take all reasonable steps to prevent conflicts of 
interest from constituting or giving rise to a material 
risk of damage to the interests of clients. Measures 
include appropriate and prior disclosure to our clients, 
subject to applicable confidentiality constraints, and 
disclosure of the steps taken to mitigate such 
conflicts.

The group has implemented a number of policies and 
procedures under the framework, including the 
conflicts of interest policy which aims to ensure that 
the group and all our employees comply with the 
applicable statutory and regulatory obligations by 
ensuring that all reasonable steps have been taken to 
prevent or fairly manage potential conflicts of interest 
and mitigate the effect that such conflicts could have 
on our clients and the group. The policy reflects the 
minimum requirements that need to be adhered to, to 
ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to prevent 
conflicts of interest from constituting or giving rise to a 
material risk of damage to the interests of our clients. 

Conflicts of interest framework Employee responsibilities 
 � All employees, consultants, contractors, suppliers, 

other associated persons and other third parties must 
always act honestly and with integrity, must be alert 
to potential conflicts of interest and must manage 
fairly all conflicts of interest. 

 � All employees must comply with the group outside 
business interests (OBI) policy. Employees must 
obtain approval before entering into an OBI, and 
declare any OBI held by themselves or their related 
parties.

 � Employees must promptly report any concerns about 
a potential conflict of interest to the relevant 
compliance functions. 

 � Employees must complete annual mandatory training 
on the conflicts of interest policy and related policies.

We require all employees, board members, and 
designated independent service providers to report their 
outside business interests and personal account trading 
details every year. This information is tracked and 
reported along with compliance training data. We require 
a 100% completion rate for declaration of outside 
business interests and personal account trading.

Procurement and third-party relationships 
The group engages with a range of third 
parties. These include suppliers of goods and 
services, technology partners, BigTechs, 
fintechs, software providers, hardware 
providers and professional services. Significant 
outsourcing engagements include cash 
handling services, premises-related services 
and mobile network providers. The group’s 
strategic ambition to become a platform 
business will increase the number of third-
party relationships. 

Procurement 
policy 
Standard Bank’s procurement policy is based 
on the group’s code of ethics and conduct, 
and the principles of value optimisation, fair 
and effective competition, accountability, 
sustainability and risk management. It 
provides guidance on the sourcing and 
selection of suppliers and ensures that 
procurement processes are conducted in line 
with sound corporate governance principles.

The group encourages and promotes 
procurement from local suppliers while 
ensuring alignment with group standards of 
quality, sustainability and commerciality. We 
strive to procure goods and services that 
minimise negative impacts on the environment 
and communities and protect the health and 
safety of workers.

required to read and attest to the policy as part 
of the procurement onboarding process. Data 
protection and data privacy clauses are also 
included in contract agreements with third 
parties. Where third parties provide digital 
solutions, they must ensure security 
requirements are met, in line with the cyber 
resilience standard. Contracts also include a 
‘Right to Audit’ clause, allowing for periodic 
assessments of the third parties. Disciplinary 
or legal action may be taken against any third 
parties who do not comply with group 
information risk and cyber risk policies.

Our third-party contracts specify that Standard 
Bank may, by notice, immediately terminate an 
agreement if we determine that the third-party 
has acted dishonestly or in bad faith in respect 
of the agreement; has engaged in any activity 
which may negatively affect our reputation; has 
offered, promised or made any gift or bribe to 
solicit any favour; is involved with any 
prohibited activity; or has made any intentional 
or negligent misrepresentation to Standard 
Bank. 

Third-party due diligence 
The group supplier risk committee reviews 
third-party reputational risk matters relating to 
ethics, conduct, conflicts of interest, 
anticompetitive behaviour, human rights, and 
bribery and corruption. In 2021, we launched a 
digital solution, which includes automated real 
time due diligence on third parties. The 
solution has been implemented across the 
group. Relevant employees have received 
training on the system, including the 
onboarding process for third parties. 

We undertake daily screening of third parties 
for adverse matters, with a focus on human 
rights, environmental issues, corruption, fraud 
and money laundering. 

Third-party code of conduct 
We require third parties to attest to the group’s 
third-party code of conduct, which is based on 
the group code of ethics and conduct, or to 
attest that their company has a code of conduct 
aligned to the SBG requirements. 

The code aims to ensure that all third parties 
who engage with the group are aware of our 
minimum requirements and governing principles 
in relation to ethical conduct. 

Approximately 6 500 third parties have read 
and acknowledged the requirements in the 
code of conduct.

The code requires all our third parties to 
respect basic human rights and establish a 
clean and safe working environment. This 
includes: 

 � Not allowing forced labour, child labour or 
discrimination 

 � Paying appropriate wages 
 � Regulating working hours 
 � Respecting everyone’s freedom of 

association.

All suppliers, consultants and contractors to 
the group are required to comply with all 
applicable environmental and social legislation 
and to follow internationally accepted 
environmental and social practices as these 
apply to their sector and to the goods or 
services supplied. This should include prudent 
management of the risks arising from climate 
change, as they relate to third parties’ 
operational activities. 

Third-party risk 
framework and 
policy 
Our third-party risk management framework 
incorporates regulatory requirements, internal 
policies and the group code of ethics and 
conduct. It ensures a consistent standardised 
approach to third-party risk management 
across the group. 

The risk assessment process includes 
determination of whether a third party will 
provide a service that potentially risks harming 
the health and safety of persons; or causing 
direct impacts/harm to the natural environment. 
If such risks may be present, the third party 
must complete a detailed risk assessment and 
due diligence process, which assesses potential 
social and environmental risks and impacts. 
Third parties may also be asked to provide 
evidence of the policies and practices they have 
in place to mitigate these risks. The nature of 
information required is dependent on the nature 
of the risk, the type of product or service being 
contracted, and the type of relationship being 
entered . We engage third parties on an ongoing 
basis to actively manage potential risks.

All third parties are required to comply with our 
anti-financial crime policies and to complete 
training related to AML/CTF, anti-bribery and 
corruption, fraud and tax evasion. 

Protection of information is included in all 
aspects of our third-party risk management 
framework. Our external party information 
risk management policy outlines minimum 
expectations from our third parties in 
protecting our information. All third parties 
processing or accessing group information are

Margaret Nienaber was promoted to take on the expanded portfolio of 
Chief operating officer. 

34.8% of our executives are women, against our target of 40% by the 
end of 2023. Measured against the 2022 McKinsey Women in the 
Workplace study, we compare favourably to global averages for 
representation of women in executive and senior management 
positions.

Our flagship group leadership programmes reflected a 57% female

Principles and frameworks
The group’s philosophy with respect to diversity and inclusion is based on creating an environment where all our people feel a strong 
sense of psychological safety, belonging and are able to bring their full selves to work. When our employees feel safe to voice their views, 
ideas, and suggestions for improvement, we are able to leverage divergent perspectives to innovate and provide better solutions for our 
customers. 

Each of our countries of operation has a diversity and inclusion plan that builds on the group’s foundational framework and is tailored for 
country context. All countries focus on gender. In South Africa, emphasis is also placed on promoting diversity across population groups, 
those who are differently abled and from a LGBTQI+ perspective.

In 2022, Ms Nonkululeko Nyembezi was appointed as the first woman to chair the 
SBG board. Four of the board’s subcommittees, namely the group directors’ affairs 
committee, the group audit committee, the group remuneration committee and the 
group social and ethics committee are chaired by female board members. The 
board continues to pursue its target of 40% female representation on the 
board by 2025 in the implementation of its succession plans.

34.8% of our executives are women, against our target of 40% by the end of 
2023. Measured against the 2022 McKinsey Women in the Workplace study, we 
compare favourably to global averages for the representation of women in executive 
and senior management positions. In 2023, we will set new targets for the group, 
based on progress made together with local and international benchmarks. 

Developing women 
While progress has been made in 
increasing female representation at 
executive and senior management levels 
across the continent, we place special 
emphasis on the driving female 
participation in leadership programmes, to 
ensure readiness to take on C-suite roles, 
build talent pipelines of women at middle 
management level and ensure successor 
readiness for more senior positions.

We continue to engage, develop, and 
provide opportunities for women to excel 
in all areas of our business, particularly 
those where they are underrepresented. 
Women in leadership are role models for 
women in more junior positions and are 
key to ensuring that diverse views are 
represented at senior levels. Our flagship 
group leadership programmes reflected a 
57% female participation ratio across all 
management levels. 

We also offer tailored development 
programmes for women that are group-
wide, business unit or country specific to 
meet specific needs. 

An example is Breaking Headwinds, a 
bespoke development programme to 
support the development of our female 
talent as ready successors for CE roles in 
Africa Regions. Selected individuals 
receive development support aligned to 
role-based gaps identified through a 
competency assessment. Through 
exposure to critical business themes, 
exchange of ideas, networking, coaching, 
mentoring and learning interventions, they 
grow their capacity to assume CE roles or 
other executive functions. Eight women 
from various African countries are 
currently participating in the programme. 

We also provide women with opportunities 
to gain global exposure through 
participation in global business and 
leadership development programmes. For 
example, in 2022, Simone Cooper, the 
head of Business & Commercial Clients in 
South Africa participated in the Institute of 
International Finance (IIF) Future Leaders 
Programme. The programme targets 
individuals who are under the age of 40 
and demonstrate strong leadership 
capability, and exposes them to the big 
ideas and topics that will drive the future of 
the industry. 

We celebrate the achievements of women 
through various initiatives and 
sponsorships in the communities we serve. 
Our annual Standard Bank Top Women 
Awards recognises outstanding leadership, 
vision and innovation among organisations 
that seek to advance the role of women in 
businesses of all sizes across all sectors of 
the economy. To create awareness about 
gender empowerment and showcase the 
themes of the Standard Bank Top Women 
Conference and Awards, we ran a Top 
Women video series, in which women in 
leadership positions at SBG shared their 
experiences of the working environment, 
anecdotes about the support that enables 
them to #RiseAboveTheNoise and the 
realities of gender diversity and leadership. 
The series became a catalyst for other 
conversations. 

For the first time, we included an award 
category to recognise women within SBG. 
We received over 700 nominations. The 
Standard Bank Top Woman Employee 
Award was awarded to Rose Kamene 
Gichuki from Stanbic Bank Kenya.

Under-represented population groups 
We believe that the extent to which our employees at all levels are representative of diverse 
local populations is a competitive advantage. We endeavour to ensure that our employee base 
reflects the local population in each country in which we operate. 

The diversity of our geographic footprint and our approach to talent development focuses on 
mobility of key people to build knowledge, skill, and alignment to SBG culture.

We support and actively drive employment equity and have employment equity targets and 
plans in place in countries where this is a regulatory requirement. However, we see diversity 
and inclusion as going well beyond numbers and legislative compliance.

Our employment equity plans in South Africa and Namibia continue to shape our efforts to 
ensure that we improve the representation of under-represented population groups. 

In South Africa, our Employment Equity Plan 
2022-2024 guides our actions to improve the 
representation of under-represented groups 
across all management levels. While we have 
employment equity targets and plans in 
place as required by legislation, we see 
diversity and inclusion as going well beyond 
numbers and legislative compliance.

Namibia has achieved equitable 
representation against the 
targets that have been set for 
previously disadvantaged senior 
managers. 

Pay equity 
We believe strongly in the principle of equal pay for work of 
equal value. Our policy framework ensures that employees doing 
similar jobs at the same level are paid equitably. Our focus on pay 
equity is an entrenched business practice and is a factor influencing 
remuneration decisions during the annual remuneration review and 
when appointments and promotions take place. 

We perform a multivariate regression analysis annually across the 
group’s employee population to identify gaps between the 
remuneration of female versus male employees on a like-for-like 
basis. This analysis includes both fixed and variable remuneration. 
Analyses in 2022 reaffirmed that there are no systemic issues 
of gender pay discrimination at a group or country level. 

For South African employees an analysis of income differentials by 
race and gender is submitted annually to the Department of 
Employment and Labour. We are confident that our holistic 
approach to pay equity produces fair outcomes, and we will continue 
to robustly address any risk of unconscious bias in this regard.

Engaging men on gender equality
In South Africa, we continued to engage our male colleagues in 
promoting gender equity, by conducting Barbershop refresher 
training, to build enough capacity for Barbershop conversations to 
be scalable where required. This initiative focuses on engaging 
groups of men in challenging conversations about masculinity, the 
role of men in society, and men as allies in the gender equality 
endeavour. The men who participate in this deep personal journey 
go on to facilitate Barbershop sessions, in which similar 
conversations are held with wider groups of men. In 2022, we held a 
Barbershop conversation session to engage men on issues of 
gender equality, empowerment of women, and the importance of 
authentic masculinity. We also engaged employees on gender 
equality through conversations and webinars. 

2022 Accolades 
Stanbic Bank Uganda was awarded a Gold Gender Equity Seal by the UNDP. The 
Gender Equity Seal aims to strengthen the capacity of institutions to integrate 
gender responsive strategies in their businesses. Stanbic Bank Uganda successfully 
completed all the assessment stages, which were externally audited, and achieved a 
score of 81.6%.

While our employees are not obliged to declare a disability if they have one, we actively 
encourage disclosure to ensure we can provide reasonable accommodation if required. 
We raise awareness of disability declaration and reasonable accommodation application 
processes through internal communications to all employees. Employees can apply for 
reasonable accommodation to address specific workplace requirements. This may 
include assistive equipment, specialised software, or time off for medical consultations, 
for example. In 2022, we introduced an initiative to improve the accessibility of all our 
learning platforms for employees with visual impairments.

We commit to ensuring that we remove attitudinal barriers that may prevent the full 
inclusion of people with disabilities in our workplaces. In 2022, we hosted a disability 
masterclass to engage our people and culture teams, and the leaders of business units, 
to raise awareness of processes to address barriers and encourage the adoption of best 
practices to create an inclusive environment for people with disabilities. In South Africa, 
we encouraged employees to sign up for an online learning module on disability and 
inclusion in the SBSA context.

During National Disability Awareness Month in December, we communicated our 
commitment towards the inclusion of persons with disabilities and ran weekly disability 
awareness campaigns. We also hosted a special event on International Day of Persons 
with Disabilities at our Simmonds campus in Johannesburg. The awareness drive 
resulted in more disability declarations in the bank. 

As part of our overall Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) strategic focus 
and commitment, we work with our Africa Regions teams to explore the appropriate 
approach to disability declaration and support to align to an overall group minimum 
standard for this practice. 

In South Africa, we include 
targets for the representation 
of persons with disabilities in 
our employment equity plans 
across all business areas. The 
representation of persons with 
disabilities improved to 0.92% 
in 2022 against a target of 1.1% 

Disability 
Our disability strategy supports our efforts to ensure that employees 
with disabilities have equal opportunities in the workplace, that we offer 
a safe and accessible workplace, and maximise the contribution of 
every employee. 

LGBTQI+ 
We are equally committed to inclusivity of 
members of the LGBTQI+ community. We 
have made excellent progress in this 
regard in South Africa. The fact that some 
of our countries of operation on the 
African continent have anti-homosexuality 
legislation in place makes this a difficult 
conversation outside of South Africa. We 
continue to grapple with the issue to 
ensure an approach that is sensitive to 
context, but which also supports our DEIB 
commitments. 

In South Africa, we participated in the SA 
Workplace Equality Index in 2021, which 
provides us an opportunity to benchmark 
our policies and practices in respect of 
LGBTQI+. In 2022 we continued with our 
LGBTQI+ awareness programme and held 
Pride events at office campuses during 
Pride Month. We have incorporated 
LGBTQI+ on the agenda of our diversity 
and inclusion forums to ensure a 
deliberate focus on the inclusivity of our 
LGBTQI+ employees. 

STANDARD BANK GROUP    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT 2022

Employees can report any incidences of 
discrimination, harassment, sexual 
harassment or bullying to their line manager 
or people and culture representative, or to the 
group’s confidential whistleblowing hotline. All 
reported cases are taken seriously and dealt 
with promptly and respectfully. 

Victims of harassment and discrimination are 
provided with the necessary support, and we 
ensure that they are not in any way prejudiced 
or disadvantaged for laying a bona fide 
complaint. We do, however, view malicious 
and frivolous complaints in an extremely 
serious light. 

All employee grievances, regardless of their 
nature, are viewed in a serious light and are 
dealt with in a fair and consistent manner. The 
group’s grievance process allows employees 
to select whether they would prefer to 
approach their grievance informally or 
through a formal process. The formal process 
comprises multiple stages, beginning with the 
line manager of the employee whom the 
grievance is against, and offering points of 
escalation thereafter. 

Employee responsibilities 
We respect the rights of our employees and endeavour to offer a safe and fair work 
environment for all. We have group policies on  harassment,  sexual harassment and 

 unfair discrimination in place. These policies establish non-negotiable principles and 
standards on these issues, while allowing for in-country adaptations for dealing with 
complaints. We have a zero-tolerance approach to harassment and unfair 
discrimination. 

All employees, including all managers, are required to complete compulsory online sexual 
harassment training, with more than 98.2% of employees completing this training during 
the last cycle. Unconscious bias training is offered to managers and employees to raise 
self-awareness and includes tools and strategies to counter bias.

Where serious concerns are raised 
involving allegations of discrimination, 
sexual harassment or bullying and 
intimidation, the group will examine 
whether the matter warrants external 
intervention. In these instances, we would 
engage one of a number of trusted and 
respected independent external 
investigators to assist with investigating 
and resolving the concerns in an objective, 
fair and unbiased manner. 

We have robust disciplinary processes in 
place for employee transgressions with a 
preference, where possible, for corrective 
discipline. While the group views 
misconduct in the most serious light, we 
are committed to running our disciplinary 
processes in a fair and consistent manner 
which respects the dignity and humanity of 
all employees involved. 

In 2022, four incidents of alleged 
discrimination were reported through the 
group’s formal grievance processes. These 
were addressed in accordance with group 
policies and procedures.

Performance management 
Our performance management 
framework is designed to guide our 
people to perform at their best and to 
recognise them for their contribution. It is 
based on our performance engagement 
philosophy, ‘perform to grow’, which is an 
integral part of all our business practices. 
Living our values through recognised 
behaviours emphasises not just what we 
do but how we do it. 

Our ‘perform to grow’ philosophy is 
founded on the principle that more 
regular and constructive performance 
coaching conversations help drive 
personal improvement, growth and 
business contribution. 

Our performance engagement approach 
runs annually in a four-phase annual cycle:

1
Individuals and teams set annual 
goals aligned to our strategy and 
based on our strategic value drivers. 

2
Goal tracking and alignment is a 
continuous process throughout the 
year. We encourage team members 
to have regular, informal
performance conversations with 
their leaders and team members to 
track and review progress while 
taking responsibility for their 
learning and growth. We emphasise 
the importance of behaviour and 
how we live our values.

3
Business areas apply an informal or 
formal mid-year performance 
conversation where team members 
discuss progress against
expectations and deliverables, 
reaffirm priorities and identify 
development areas. 

In the last quarter of the year, we 
hold integrated people days where 
leaders discuss team members’ 
overall performance and ratings, 
strengths and development 
opportunities and undertake 
performance ratings moderation to 
ensure a fair and equitable process 
and avoid bias.

4
Leaders hold year-end 
performance conversations with 
team members and confirm final 
performance ratings for the year. 

Our performance management system 
supports our people through their 
performance journey in an intuitive and 
agile way. It enables seamless alignment 
of the goals across the group, real-time 
feedback and the tracking of team and 
individual progress throughout the year. 

We have access to real-time data, 
analysis, and trends as input to 
meaningful discussions. This enables 
insights and decisions on what “good 
looks like” across all work levels and peer 
groups and the performance of the 
business in all segments. 

Our remuneration committee governs 
our remuneration policy and its 
application and ensures that reward and 
remuneration decisions and processes 
consider and promote desired behaviours 
and conduct, as a direct outcome of the 
performance review cycle. In 2023, we will 
continue to emphasise business 
alignment, multi-source feedback and 
maturing our performance data and 
insights.

We aim to ensure that our people are fully 
engaged to perform at their best, feel a 
strong sense of pride and belonging in the 
organisation, are engaged in meaningful 
work and have opportunities to develop 
their skills and grow their careers.

While slight decreases are 
evident since 2021, this can 
be ascribed to the 
normalising of our operating 
environment as we came out 
of the pandemic. It is also 
influenced by the prevailing 
macro-economic environment 
in certain countries.

We analyse the results by 
various dimensions to 
determine if specific trends or 
insights are applicable to 
specific employee groupings. 
Our analysis includes 
variables such as geography, 
business segment, group 
function, gender, age group, 
workforce level, performance 
rating, whether employees 
work from home, the office or 
on a hybrid basis, and, in 
South Africa, population 
group. 

Employee engagement insights 
We have been running a group-wide annual 
employee engagement survey since 2017. In 
2022, 85% of employees participated (86% in 
2021). We use the Employee Net Promoter 
Score (eNPS) as our headline engagement 
measure. The score ranges from -100 to +100.  
It is calculated by subtracting the percentage of 
detractors (scoring 0 to 6) from the percentage 
of promoters (scoring 9 to 10). 

While individual responses are anonymised, we 
share the full survey results with employees, 
executives and the board. All leaders with more 
than ten respondents receive a full dashboard of 
their results. We use the results to shape our 
people plans and future initiatives to 
continuously improve employees’ experience of 
their work environment.

In 2022, the top scoring questions reflected 
employee pride in the group, a deep connection 
to our purpose, our ability to work in teams to 
achieve common goals, the adaptability of our 
teams and that we trust our immediate leaders 
to act with integrity. Areas for improvement 
included appreciating one another’s efforts, and 
the need to continue to work on creating an 
environment that is safe for people to share 
their views and make sure they feel heard. 

Top emotions expressed by employees included 
gratitude, optimism, and feeling productive. 
Some employees also expressed feelings of 
being overwhelmed, burnt out, and stressed, 
and we have taken action to explore this further. 
Employees who have been able to adopt the 
hybrid work model in 2022 (based on job 
requirements) expressed appreciation of the 
flexibility this offers and its positive impact on 
wellbeing and productivity.

Although an increase in employee turnover is evident, our overall (7.8%) and voluntary 
(3.9%) turnover remain well below local financial services industry benchmarks, of 15% 
and 10% respectively (REMChannel, June 2022) and global banking sector benchmarks 
(12% voluntary turnover rate, Visier 2022).

Turnover 

In 2022, our turnover trends normalised to pre-pandemic levels. Increased 
competition for talent in our countries of operation resulted in higher turnover trends 
and loss of talent in specific areas. Our group-wide response included tracking 
turnover trends to discern where we are losing talent, initiating tailored retention 
programmes to counter potential loss in these areas, talent acquisition to address 
capability gaps and an ongoing focus on skills development, to enable our people to 
capitalise on career growth opportunities.

Self-directed learning to develop our people 
in the flow of work 
We encourage our people to take ownership of their own 
learning and development journeys. All our employees have 
access to the My Learning platform, which is designed to enable 
them to acquire the skills needed to meet the demands of a 
rapidly changing and increasingly digital world of work. Topics 
range from general to highly specialised and include internally 
developed content and access to external resources. The 
platform uses machine learning to gather information about 
employees' interests and personalises development pathways 
based on their roles and learning goals. My Learning offers our 
people a single point of entry for all learning, a place to share 
learning and make skills visible, and a way to rate and improve 
skills on an ongoing basis. To ensure meaningful return on 
investment in self-directed learning, emphasis has been placed 
on guiding our people on what and how to learn, as critical 
success factors in creating the ideal conditions for learning. 

Building essential foundational  
future-ready skills 
Over and above the always-on, relevant, simple, and 
accessible learning we offer, at the heart of learning for work 
are skills and jobs. Based on ongoing research on global skills 
trends and our own business requirements, we have identified 
a list of critical foundational future skills, to ensure that all our 
people have the ability to grow and thrive in a changing work 
environment that requires a truly digital focus. This includes 
becoming more data driven, learning digital skills, 
understanding ecosystems and embracing a platform 
mindset coupled with a truly human focus to embrace a 
growth mindset and enable quality conversations. 

To enable our people to learn these skills, we offer an online 
future ready skills curriculum. This proved to be the most 
consumed content on our My Learning platform in 2022. We 
will continue to create meaningful opportunities for our 
people to go beyond just gaining knowledge to practically 
applying newly learned skills in the flow of work.

Talent management and  
succession planning
We are strengthening our leadership and 
scarce skills pipeline in line with the 
capabilities we need to succeed. We remain 
committed to accelerating the development 
of black talent in South Africa, ensuring 
greater depth of local talent in our Africa 
Regions countries, and increasing female 
representation at senior leadership levels.

Our robust talent management framework 
and process ensures effective succession 
planning for key roles across business lines, 
corporate functions and geographies. Our 
People Days run throughout the year, 
covering all levels of the business. Specific 
emphasis is placed on succession for 
leadership roles that we believe are business 
critical. We identify and review critical roles, 
succession bench strength and successor 
readiness across the group on an annual 
basis and address any identified gaps. 

Leaders provide input on suitable internal 
candidates for progression and the 
appropriate development actions to support 
development (‘build’ strategy). Where no 
successors are identified, we engage a ‘buy’ 
strategy and undertake external market 
mapping to identify suitable talent. 

At a senior leadership level, we have a robust 
process to review succession pipelines for 
group leadership council roles, which 
includes formal sessions on succession with 
the board directors affairs committee and 
the group board on an annual basis. In 2022, 
the chairman hosted a special board people 
day to assess the depth and breadth of the 
succession pipelines. We are confident that 
we have healthy succession pipelines in 
place across most parts of our business and 

every leader has specific plans to address 
any gaps identified, through build and buy 
strategies. Our internal hire ratio of 63% 
bears testimony to our strong succession 
pipelines and career progression 
opportunities for our people. 

Talent acquisition 
Our talent acquisition strategy is to find the 
best people for the right roles. We use 
targeted acquisition approaches that 
leverage external talent mapping, LinkedIn 
campaigns, industry networking platforms, 
and specialised search companies where 
required, as well as employee referral 
programmes. Where necessary we may use 
consultants, outsourcing or contingent 
workforce to access needed skills. In 2022 
we deployed a cloud-based talent 
acquisition solution which offers a 
sophisticated source-to-hire functionality on 
any device. This improves candidate 
experience, provides meaningful data and 
insights to inform hiring decisions, and uses 
AI to aid effective screening and volume-
management, reducing time-to-hire. The 
solution enables us to track data such as 
new and internal hires by age group, gender, 
management level, and population group in 
South Africa. 

We also enhanced our careers website to 
create a world class candidate experience 
that combines intuitive user journeys, 
engaging content and visuals, and smart 
interactivity. 

We saw an increase in new hires in 2022 as 
demand for specific capabilities increased, 
coupled with a higher turnover rate. 

Hiring activity in 2022

International mobility
We value multi-country experience and offer international assignments and secondments 
to ensure that our people get multi-jurisdictional exposure and broaden their skills. 
This builds deeper understanding of our local markets, cross-cultural awareness and 
supports succession planning for key roles. Talent mobility enables us to align our 
workforce to strategic business needs. It provides an opportunity to develop employees’ 
career paths, drive engagement and build future capability. Assignments include 
short-term assignments, long-term assignments, virtual assignments and the ICBC-SBG 
staff exchange programme. 

ICBC is our single largest shareholder and a strategic partner. To deepen the long-term 
and mutually beneficial strategic partnership between our banks, we developed a staff 
exchange programme in 2016. The programme helps to build relationships between 
employees, build understanding of one another’s cultures and business, share knowledge 
and resources, build Africa-China client relationships, and develop talent. Since the 
inception of the programme, 45 assignees have participated, 22 of whom were from 
Standard Bank and 23 from ICBC.

In 2022, 59 long-term, 16 short-term and four virtual assignments were facilitated 
across the group.

We strive to ensure data-driven people 
decision-making, by providing useful data 
analytics and insights to our leaders to help 
them manage and plan for the workforce of 
both today and tomorrow. We have deployed a 
suite of integrated people management 
systems across the group, which supports 
data tracking and analysis to inform decision-
making in areas such as performance 
management, talent attraction, reward and 
remuneration, talent management, payroll and 
data analytics systems. These systems are 
cloud-based and fully integrated to provide a 
single view of the employee and enable 
advanced people analytics. 

Our Meaningful Workforce Insights (MWI) 
platform allows us to integrate and share all 
people related insights with our leaders and 
our people and culture community in real time. 
MWI enables us to plan for the right mix of 
talent in the right roles, at the right time. We 
use the MWI platform as an integration tool 
across our people data, enabling us to extract 
insights and inform approaches to priority 
issues. We aim to move away from people 
analytics as a service to a people analytics 
platform, enabling informed, forward-looking 
people management decision-making and 
processes and better connecting workforce 
decisions to business results. 

The MWI solution is actively used by more 
than 5 000 people leaders in SBG (50% of the 
line manager population), together with the 
people and culture team, finance and 
compliance. Over 7 000 employees use the 
solution for people data and analytics.

We use MWI to inform and track our employee 
engagement metrics against our 2025 targets. 
We also use MWI for scenario modelling and to 
determine the drivers for key metrics such as 
the workforce ROI. 

We can model various scenarios to plan 
for potential headcount movements and 
the associated cost of this across the 
group or in specific business areas. 

We use Strategic Workforce Planning 
(SWP) at organisational level and at 
business unit level, to predict or model 
scenarios with regards changes to 
workforce size, shape and cost over time. 
The MWI planning solution and headcount 
planning also supports diversity planning.

We use our MWI platform to monitor and 
analyse data such as:

 � Recruiting and hiring: 
Employee turnover trends, drivers of 
attrition and hiring analytics provided 
by our recruitment solution 

 � Recognition: 
Trends of recognition awards per 
business area, employee level, gender. 
We use workforce planning modules to 
predict future outcomes if current 
patterns persist 

 � Performance: 
Drivers of high performance, 
distribution curves per business area, 
and turnover of high performers

 � Position management: 
Variables such as unoccupied positions, 
variance between position grade and 
employee grade, and job cluster 
analysis 

 � Talent management and succession: 
Successor coverage for critical roles, 
readiness levels, diversity of successors, 
and successors due to retire

 � Learning activity: 
Average learning time per employee and 
learning trends and skills gaps in different 
parts of the organisation. We have developed 
a model to classify certain skills and learning 
activities as future skills and we track the 
extent to which employee learning 
encompasses these skills, and which future 
skills are getting most and least attention

 � Return on investment in learning: 
Impact on performance and impact of 
leadership development programmes on 
progression

 � Compliance training: 
Compliance certification status per business 
area and employee, and compliance 
certifications due to expire. We provide line 
managers with detailed analysis on 
employees who are not compliant or at risk 
of becoming non-compliant

 � Engagement: 
Employee engagement scores and the 
correlation between employee wellbeing and 
employee engagement

 � Onboarding and exit interview survey 
data: 
What drives attrition, identify areas with 
elevated risk of exit and assess reasons for 
higher attrition levels in certain countries or 
business units

 � Employee turnover: 
New hires, voluntary, involuntary and 
regrettable turnover, monthly turnover 
against thresholds and trend analysis to 
identify risk

 � Annual leave: 
Areas/roles with large balances of 
accumulated leave, enabling us to 
target communications to encourage 
leave in relevant areas

 � Organisational network analysis: 
Employee collaboration, internally and 
externally, work patterns and areas at 
risk of possible burn-out.

Principles and 
frameworks 
Our employees have the right to enjoy fair and just 
conditions of work. We value and respect the rights 
of employees and aim to create a work environment 
that is free of any discrimination. Fair labour 
practices are at the core of our organisation's value 
proposition. We provide exceptional benefits to our 
employees and ensure that we are in line with or above 
local market standards.

Working conditions 
The group employee relations governance framework 
provides for constructive employer-employee 
relationship practices in Standard Bank. The framework 
is founded on our international and national regulations 
and obligations, our values and code of ethics and 
conduct and our commitment to maintaining and 
developing fair employment practices in all our 
countries of operation. The framework provides a 
general set of employee relations operating principles, 
which are incorporated into the policies and procedures 
of group entities as applicable in their country of 
operation. It includes our commitment to ensuring, in 
respect of all our employees: 

 � Protection of human rights, fair employment 
practices, and the principles of non-
discrimination 

 � Freedom to express concerns arising in the 
workplace through established whistleblowing 
procedures without fear of retaliation or victimisation 

 � The right to a safe and healthy working 
environment and the expectation of decent work that 
is productive and delivers a fair income 

 � Protection against discrimination in employment and occupation, 
including recognition of the principle of equal remuneration for work of 
equal value 

 � The right to fair labour practices in the employment of employees and 
throughout the duration of their employment with the group 

 � Freedom of association and the freedom not to associate, including the 
right to collective organisation and representation. The observance of 
freedom of association provides for, among others: 

 – Recognition of collective organisation for employees to form and join 
unions of their choice, (or the right not to), and to exercise organisational 
rights (or the right not to) as provided for in terms of the relevant laws 

 – Collective bargaining through representatives of choice for the purposes 
of reaching agreement on terms and conditions of employment in terms 
of the relevant laws and country level agreements. The structure and 
form of collective bargaining is determined by labour market factors 
within the country and the bank and requires agreement between the 
bank and the recognised union. Collective bargaining by custom and 
agreement is restricted to general employees.

 – In South Africa, 43.9% of our people belong to a trade union. Of 
our general staff complement of 16 970, 61.3% are recognised for the 
purposes of collective bargaining.

 – In Africa Regions, 27% of our employee complement of 14 486 
belong to a trade union, recognised by the bank for the purposes of 
collective bargaining.

We implemented a new hybrid work 
group framework that was applied 
by each country to suit their context 
and operational requirements.

We implemented a comprehensive 
range of wellbeing programmes 
and initiatives to address the 
wellbeing needs of our people.

The average sick absence rate for 
permanent employees and 
contractors was 1.6%.  

Working conditions and benefits

2022 highlights

STANDARD BANK GROUP    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT 2022

Employee benefits 
We provide a range of market-competitive 
benefits that help us to attract, motivate 
and retain employees by creating an 
exceptional benefits experience that is 
digitised, integrated and personalised. 
Our group benefits governance framework 
ensures a consistent approach across the 
group while factoring in local market 
practices and legislation. 

 � Benefits are market-competitive and 
relevant to local markets, customs, 
practices and/or culture.

 � Core benefits coverage is consistent 
across the group, even if local market 
conditions, collective bargaining 
arrangements and/or legislative 
requirements may demand differences 
in benefit offerings by country.

 � We ensure full regulatory and tax 
compliance in the establishment and 
delivery of benefits in every jurisdiction. 

 � Fairness and equity prevail across 
employee groups e.g. consistent 
treatment between general staff, 
managers and executives. 

Benefits are provided in addition to 
remuneration and include some 
allowances, for example for transport or 
meals. However, allowances for shift, 
overtime, standby and call-outs form part 
of remuneration and are not regarded as 
benefits for the purpose of benefits 
governance. 

We aim to enhance our employees’ lives 
with meaningful, personalised benefits 

that make them feel connected, 
empowered and recognised by offering 
benefits customised to employees’ needs 
and country nuances. We launched a 
MyBenefits digital portal in 2019, which 
has been implemented in 19 countries. It 
delivers a digital, integrated and 
personalised benefits experience and is 
available in multiple languages.

We offer a range of benefits to employees, 
with some as core compulsory benefits 
and others as non-core benefits that are 
applicable to specific employee 
groupings, or can be taken up by 
employees based on their personal needs 
and circumstances. 

We offer medical aid through a number of 
service providers in our various countries 
of operation to ensure fit-for-purpose 
benefits in line with country legislation. 
Each medical aid offers varied benefits 
relating to before, during and after 
pregnancy. Through our independent 
counselling and advisory services 
contracted in specific countries, we 
provide additional support such as advice 
to ensure wellbeing during pregnancy, 
psycho-social support and postnatal 
medical advice (breastfeeding, neonatal 
care, etc.). Through our wellbeing 
providers, employees have telephonic 
access to nurses who are able to provide 
guidance, education and support to 
lactating mothers. We provide breast-
feeding/lactation facilities in our 
wellbeing centres and some of our office 
spaces, but these are not available in all 
our facilities.

 � Part-time working options – In SBSA, where feasible, employees may switch from permanent full-time to 
part-time employment, with an applicable reduction in their package.

 � Fully on-site/office based – Employees should be on-site for all working hours, with some flexibility where 
the role allows. The employee is a full-time office worker with a designated office space and seating. 

In South Africa, which accounts for 64% of our employees, we have implemented a hybrid model of working 
which entails employees working according to any one of the following arrangements: 

Flexible working arrangements
Worldwide, organisations have been grappling 
with the challenge of the best way to manage 
flexible ways of working. Most of our people 
worked remotely from home in 2020 and 2021.  
In 2022, we experimented with fully onsite, hybrid 
(a mix of onsite and work from home) and fully 
remote work. Our Tell Us How You Are survey in 
2022 focused on how our employees in South 
Africa felt about the trial adoption of new ways of 
working. This allowed us to evaluate the impact 
these options have on our productivity, employee 
engagement and our service to our clients.

We are clear that there is no ‘one-size fits all’ 
solution. We aim to balance the needs and 
interests of various stakeholders. In considering 
the options, we take into account employee 
health and safety at home and at work, client 
engagement needs, the nature of work that our 
people do, socioeconomic conditions, access to 
technology and reliable power, generational needs 
and more. We recognise that in-person 
engagements have many benefits, like helping us 
to build and maintain diverse relationships, 
improving mental health and wellbeing, and 
solving for complex problems.

We seek to embrace workplace agility through 
mutual trust and commitment, serving our clients 
with excellence, ensuring operational 
effectiveness, and providing a positive experience 
for our employees and teams. We have developed 
a group framework within which each country can 
consider the best approach for their context. We 
offer flexible working arrangements, tailored to 
regulatory frameworks at country level and role 
requirements. In 2023, we aim to shift the focus 
from work location, to how we work together for 
effectiveness and delivery of high-quality 
outcomes. 

Parental leave
We provide employees with leave allowances to be there in the moments that matter, be it during the birth or 
adoption of a child or when something unforeseen happens. We aim to support all employees to manage the 
often-conflicting demands of work and home life as best as we can. Leave categories include parental leave for the 
birth of a child, adoption of a child, surrogacy or guardianship, and family responsibility leave. 

In South Africa, China, Isle of Man, Jersey, Tanzania, UAE, and the UK we provide primary caregiver parental leave of 
16+ weeks on full pay for the primary caregiver, and two weeks for the secondary caregiver, for births and 
adoptions. The Isle of Man and Jersey provide the same benefit for surrogacy and the UK provides the same benefit 
for surrogacy and guardianship. This covers 68% of our employee base.

Arrangements in other countries differ according to local regulations. Up to 16 weeks of paid maternity leave is 
offered in Angola, DRC, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, USA, Zambia, Zimbabwe, 
representing 13% of our employee base. Up to 12 weeks of paid primary caregiver leave is offered in Botswana, 
Ghana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Uganda, covering 18% of our employee base. 

When an employee returns to work following parental leave, they must return on the same terms and conditions of 
employment they had previously. We recognise that employees may require time to balance the demands of a new 
baby/child and the demands in their work environment. Where possible, we encourage flexible work arrangements 
to ensure that employees have a satisfactory work-life balance to adjust to their new responsibilities.

 � Remote – Employees work fully remotely but may be expected on site/in the office for specific activities 
during the year. Employees will need to book a hot desk when on-site/in the office. 

 � Flexible hybrid – Employees work on-site or in the office for a certain number of days in the month and work 
remotely for the remaining time. Employees will not have a dedicated desk in the office and may be required 
to book a hot desk when on-site/in the office.

Employee health and wellness
We support a holistic approach to 
employee wellbeing. We recognise that 
our people’s sense of wellbeing plays a 
key role in how they feel about their jobs, 
how well they perform and how they 
interact with colleagues, customers and 
clients. The Covid-19 pandemic had a 
significant impact on the emotional and 
psychological wellbeing of our people and 
was associated with an increased 
incidence of mental wellbeing issues, such 
as feelings of stress, depression and 
post-traumatic stress. 

Our wellbeing focus in 2022 sought to 
address these and related issues 
identified by our people who, in the Tell Us 
How You Are survey, identified managing 
stress, multiple demands, work-life 
balance and mental wellbeing, as their 
most significant wellbeing needs.

We implemented a range of wellbeing 
programmes and initiatives in response. 
These included: 

 � Group-wide webinars on issues such as 
the psychological and personal impact 
of transitioning to the hybrid way of 
working, becoming complexity fit, and a 
brain-based approach to combating 
burnout and optimising your 
functioning

 � Covid-19 support, information and 
guidance through our Covid-19 
information hub, vaccination 
information hub, Covid-19 helpline 
which provided guidance on workplace 
measures and practices, a clinical 
pathway to assess and support 
employees with post-Covid syndrome, 
webinars on Covid-19 and vaccines, and 
a dedicated support line in South Africa 
for queries about the vaccination policy. 

We also continued to provide Covid-19 
support to line managers, employees 
and their immediate family members

 � Mental health and wellbeing awareness 
sessions to provide our people with the 
tools to maintain mental wellbeing, 
destigmatise mental health issues in 
the workplace, and raise awareness 
about mental health including the role 
of psychosocial support, treatment, and 
reasonable workplace accommodation 

 � Emotional impact sessions for 
employees, providing a safe space to 
reflect on the emotional and 
psychological impact of the pandemic 

 � Webinars on topics such as work-life 
balance, mental health, managing 
multiple demands, managing stress and 
preventing burn-out, and financial 
wellbeing 

 � The Wellbeing Wednesdays 
communications series on our internal 
social media platform achieved over 
236 000 views. Themes included 
mental, social, financial and physical 
wellbeing 

Our Employee Assistance Programme 
(EAP) continues to provide confidential, 
personal support and information to our 
employees and their immediate 
dependants, at no cost to the employee. 
Services are provided through 
independent and external employee 
wellbeing providers in each country. 

We continued to position empathy as a 
leadership practice and incorporated 
empathy into some our leadership 
conversations.

Sick absence management
Wellbeing matters have the potential to 
impact not only the individual but also 
productivity and performance of the 
organisation more broadly. In addition to 
wellbeing initiatives to support individuals, 
we have a sick absence management 
framework to identify and support 
employees with wellbeing matters that 
have the potential to impact their 
performance and productivity. 

Metrics to help us appropriately identify 
and support our employees include 
average sick absence days per employee 
and average number of sick absence days 
per incident. 

 � Average sick absence days per 
employee: 2.7 down from 3.3 in 2021

 � Average number of sick days per 
incident: 2.9, down from 3.5 in 2021

 � The absence rate for permanent 
employees and contractors was 1.6%, 
down from 1.8% in 2021.

The decrease in metrics could indicate 
that employees are taking sick leave for 
acute health issues, a shift away from the 
trend during the pandemic, where 
Covid-19 and related conditions may have 
impacted the number of sick days taken. 

In 2022, we become the first company in 
Africa to sign up for Well at Scale, a 
commitment to improve employee 
wellbeing across the group. We are 
working toward achieving a Health and 
Safety seal on our commercial facilities. 
This includes commitments in respect of 
air quality, water quality and light quality, 
movement, thermal comfort, sound, 
materials and sense of community.

Occupational health and safety

Principles and 
frameworks 
Standard Bank’s occupational health and 
safety (OHS) policy seeks to achieve high 
standards of care and provide a healthy and 
safe workplace for employees, contractors, 
clients, visitors, and other relevant individuals 
and groups. The policy is aligned to the 
requirements of South Africa’s Occupational 
Health and Safety Act, Compensation for 
Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act and 
other relevant legislation and regulations. 

Our offices and operations in all geographies 
are required to comply with national OHS 
standards and legal requirements, or the 
group’s minimum standards, whichever is 
more stringent. We use multiple channels to 
proactively monitor regulatory developments 
across our countries of operation. We develop 
and implement risk management plans on an 
ongoing basis to ensure that our OHS 
management systems are in line with emerging 
requirements. 

The implementation of a hybrid 
working model required the 
reconstitution of OHS committees. 
We nominated and appointed new 
emergency officials and re-
established OHS committees across 
business areas.

In South Africa, we conducted full 
evacuation exercises at six of our 
nine provincial offices. We also 
supported evacuation walk-through 
exercises as an interim measure to 
practise emergency management 
capability in head office buildings, 
where different groups of employees 
are in the office on different days.

54 injuries on duty were reported.  
We had zero on duty fatalities.

OHS management system 
Our OHS management system aligns to the principles of the international OHSAS 18001 and the tenets of ISO 45001 standard. 
Each country has its own governance structure and policy, based on national regulatory requirements. 

Below is an example of our governance structure in South Africa.

The group SHE risk team is responsible for: 
 � Developing, implementing and maintaining an 

effective OHS framework and risk management plan 
 � Assisting client segments to comply with the SBSA 

policy and in-country health and safety legislation
 � Monitoring levels of OHS emergency preparedness, 

including emergency evacuation exercises
 � Ensuring that risk and hazard assessments are 

undertaken, risks are identified, and control 
measures are developed and implemented. Offices 
and branches are provided with a risk assessment 
template for office environments, which must be 
customised by the site to be appropriate for the 
relevant need and submitted to group SHE risk 
management. Risk assessments must be updated 
on an ongoing basis to take into account any activity 
that could result in harm to persons or property, 
including work projects and workplace social 
activities

 � Undertaking inspections across our operations to 
ensure policy compliance and support a positive 
health and safety culture. Inspections are 
undertaken on an ongoing basis, to conduct routine 
OHS compliance checks, and as triggered by risks or 
potential OHS risks. Where applicable, inspections 
are initiated by business to address identified risks 
and ensure compliance with applicable OHS 
provisions.

Section 16.2 appointees are responsible for creating OHS 
management structures in their areas of responsibility. 
This includes: 

 � Appointing OHS employee officials (health and safety 
representatives, first aiders, fire fighters, evacuation 
wardens, evacuation chair operators) and ensuring 
required training is provided

 � Ensuring formation and operation of health and safety 
committees

 � Ensuring a culture that promotes health and safety at 
work 

 � Establishing and maintaining appropriate controls to 
ensure compliance with the OHS policy

 � Ensuring awareness of hazards, risks, precautions and 
requirements in the workplace

 � Ensuring OHS risk assessments and identification of 
hazards and possible environmental impacts are 
undertaken by project teams, relevant resources and 
contractors for projects and activities in the workplace, 
and mitigation and control measures are implemented 
before commencement of a project or programme of 
work

 � Maintaining a high level of emergency preparedness, 
including bi-annual evacuation drills

 � Ensuring reporting of concerns regarding project 
management OHS and effective contractor 
management

 � Reporting OHS metrics for their area using the group’s 
reporting tools and submitting OHS management 
reports to relevant oversight committees

 � Taking corrective actions where non-compliance issues 
are raised

 � Ensuring all injuries, occupational diseases or damage to 
property or the environment, and incidents leading 
thereto, are reported and investigated to determine root 
causes and to implement corrective action.

Inspections and support visits 
Our evacuation management and preparedness 
initiative includes OHS site inspections and 
support visits by the SHE risk team, together with 
the physical security team where appropriate. 
Emergency evacuation management support visits 
are conducted in accordance with industry best 
practice and the group’s emergency management 
framework and evacuation management 
procedures. The SHE risk team reports on these 
visits to management in the relevant business 
area, and includes insights from these visits in 
reports to group SHEROC and group compliance 
committee.

Over the past six years, inspections have been 
conducted at 423 points of representation, 
including provincial offices, branches and service 
centers. In 2022, we visited 34 points of 
representation (visit frequency remains lower than 
during the pre-Covid period, as many employees 
continue to work from home or to work on a hybrid 
basis). Sites are also regularly inspected by 
government officials, to assess compliance with 
legal requirements. 

Evacuation drills are generally conducted at least 
twice a year. This includes walkthroughs and 
virtual engagements where applicable. Fire-
fighting equipment is serviced and maintained by 
the relevant appointed service provider, and first 
aid boxes are provided at conspicuous places 
unless otherwise indicated. OHS officials receive 
training at regular intervals, and all employees 
are required to watch an online educational 
evacuation training video as part of compulsory 
compliance training.

Employee responsibilities 
Health and safety is everyone’s responsibility. We require all group employees to:

 � Be aware of and understand the hazards and risks associated with their jobs and their work areas 
 � Take reasonable care for the health and safety of themselves and other persons who may be 

affected by their acts or omissions at the workplace and while working remotely
 � Comply with all applicable health and safety policies and procedures and follow safe work 

procedures as defined for any hazardous task 
 � Comply with all instructions issued to prevent OHS risks and incidents, including participation in 

OHS programmes and initiatives and emergency evacuation exercises
 � Complete mandatory OHS compliance training on our online learning platform every two years. 

99.7% of SA employees completed this training successfully in 2022
 � Promptly report any OHS hazards in their workplace
 � Report any work-related injuries sustained or diseases contracted in the working environment to 

their supervisors or line management.

In South Africa, a formal health and safety committee is a legal requirement under the country’s OHS 
Act. SBSA has an agreement with SASBO, the primary trade union for South Africa’s financial sector, 
on how OHS employee officials will be engaged around terms of office and removal from office, and 
related matters. We hold quarterly committee meetings at all our sites. These meetings provide a 
platform to discuss OHS matters, and upcoming projects or events that may impact on OHS. 
Appointed health and safety representatives receive targeted training from external service providers. 
Health and safety representatives provide feedback to management and OHS committee members at 
mandatory quarterly and in some cases monthly meetings.

Breaches 
Non-compliance with the OHS 
policy must be reported to line 
management and group SHE Risk. 
Failure to adhere to the OHS policy 
may lead to disciplinary action and 
possible dismissal. Employees and 
the group may be held liable for civil 
or criminal penalties.

In 2022, the group did not incur any 
civil or criminal penalties in relation 
to non-compliance with OHS.

Third-party 
responsibilities 

 � The procurement function is 
responsible for assessing OHS risks 
as part of our third-party risk 
assessment processes. 

 � We provide our service providers and 
contractors with information on their 
health and safety responsibilities and 
how their activities may impact the 
group’s operations. 

 � OHS clauses are incorporated into 
contractual agreements as and when 
required.

Incident reporting 
Each area of the business is required to report 
OHS metrics for their area using the group’s 
reporting tools. This information is collated by 
group SHE risk management and reviewed at 
the quarterly group SHEROC meeting, together 
with risk mitigation strategies. 

We have seen a significant reduction in the 
number of workplace injuries reported since 
2019 (when 162 incidents were reported). This is 
in part a result of the large proportion of our 
employees who worked from home during the 
Covid pandemic, and the introduction of a hybrid 
working model since April 2022, which results in 
fewer employees being in the office overall.

Sustainable 
investing 
Melville Douglas ESG policy 
As asset managers and fiduciaries, 
Melville Douglas Investment Management 
is committed to achieving sustainable, 
above-average returns on client 
investments. To achieve this, investment 
decisions include the assessment of 
material financial and non-financial 
factors, including ESG risks and 
opportunities. At present, ESG 
considerations are incorporated in the 
listed equity investment process. Melville 
Douglas is committed to expanding the 
scope of integration to include other asset 
classes and securities.

Melville Douglas’ focus on ESG is 
motivated by: 

 � Commitment to support the long-term 
sustainability of the economies, 
communities and natural environment 
in which they operate

 � Their belief that companies that focus 
on ESG issues as part of their overall 
strategy tend to offer lower investment 
risk and better investment returns.

Integrating ESG considerations into their 
investment and decision-making process 
allows Melville Douglas to better 
understand and quantify how the 
companies in which they invest are 
dependent upon, and impact, economic, 
human, and natural capital. This helps 
them to appropriately manage emergent 
risks and to leverage emerging investment 
opportunities.

They create competitive advantage by 
identifying responsible investment 
opportunities and support their clients by 
developing investment solutions in 
alignment with their ESG-related targets 
and goals. They hold themselves to the 
same ESG best practice standards they 
expect of investee companies.

Due diligence 
The ESG risk management framework for 
assets under management ensures that 
due diligence is included for every 
investee company as part of the core 
research process, to assess material ESG 
factors which may exclude companies 
from the investible universe of listed 
equities. 

 � First, companies are screened against 
the Melville Douglas excluded and 
sensitive activities policy statements 
(which are guided by global norms and 
best practice standards and 
conventions, and include activities in 
contravention with national or

that do not align to Melville Douglas‘ 
investment philosophy, and activities 
that deliver materially negative ESG 
impacts) 

 � Thereafter, detailed company-level due 
diligence is undertaken as part of the 
fundamental research process, to 
develop an ESG assessment and 
recommendations. This draws on 
companies’ public reporting, verified 
third-party reports, AGMs, media 
reports and sector specific 
sustainability assessments. Their 
proprietary ESG assessment is based 
on the Sustainable Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB) materiality 
map, which looks at material ESG 
disclosure topics across industries and 
sectors and identifies 26 sustainability-
related issues known as ‘general issue 
categories’. These are grouped under 
five themes: Environment, social 

capital, human capital, business model 
& innovation, and leadership & 
governance. Sector-level and industry-
level mapping identifies how likely an 
issue is to be classified as material for 
companies. A score is applied to each 
material category, based on how well 
the company deals with each issue and 
evaluation of the risk posed by the 
issue. A weighted ESG score is then 
calculated, reflected as a percentage. 

 � The ESG Committee provides oversight 
and investment recommendations, 
while the investment committees 
provide final approvals. 

 � A monitored list and a buy list is 
selected. 

 � Analysts prepare annual ESG reports 
and company guidelines to monitor 
investee companies’ progress on 
ESG issues. 

 � The trend of the company’s ESG score 
is monitored over time. Deterioration in 
the score prompts engagement with 
the company. For companies on the 
monitored list, ESG assessments are 
conducted at least once a year. 

 � Should a material contravention 
become apparent post the investment 
process, Melville Douglas will engage as 
necessary with the investee company to 
rectify the issue.

Active ownership and engagement 
Melville Douglas engages in active 
ownership and engagement to positively 
influence the adoption of progressive ESG 
practices in the companies which they 
invest. They exercise their rights and 
obligations as shareholders to vote in a 
manner that promotes ESG aligned 
business practices. They also engage 
directly with investee companies as 
appropriate to ensure the ongoing 
alignment of their ESG strategy with 
those of the companies in which they 
invest. They will divest from active 
positions in their portfolios where 
unmanaged ESG factors exceed risk 
tolerance and ongoing engagement with 
the company is deemed unsuccessful.

The   Melville Douglas ESG policy, 
includes their active engagement process. 
Internally they have a detailed ESG policy 
and a domestic proxy voting policy. This 
guides investment teams on how to 
exercise shareholder rights in the best 
interest of clients, establishes their 
position on various issues and provides 
information about their engagement and 
active ownership approach. All proxy 
votes are presented to their ESG 
committee for approval prior to 
submission. They actively engage investee 
companies to support, encourage, and 
catalyse sustainable business operations. 

They:
 � Participate in mandatory governance 

and proxy voting requirements of 
investee companies

 � Conduct proxy voting in alignment with 
the ESG strategy and associated 
policies. Investment teams are guided 
by their research and the support of the 
ESG Committee to cast votes in a 
manner that aims to achieve the best 
ESG aligned outcome for the investee 
companies

 � Communicate in a constructive and 
clear manner that promotes improved 
ESG performance

 � Expect investee companies to provide 
timeous feedback to ESG-related 
correspondence. Where appropriate, 
matters are addressed through the 
company secretary to ensure the board 
is informed about material issues that 
are being raised.

Governance 
The independent ESG committee 
oversees ESG policies, due diligence, 
engagement, and proxy voting processes. 
It reports to the Melville Douglas Fund 
Boards, the Melville Douglas Investment 
Management Board of Directors, and 
investment committees, summarising 
voting results, policies, procedures, and 
other noteworthy items. It also works with 

the various asset class committees to 
support the establishment of frameworks 
for:

 � Assessing ESG issues for their asset 
class

 � Maintaining an appropriate set of proxy 
voting guidelines

 � Overseeing and approving exclusions 
lists for use in various investment 
capacities

 � Implementing the responsible 
investment strategy.

Liberty’s responsible 
investment policy 
Liberty Holdings Limited (LHL) recognise 
ESG as a material investment 
consideration, forming a material element 
in driving risk-adjusted returns for clients. 
As stewards of client funds and to deliver 
on client financial outcomes, they believe 
that the consideration of sustainability in 
investment decisions is essential to value 
creation and capital protection.

Liberty Holdings finds value in 
incorporating relevant and material ESG 
issues that can meaningfully affect 
investment performance in their research, 
decision-making, reporting and ongoing 
monitoring processes. This enables them 
to better identify investments that will 
provide sustainable and superior risk-

adjusted returns. As an active asset 
owner, they can influence corporates and 
entities to incorporate ESG factors, 
thereby promoting sustainable 
businesses. Their policy commits them to: 

 � Promoting integration of ESG factors 
into the investment process 

 � Active engagement in considering ESG 
factors 

 � Exercising ownership rights 
 � Collaborating to drive desired outcomes 
 � Communicating their responsible 

investing activities 
 � Applying ESG oversight to their 

investment capabilities. 

Their investment teams outsource the 
asset management function to third-party 
asset managers, the majority of which is 
managed by STANLIB. They review and 
analyse relevant ESG data to build as 
complete a picture as possible of ESG 
risks embedded in the shares of their 
portfolios. Investment teams are 
periodically engaged on their evolving 
ESG approaches and report to the group 
client experience and fairness committee 
(GCxFC) on progress made.

and seeks to enhance risk-adjusted 
returns 

 � Related material ESG investment risks 
and opportunities are addressed in a 
consistent manner through clear 
identification, measurement, 
management, reporting and ongoing 
monitoring across investment 
management processes 

 � Principles of good corporate 
governance are applied in the 
investment decision-making process 

 � Compliance with relevant legislation 
and adoption of best practice voluntary 
standards

 � Ethical investing allowing for the 
exclusion of certain stocks or industries, 
in line with Liberty's code of ethics 

 � Sustainable and impactful investing 
through comprehensive assessment 
and valuation of companies or 
industries, which incorporates ESG 
risks and opportunities, where 
applicable, and 

 � Promotion of ESG management 
practices within companies through 
active engagement, where feasible. 

STANLIB endorses CRISA 2 and is a 
signatory to the PRI. Their responsible 
investment policy incorporates ESG 
principles. The policy guides investment 
teams as they integrate ESG into 
investment processes.

Managing our social and 
environmental risks and impacts

2022 highlights

Environmental and social (E&S) risk refers to the 
risk of adverse impacts on people and the natural 
environment arising from our business activities. 
Such impacts may include risks to the environment, 
including impacts on climate and biodiversity, and 
social risks such as impacts on local communities’ 
livelihoods and adverse impacts on human rights 
(understood at a minimum as those expressed in the 
International Bill of Human Rights and the 
International Labour Organization’s Declaration on 

Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work). Such 
risks may arise from our direct business activities, or 
from the activities of the clients or projects we 
finance, and may impact on our employees, our 
clients, the individuals and enterprises in our supply 
chain, and the communities impacted directly or 
indirectly by our business activities. E&S risk creates 
potential credit risk, operational risk, business risk 
and reputational risk.

 � The standard and policy apply to all the group's banking entities. They are primarily applicable 
in relation to our business, commercial and corporate clients. They also apply to products 
such as corporate loans, trade finance, project finance, debt and equity market services.

 � We assess the E&S performance of our clients and partners before entering a transaction, 
investment or business relationship with them.

 � E&S risk management is integrated into our lending and investment processes. Our 
credit management policies and processes include assessment of E&S risks and associated 
mitigation measures and opportunities. 

 � Development of new products and services incorporates E&S risk assessment. 
Opportunities to create positive E&S outcomes are actively identified and pursued. 

 � Investment governance includes E&S risk assessment and monitoring. E&S due diligence 
must be undertaken for investee companies in  high-risk industries or transactions. 
This includes assessment of the quality of the investee company’s monitoring and reporting 
regarding long-term sustainability of strategy and operations. 

 � Certain trading proposals are screened from an E&S risk perspective based on potential E&S 
risks related to the sector and the specific client. GESR is currently working with the Trade 
Finance team to develop a more formalised E&S screening and review process for trade 
finance deals.

Principles and frameworks
Standard Bank’s overarching environmental and social management system (ESMS) comprises 
various risk management policies, procedures, processes and tools. The ESMS seeks to guide all 
relevant stakeholders within the bank through the implementation of E&S risk management.  
Our E&S risk governance standard sets out the group’s E&S risk management framework, which 
provides for the governance, identification, measurement, management and reporting of E&S risks 
associated with the group’s financing and investment activities. The standard is supported by the 
group E&S risk policy, which details how the framework should be implemented. Group 
environmental and social risk (GESR) is responsible for reviewing, updating and ensuring the effective 
implementation of the standard and policy.

Our E&S risk management processes are based on international good practice and align with the 
requirements of the Equator Principles, the IFC Performance Standards, and the Principles for 
Responsible Banking. Further, as an Equator Principles Financial Institution (EPFI), Standard Bank 
commits to implementing the Equator Principles in our internal environmental and social policies, 
procedures and standards for financing projects, and to evaluating and actively avoiding and mitigating 
any negative social or environmental impacts when we lend or provide advisory services  
to a project.

The standard and policy are supported by the  group human rights statement our 
  exceptions list, the  group climate policy and related policies. 

Group portfolio risk management committee

 � Review results of portfolio reviews, stress testing, appetite and strategy 
assessments for all risk types, including E&S risk

 � Set concentration limits or thresholds of portfolios and risk appetite 
indicator guidelines for group

 � Assess portfolio composition and implications of climate stress testing.

New business approval committee

 � Review recommendations from relevant committees and business 
processes, including E&S risk assessment processes.

Credit risk committees

 � Decide on client onboarding and offboarding, including for reasons of 
environmental or social counterparty risk.

Country risk committees

 � Monitor and ensure compliance with E&S contractual obligations in lending 
and funding agreements

 � Ensure integration of appropriate E&S risk processes and mitigations across 
business

 � Ensure relevant E&S clauses included in contracts
 � Report regulatory non-compliance, directives or fines to GESR so policy gaps 

can be closed and performance improved.

Structured transactions committee and structured transactions  
pre-screening committees

 � Review and assess transactions which, in addition to credit and country risks, 
include potential exposure to reputational, social or environmental risks.

E&S risk screening 

 � All new lending applications, excluding 
personal banking, are screened by 
pre-credit committees for E&S risks using 
the group’s digital E&S screening tool. 

 � The E&S screening process checks for 
compliance with national laws and 
standards, our exceptions list and 
relevant group policies including the 
E&S risk standard and policy. Where 
applicable, we also apply the IFC 
Performance Standards and the 
Equator Principles. Screening provides 
an initial indication of possible risks 
associated with a client’s ability to 
manage E&S issues and with the 
transaction itself. 

 � We use three levels of screening 
according to the type of financial 
product, the quantum and tenor of the 
transaction and the potential E&S risks 
involved. Each level includes likely E&S 
risk, sector and client considerations, 
the client’s ability to manage E&S risk 
and historical track record. Risks are 
rated low, medium or high. 

 � E&S screening includes client and 
transaction risk: 

 – Client Risk Assessment (CRA): Risks 
associated with a client due to labour 
issues, negative media attention, NGO 
or activist focus, community issues or 
reputational risk to the group, and 
client's ability to manage E&S risks

 – Transactional Risk Assessment (TRA): 
Risks associated with a transaction due 
to sector, activities to be undertaken 
and nature of finance and risks 
associated with security over assets, 
for example, contamination of land.

 � Screening determines: 

 – Whether to proceed with a transaction
 – Whether further E&S assessment of the 
client and/or transaction is required

 – The level of E&S risk review required.

We assess the E&S performance of our clients and partners before entering a transaction, investment 
or business relationship with them. The E&S risk process is shown in the figure below.

Governance risks 
 � Governance around E&S risk 

management, including whether the client 
has appropriate E&S policies and ESMS

 � Negative E&S media attention.

Environmental risks 
 � Impacts on landscapes, biodiversity 

and ecosystems will be avoided and/or 
minimised.

 � Impacts on surface water and 
groundwater, as well as air quality, will 
be avoided and/or minimised.

 � Pollution from business and/or project 
activities is minimised.

 � Hazardous substances will be stored 
and managed properly. 

 � Sustainable use of resources, including 
energy and water, and minimisation of 
GHG emissions, is promoted. 

 � Direct and indirect impacts on 
biodiversity and ecosystem services 
are identified and avoided or mitigated. 
Practices that integrate conservation 
needs and development priorities will 
be adopted to promote the sustainable 
management of living natural 
resources. 

We undertake careful analysis of the 
relative E&S related risks and costs 
associated with managing these factors 
to identify the most appropriate course 
of action and optimal mitigation actions. 
While trade-offs may be necessary, they 
must not compromise the group’s 
commitment to human rights and must 
always adhere to all applicable laws and 
regulations. By embedding E&S risk 
assessment processes into lending 
practices at an early stage, we ensure 
E&S consideration and accountability in 
decision-making and monitoring. 

Social risks, including human rights risks 
 � Workers’ rights are protected. Workers are treated fairly 

and provided with safe and healthy working conditions. 
Vulnerable categories of workers, such as migrant 
workers, are protected. (For Equator Principles 
transactions, this incudes gender equity, risks of 
discrimination, and freedom of association) 

 � Child labour, and forced and compulsory labour, are 
prohibited. 

 � Risks to communities, including health and safety, have 
been/will be assessed, avoided or minimised. 

 � Security assessment 
 � Safeguarding of personnel and property will be carried 

out in accordance with relevant human rights principles 
and will avoid/minimise risks to affected communities. 

 � Adverse impacts on communities and people from land 
acquisition, restrictions on land use, resettlement and 
livelihood changes, displacement or forced eviction will 
be anticipated and avoided where possible. Where 
avoidance is not possible, impacts on affected 
communities will be minimised and livelihoods and 
standards of living of displaced persons improved or 
restored. 

 � Cultural heritage and/or archaeological resources is/will 
be protected. 

 � Potential adverse impacts on indigenous people are 
identified and avoided where possible. If unavoidable, 
engagement has taken/will take place with the impacted 
community and actions taken to minimise, restore and/
or compensate for adverse impacts in a culturally 
appropriate manner commensurate with the nature and 
scale of such impacts.

Advice and approvals 
 � The responsible deal team or client 

relationship manager ensures the 
completeness, accuracy and consistency 
of E&S screening and other relevant 
information contained in pre-credit or new 
business applications. 

 � The responsible business area and credit 
officer ensure that relevant E&S risks are 
reported timeously to GESR for further 
analysis and decision-making. 

 � GESR evaluates all project-related 
transactions and all medium and high-risk 
non-project related transactions, provides 
commentary in the pre-credit approval 
paper and more detailed commentary in 
the credit paper, and works with the 
business and credit teams, and our clients, 
to assess and mitigate risks. 

 � Transactions rated as high E&S risk 
require approval from the head of GESR 
prior to credit approval. 

 � Prior to financial close on transactions, 
GESR reviews and provides input into loan 
agreements. Post financial close, GESR 
undertakes annual reviews of clients to 
make sure that E&S risks are being 
managed appropriately over time.

Risks we screen for
Screening includes assessment of the following issues, 
taking account of potential risks associated with the 
business, sector, transaction, or project:

STANDARD BANK GROUP    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT 2022

84



 � We work with our clients to ensure that their E&S risk-related functions are 
appropriately resourced, and that they can effectively manage their material health 
and safety and E&S related risks and impacts.

 � GESR determines the required scale and scope of E&S due diligence per transaction, 
commensurate with the potential level of E&S risk (low, medium or high) as guided 
by the E&S screening tool. GESR applies the Equator Principles and associated IFC 
Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability and the World 
Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines (EHS Guidelines) to all 
relevant project-related financing or transactions. As per the Equator Principles 
requirements, we, or our independent E&S consultants, categorise relevant projects 
proposed for financing based on the magnitude of potential E&S risks and impacts 
as Category A, B or C. GESR provides the categorisation for Equator Principles 
transactions and is involved in ongoing due diligence for all Category A and B 
projects.

 � For medium or high-risk clients/transactions that are not Project Financing or 
Equator Principles related transactions, GESR undertakes an internal desk-top E&S 
review of the client, its operations and the transaction. 

 � GESR works with business and credit teams to undertake enhanced due diligence for 
all project-related transactions and transactions identified as medium or high-risk. 
This may include sector or issue specific questions, direct client engagement and 
site visits, and/or the use of independent external E&S consultants.

 � For all Equator Principles transactions, GESR works with the client to develop the 
scope of work for the undertaking of an environmental and social due diligence 
(ESDD) by an independent E&S consultant. The consultant is selected by the 
borrower and lenders and contracted by the borrower to undertake a detailed 
independent environmental and social due diligence (ESDD) of the project. This 
identifies any issues or gaps from an E&S risk management perspective, including 
gaps in meeting Equator Principles or IFC Performance Standard requirements. 
Based on any gaps identified, the consultant develops an environmental and social 
action plan (ESAP). The ESAP notes any actions and associated time frames that 
need to be implemented by the client. The ESAP or key actions from the E&S review 
are included as clauses in the facility agreement with the client. This may include 
requirements in respect of mitigating actions, monitoring and reporting by clients to 
address E&S risks.

 � We engage our clients to encourage them to apply the Precautionary Principle to 
their operations and activities, where applicable.

STAGE 2:  
Due diligence during credit assessment process 

2

 � For Category A and where appropriate, Category B project finance, human rights due 
diligence is part of the ESDD completed by the independent E&S consultant on behalf 
of the lenders. 

 � For non-project financing, GESR identifies potential human rights issues based on 
general monitoring of negative media and campaigns against clients. 

 � Where human rights risks can be mitigated, we include controls in client legal 
agreements. This may include client labour policies to address human rights issues 
and/or provide for collective bargaining, supply chain management and monitoring, 
compliance with IFC Performance Standards and ILO conventions. Where necessary, 
we commission independent specialist reviews/audits to confirm implementation of 
mitigation plans.

 � Where relevant, clients implement independently verified monitoring of supply chain or 
certification processes that address human rights. Examples include the Roundtable on 
Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the Better Cotton Initiative. 

 � In some instances, we require human rights assessment and monitoring by specialist 
consultants and annual feedback from clients on progress with action plans and 
mitigation processes. 

Assessment of human rights risks is integral to E&S due diligence

 � Grievance mechanisms for employees: We require all our corporate clients 
to have in place grievance mechanisms for their employees to raise 
workplace concerns, and to inform employees of these mechanisms. 

 � Community grievance mechanisms: Where it is anticipated that a new 
project or existing company operations will involve ongoing risk and adverse 
impacts on surrounding communities, we require the client to establish/
provide evidence of a community grievance mechanism to receive and 
facilitate resolution of the affected communities’ concerns and complaints 
about the client’s E&S performance (as per the IFC Performance Standards 
on Social and Environmental Sustainability). The grievance mechanism 
should be scaled to risks and adverse impacts of the project, address 
concerns promptly, use an understandable and transparent process that is 
culturally appropriate and readily accessible to all segments of the affected 
communities, and do so at no cost to communities and without retribution. 
The client is responsible for informing affected communities about the 
mechanism through its community engagement process.

Controls 
Where E&S risk is deemed significant, it must be included in risk and 
control self-assessments, to ensure appropriate controls are identified 
and mitigation plans developed. Actual or potential losses associated 
with E&S risk incidents may impact the amount of advanced 
measurement approach (AMA) regulatory capital held for operational 
risk. As the group holds capital for E&S risk, scenarios must consider 
the impact of E&S risks. 

GESR is responsible for ensuring that 
appropriate systems and processes 
are maintained to collect, and store 
required E&S risk data, and that there 
is reasonable assurance of data 
integrity and completeness. Where 
external data or analysis is used, the 
E&S risk team relies on the source to 
provide assurance for data accuracy. 

E&S incident reporting to the bank is 
included as a condition in loan 
agreements with clients. GESR ensures 
that any significant E&S (or health and 
safety) risk incident is recorded in the 
operational risk management system 
and reported in line with the 
operational risk materiality matrix, so 
that appropriate actions can be taken 
to prevent recurrence. GESR is also 
responsible for ensuring that any 
breaches of the E&S standard or 
policy, and/or any material E&S 
counterparty risk, is promptly reported 
to the relevant decision-making bodies 
within the group. 

If clients are not compliant with the 
group’s E&S requirements, we work 
with them to close the gaps and 
achieve the necessary standards over 
time. If there is no progress toward 
meeting requirements within agreed 
timeframes, remedies may include 
additional monitoring and revised 
action plans; specialist or independent 
intervention; or re-evaluation of the 
loan.

We are committed to taking 
appropriate steps where we discover, 
or are made aware, that we have 
contributed to or caused actual or 
perceived human rights abuses or 
environmental damage. This may 
include constructive engagement to 
promote better practice, or 
termination of the business 
relationship. 

Ongoing monitoring 
 � Credit managers apply the digital E&S screening tool as part of the process of 

regular (at least annual) review of existing transactions and clients. E&S risks that 
emerge after financial close are flagged and assessed through this process.

 � Business is responsible for ongoing monitoring of their portfolios. Frequency and 
type of monitoring is determined by the type of transaction and the level of risk. 

 � GESR annually reviews all Equator Principles transactions categorised as Category 
A or B, other transactions identified as high E&S risk, and clients identified as high 
and medium risk, as part of the annual credit review process. These reviews require 
completion of the digital E&S screening tool to determine a CRA rating and assess 
whether the client is meeting their E&S commitments. 

 � Where necessary, GESR undertakes site visits to ensure that E&S performance is 
being managed appropriately. Independent external E&S consultants may be used 
to monitor implementation and progress if required for Equator Principles deals. 

 � The group undertakes portfolio-wide reviews of high-risk sectors. These reviews 
enhance the group’s decision-making during transaction approval processes and 
provide a mechanism for proactive client engagement. 

Targeted business areas (business, credit, legal, coverage) across the group 
undergo mandatory training on E&S risk awareness, Standard Bank’s E&S risk 
management process, the E&S screening tool and relevant environmental and 
social guidelines, standards and requirements.

Training includes interactive ‘classroom’ training and online training courses on 
the group's in-house training platform.

We are deploying ESG tools to assist credit managers, country risk and portfolio 
risk teams with ESG risk information relevant to our portfolio.

E&S coordinators at country level receive in-country training.

The project
Terminal Industriel Polyvalent de San Pedro (TIPSP) is 
the concessionaire involved in the development of the 
San Pedro Multipurpose Industrial Terminal Project in 
Cote d’ Ivoire. As part of San Pedro Port extension, a 
35‐year concession was granted by the Autonomous 
Port of San Pedro (the Authority) to TIPSP in 
December 2016. The project encompasses the 
design, construction, financing, operation and 
maintenance of a 13.8 ha port platform comprising 
two berths. Construction started in 2019 and was 
completed in 2022. The port extension is now 
operational.

Stakeholder engagement
A public participation process was completed during 
the ESIA, as per national requirements. Several 
rounds of public consultations have been carried out 
since then by the concessionaire with key 
stakeholders, including local elected officials, civil 
servants, stakeholders in the artisanal fisheries at the 
fishing port of San Pedro (fishermen, wholesalers and 
retailers) and the Blowa Toro Association, which 
represents landowners claiming customary rights 
over port land. The project has a community 
grievance mechanism in place.

Our direct environmental impacts arise mainly from energy use at our office 
and branch infrastructure, cash and data centres, and to a lesser extent, from 
waste generation at these buildings and employee travel. 

Our primary focus for the reduction of direct emissions is in South Africa, 
which accounts for our largest physical presence. We estimate that our South 
African operations constitute approximately 72% of our real estate physical 
footprint and about 88% of our scope 1 and 2 operational emissions. 

The collection and analysis of accurate and comprehensive scope 1 and 2 data 
across our multiple countries of operation remains a challenge for the group. 
We have identified the need to improve metering, data capture and analysis 
systems in our countries outside South Africa. This will enable us to better 
track usage and determine appropriate yearly reduction targets for each of our 
countries of operation. 

As a starting point, we have selected five additional African countries for 
immediate focus, based on the materiality of their emissions to the group 
total. Materiality was determined based on the physical size of the portfolio 
in-country and the grid emission factor per country. We have started the 
process of installing meters in these countries, but are currently collecting 
data manually at key facilities, to enable us to model a baseline for setting 
targets and monitoring progress.

Reducing the group’s 
operational footprint 
We continue to prioritise decreasing our carbon footprint in line 
with international best practices. We have committed to achieving 
net zero carbon emissions from our own operations for newly built 
facilities by 2030, and for existing facilities by 2040, using the 
absolute contraction approach, and aligned to the science-based 
target methodology. To achieve this target, we aim to achieve an 
annual reduction of 4.2% of Standard Bank’s 2014 baseline 
emissions. We have already reached a number of milestones, 
including reducing electricity consumption by 45%, and producing 
more than 18 085MWh of renewable energy through our 2MW 
tri-generation plant and solar PV rooftop and carport installations.

At our head office building in Rosebank, Johannesburg, we operate a 2MW tri-generation plant to produce electricity 
from natural gas and use the waste heat to supplement our need for building heating and cooling. This is equivalent to 
powering 3 952 South African households per year. The system helps reduce strain on the electricity grid and improve 
resilience to loadshedding, by using natural gas as a primary source. It can supply up to 60% of the building’s electrical 
needs. 

We have installed 2MW small-scale embedded generational rooftop solar PV plants at ten of our head office buildings 
(nine in Johannesburg and our Durban head office), covering an area of approximately 13466sqm. We have plans to 
expand our solar PV installations to additional head office buildings and branches, adding another 1.8MW of renewable 
energy to our portfolio by 2025, and to expand rooftop solar PV to retail sites at bank-owned sites. Our group leadership 
training centre in Johannesburg is certified as ISO50001.

Energy 
Electricity comprises the major contributor to 
the group’s direct carbon footprint (scope 2 
location-based emissions). The energy used to 
keep our infrastructure operational is mainly 
sourced from the national electricity grids of 
the countries in which the group operates. In 
consequence, our carbon emissions reflect 
these countries’ current reliance on coal-fired 
power. In South Africa, we purchase our 
electricity from the national utility, Eskom. 
Additionally, the group uses diesel generators 
to provide emergency power with an 
associated impact on scope 1 emissions. In 
2022, our scope 1 emissions from the use of 
diesel generations increased substantially 
owing to high rates of load shedding across 
the country. Scope 2 emissions arising from 
purchased electricity declined as a result of 
efficiency gains and reduced availability owing 
to load shedding.  

All of our commercial sites are metered. In 
2022, we improved metering of branches from 
58% to 67%. Electricity consumption data for 
these facilities is collected directly from our 
meters. Consumption from unmetered data is 
extrapolated using a verified method which is 
documented for auditing purposes. The total 
consumption data is converted to CO2 

equivalent using a factor obtained from 
Eskom. We use our metered data to develop 
business cases to ensure investment is 
targeted to priority areas which offer attractive 
paybacks and return on investment. 

Our energy management system aligns with 
ISO 50001, an international standard designed 
to improve energy performance and 
consequently conserve resources, tackle 
climate change and save money.

Water 
We have put measures in place to ensure that our strategic facilities across South Africa are 
water efficient, have a reliable source of water when there is an interruption to supply from the 
municipality and minimise water waste. 

 � Since 2016, we’ve installed water meters in our strategic facilities to enable accurate 
monitoring of water usage and benchmarking across locations and against industry 
benchmarks. 

 � In 2019, we identified sites displaying high-use, and implemented water efficiency projects, 
including low-flow bathroom taps and showers. 

 � We identified sites at significant water risk, and installed back-up water storage tanks. 
 � All HVAC systems at our main facilities have been standardised to accommodate air cooled 

chillers and reduce our need for water. In some cases, we make use of combination systems 
like dry adiabatic coolers to achieve a balance between energy efficiency and water 
conservation. 

 – Our dry adiabatic cooler has reduced water consumption at our head office building in 
Rosebank, Johannesburg, by 25 000kl (the equivalent of 500 average sized swimming 
pools).

 � In 2022, we initiated a portfolio wide replacement of taps to a single touch solution, to 
support our Covid-19 response. 

 � We have installed rainwater harvesting solutions at Kingsmead head office building in 
Durban, reducing water consumption by 4 600kl  
(92 swimming pools) in 2022. 

 � We test and monitor the quality of our drinking water to International Well Building Institute  
standards.

Waste 
Our waste includes general waste and wet waste from our canteens 
and restaurants, which are mostly sent to landfill, and hazardous 
waste. In 2019, we introduced a ‘follow me’ printing initiative in our 
offices, which has significantly reduced office paper usage. We 
actively encourage staff to be paper-wise when they print. We are 
actively exploring ways to further reduce our waste to landfill.

Air quality 

Since 2002, we have significantly enhanced the indoor air quality (IAQ) in 
our buildings, contributing to the wellbeing of our people and greatly 
reducing the risk of airborne infections. 

In 2022, 17 of our commercial facilities and six retail facilities received 
GreenFlag certification. The GreenFlag Association is a third-party 
validation body approved by the South African National Accreditation 
System (SANAS) to assess and issue certification to facilities that meet 
stringent air quality standards, using the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) as 
an indicator of IAQ. This means that these facilities are continuously 
monitored for CO2 and can operate better than the acceptable levels of 
800 parts per million (ppm). 

Initiatives in Africa Regions 
In 2020, Stanbic IBTC deployed hybrid solar systems in some of its 
branches and off-site ATMs across Nigeria, reducing its total carbon 
emission by 1.67 tonnes. We deployed hybrid solar systems in various 
branches and off-site ATMs. We also reduced paper usage from printing and 
photocopies by 30% across branch locations on the Go-Green branch 
initiative. We have held webinars for employees to promote awareness of the 
impact of climate change and provide practical methods to enable 
individuals to reduce their own carbon footprints and help contribute to net 
zero emissions achievement. We also have an EDGE certified facility and 
power purchase agreements in place. 

Our head office in Windhoek, Namibia has a 5-star Green Star rating and 
solar PV. In Botswana we have installed a 99KW system. In Zambia, we have 
implemented energy efficiency initiatives and savings.

Sponsorships 
The group sponsorship policy governs all sponsorships undertaken by the group. 

 � We define sponsorship as a commercially viable investment of cash, product or in-kind support with a 
rights holder, for which the bank receives quantifiable commercial rights in return. 

 � Due diligence is carried out on rights holders prior to contracting, to ensure entities are of impeccable 
integrity and are reputationally sound. 

 � In South Africa, we spent R10 million on sponsorships in 2022, including support of the National 
Arts Festival, the Wits Art Museum and exhibitions at the Standard Bank Gallery. 

Civil society organisations/NGOs
 � Funding policies are determined at country level. 
 � In South Africa, the expanded democracy support programme 

guidelines govern the assessment of funding requests and the 
provision of financial support to civil society organisations. They 
ensure consistency in the assessment, management and 
outcomes of funding requests and compliance with applicable 
statutory and regulatory obligations and the group values and 
code of ethics and conduct, while guarding against the risk that 
such contributions be used inappropriately to obtain business 
advantage. Organisations are funded for a three-year period. 

 � In 2022, we provided R4 million in funding to eight 
organisations (R500 000 each).

Political parties 
 � We do not fund political campaigns. 
 � We do not fund political parties outside of South Africa.
 � In South Africa, we provide funding for political parties 
under our democracy support programme (DSP). This 
board-approved funding policy is reviewed every five years. As 
of 2022, donations are made directly to the Independent 
Electoral Commission (IEC), in line with arrangements provided 
for in the Political Party Act 6 of 2018. Guidelines are in place to 
guard against the risk that such contributions be used 
inappropriately, by the bank, our employees or third parties, to 
obtain business advantage. Political parties receive no other 
financial support from the group.

Engagement with 
regulators
We continued to monitor policy and regulatory 
developments across the group and provide evidence-
based submissions to support the policy making process. 
We have seen a notable shift in several of our countries of 
operation toward forward-looking regulatory supervision, as 
embodied in stress testing requirements and recovery and 
resolution planning, particularly in respect of climate risk. A 
challenge for the group, operating as we do across multiple 
countries and regions, is that different countries are adopting 
global standards and good practice at different times, and 
that some countries have taken different regulatory 
approaches to issues (such as adoption of cloud and 
cryptocurrencies, for example), with implications for our 
group strategy and operations.

In South Africa, we maintain a schedule of policy and 
regulatory developments, which is shared with relevant 
internal stakeholders across the group to ensure awareness 
and readiness for new regulatory requirements. In 2022, we 
assessed 104 new regulatory issues and completed 
51 submissions on behalf of the bank to Parliament, 
regulators, government departments and trade associations. 

Engagement with civil 
society
Standard Bank’s climate-related risk exposure, and our 
finance for fossil-fuel related projects, remained a priority 
concern for civil society organisations. Our role as an advisor, 
and potential funder, for the East African crude oil pipeline, 
was the primary focus.

Stakeholder concerns include the potential risk to local 
communities and livelihoods, biodiversity and wildlife, 
together with negative climate impacts. We engaged with a 
range of organisations on these issues throughout the year 
and included their feedback and research reports into our due 
diligence processes. We continue to engage with the asset 
owner/project lead on issues related to communication, 
community consultation and social and environmental risk 
management. 

Issues on which we engaged with regulators in 2022

 � Supervisory attention remained focused on enhancing AML and CFT to avoid ‘grey-
listing’ by Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

 � We engaged with National Treasury, bilaterally and through the Banking Association, and 
submitted action plans and progress reports to the PA as required.

AML/financial crime 
regulation

 � Engagements with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) were led by the group 
CEO, SBSA CEO and business heads. Additional engagements on specific issues were led 
by the relevant executive teams. 

 � FSCA commended the bank for the constructive and efficient nature of the engagements, 
while identifying specific areas for improvement. 

 � Account closures received considerable attention. FSCA noted areas for improvement 
including the content and manner of communication with clients when termination takes 
place, and the process of escalation should the client disagree with the decision.

 � Other areas of engagement included the inappropriate activation of a small number of 
MyMo accounts, and the measures we have implemented to protect against such 
practices, and problems experienced in system stability in the first half of the year, and 
how we have addressed the issues and improved resilience.

Conduct, customer 
fairness, market integrity 

 � We engaged with government and industry regarding the country’s climate change policy, 
and with the SARB regarding climate risk management and stress-testing.

Climate-related risk 
identification and 
management 

 � We continued to engage with National Treasury regarding the development of a national 
green taxonomy. The taxonomy is currently voluntary. Regulatory guidance is planned.

 � We have included elements of the taxonomy in revisions to our sustainable finance 
frameworks. 

 � Together with National Treasury, we hosted a webinar with group employees to familiarise 
them with the taxonomy.

Sustainable finance,

 � We engaged with regulators regarding the policy and regulatory environment for fintechs, 
the development of a platform business and how this will impact our clients, and 
regulatory positions on Cloud in our different countries of operation. 

 � We engaged with the inter-governmental fintech working group of financial sector 
regulators on crypto assets development.

Engagement with industry bodies 
We participate in a variety of industry bodies at country and global level. We are active members of banking and/or insurance associations in our countries of operation. We also engage 
in broader business associations and industry work groups set up by regulators or government. These memberships enable us to contribute to public policy debates, support evidence-
based policy making, and contribute to processes such as the development of global standards and frameworks. We do not provide funding for lobbying on specific issues.

Our countries of operation are responsible for 
developing their CSI policies and plans on the 
basis of this framework, prioritising areas 
according to local need and priorities. In all 
cases, we work closely with government 
departments and other social partners to 
understand priorities at the national and local 
level, and partner with local agencies and 
community organisations to ensure effective 
and sustainable delivery of our programmes. 
Each country is responsible for articulating a 
clear business rationale for CSI which ensures 
that CSI delivers shared value to the group and 
the communities within which we operate, and 
for developing appropriate governance 
structures, management structures and 
reporting processes. 

Our CSI strategy incorporates: 
 � Strategic projects/community investments, in 

which we contract with NGO partners to 
undertake longer term interventions in line 
with our three selected impact areas

 – In SA, R78 million in 2022, comprising 62% 
of total CSI spending

 � Charitable donations on an ad hoc and 
responsive basis, including disaster relief and 
humanitarian relief

 – In SA, R34 million in 2022, comprising 26% 
of total CSI spending

 � Employee community involvement and 
contributions, including donations and 
volunteering of time and skills to community 
outreach projects and disaster/humanitarian 
relief. We encourage our employees to get 
involved in meaningful, sustainable volunteer 
work in the communities, including donations 
and volunteering of time and skills to 
community outreach projects and disaster/
humanitarian relief. 

 – In SA, R11 million comprising 9% of total 
CSI spending1

Countries are required to report twice a year to 
group on their CSI programmes and spending. 
These reports are collated and submitted to the 
group social and ethics committee. Our CSI 
budget is calculated by each country of 
operation as 1% of net profit after tax (NPAT) of 
the previous year.

Principles and frameworks

Employee volunteering 
In South Africa, we have partnered with ForGood, an online 
platform that connects volunteers with organisations in 
need of assistance. ForGood vets and monitors all 
beneficiary organisations. Platform users can choose an 
organisation or cause that resonates with them, and donate 
money, goods or skills. A dedicated portal enables Standard 
Bank employees to connect with organisations to make a real 
difference. 

Over 3 000 of our employees have registered on the 
ForGood platform, with over 1 200 new registrations in 
2022. Our employees supported 108 different causes in 
2022, with a focus on humanitarian relief and support for 
children in need. 552 employees participated in in-person 
events, and 113 contributed their skills and time. Popular 
in-person events included participation in reading events for 
national literacy month, and the packing of ‘boxes of joy’ for 
people in need. 

Several of our countries provide for the matching of 
employee donations by the bank. In South Africa, for 
example, we match all employee donations to registered 
charitable organisations thus doubling the funds received by 
the beneficiary organisation. In SA, 343 employees made 
monetary donations to various causes amounting to 
almost R540 000, which was matched by SBSA. The top 
three causes for employee donations were Salaam 
Foundation, Gift of the Givers and Rise Against Hunger. In 
total, we matched donations to 85 different organisations. 
Employees also participated in hands-on activities at head 
office and provincial level.

Standard Bank Group’s CSI framework aligns to the group’s sustainability strategy and 
SEE value driver, with a focus on four of our seven SEE impact areas. 

1 3% of CSI funding in South Africa is spent on operational costs.

Governance of 
tax matters 
Standard Bank is committed to full 
compliance with tax laws and full 
disclosure to tax authorities in terms of 
our statutory obligations.

Standard Bank’s board is ultimately responsible 
for the group’s tax matters and governance, 
including oversight of reporting on income, tax 
expenses, the management of tax risk and setting 
the group’s tax risk profile. This responsibility is 
delegated to the group audit committee, who is 
responsible for approving the group’s tax strategy 
which directs our approach to tax matters. 

Board accountability

The group chief finance and value management 
officer (CFVO), and the group head of tax are 
responsible for executing on the mandate from the 
board. The tax governance standard sets out the 
roles and responsibilities of the tax function and 
other business and support areas in the group to 
ensure that corporate governance, compliance 
and tax risk management requirements are met.

 � Specific policies deal with aspects of tax risk such as transfer pricing, indirect 
taxes, withholding taxes, remuneration-related taxes and client tax reporting. 

 � The group’s tax approach and governance standard, together with all other 
tax policies/standards, are updated at least every second year to ensure 
alignment with our strategy. 

 � Standard operating procedures (SOPs) ensure that our approach to tax is well 
embedded and compliance obligations are effectively monitored. The SOPs 
are continuously updated to respond to changes in the business or applicable 
legislation. They are approved and attested by the CFVO of each country, on a 
quarterly, bi-annual and/or annual basis, to ensure compliance. 

 � All tax governance documents are available through a central repository to 
relevant employees. 

Principles and frameworks
The group tax governance standard and group tax policies are 
localised and approved at the various subsidiary boards and/or 
the internal financial control (IFC) committees across the group. 

We commit to the following fundamental principles, as contained in our tax 
strategy: 

 � Compliance: We are committed to ethical outcomes and accurate, transparent 
and timely compliance with the tax laws of the countries where we operate. 

 � Shareholder value: We maximise sustainable shareholder value by 
undertaking legitimate and responsible tax optimisation in line with the spirit 
and purpose of, and complying with all relevant laws, rules and regulations. 

 � Tax planning: We only engage in transactions that have commercial and 
economic substance and do not carry the prospect of material reputational 
risk. 

 � Cross-border related party transactions: We apply the OECD transfer pricing 
guidelines for purposes of ensuring compliance with the arm’s length principle. 
This requires that related parties agree to transact under the same terms and 
conditions which would have been agreed between non-related entities for 
comparable uncontrolled transactions. 

 � Tax advice: We do not provide tax advice to clients or counterparties. 
 � Prevention of the facilitation of tax evasion: The group has no tolerance for 

any of our employees or any person or entity acting on our behalf to be involved 
in or implicated in any way in bribery or any corrupt practice, including the 
facilitation of tax evasion.

 � Tax havens: The group operates in jurisdictions that may be defined as tax 
havens for commercial and not tax reasons.

We manage our tax risks by
 � Evaluating compliance with our tax risk control framework by performing tax risk self-assessments 

every second year, following a risk-based approach. Any material shortcomings and required 
actions are reported to the group audit committee

 � Tax compliance reviews also form part of all internal audit reviews where appropriate. Any material 
operational tax risk is tracked at the relevant IFC committee and/or managed as part of the 
non-financial risk taxonomy under the enterprise risk management framework to ensure 
shortcomings are timeously resolved

 � Providing continuous tax and VAT training and guidance to business
 � Ensuring employees in the tax function have the required skills and qualifications
 � Obtaining external tax opinions from senior counsel or an external tax adviser where the tax 

treatment of a transaction is uncertain or applying for an advanced tax ruling from the tax 
authorities

 � Monitoring the adherence to the SOPs and relevant CFVO attestations and reporting any 
shortcomings to the internal financial control committee and other relevant risk committees

 � Ensuring tax team review of any new product, business venture, process or procedure, or 
significant changes thereto, and of any transaction affecting the legal entity structure of the group 
to ensure compliance with all tax regulations

 � Continuously reviewing and enhancing our tax systems and processes

Identifying, managing and monitoring tax risks

We are committed to fostering transparent, constructive and cooperative relationships 
based on open and honest disclosure and building mutual trust wherever possible.

Engaging with tax and regulatory authorities 

 � We engage in full, open and early dialogue with tax authorities on a regular basis to discuss 
relevant tax matters and to achieve certainty, where possible, over tax positions.

 � We attend tax authority and treasury/regulator workshops to engage on policy and 
technical amendments

 � We submit comments and recommend tax proposals and/or policy changes aimed at enabling 
conducive tax environments via in-country banking associations and other relevant industry 
forums

 � Where disputes occur, we manage these professionally.
 � We support the fundamental principles underlying multilateral moves toward greater 

transparency.

* These taxes are reflected on a cash basis and include cash payments made to revenue authorities set-off by refunds received during the period presented.
** These taxes are presented on an accrual basis.

The group contributes significantly 
to government revenues by way of 
corporate income taxes and 
indirect taxes such as VAT. 

We also collect other taxes such as 
withholding tax and employees’ tax on 
behalf of revenue authorities and assist 
tax authorities with tax administration, 
collection processes and by obtaining 
independent verification of third-party 
data.

Insights into our 
groupwide tax 
contributions

STANDARD BANK GROUP    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT 2022

105



Standard Bank Group Limited is the ultimate 
holding company of the Standard Bank Group 
and has filed an annual CbCR return since 2016. 
We are fully compliant and transparent in our 
annual CbCR obligations. In the 2021 financial 
year return, the group provided relevant CbCR 
information pertaining to 139 legal entities 
(excluding Liberty). Due to the large number of 
entities in the group, a pragmatic approach is 
followed in terms of our disclosure in this report 
to provide stakeholders with relevant subsidiary 
information at a regional level. Our commercial 
operations in low tax jurisdictions (Isle of Man, 
Jersey and Mauritius) have substance and are 
subject to controlled foreign company legislation 
that is applicable in South Africa. 

Standard Bank Group predominantly subscribes 
to the OECD based interpretations for CbCR 
metrics

Accordingly, CbCR does not fully correlate to our 
annual financial statements prepared on an IFRS 
basis. Revenue for the group thus comprises net 
interest income (NII) and non-interest revenue 
(NIR). Revenues reflected below are split between 
related party revenues and unrelated party 
revenues, implying an unavoidable duplication 
relevant to related party revenue reporting.* 

Revenue excludes payments received from other 
constituent entities that are treated as dividends 
in the payor’s tax jurisdiction, in accordance with 
OECD guidance. 

* This metric provides a useful insight into the movement of money between legal entities within a 
particular jurisdiction. However revenues earned from a third-party in one jurisdiction (classified as 
unrelated party revenues) may in turn be used to make a payment in the form of a ‘revenue-share’ 
to a related party in another jurisdiction. Such revenues will in turn, be reported within the 
classification of related party revenues in the recipient jurisdiction. This related party revenue is not 
incremental but represents the same flow that has already been accounted for in the first country’s 
unrelated party revenue. Further information can be provided on request.

Country-by-Country Reporting information
The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is responsible for implementation of the 
Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) Standard for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) in 
South Africa. Each ‘ultimate parent entity’ of a MNE group that is resident for tax purposes 
in South Africa must file a CbCR return with SARS.

¹  The number of employees include the number of full-time equivalent employees at the end of the year and excludes all non-permanent contractors, brokers, agents and financial advisers.
²   Owing to the reporting of revenue being based on NII and NIR, in some cases it is possible that revenue from related parties may reflect a negative number (i.e. the interest expense/non-interest expense from transactions with 

related parties may have been greater than the interest income/non-interest income from transactions with such related parties). In order to accurately depict the level of related party activity, absolute values have been used for 
the regions with a negative total related party revenue. As a result, the total related party revenue depicted here will not be the same as that reported in the CbCR return.

The effective tax rate represents the total direct tax accrued in the income statement as 
a percentage of net profit before direct tax. The total direct tax accrued in the income 
statement comprises current and deferred tax and as a result cash taxes paid is not a 
representation of the total direct tax expense. The effective tax rate will differ from the 
statutory tax rate when tax legislation deems certain income and expenses non-taxable 
or non-deductible when calculating the tax expense or credit for the entity.

STANDARD BANK GROUP    ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT 2022

Your responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for the selection, preparation and presentation of the 
selected sustainability information in accordance with the accompanying reporting 
criteria set out at 
https://www.standardbank.com/static_file/StandardBankGroup/filedownloads/
RTS/2022/SBGSelectednonFinancialIndicators2022.pdf

This responsibility includes:
 � the identification of stakeholders and stakeholder requirements, material issues, 

commitments with respect to sustainability performance, and
 � the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 

preparation of the Reports that is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.

The Directors are also responsible for determining the appropriateness of the 
measurement and reporting criteria in view of the intended users of the selected 
sustainability information and for ensuring that those criteria are publicly available to the 
users of the Reports.

Inherent limitations
Non-financial performance information is subject to more inherent limitations than 
financial information, given the characteristics of the subject matter and the methods 
used for determining, calculating, sampling, and estimating such information. The 
absence of a significant body of established practices on which to draw allows for the 
selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques which can result in 
materially different measurements and can impact comparability. Qualitative 
interpretations of relevance, materiality, and the accuracy of data are subject to individual 
assumptions and judgements. The precision of different measurement techniques may 
also vary. Furthermore, the nature and methods used to determine such information, as 
well as the measurement criteria and the precision thereof, may change over time.

In particular, where the information relies on carbon and other emissions conversion 
factors derived by independent third parties, or internal laboratory results, our assurance 
work will not include an examination of the derivation of those factors and other third-
party or laboratory information.

Our Independence and Quality Management
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of 
Professional Conduct for Registered Auditors, issued by the Independent Regulatory 
Board for Auditors’ (IRBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, 
objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional 
behaviour. The IRBA Code is consistent with the corresponding sections of the 
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards).

The firm applies the International Standard on Quality Management 1, Quality 
Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other 
Assurance or Related Services Engagements, which requires the firm to design, 
implement and operate a system of quality management, including policies or procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.

Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the selected 
sustainability information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence 
we have obtained. We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance 
Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000 
(Revised)), and, in respect of greenhouse gas emissions, International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements 
(ISAE 3410) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. These 
Standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance 
about whether the selected sustainability information is free from material misstatement.

A limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised), 
and ISAE 3410, involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s 
use of its reporting criteria as the basis of preparation for the selected KPIs, assessing the 
risks of material misstatement of the selected sustainability information whether due to 
fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and 
evaluating the overall presentation of the selected sustainability information. A limited 
assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance 
engagement in relation to both risk assessment procedures, including an understanding 
of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. The 
procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included 
inquiries, observation of processes followed, an inspection of documents, analytical 
procedures, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting 
policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.

Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above 
we:

 � Interviewed management and senior executives to obtain an understanding of the 
internal control environment, risk assessment process, and information systems 
relevant to the sustainability reporting process;

 � Inspected documentation to corroborate the statements of management and senior 
executives in our interviews;

 � Tested the processes and systems to generate, collate, aggregate, monitor, and report 
the selected sustainability information;

 � Performed a controls walkthrough of identified key controls;

https://www.standardbank.com/static_file/StandardBankGroup/filedownloads/RTS/2022/SBGSelectednonFinancialIndicators2022.pdf


 � Inspected supporting documentation on a sample basis and performed analytical 
procedures to evaluate the data generation and reporting processes against the 
reporting criteria;

 � Evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness of significant estimates and 
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the selected sustainability 
information; and

 � Evaluated whether the selected sustainability information presented in the Reports are 
consistent with our overall knowledge and experience of sustainability management 
and performance at the Company.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing 
and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. As a result, the level 
of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the 
assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance 
engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about 
whether the Company’s selected sustainability information has been prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the accompanying the Company’s reporting 
criteria.

Limited Assurance Conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, and 
subject to the inherent limitations outlined elsewhere in this report, nothing has come to 
our attention that causes us to believe that the selected sustainability information as set 
out in the Subject Matter paragraph above for the year ended 31 December 2022 are not 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.

Other Matters
Our report includes the provision of limited assurance on:

 � Mobilisation of Sustainable Finance;
 � Committed Financing of Renewable Energy Plants; 
 � Committed Financing of Social Projects; and
 � Absenteeism ratio 

We were previously not required to provide assurance on this selected sustainability 
information.

The maintenance and integrity of Standard Bank Group Limited’s website is the 
responsibility of Standard Bank Group Limited’s directors. Our procedures did not involve 
consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any 
changes to either the information in the Reports or our independent assurance report 
that may have occurred since the initial date of presentation on Standard Bank Group 
Limited’s website.

Restriction of liability
Our work has been undertaken to enable us to express a limited assurance conclusion on 
the selected sustainability information to the directors of the Group and Company in 
accordance with the terms of our engagement and for no other purpose. We do not 
accept or assume liability to any party other than the Group and Company, for our work, 
for this report, or for the conclusion we have reached.
