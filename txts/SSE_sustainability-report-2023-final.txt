Right action. 
Right now.

The SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 is 
complemented by SSE’s Annual Report 2023 
which can be found online at sse.com.

Alternative Performance Measures
SSE assesses the performance of the Group using a variety of performance measures. These 
measures are not all defined under IFRS and are therefore termed ‘non-GAAP’ measures. A 
reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest prepared measure in accordance with 
IFRS is presented and described on pages 194 to 201 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023. The Alternative 
Performance Measures SSE uses might not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures 
used by other companies.

responsible for the preparation of SSE’s selected sustainability data 
including this Directors’ Statement and for reporting the selected 
sustainability data in accordance with the reporting criteria set out 
on at sse.com/sustainability/policies-and-assurances.

We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, that we have:
• designed, implemented and maintained internal controls and 

processes over information relevant to the measurement, 
evaluation and preparation of selected sustainability data that is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;

• established objective reporting criteria for preparing and 
presenting the selected sustainability data, including clear 

definition of the entity’s organisational boundaries, and applied 
them consistently;

• presented information, including the reporting criteria, in a 
manner that provides relevant, complete, reliable, unbiased/
neutral, comparable and understandable information;

Open and transparent disclosures 
This Sustainability Report complements 
a dedicated section within the SSE 
Annual Report 2023 and material 
social and environmental impacts are 
integrated throughout the Directors’ 
and Financial Reports that are part of 
that document too. A single-issue report 
on Inclusion and Diversity provides 
stakeholders with enhanced information 
about our I&D strategies and a Net Zero 
Transition Report digests all climate 
information for the benefit of climate-
focused stakeholders, and is subject to 
an advisory vote at the Annual General 
Meeting in July. 

SSE also provides regular, standalone 
disclosure reports through the year on 
biodiversity, the just transition, and many 
others. This comprehensive approach 
to disclosure is driven by a belief that 
openness and transparency builds trust 
with stakeholders, and the process of 
scrutiny and accountability is a powerful 
agent for performance improvement 
too.  

As with all of SSE’s sustainability 
disclosures, feedback and further 
engagement is warmly welcomed. 
Please get in touch with
sustainability@sse.com.

Alistair Phillips-Davies
Chief Executive
16 June 2023

Providing energy is a purpose that SSE, and its predecessor 
organisations, has been fulfilling for 80 years. This year 
marks the anniversary of the 1943 Hydro Development Act, 
a pioneering piece of public policy that connected people in 
the North of Scotland to the electricity grid for the very first 
time. SSE’s purpose today is to provide the energy needed in 
the UK, Ireland and, increasingly, elsewhere in the world but 
now with every tonne of damaging greenhouse emissions 
removed from the process.

Coupled with the urgent climate 
imperative, the energy security 
concerns raised by the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine makes an overwhelming 
case for the swiftest, most orderly, and 
just transition we can possibly achieve. 
With SSE’s enhanced capital investment 
programme squarely focused on 
accelerating renewables, reinforcing 
networks and providing vital system 
flexibility, we are delivering the right 
action, right now. 

Our strategy is tackling climate change, 
providing greater energy security and 
addressing concerns about affordability. 
But we are acutely aware that our 
actions need to be sustainable for 
nature and people. That is why, when 
taking the right action, right now, we 
strive to do it in the right way too.

Focusing on what matters 
Any credible sustainability plan must be 
founded on a regular assessment of 
the organisation’s most material social 
and environmental impacts. This year, 
a comprehensive and independent 
assessment of a variety of sustainability 
issues was undertaken, concluding 
that SSE’s focus on climate change, 
sustainable energy generation and 
reliable and affordable energy remain, 
as we would expect, our defining 
sustainability impacts. Interestingly, 
a further two highly material issues 
were identified, on skills availability and 

supply chain capacity. The increasing 
significance of these two issues is 
reflected within this report.  

Ten years of enhanced social impact 
SSE became a real Living Wage 
employer a decade ago, at a time when 
it was a fledgling movement. Now, one 
person in every nine working in the UK 
is covered by a commitment to the 
real Living Wage. I like to think SSE has 
played its part in normalising the notion 
that everyone who works deserves to 
earn an income that prevents them 
from being in poverty. 

In recent years, we have focused on 
the principles of a just, or fair, transition 
to net zero.  Experienced or perceived 
injustice as the economy undertakes its 
almighty transition to net zero, will be 
counterproductive. It will undermine 
the very case for climate action that so 
many are working towards. More simply, 
the case for a just transition supports 
our climate action. 

The skills and expertise of those working 
in declining high-carbon industries are 
valuable.  Delivering SSE’s investment 
plan will require the capability and 
commitment of many more than the 
12,000 highly capable people who 
currently work for SSE, so our just 
transition plan deliberately seeks to 
attract people from the high-carbon 
sector to work with us.

Right action, taken  
in the right way

Ambition for 2030

Business goals with societal benefit
Aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) most material to 
SSE’s business activities, the 2030 Goals place sustainability firmly at the heart of 
SSE’s business strategy. They provide a framework for the Company as it works 
towards its net zero ambitions, ensuring that as it does, it creates and shares value 
with its stakeholders along the way.  

In 2022, SSE undertook a sustainability materiality assessment, supported by 
a third-party professional services firm, the results which reinforced the highly 
material nature of the 2030 Goals and the core issues they are focused on. For 
more information on the results of the materiality assessment, see pages 8 and 9.

Since 2019, SSE has aligned its business strategy to 
the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
which provide the framework to guide the creation 
of shared value. Within this framework SSE has 
identified four SDGs which are highly material to 
the business, and to which it has linked its four core 
2030 Goals.

Tracking progress against SSE’s 2030 
Goals
With updated 2030 Goals in early 2022 
reflecting an accelerated decarbonisation 
pathway, financial year 2022/23 was 
marked as a year of delivery. Progress 
against each of its four 2030 Goals 
is set out in detail at the start of the 
corresponding chapters of this report. 

Accountability for progress 
Reinforcing SSE’s commitment to the 
achievement of its 2030 Goals, they have 
been used as a framework since 2019 to 
assess performance, which was linked to 
the performance based Annual Incentive 
Plan for Executive Directors until 2021/22. 
The updated Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, approved by shareholders at the 

2022 AGM, has seen performance against 
these Goals now linked to the longer-term 
Performance Share Plan, which will vest for 
the first time in 2025. This is in recognition 
of the longer-term nature of SSE’s 
sustainability ambitions. More information 
on sustainability incentives linked to 
Executive remuneration can be found on 
page 92 of this report.

The strategic hierarchy of 
sustainability within SSE 
SSE’s purpose is to provide the energy that people need today whilst ensuring a better world of energy is built for tomorrow. The essential 
nature of its business activities mean it has a multitude of sustainability impacts. While the breadth and depth of SSE’s economic, social and 
environmental impact is extensive and complex, a strategic hierarchy of sustainability provides simplicity and clarity.

The results of the 2022 materiality 
exercise
The double materiality assessment 
identified 21 ESG issues material to SSE and 
highlighted five highly material issues for 
SSE, alongside three areas of opportunity. 

SSE’s five most material sustainability 
topics

These five defined sustainability topics map 
across to the four UN SDG’s long identified 
as being most material to SSE’s business 
activities. Carbon emissions align to SDG 
13; sustainable energy generation and 
affordable and reliable energy both align to 
SDG 7 and SDG 9 and, finally, supply chains 
and skills align to SDG8. 

8 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

Strategic introduction

Materiality review 2022/23: 
defining the issues that matter
The process of defining and confirming the most material social, environmental, and 
economic matters, is the foundation of any business strategy for sustainability. 

The importance of ‘double materiality’
SSE has consistently sought to 
understand its sustainability impacts, 
however, in 2022, it established an 
independent and thorough review of its 
most material environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) issues. 

For the first time, SSE has adopted the 
‘double materiality’ approach, a concept 
which acknowledges that a company 
should report simultaneously on 
sustainability matters that are material in 
influencing business value and material to 
the environment and society.
This approach is important because it 
considers SSE’s sustainability impacts 
from both the perspective of its impacts 
on the outside world, and the outside 
world’s impact on SSE, meaning risks and 
opportunities are viewed as a two-way 
impact. This is a comprehensive and rich 
consideration of social and environmental 
issues. 

SSE is mindful that emerging ESG 
disclosure standards from the ISSB and 
elsewhere are likely to require evidence of 
a company’s most material ESG issues – 
from both the company and stakeholder 
perspective. Being able to provide 
evidence of the status of those issues 
will support stakeholder confidence in 
SSE’s non-financial disclosures. 

The process to confirm materiality
SSE undertook its double materiality 
assessment with support from an 
independent professional services firm, 
with the objective of confirming the ESG 
issues most material to SSE, both in terms 
of their impact on the business and the 
impact of the business on each issue.

The assessment involved a desk-based 
study and peer review, alongside a series 
of interviews with internal and external 
stakeholders, in order to identify the 
most material ESG issues. In the final 
stage, a workshop was held with internal 
stakeholders to validate the prioritisation 
of the ESG topics and a matrix was 
produced as a visual aid (see page 9). 

What is double materiality?
Traditional materiality assessments 
often consider how important a 
particular ESG issue is through one 
lens. Single lens materiality tends 
to consider whether an issue is 
sufficiently important to impact on a 
company’s enterprise value.

The concept of double materiality 
goes beyond this financial lens and 
considers how the company impacts 
on the issue itself. The combination 
of both considerations gives a 
more holistic view of which social, 
environmental and governance issues 
should be prioritised.

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 9

It is worth noting, in the context of SDG 
8, the increasing salience of supply chain 
management and a skilled workforce.

The impact of this work is partly, to provide 
confidence to the organisation that it is 
prioritising the correct issues. It also is 
impactful, in that it provides the evidence 
from which SSE’s non-financial disclosures 
(within SSE’s suite of reporting documents) 
are prioritised. 

Opportunities for enhanced sustainable 
impact
The final output from the dedicated 
materiality review was to identify, through 
the stakeholders interviewed, areas where 
stakeholders believed there was opportunity 
for SSE to make greater impact.

1. Just transition: Stakeholders 
recognised the efforts that SSE has 
made in relation to the Just Transition 
but believed SSE could provide 
continued leadership, potentially 
creating a cross industry standard to 
drive progress and further secure long-
term legitimacy.  
 

See pages 58 to 77 – the just transition 
now frames SSE’s efforts under SDG 
8 and it has structured its disclosures 
accordingly.  

2. Circularity: SSE can further embed 
circularity principles into its operations 
and in its value chain through industry 
collaboration and innovation.  
 
See pages 86, for information about 
the Coalition for Wind Industry 
Circularity, undertaken after the results 
of the materiality exercise. 

3. Nature and biodiversity: SSE can 
take a leading position in this area and 
embed nature considerations across its 
value chain, and prepare for upcoming 
regulations (e.g., TNFD). 
 
Whilst much more work is required 
before SSE will be ‘TNFD-ready’, this 
year’s environmental disclosures 
have been structured following TNFD 
methodology and, importantly, the 
chapter is highlighting the most 
strategic business issues relating to 
nature. See pages 78 to 87.  

Materiality is the starting point 
of any credible sustainability 
plan. For a power company, 
sometimes the most material 
social and environmental 
issues may seem obvious. But 
it’s important to stay fresh and 
alive to emerging issues as 
they arise. And the only way 
you can learn that, is if you 
listen deep and hard to your 
stakeholders.”

Emerging trends

Strategic introduction

The ability to identify and respond to emerging social, economic, and environmental change 
is an important feature of SSE’s long-term sustainability. While there are ‘mega’ trends that 
determine SSE’s strategic choices, such as the climate imperative, from year-to-year new 
features emerge. 2022/23 was no different, with global and national circumstances affecting 
the external environment SSE operates within. 

Return of the energy trilemma
In 2022/23, the triple challenge of 
simultaneously achieving security of supply, 
affordability and decarbonisation was 
brought into sharp focus. Since the term 
‘energy trilemma’ was first coined by the 
World Energy Council in the early 2000s, 
the focus of political and public attention 
has swung from one challenge to the next. 
However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
and the gas supply shortages that resulted 
in Europe in 2022 raise new challenges 
relating to both security of energy supplies 
and affordability.

The recent affordability challenge is directly 
caused by the dependency of Western 
Europe on imported gas from Russia and 
the market volatility and energy price spikes 
that resulted when supplies were restricted. 
The British Energy Security Strategy in 2022 
was the UK’s long-term response to those 
challenges setting out, amongst other 
things, a target for 50GW of offshore wind 
by 2030. With electricity prices being set 

by the marginal price of gas generation, a 
further government-initiated reform under 
REMA (the Review of Electricity Markets 
Arrangements) seeks to decouple the 
price of electricity generated by renewable 
energy from the price of gas. The EU 
RePower programme further reinforces the 
desire for governments to act in addressing 
both the short- and long-term impacts of 
the war in Ukraine.  

In Ireland, shortages of electricity supply led 
the Irish Government to intervene in the 
market to ensure emergency generation is 
available in the short term with SSE being 
approached by government authorities to 
enable temporary generation at its Tarbert 
site in County Kerry.

SSE welcomed enhanced government 
action to support consumers with the 
exceptional costs of energy in the last 
12 months but believes the long-term 
solutions associated with accelerated build 
out of renewable energy, a step change in 

energy efficiency measures along with the 
flexible energy sources to back it up and 
the network infrastructure to connect and 
transport it will prevent such energy price 
extremes in the future.

10 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

“Putin’s abhorrent war in 
Ukraine and rising energy 
prices across the world are not 
a reason to go slow on climate 
change. They are a reason to act 
faster. Because diversifying our 
energy supplies by investing in 
renewables is precisely the way 
to insure ourselves against the 
risks of energy dependency.”

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak,
address to COP27,
November 2022

Our warming world
The final instalment of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change’s (IPCC) sixth assessment report 
provides the most comprehensive scientific 
assessment of climate change. While the 
synthesis report was the culmination of 
eight-years of scientific assessment, it 
represents the most up-to-date consensus 
of the consequences of rising greenhouse 
gas emissions.

The report confirmed that concentrations 
of the warming gas CO

2
 in the atmosphere 

are at their highest in two million years. 
While climate scientists recognise that 
global temperatures are getting close to 
exceeding 1.5oC temperature increase since 
preindustrial levels, deep and immediate 
cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will 
limit warming to a short and temporary 
overshoot.

With the significant scale of investment 
required in its network in the north of 
Scotland, SSEN Transmission engages 
closely with all communities and 
stakeholders with an interest in its 
infrastructure developments. Some 
stakeholders have raised whether some 
form of community benefit funding might 
be an appropriate way to share in the 
value of these developments in addition 
to the other economic and employment 
opportunities they bring. SSEN Transmission 
will continue to engage with Ofgem and 
its stakeholders to consider the potential 
for a legacy fund being created, particularly 
to support the next phase of its network 
expansion which is critical to powering 
change and meeting Scotland and the UK’s 
renewable energy targets.

Nature and people: the 
interdependencies of net zero
In the UK, the HM Treasury-led Transition 
Plan Taskforce (TPT) published its 
Disclosure Framework and Implementation 
Guidance for company net zero transition 
plans at COP27 in November 2022. SSE’s 
early adopter status led to SSE being invited 
to join the TPT Delivery Group in February 
2023.

Within the Disclosure Framework, the 
importance of interdependencies within 
transition plans is called out as an area 
for companies to consider in a holistic 
way. The importance of factoring the 
role of nature, both as a tool for building 
in resilience to a climate changed world, 
and to mitigate against greenhouse gas 
emissions is recognised. Equally, the notion 
of a just transition and managing the social 
consequences of the net zero transition 
on working people, consumers, and their 
communities is emerging as a critical 
consideration for any transition plan.

While the adoption of just transition 

principles and nature within net zero 
transition plans, adds complexity to 
company plans, SSE believes this is an 
important trend and will represent the gold 
standard in the establishment of credible 
transition plans for companies.

out of renewable energy, a step change in 
energy efficiency measures along with the 
flexible energy sources to back it up and 
the network infrastructure to connect and 
transport it will prevent such energy price 
extremes in the future.

“Even in the near term, 
global warming is more 
likely than not to reach 1.5oC 
even under the very low 
greenhouse gas scenario.”

Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC),
March 2023

“A [net zero transition plan] 
should examine all material 
interdependencies, including 
those that relate to the 
natural environment, workers, 
suppliers, communities, and 
consumers.”

Identifying material issues

Achieving a decarbonised UK power 
system by 2035
The International Energy Agency (IEA) 
global decarbonisation pathway outlines 
the importance of power generation in 
developed countries achieving net zero 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. The 
UK Government has targeted 2035 as the 
goal for the UK power sector to achieve 
complete decarbonisation and, in March 
2023, a long-awaited report from the UK’s 
Climate Change Committee (CCC) set out 
to answer the question: “can we rely on an 
electricity system based on renewables?”.

Using historical weather data and testing 
against an extreme wind drought of 
30 days the CCC concluded that the 
system will be dependable with 70% 
renewable generation and point out the 
importance of low-carbon dispatchable 
(or flexible backup) plant. They also retain 
a small amount of unabated gas, calling 
it a ‘strategic reserve’ amounting to 2% 
of total generation. The CCC specifically 
highlighted that the greatest risk to 
achieving a decarbonised power sector in 
the UK is deployment and that processes 
including planning and consenting need 
urgent reform to enable infrastructure to be 
deployed at sufficient speed.

This CCC report confirms a growing 
understanding that, while national ambition 
and clear targets for renewables and 
network infrastructure are very welcome, 
there are challenges in delivery. SSE is 
working constructively with planning 
authorities and others, to work through 
these barriers, while remaining mindful 
of the critical need to consult effectively 
with communities and other stakeholders 
impacted by infrastructure delivery.

The role of critical minerals in the clean 
energy transition
There is an increasing understanding of the 
criticality of key mineral resources to enable 
the clean energy transition, with an onshore 
wind farm typically requiring nine times 
more mineral resources than a gas-fired 
plant and an electric vehicle six times more 
than a conventional one.

While a flagship report in 2021 by the IEA 
identified the scale of resource required, 
more studies are being released showing 
the juxtaposition of global unmined 
resources and its colocation with the lands 
of indigenous peoples. Some reports 
suggest that 50% of the key minerals 
required for the energy transition, including 
lithium, cobalt, copper, and nickel, are 
located within indigenous peoples’ land. 
The right to consultation and Free Prior and 
Informed Consent (FPIC) of indigenous and 
peasant peoples is embedded within United 
Nations declarations and the IEA is taking 
an important leadership position amongst 
nation states and international mining 
companies.

As an end user of those mined products, 
SSE is paying close attention to 
developments and is working with its own 
suppliers to consider how to ensure that 
the transition minerals that feature in SSE’s 
manufactured components were mined 
using FPIC principles. SSE also recognises 
the contribution a fully functioning circular 
model can make, in reducing the scale of 
mining virgin materials.

“This is a national mission at scale 
– build rates for generation and 
network capacity exceed anything 
achieved before… [a decarbonised 
power system by 2035] is credible 
and achievable, with multiple 
benefits… but the present system 
of planning and consenting just 
isn’t up to it.”

Chris Stark, Chief Executive,
Climate Change Committee,
March 2023

“… the IEA is taking the lead 
responsibility on secure and 
sustainable supplies of critical 
minerals. Managing these 
resources effectively is essential 
to ensure energy and climate 
goals translate into tangible 
action and clean energy projects 
on the ground.”

Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director,
International Energy Agency,
May 2023

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 13

Driving better outcomes together
Collaboration with the wide range of stakeholders who have a direct interest in SSE is essential 
to facilitate strategic decision-making and to support the achievement of shared sustainability-
related objectives. 

SSE’s approach to stakeholder 
engagement 
SSE promotes an open and transparent 
approach to stakeholder engagement 
which is supported by governance and 
accountability at both Group and Business 
Unit level. Through the course of its 
daily interactions with a broad range of 
stakeholders, SSE seeks to ensure that their 
perspectives are built into its business plans 
and objectives at every stage.

SSE defines six key stakeholder groups: 
Employees; Shareholders and debt 
providers; Energy customers; Government 
and regulators; NGOs, communities and 
civil society; and, Suppliers, contractors 
and partners. Full detail on the range of 
engagement methods SSE adopts to 
build reciprocal relationships with these 
stakeholders, alongside the issues identified 
as material to them, can be found on pages 
28 to 33 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023.

Partnering for good
SSE’s partnerships form a core part of 

SSE approach to business and ensuring 
it contributes positively to wider societal 
issues. They enable it to drive progress by 
collaborating with leaders and specialists 
to achieve more than it could alone. SSE 
works with several longstanding values-
based partners which form a core part 
of SSE’s sustainable culture and help set 
standards for the way SSE operates. 

These include almost decade-long 
partnerships with the Living Wage 
Foundation and the Fair Tax Foundation, 
working to address two issues which SSE 
believes are at the heart of sharing value 
with society. SSE’s commitment to these 
partnerships has only strengthened in 
recent years, with it becoming a Living 
Hours accredited employer in March 
2021 and transitioning to the Fair Tax 
Foundation’s new Global Multinational 
Business Standard in November 2022 (see 
page 62). 

SSE is also signed-up to voluntary 
international frameworks, which ensures 

that it operates to highest standards 
aimed at ensuring the common good. 
This includes being a signatory of the UN 
Global Compact since 2018, aligning to its 
ten principles for corporate sustainability, 
and being a subscriber to the Institute of 
Business Ethics since 2014, through which it 
shares best practice on embedding ethical 
business cultures. 

Collaborating for industry-wide 
progress
Strong partnerships are increasingly 
important as the change affecting the 
energy sector continues at pace. The 
transition to net zero presents many 
industry-wide challenges which often 
require a network of collaborators to solve 
together. SSE works with several partners 
that inform its thinking and enable SSE to 
be part of the discussions around emerging 
industry challenges and solutions. 

For example, SSE is working with the 
turbine manufacturing companies, to 
develop joint plans in establishing a greater 
proportion of wind turbine components 
that have the ability to be refurbished and 
remanufactured (see page 86). 

SSE’s supply chain is an important area for 
collaboration and SSE has a number of 
supply chain partnerships, including: the 
Powering Net Zero Pact, created by SSE 
with 10 key founding partners, which is 
working to address five key topics to bring 
about a fair and just transition to net zero; 
and the Supply Chain Sustainability School, 
with which SSE has been a principal partner 
since 2021 and work with to engage with 
its employees, as well as collaborate closer 
with its suppliers.

For more detail on the many business 
partnerships that SSE holds across its 
Business Units, all of which provide 
valuable input and contribution, see 
sse.com/sustainability. 

Forging new partnerships
In 2023, SSE formed a new relationship with the Institute 
for Human Rights and Business (IHRB), the global centre 
of excellence and expertise on the relationship between 
business and internationally recognised human rights 
standards. 
 
Hosting a ‘Wilton Park Dialogue’ in October 2022, with SSE in attendance, the 
IHRB has emerged as one of the most important voices on efforts to deliver a just 
transition for working people and their communities in both the developed and 
developing world. SSE’s subscription to the IHRB first and foremost, supports its 
work, but also provides SSE with a platform to learn and benefit from, emerging 
thinking and best practice on areas which both SSE and the IHRB have identified as 
key priorities, such as the advancement of rights-based approaches to key sectoral 
net zero transformations through a just transition. 

The IHRB has recognised SSE as one of the world’s first companies to create a just 
transition strategy and action framework. In May 2023, the IHRB published a podcast 
in which SSE’s Chief Sustainability Officer discussed SSE’s approach to ensuring a 
just transition and some of the key lessons learned along the way. The podcast is 
available at ihrb.org.

PARTNERING IN ACTION



Enhanced 
climate action

In every credible national and international pathway to net zero, decarbonised electricity plays 
a critical role. Enabling the decarbonisation of key sectors, particularly heat and transport, the 
importance of swift and effective delivery of renewables, grid infrastructure, and low-carbon 
flexibility in the next decade is stark. SSE’s integrated business model has an advantage in that 
it supports whole system thinking, and it is in the business of practical real-world delivery. 
Its intention is to position its growth ambition to meet the clear requirement from society: a 
decarbonised power system in the UK, Ireland and beyond, in 2035.

National and international climate ambitions have established a 
power sector decarbonisation pathway, SSE’s enhanced capital 
investment programme ‘NZAP Plus’ accelerates delivery of its net 
zero ambitions with a practical plan of action in the short and 
medium term.

The scope 1 carbon intensity of electricity generated remained relatively stable, falling by 
2% between 2021/22 and 2022/23.

Progress was made in renewables growth and in developing lower-carbon flexible thermal generation 
options. While Keadby 3 Carbon Capture Power Station project has not yet achieved the final stages of the 
UK Government’s Cluster Sequencing Process, a similar project at Peterhead attracted ‘Tier 2 Status’. Keadby 
2 began commercial operations in March 2023, which is Europe’s most efficient CCGT. 10-year contracts 
were secured – subject to planning permission and final investment decision – for two new low-carbon 
power stations in Ireland fueled by sustainable biofuel.

A strategy to mitigate and 
adapt to climate change
SSE is providing the practical solutions to deliver a decarbonised energy system whilst also 
reducing carbon emissions arising from its own business activities. SSE’s strategy is aligned to the 
ambitions set out in the Paris Agreement and an accelerated power sector pathway to net zero 
consistent with global warming of no more than 1.5oC. SSE also aims to increase the resilience of 
its business by adapting to the impact of a changed climate. 

Targeting net zero
SSE aims to achieve net zero across scope 
1 and 2 emissions by 2040 at the latest 
(subject to security of supply requirements) 
and for remaining scope 3 emissions by 
2050 at the latest. SSE has a series of interim 
science-based targets that align to a 1.5°C 
pathway.

Actions to achieve net zero
SSE will, first and foremost, take action to 
reduce emissions as low as possible and 
its Net Zero Transition Plan sets out the key 
actions it is taking to achieve its targets to 
drive progress towards its net zero ambitions. 
More information on SSE’s action plan can 
be found in the table on Net Zero Transition 
Report summary table on pages 28 and 29. 
Only when abatement is maximised will 
SSE deploy technologies or nature-based 
solutions that will neutralise any residual 
emissions.

SSE’s Net Zero Transition Plan was first 
published in March 2022 and updated in 
October 2022 in response to shareholder 
and wider stakeholder feedback. The 
updated Net Zero Transition Plan outlines 
SSE’s net zero aligned targets and describes 
17 actions to reduce material GHG emissions 
across scopes 1, 2 and 3.

Developing and promoting transition 
planning
SSE believes Net Zero Transition Plans play a 
critical role in outlining company pathways 
to net zero, supporting both delivery and 
accountability. SSE believes plans must have 
integrity and in developing its own plan, it 
sought to be transparent on the challenges 
and interdependencies of delivering the 
actions set out. With this principle in mind, 
SSE has:
1.  Updated its plan to address additional  
 material issues identified by its   
 stakeholders including:

a. scope 3 ‘investments’ to recognise 
SSE’s joint acquisition of Triton Power;
b. providing further explanations on the 
role of neutralisation technologies in 
achieving net zero; and 

c. adding cross-cutting issues to 
recognise the key role that climate 
adaptation and just transition will play in 
the transition to net zero.

2.  Supported the UK Government’s  
 Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT)   
 working group for preparers and users  
 group in the development of the   
 TPT Disclosure Framework and 
 Guidance and in its subsequent 
 sandbox exercise. SSE continues 
 to support the widespread adoption
 of transition planning, as a member 
 of the TPT’s Delivery Group, it is

 supporting the development of sector
 specific frameworks, and guidance on 
 cross cutting issues of just transition
 and climate adaptation. 

Net Zero Transition Plan reporting
SSE’s Net Zero Transition Plan can be found at 
sse.com/sustainability and additional climate-
related disclosures are provided within SSE’s 
Annual Report and CDP disclosures. SSE’s 
annual Net Zero Transition Report provides 
a summary and navigation tool from which 
shareholders vote each year. All reports are 
available at sse.com/sustainability.

An early adopter of net 
zero transition planning
In advance of any mandatory requirements and prior to the publication of transition 
plan recommendations and guidance, SSE developed its own transition plan to set 
out its route to net zero. The transition plan was built on three key principles: targets 
to set direction; actions to deliver the targets; and integrity with the aim of being 
open and honest about the pathways to achieve net zero. This has led SSE to gain 
invaluable experience in the development and publication of transition plans and 
reports making it an early example in relation to its arrangements for scrutiny and 
accountability through the annual shareholder vote. 

All this work on transition plans has led to SSE being involved in the UK 
Government’s Transition Plan Taskforce which is tasked with the development of a 
‘gold’ standard for private sector climate transition plans. SSE initially was involved in 
the UK Transition Plan Taskforce Implementation and Guidance Working Group; it 
then supported the sandbox exercise which tested the Disclosures Framework and 
Implementation Guidance; and more recently as a member of the TPT Delivery 
Group, TPT Adaptation and Just Transition Working Groups and the Electric Utility 
and Power Generators Working Group all of which are developing topic and sector 
specific guidance on transition plans.

Climate performance in 2022/23

Year on year GHG emissions 
performance
In the 2022/23 reporting period total GHG 
emissions were higher in comparison to 
the previous reporting period (2021/22). 
SSE’s total GHG emissions (scope 1, 2 
and 3) increased by 14%, from 9.9MtCO

2
e 

to 11.3MtCO
2
e, between 2021/22 to 

2022/23. This was predominantly a 
result of the acquisition of Triton Power 
in September 2022; and a rise in output 
from SSE’s thermal generation plant due to 
market conditions and the reinstatement 
of operations following planned and 
unplanned outages the previous year. 
The impact of weather, demand and 

availability of plant can mean that GHG 
emission trends vary between reporting 
periods. This means that over time 
emissions can go up as well as down but 
the overall trajectory of SSE’s emissions 
pathway is in line with its net zero 
ambitions. 

Enhanced climate action

SSE aims to reduce its GHG emissions in line with the power sector 1.5oC pathway and has 
set interim targets en route to net zero. To track these targets, SSE reviews performance and 
reports progress annually.

18 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

Note on SSE’s emissions arising from SSE Thermal Joint Ventures
SSE’s scope 3 inventory includes GHG emissions associated with Joint Venture holdings according to equity share if SSE does not have 
operational control. This reflects the fact that under SSE’s ‘operational control’ method of reporting GHG emissions, Joint Ventures 
are classed in the scope 3 ‘investment’ category. This is based on SSE’s interpretation of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Joint Ventures 
included in the GHG inventory include:
• Seabank power station (50% ownership share) - reflecting the end of SSE’s power purchase agreement on 30 September 2021. It 

should be noted that prior to September 2021, 100% of Seabank GHG emissions were accounted in SSE’s scope 1 emissions.
• Triton Power (50% ownership share), including Saltend power station, Indian Queens gas-fired power station and the 

decommissioned Deeside power station. SSE acquired its equity share on 1 September 2022 and includes 50% of its emissions 
from that date in its scope 3 inventory. For Triton Power the GHG emissions are based on management information obtained from 
the Joint Venture. The acquisition does not breach the 10% significance test applied by SSE in relation to it recalculation policy as 
outlined in SSE’s GHG and Water Criteria 2023 (see sse.com/sustainability).

* SSE changed the way it accounts for the GHG emissions from its 50% 
owned Seabank gas-fired power station from 1 October 2021. Prior 
to this date SSE had operational control of the plant under a Power 
Purchase Agreement and as such 100% of emissions from the station 
were accounted for in scope 1 inventory. Following cessation of the 
agreement on 30 September 2021, 50% of its emissions (aligned with 
equity ownership) will be accounted for within scope 3.

Progress in the context of the interim science-based targets
At the heart of SSE’s Net Zero Transition Plan is a set of interim 
emissions targets that are aligned to a 1.5oC pathway. Providing 
energy, a lifeline service, means that it must also meet the social 
obligation of supporting the security of energy supply for homes 

and businesses. That means that medium term targets are 
particularly important, given that, in the short term, the emissions 
are influenced by external factors outside of its control. In the 
medium term, however, targets can be aligned to investment 
cycles. It is within that context that an annual review of its 

progress against its key science-based targets is important and 
is demonstrated in the graphic below. SSE is making reasonable 
progress against these key, science-based targets and, following 
the publication of its revised capital investment plan, the NZAP Plus, 
it continues to be confident that it will meet these targets on time. 



Directly impacting emission reductions

Transitioning electricity generation 
SSE’s activities generate GHG emissions, 
the most significant source of GHG 
emissions arises from burning fossil fuels 
(mainly gas with some oil) in power 
stations to generate electricity.
During 2022/23 the focus of SSE’s GHG 
emission reduction activities was on the 
development of innovative low-carbon 
thermal electricity generation projects 
which can reduce GHG emissions while 
supporting secure electricity systems. 
Focus has been on carbon capture and 
low-carbon hydrogen technologies, as 
well as sustainable biofuel as a bridge into 
hydrogen, that will support the delivery of 
a net zero electricity system. 

SSE’s Tarbert site in Ireland is an example 
of work undertaken to develop lower 
carbon alternatives. The existing oil-fired 
power station at the site will close by the 
end of 2023, in line with environmental 
requirements. In the very short-term, 
and in response to a direct request from 
the Irish authorities, SSE will provide 
temporary and emergency generation to 
support system requirements however, 
the sustainable solution is to repurpose 
the site for enduring low-carbon thermal 
generation solutions. Plans are underway 
to build a new power station that will 
initially run on sustainable biofuel and in 
the future will have the potential to convert 
to low-carbon hydrogen when the fuel 
source is available. For further information 
on Tarbert see page 87. 

Alongside the development of low-
carbon thermal generation, SSE is also 
displacing higher carbon generation in 
the UK with its newly operational gas-fired 
CCGT at Keadby 2. Keadby 2 is the most 
efficient plant of its type in Europe, with 
an efficiency of around 63%, and work is 
already underway to decarbonise it further 
with the potential to blend hydrogen in 
the future. Keadby 2 provides important 
flexibility for the UK electricity system and 
complements the increased renewable 

generation available on the grid, as 
lower carbon alternatives continue to be 
developed. 

Networks for a 
low-carbon future

Reducing reliance on diesel generation 
Alongside the development of low-carbon 
options for the generation of electricity, 
SSE is also investing in its networks to 
reduce associated GHG emissions. In 
particular, SSEN Distribution’s strategy is 
to reduce reliance on diesel generation 
across both networks including the 

Scottish Islands. SSEN uses generators 
to provide critical backup electricity 
generation during storm and planned 
maintenance outages, these use carbon 
intensive heavy fuel oil and are a significant 
source of SSEN Distribution’s emissions. 
SSEN Distribution is exploring alternative 
technologies, reviewing operational 
methods and potential network 
configuration to reduce the need for 
emergency generation for the long term. 
In the meantime they are trialling biofuels 
as a transition fuel - to replace the more 
carbon intense fuel oil that is currently 
used. Generators using biofuels have 
been trialled in the northern networks and 

Enhanced climate action

With electricity generation providing the vast majority of SSE’s direct impact on climate 
change, SSE is focused on actions to remove GHG emissions from its thermal generation 
activities. SSE is also responsible for other GHG emissions in other areas of its business and is 
working hard to reduce the impact of these.

22 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

Developing low-carbon technologies 
in thermal generation
SSE Thermal has progressed plans at its existing Aldbrough gas storage site in East 
Yorkshire to deliver a first-of-a-kind project, bringing together hydrogen production, 
hydrogen storage and 100% hydrogen-fired power generation on one site by 
the middle of the 2020s. This project will support the evidence base for wider 
deployment of flexible hydrogen power.

The concept would see the purchase of renewable sourced power from the 
national grid through renewable Power Purchase Agreements to produce hydrogen 
through electrolysis. The hydrogen would comply with the UK Government’s 
Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard, which sets a threshold for GHG emissions in the 
production process. The hydrogen will be produced using a 35MW electrolyser 
then stored in a converted salt cavern before being used in a 100% hydrogen-
fired turbine, exporting flexible green power back to grid at times of system need. 
The project’s potential has also been recognised by the UK Government, which 
advanced it to the next stage of the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund in March 2023.

Additionally, in partnership with Equinor, SSE Thermal is developing cutting edge 
carbon capture power stations. In December 2022, Keadby 3 became the first 
power carbon capture and storage project in the UK to secure planning consent. 
With capacity of up to 910MW, Keadby 3 will use natural gas as a fuel and be fitted 
with carbon capture technology to remove the carbon dioxide from its emissions. 
In line with UK Government policy, the station would capture at least 90% of carbon 
dioxide emissions, with work underway to achieve consistent capture rates over 
95%. The new plant would capture up to 1.5MtCO

2
 each year (dependent upon the 

running regime of the power station). 

PARTNERING IN ACTION

funding has been received for replacing 
emergency backup generation plant at 
Battery Point in the Scottish Islands. 

Managing and replacing SF₆
Sulphur hexafluoride (SF₆) gas has been 
used extensively across the electrical 
industry due to its insulating and 
interruption properties, making it possible 
to reduce equipment size and improve 
reliability and safety. However, SF₆ is a 
greenhouse gas that is 23,500 times more 
harmful to the Earth’s atmosphere than 
carbon dioxide which if released, stays in 
the atmosphere for over 3,000 years. 

As a result, SSE’s networks and thermal 
businesses have been adopting specific 
procedures to manage, monitor and 
report SF₆ to prevent and reduce SF₆ 
leakages. In 2022/23, SSE’s SF₆ emissions 
increased to 424kg from 305kg the 
previous year in SSEN Transmission, SSEN 
Distribution and SSE Thermal due to 
equipment failures. These have all been 
assessed, repaired and actions put in place 
to mitigate these in the future.

For SSEN Distribution and Transmission 
businesses, SF₆ leakage has an impact on 
their operations and these businesses have 
several initiatives to prevent and reduce 
SF₆ leakages from their networks. SSEN 
Distribution’s RIIO ED2 Business Plan 
outlines its SF₆ leakage reduction strategy 
and over the past year it continued to 
minimise switchgear SF₆ leakage as well 
as trialling alternatives. SSEN Transmission 
continues to work with suppliers to use 
alternative SF₆ gases in its network in 
the north of Scotland. To date, SSEN 
Transmission has energised five substations 
with a further six in construction and two 
in development using distinct SF₆-free 
alternative technologies.

Externally, SSEN Transmission and 
Distribution are taking active roles in 
addressing the issue of SF₆ and are part of 
the Energy Networks Association SF₆ (IIG) 
Strategy group.

Managing electricity losses on the 
distribution betworks
Distribution losses refer to the electricity 
lost as it travels through SSEN’s equipment, 
known as technical losses, or through 
measurement inaccuracies and theft, 
known as non-technical losses. Reducing 
emissions arising from electricity losses 

across its networks is a key component 
of SSEN Distribution’s RIIO ED2 Business 
Plan. SSEN Distribution is implementing 
its strategy to reduce electricity losses 
across its network by installing assets 
with known lower loss rates, trialling 

innovative loss reduction techniques 
and tackling electricity theft. For further 
information see SSEN Distribution’s RIIO-
ED2 Environmental Action Plan document

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 23

SF₆ alternatives research
As part of its Network for Net Zero business plan, SSEN Transmission continues 
to move to using alternative gases with a lower carbon footprint than sulphur 
hexafluoride (SF₆) as an insulating gas. SF

6
 is the industry norm for insulation gases 

within switchgear due to its exceptional insulating properties. That means there is 
less experience and knowledge associated with the use of new alternative gases 
which could lead to future challenges from their use on the network. As a result, 
SSEN Transmission is undertaking a key research project, called the Condition 
Assessment of SF₆ Alternatives (CASA), to understand the changes in operating 
conditions associated with the use of SF₆ alternatives and their potential impact on 
the network system when rolled out at scale. 

The research looks at the condition monitoring requirements of the alternative gases 
with the aim of gaining key insights into the type and severity of defects associated 
with these systems. With this information it is hoped that network operators will be 
able to detect defects earlier and implement planned interventions to manage the 
network. In addition, the research will help to reduce the industry to develop and 
advance international measurement standards and diagnostic data tools to support 
the use of these innovative SF₆ alternative solutions.

Managing energy consumption
Between 2021/22 and 2022/23, the 
energy SSE purchased for use in its assets 
(offices, depots, thermal power stations, 
gas storage facilities, and data centres) 
increased by 5%, from 196GWh to 
206GWh. A large contributor to this trend 
was a 60% increase in energy consumed 
in SSE’s gas storage facilities compared to 
2021/22. This was largely due to increased 
gas storage activities at SSE’s Aldbrough 
facility to ensure security of supply. 

Energy consumed in SSE’s offices, depots 
and data centres reduced by 5% compared 
to 2021/22. This was due to the continued 
investment by SSE in 2022/23 in a range 
of energy efficiency measures including 
a programme of LED lighting upgrades to 
depot sites and it continued its ‘Better Off’ 
behaviour change campaign. 

In 2022/23, SSE purchased 100% of its 
electricity for use in its directly managed 
offices from renewable sources, backed by 
renewable guarantees. In 2022/23, around 
52% of the electricity that SSE purchased 
for its assets (offices, depots, thermal 
power stations, gas storage facilities, and 
data centres) was from renewable sources, 
up from around 39% the previous year. 

SSE is a member of the Climate Group’s 
EP100 initiative to encourage businesses 
to double energy productivity associated 
with office and depot buildings by 2030 
from a 2011 baseline. From 1 April 2022 
onwards, SSE set an annual reduction 

target of 7.19% against a 2020/21 baseline, 
to align with its ambition of achieving a net 
zero non-operational buildings (offices, 
depots, and data centres) estate by 2035.

Electrifying SSE’s vehicle fleet 
In July 2019, SSE joined The Climate 
Group’s EV100 initiative and committed 
that by 2030 it will switch 2,500 of its 
vehicles to electric and install charging 
points at its sites. 

Since the launch of SSE’s new low 
emission company car scheme in June 
2020, the uptake of electric vehicles 
and low emission vehicles has increased 
significantly. By the end of 2022/23 over 
57% of its car fleet was fully electric, this 
increases to 73% with the addition of 
Plug in Hybrids which are classed as low 
emission vehicles. In addition, SSE at the 
time of reporting had another 201 fully 

electric vehicles and a further 176 Plug 
in Hybrids on order. The success of the 
car scheme has resulted in a reduction 
in the average CO

2
 across SSE’s car fleet 

from 106gCO
2
 /km when the scheme 

launched, to just 36gCO
2
 /km at the end 

of 2022/23. 

SSE has also expanded its fully electric 
van fleet between 2021/22 and 2022/23, 
increasing it from 41 to 47 with one 
currently on order. SSE is trailing all low 
emission and fully electric vans that come 
to market and will increase volumes when 
suitable vans become available to match 
operational requirements. 

SSE has also continued to grow its electric 
vehicle charging infrastructure, increasing 
installations to 758 in 2022/23, from 519 
the previous year. This includes 158 rapid 
and two ultra-rapid charge points.

Trailing new electric vehicles and 
infrastructure across SSE’s operations
To continue to increase the uptake of electric vehicles across 
SSE, plans are in place in 2023/24 to test, buy and install 
infrastructure to support the use of low-carbon vehicles across 
its operations. 

In terms of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, SSE’s 
property team are set to install 126 electric vehicle charge 
points across its offices; SSEN Transmission will install 
32 electric vehicle chargers at its substation sites; SSEN 
Distribution will add a further 39 charging points at its depots 

and SSE Renewables aims to install 14 charging points at its 
operational sites across GB and Ireland in 2023/24. 

In addition, SSEN Distribution will trial a fully hydrogen 3.5 
tonne vehicle as well as electric vans in its operations in the 
north of Scotland. Furthermore, SSE will trial the first ever 4x4 
electric vehicle at its Clyde wind farm in 2023/24. This vehicle 
which will be manufactured in Scotland has been designed 
specifically for the utility industry.

Influencing emissions reductions 

Partnerships to deliver low-carbon 
thermal generation
SSE believes it is important to capture
the GHG emissions associated with its
Joint Venture holdings to be transparent
about the investments it holds and the
contribution of these activities to climate 
change. With Joint Ventures in gas-fired 
thermal electricity generation SSE’s scope 
3 GHG inventory now includes 1.5MtCO

2
e 

emissions from these operations 
in 2022/23. These GHG emissions 
contributed to 32% of SSE’s 2022/23 
scope 3 GHG inventory and included: 
• Seabank gas-fired power station, 50% 

equity share; and 
• Triton Power2 (which includes Saltend 

gas-fired power station, Indian 
Queens gas-fired power station and 
the decommissioned Deeside power 
station), 50% equity share. 

To help to address the impact of Joint 
Ventures on SSE’s GHG inventory, SSE 
has set an action as part of its Net Zero 
Transition Plan to ‘align unabated gas 
power generation owned through Joint 
Ventures with a net zero pathway’. To do 
this, SSE will work in partnership with its 
Joint Venture partners to ensure each 
put in place their own Net Zero Transition 
Plans. Work on Net Zero Transition Plans, 
at both executive and board level, have 
begun with Marchwood Power Station1, 
Seabank Power Station and Triton Power. 

In addition, SSE is also committed to 
reviewing how it reports its GHG emissions 
associated with its Joint Ventures and 
to understand the emissions history 
associated with these investments. As 
part of this SSE will review its recalculation 
policy, in particular the significance test 
applied, with best practice as well as 
the accounting methods used for Joint 
Ventures. It is important to understand that 
whilst SSE does report these emissions, 
both Seabank and Triton Power also report 
GHG emissions in line with trade and 
corporate reporting requirements (such as 
UK ETS.

Working with suppliers on climate 
solutions
SSE continues to work with CDP to 
improve its climate-related supply chain 
engagement. By requesting information 
and providing supplier support webinars 
112 suppliers, accounting for over 65% 
of spend, provided information to SSE 
through the CDP Supply Chain module in 
2020/21. This was the highest number of 
responses since SSE began its partnership 
with CDP in 2018. This engagement has 
been recognised by CDP as it awarded 
SSE an ‘A’ in its Supplier Engagement 
Rating assessment in 2023. Over 11,400 
companies were assessed, and SSE 
featured in the top 8%.

SSE has set SBTi-approved targets to 
engage with 50% of its suppliers by spend 
to set science-based targets by March 
2024. Given that the Copmany has met 
the original target it is now tracking 
closely, the proportion of suppliers that 
are translating their commitments to 
science-based targets into hard targets 
verified by SBTi. As of 31 March 2023, 34% 
of SSE’s supply chain by spend has verified 
science-based targets, with a further 17% 
made the commitment to have verified 
targets in due course.   
 

An important element of SSE’s climate action is to embed policies and processes that support 
the delivery of actions that are in line with the Paris Agreement and a 1.5oC pathway. SSE 
does this in several ways including advocating for policy that supports climate action as 
well as working in partnership with others such as customers and suppliers to implement 
climate-related solutions. 

Acquiring 50% of Triton Power
In September 2022, SSE Thermal expanded its low-carbon ambitions in the UK 
by acquiring a 50% stake in Triton Power with Equinor. The Triton Power portfolio 
consists of three strategically-located assets, with the largest being Saltend Power 
Station in the Humber.

The acquisition not only supports the long-term decarbonisation of the UK’s power 
system but also contributes to security of supply and grid stability in the shorter term.

Since September, the joint venture comprising SSE Thermal and Equinor has 
focused on using the portfolio as a platform to develop more low-carbon projects 
to support the transition to net zero, building on the decarbonisation work already 
carried out by Triton. Initial steps to decarbonise Saltend Power Station are already 
underway, targeting partial abatement by 2027 through blending up to 30% 
low-carbon hydrogen into the plant, with a commitment to work towards 100% 
abatement.

In line with just transition principles, the joint venture is committed to transitioning 
the assets for the net zero world through responsible ownership and operation, and 
in consultation with the local workforce and representatives.

SSE introduced an additional action into its Net Zero Transition Plan to ensure that 
its gas-fired joint ventures are aligned with a net zero pathway. While the acquisition 
of Triton Power brought additional emissions onto SSE’s greenhouse gas emissions 
inventory in the short term, SSE’s 2030 Science-Based Targets remain unchanged. 
As a result, the acquisition is wholly aligned to SSE’s Net Zero Transition Plan and 
reflects the Group’s wider ambition to invest in projects with a low-carbon focus. 

1 While Marchwood Power Station is a 50% Joint Venture, 100% of the GHG emissions from this power station are captured in the scope 1 inventory as a result of the Power 
Purchase Agreement that has been in place since it was commissioned.
2 SSE acquired its equity share of Triton Power on 1 September 2022 and includes 50% of its emissions from that date in its scope 3 inventory.

PARTNERING IN ACTION



Enhanced climate action

26 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

The next phase of SSE’s engagement is 
to measure the impact of its suppliers 
and integrate solutions to mitigate and 
manage these emissions. To do this, 
SSEN Distribution worked with the 
Supply Chain Sustainability School and 
launched a Sustainable Supplier Code 
which aims to support suppliers to embed 
climate actions with the aim of reducing 
GHG emissions and support net zero 
ambition. In addition, SSEN Transmission 
is undertaking an innovation project 
with project partners to introduce better 
designs into its overhead line tower 
foundations, with the aim of reducing 
the concrete used and saving around 
1,360MtCO

2
e. 

SSE Renewables joined up with nine 
other energy companies to work with the 
Carbon Trust to develop methods and 
guidance to measure carbon emissions 
associated with offshore wind projects. 
The aim of the tool is to build a common 
life cycle analysis methodology that will 
support the industry to identify carbon 
intensive practices and reduce the carbon 
impact of offshore wind projects. It is also 
working with its power cable supplier, NKT, 
to source low-carbon power cables for its 
Dogger Bank C offshore wind farm.

Advocating for climate action
During 2022/23 SSE continued to 
advocate for accelerated climate action 
with focus on increasing deployment of 
renewable generation and decarbonisation 
of thermal generation, heat and transport. 

SSE Thermal engaged the UK Government 
on making the case for investment in 
carbon capture and storage, including 
in the Humber region and Scotland, 
and provided input into the design of 
the heads of terms for dispatchable 
power for carbon capture and storage 
technology. SSE also is a member of 
the UK Government’s hydrogen expert 
groups on hydrogen transport and storage 
infrastructure and has been active in 
informing the needs case assessment 
for hydrogen policy interventions. SSE 
also responded to the Irish Government’s 
hydrogen strategy, supporting the 
development of a hydrogen economy 
and outlining the need for coordinated 
and effective incentives for its production, 
use, transport and storage. In addition, 
SSE responded to the UK Government’s 
consultations and discussions on negative 
emissions technologies.

SSE also engaged with the UK’s 
Department for Environment and Rural 
Affairs on matters relating to climate 
adaptation and resilience planning as 
well as consultations on the Electricity 
Networks Strategic Framework and 
the review of Renewable Electricity 
Market Arrangements. In Ireland, climate 
advocacy continued with SSE contributing 
to Government considerations on 
the rollout of offshore wind, with SSE 
successfully calling for an increase in the 
2030 offshore wind target from 5GW to 
7GW. 

Climate advocacy through trade 
associations
SSE is a member of several diverse 
trade associations that align with its 
business objectives and enable it to work 
collaboratively across the energy sector 
on matters of shared interest. SSE works 
closely and engages with these trade 
associations on a continuous basis to 
ensure that their principles on climate 
change are consistent with those of its 
own.

SSE’s annual review of the net zero 
ambitions of its trade association 
memberships can be found in SSE’s Trade 
Association Climate Review available at 
sse.com/sustainability. The report once 
again confirms that none of the trade 
associations assessed were identified to 
have opposing climate-related views. 
SSE will continue to engage with all trade 
associations and report its assessment 
annually. 

Taking account of the price of carbon
As a generator of electricity, SSE is 
subject to policies that impact carbon 
pricing, which means the price of carbon 
is an explicit consideration in many 
investment decisions. During 2022/23, 
SSE’s generation activities in GB operated 
under the UK Emissions Trading Scheme 

(UK ETS) carbon pricing system. SSE’s 
generation assets in Ireland operate under 
the EU ETS. The UK ETS and EU ETS are 
cap- and- trade emissions schemes. This 
involves a ‘cap’ that is set on the total 
amount of GHGs that can be emitted 
by sectors and this is reduced over time 
so that overall total emissions must 
fall. Within the cap, participants receive 
free allowances and/ or buy emissions 
allowances at auction or on the secondary 
market, which they can trade with other 
participants as needed.

In addition to the UK ETS, in GB SSE’s 
activities are subject to the Carbon Price 
Support (CPS) mechanism which sets a 
price per tonne of carbon emitted and 
combined with the UK ETS allowance 
price, makes up the Total Carbon Price 
paid by electricity generators. The 
combination of the UK ETS and the CPS 
sets the carbon price in electricity market 
in Great Britain, and the EU ETS in the 
Single Electricity Market (SEM) between 
Ireland and Northern Ireland. 

SSE views that strong carbon pricing in 
the electricity system has a critical role in 
meeting the UK’s net zero commitments 
and delivering a net zero electricity system 
in the 2030s. SSE continues to promote a 
robust carbon price with the UK and Irish 
Governments, along with the European 
Commission, and continues to support 
the strengthening of the UK ETS and EU 
ETS through determining the supply of 
greenhouse gas emission allowances. 
Ultimately, SSE believes the progressive 
tightening of the allowances available is 
a powerful tool to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions in the most economic way 
possible. SSE will also continue to actively 
engage with both the UK and EU as they 
implement the changes to align their 
ETS with their net zero targets as soon as 
possible, both bilaterally and through its 
trade associations.

Adapting to a climate changed world

Potential impacts of climate change to 
SSE’s operations
The physical impacts of climate change 
have the potential to adversely impact 
SSE’s operations and interrupt the supply 
of energy to its customers. Increased 
severity of extreme weather events, such 
as storms, floods and heat waves bring 
prolonged extreme temperatures, wind 
or rainfall, which can impact all aspects 
of SSE’s activities, including renewable 
generation output, electricity networks 
infrastructure and customer demand. 
Physical impacts of climate change are 
highlighted as a climate-related risk in SSE’s 
TCFD opportunity and risk assessment 
(pages 44 and 45 of SSE’s Annual Report 
2023) and the information in this section 
provides additional detail on how the 
controls and mitigating actions it takes to 
manage these impacts.

For example, over the 2022/23 winter the 
SSEN Distribution network was affected 
by two extreme weather events, an ice 
storm in Shetland in December 2022 
and Storm Otto in February 2023. SSEN 
Distribution has an investment programme 
for weather-related resilience expenditure 
covering overhead line replacement and 
refurbishment, tree cutting and flood 
protecting (see page 24). In 2022/23 
SSEN Distribution attended the Energy 
Innovation Base Camp to discuss the use 
of Nature Based Solutions as part of flood 
prevention resilience responses. 

SSE has mitigation methods in place, 
such as monitoring short- and long-term 
weather patterns, crisis management and 
business continuity plans and investment 
programmes to improve infrastructure 
resilience. It also assesses potential future 
risks of climate change and considers 
actions that can be taken to prepare for 
changes to weather. 

Assessing future risks of a changing 
climate
An important element in SSE’s climate 
adaptation work is assessing future 
potential risks from a changing climate. 

SSE does this in a couple of ways, 
including through its annual assessment of 
the potential financial impacts key climate-
related opportunities and risks facing the 
business. Through this process SSE has 
identified that storm damage and heat are 
a significant potential risk to its networks 
businesses. Full details of the assessment 
can be found in SSE’s Annual Report 2023, 
pages 42 to 45.

In addition to this, SSE continues to 
review climate projections using the Met 
Office UK Climate Projection (UKCP18) 
tool for the next decade, to understand 
the potential impact on its key assets and 
infrastructure from higher temperatures, 
changing rainfall patterns, and more 
extreme weather events such as floods, 

droughts and heat waves. This process 
supports the UK Government’s assessment 
of critical infrastructure which takes place 
every five years. SSE’s electricity networks 
and generation businesses have published 
progress reports against the previous 
assessments which were completed 
in 2015 and further work is ongoing 
to reassess the risks and to update 
mitigation measures where required. SSEN 
Transmission and SSEN Distribution have 
set out resilience strategies with climate 
adaptation actions in their respective 
price control frameworks. In 2023, SSE 
also responded to the UK Government’s 
consultation on national adaptation 
planning framework through its businesses 
and associated trade associations. 

The increasing severity and regularity of extreme weather events can pose significant 
disruption to SSE’s operations and it must work to build resilience as it adapts to changing 
weather patterns and extreme events. 



28 SSE plc Net Zero Transition Report 2023

The Net Zero Transition Report in summary
SSE understands that net zero targets are only credible when backed up by a clear plan of 
action. SSE’s Net Zero Transition Plan was designed to provide this clarity for its stakeholders. 
It outlines 17 key actions to ensure its net zero ambitions are met.

The key actions focus primarily on addressing SSE’s largest source of GHG emissions from electricity generation, alongside 
a plan to address remaining GHG emissions across remaining emissions, at the same time as recognising the cross cutting 
issues of social impact and climate resilience. This following summary provides updates on the actions taken, in financial 
year 2022/23. 

Key progress in 2022/23

SSE Thermal continues to manage its existing unabated generation fleet carefully, 
ensuring plant availability at times of system need and maximum efficiency. Tarbert, 
an oil-fired generator in Ireland, will close by the end 2023, in line with environmental 
requirements.

Enhanced climate action



Providing 
affordable and 
clean energy

The extreme volatility experienced in international gas markets over the last 12 months, has reinforced the importance of SSE’s 
continued investment in homegrown sources of energy. Homes and businesses have been faced with challenging circumstances 
and SSE has put in place immediate measures of support for its household customers, while also working with government in the 
medium-term for a secure, clean and affordable future energy system for all consumers.

As SSE supports the transition from a traditional fossil fuel-based energy system towards one that 
is renewables-led, it must not compromise on system reliability or the affordability of energy for 
the end consumer. 

Increase renewable output fivefold
Build a renewable energy portfolio that generates at least 50TWh of 
renewable electricity a year by 2030.

SSE’s renewable generation output in 2022/23, while impacted by lower levels of wind 
resource, increased by 730GWh compared to 2021/22.

Having experienced exceptionally still and dry conditions in the prior year, SSE’s renewable generation 
volumes in 2022/23 rose by 7% but were 13% behind plan due to Seagreen Offshore Wind Farm project 
delays and another year of unfavourable weather. SSE Renewables made progress with its key flagship 
projects. First power was achieved at the 1,075MW Seagreen Offshore Wind Farm (49% SSE stake) and 
progress was made on Dogger Bank Offshore Wind Farm (3,600MW, 40% SSE stake). Onshore, the 
443MW Viking Onshore Wind Farm was successful in securing a Contract for Difference (CfD) in July 
2022 where construction has progressed well, with the first turbine successfully installed in April 2023.

Delivering clean, affordable energy
Delivering the clean energy needed for the transition to net zero requires increased and 
sustainable investment in renewable sources of energy, alongside the transmission network 
infrastructure which is essential in connecting it to the grid.

Investing in a clean and secure 
homegrown energy system 
With international gas prices rising 
substantially in 2022/23, the case for 
continued investment in clean and secure 
homegrown sources of energy has 
become even more urgent Renewable 
sources of energy provide one of the most 
cost-effective solutions to address both the 
challenges of energy security and energy 
affordability currently facing the UK, Ireland 
and beyond. 

SSE’s enhanced capital and investment 
expenditure programme, NZAP Plus, 
enhances SSE’s investment plans to 2027, 
supporting renewable sources of energy, 

low-carbon flexible generation as well 
increased investment in transmission 
network infrastructure that has a crucial role 
in facilitating the connection of increased 
volumes of renewables on the electricity 
system. 
 
Targeting a fivefold increase in 
renewable generation output 
Progress was made in 2022/23 towards 
SSE’s target to grow renewable electricity 
generation output fivefold between 2017/18 
and 2030/31, with output increasing from 
9.5TWh in 2021/22 to 10.2TWh in 2022/23 
(inc. pumped storage, biomass and 
constrained off wind in GB). 

In addition to progress made over 2022/23, 
SSE Renewables reached important 
milestones in key pipeline projects, 
including the submission of a consent 
application to the Scottish Government 
in December 2022 for the Berwick Bank 
offshore wind farm. Located in the outer 
Firth of Forth, Berwick Bank has potential to 
deliver 4.1GW of installed capacity, making it 
one of the largest offshore opportunities in 
the world, and it could be complete around 
the end of the decade. 

In addition, the 3.6GW Ossian offshore 
wind farm (40% SSE Renewables stake), 
one of the largest floating offshore wind 
projects in development worldwide, 

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 33

continued to progress through the 
early stages of development with the 
Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping 
Report for the Ossian Array submitted to 
the Scottish Government in March 2023.

SSE Renewables continues to focus on 
developing a strong pipeline of renewable 
energy projects to meet its own, as well 
as national, ambitions. SSE Renewables is 
targeting an installed capacity (net) of over 
9GW of renewable generation, including 
battery storage by 2027 and has a current 
pipeline1 of around 14GW of renewable 
energy projects, 2.6GW of which was in 
construction at 31 March 2023. 

Sustainable finance for the net zero 
transition
A new Green Bond to finance renewables 
To delivery of key infrastructure to support 
the net zero transition, SSE has pursued 
a strategy of issuing Green Bonds, when 
appropriate, to fund its investments. To 
date, the proceeds of SSE’s Green Bonds 
have been allocated to refinancing eligible 
projects of onshore wind farms in the UK 
and Ireland, as well as key transmission 
network projects which are primarily 
required to facilitate greater volumes of 
renewable generation in Scotland and 
transporting it to centres of demand. 
These projects are key in supporting SSE’s 
focus on investing in clean and secure, 
homegrown energy system. 

In July 2022, SSE issued a €650m seven-
year Green Bond, the proceeds of 
which were allocated to help fund SSE 
Renewables’ flagship onshore and offshore 
wind projects which are currently under 
construction or recently completed. This 
marks SSE’s fifth Green Bond in six years 
and reaffirms its status as one of the largest 
issuers of Green Bonds from the UK 
corporate sector. It remains the only UK 
corporate to offer multiple Green Bonds 
and this latest issuance brings SSE’s total 
outstanding Green Bonds to over £2.5bn. 

SSE has made a commitment to update 
investors each year on the allocation of the 
proceeds and the environmental impact of 
its Green Bonds. SSE’s Green Bond Reports 
can be found at sse.com/greenbond. 

Funding increased capacity on  
the transmission network
SSEN Transmission (75% SSE stake) is 
expected to invest over £10bn in the 
decade to 2030 and in doing so will 

considerably increase its portfolio of 
major capital projects. This scale of 
investment requires finance which seeks 
to promote and enable sustainability, and 
private financial products can support 
this endeavor. SSEN Transmission has 
developed its first sustainability-linked 
revolving credit facility of £750m. The 
facility, which was signed in November 
2022, provides credit to support investment 
in the north of Scotland’s electricity 
transmission network, connecting low-
carbon power and helping deliver net zero.
 
In aligning sustainability performance with 
its financing strategy, SSEN Transmission 
has established four key performance 
indicators (KPIs) which are material to its 
sustainability commitment. The basket of 
KPIs is compliant with the Sustainability-

Linked Loan Principles (SLLPs) which state 
that KPIs should be core and material to a 
business and of high strategic significance 
to current and future operations.

The KPIs relate to the following areas: 
• reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions; 
• suppliers setting science-based 

emission reduction targets; 
• capex spend on connecting 

renewables; and, 
• biodiversity net gain delivery 

commitments across major terrestrial 
projects. 

Progress against the KPIs will be 
disclosed annually in SSEN Transmission’s 
Sustainability Report, which will be 
published later in 2023 and will be available 
at ssen-transmission.co.uk.

Providing affordable and clean energy

Serving electricity distribution customers
SSEN Distribution works to ensure that customers have secure and reliable energy today, 
while also laying the groundwork for a future energy system in which everyone can access the 
benefits.   

Unlocking a just transition for network 
customers
SSEN Distribution is at the forefront of 
enabling net zero at a local level, operating 
the electricity distribution network that 
will facilitate new forms of heating, battery 
storage and many more electric vehicles. 
In March 2023, it published a report which 
explores how net zero can be delivered 
fairly for consumers, ensuring people can 
participate in and benefit from the energy 
transition.

The report, titled A Fair Energy Future, 
details the partnerships and innovation 
projects SSEN Distribution has undertaken 
to explore and understand the new energy 
challenges that consumers will face in the 
next two decades with technology rapidly 
advancing and high-carbon heating and 
transport being phased out.

In addressing these critical issues, SSEN 
Distribution has created an action plan 
for delivering a just transition for energy 
consumers. To unlock the benefits of net 
zero for all consumers, the plan covers 10 
commitments from SSEN, alongside further 
recommendations for the energy industry 
and policy makers, against four key themes:

The full report can be found at ssen.co.uk.

Achieving the gold standard in inclusive 
service 
In January 2023, SSEN Distribution 
was announced as one of the first nine 
organisations to have achieved certification 
to the Inclusive Service Kitemark. The 
new Kitemark assured by BSI, the business 
standards and improvement company, 

demonstrates the provision of an inclusive 
and flexible service that benefits all 
consumers, regardless of their personal 
circumstances. The standard covers topics 
including, the identification of customer 
vulnerability; inclusive design of products 
and services; and, the adoption of AI and 
data collection, protection and sharing.

SSEN Distribution aims for industry-
leading service which is tailored, inclusive 
and accessible to customers, and the 
achievement of the standard is a result 
of its work to build on its range of well-
established existing inclusive service 
provision. The Inclusive Service Kitemark 
demonstrates both SSEN Distribution’s 
ongoing commitment to offering an 
inclusive service for all and its desire to be 
held to account too. This is particularly 
important in supporting customers through 
the recent cost-of-living crisis which has 

seen an increasing number of people 
entering vulnerable circumstances.   

Driving greater Priority Services 
Register awareness.
The Priority Services Register (PSR) is 
a free to join service that helps utility 
companies to provide adapted services 
and additional support to individuals in 
potentially vulnerable situations. Registering 
with a utility company’s PSR provides 
customers with vital support during a supply 
interruption. 

Recognising that the circumstances of its 
customers can change, SSEN Distribution 
consistently promotes the PSR to its 
customers, to ensure that its register is 
comprehensive, accurate and captures all 
those in need. In support of this objective, 
in March 2023, a new website thepsr.
co.uk was created through a collaborative 

Establishing new standards 
for equal access to EVs
In October 2020 SSEN Distribution 
established ‘Equal EV’, a collaboration 
with Disabled Motoring UK (DMUK) to 
identify the unique enablers and barriers 
faced by drivers with vulnerabilities 
adopting electric vehicles (EVs) and 
the role of technologies and networks 
operators in removing barriers. The 
Equal EV project focused on two key 
vulnerable groups – those with mobility 
impairments and those with high levels 
of anxiety, to explore how networks 
operators can provide additional 
support, such as installing Vehicle to 
Grid (V2G) technology to offer at-home 
resilience for vulnerable customers. 

The insights gained from the work have 
been instructive and have supported the 
inclusion of a commitment to improve 
accessibility at public charge points for 

disabled users in the UK Government’s 
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy.

In 2022, the Equal EV project fed into 
the creation of the British Standard 
Institution (BSI) PAS 1899, a new 
specification on accessible public 
charge points for EVs covering the 
design of charge points, including 
the location spacing and surrounding 
environment, as well as the appropriate 
information, signals and indicators to be 
provided. 

In addition, DMUK launched a parking 
standard called the Disabled Parking 
Accreditation which signposts off-
street car parks that are accessible to 
disabled people and will soon include a 
dedicated section on EV charge point 
provision.

PARTNERING IN ACTION CASE STUDY
PARTNERING IN ACTION

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 35

initiative led by SSEN Distribution and 
including 10 Distribution Network 
Operators (DNOs) and Gas Distribution 
Network Operators. This website brings 
together individual registers across these 
service providers, making it easier to 
raise awareness of the additional support 
available nationwide.

This initiative was created based on 
feedback from partners and stakeholders 
and follows on from a partnership, PSR 
Scotland, which launched in Scotland in 
March 2021. The website supports external 
partners such as local and national charities 
and NHS Trusts to promote the PSR to their 
customer base through a clear process.

Building trust in the domestic 
flexibility market 
In August 2022, the Household or 
Microbusiness Energy flexibility (HOMEflex) 
project was launched, which seeks to 
develop the tools to build trust in the 
domestic flexibility market and support 
consumers’ engagement. The HOMEflex 
project is being led by SSEN Distribution,  
alongside project partners Centre for 
Sustainable Energy and Flex Assure, and 
was established by the Association for 
Decentralised Energy.

Flexibility is the ability to shift the timing 
and location of the consumption and 
generation of electricity, to allow DNOs 
like SSEN to balance supply and demand 
and to manage constraints on the network 
cost effectively. Flexibility trading markets 
with commercial and industrial partners 
are already operational, but the scope for 
domestic consumers and microbusinesses 
to engage and trade is in its infancy. The 
HOMEflex project will work to build the 
trust that consumers need to engage with 
the market.

HOMEflex will ensure the domestic 
flexibility market is inclusive, fair 
and transparent, with clear lines of 
accountability to ensure participants abide 
by their commitments and to guarantee 
customers are protected and rewarded. 
The project will include developing a Code 
of Conduct for domestic flexibility services; 
a voluntary compliance scheme and a 
mechanism for customer complaints; and, 
a recommended trust mark for flexibility 
service providers signed up to the Code 
and redress schemes. 

Projects, such as HOMEflex, are essential 

in building trust in flexibility markets and 
ensuring the benefits of the transition 
of smart grids are shared widely with all 
consumers have equal opportunity to take 
part in future local energy markets. 

An electric heat pathway 
In 2022, SSEN Distribution and Grid 
Edge Policy published ‘An electric heat 
pathway: looking beyond heat pumps’. 
The report examines the opportunities 
presented by the use of storage heating 
as a viable alternative to heat pumps, and 
the changing role network operators may 
need to play to provide flexibility services 
to ensure value when adopting this type of 
technology. 

The report determined that storage heating 
with smarter controls could offer a suitable 
solution for many properties where heat 
pumps are unsuitable due to space, higher 
upfront costs and home efficiency (heat 
pumps are less efficient in poorly insulated 
homes). It also noted that properties with 
storage heaters are overwhelmingly lived 
in by more vulnerable households on 
lower incomes who can be pushed into 
fuel poverty by the higher running costs 
of existing legacy electric heating systems. 
The report therefore recommended a 
clear vision for these households and the 
housing stock should be a priority to ensure 
a fair transition to net zero. 

The learnings from this project are being 
used to build future projects to understand 

the specific impacts of flexible heating 
demand and build safeguards for vulnerable 
customers when alternative technologies 
are being considered. 

Expanding trials to aid low-carbon 
infrastructure planning 
SSEN Distribution is expanding its trial of 
the innovative Regional Energy System 
Optimisation Planning (RESOP) tool, which 
seeks to help local councils to make better-
informed decisions about the location of 
low-carbon infrastructure. Having partnered 
with Dundee City Council in July 2020 for 
the initial RESOP trial, SSEN Distribution 
announced in August 2022 that it was 
expanding the project by trialling RESOP 
with Oxford City Council and Oxfordshire 
County Council via the County Council’s 
spatial mapping work in Project LEO (see 
page 55 for more information). 

RESOP draws together data from 
multiple sources into a single database 
and incorporates social demographics 
and network data, ensuring that different 
challenges in differing geographies are 
accurately mapped, and provides council 
planners with whole system insights. This 
can then be used to rollout out low-carbon 
technologies such as charging points. 
The aim is that RESOP will support local 
authorities to plan future heat projects and 
other clean technologies with a clearer 
understanding of specific smart energy 
capabilities in their communities.

at financially vulnerable consumers and 
customer support funds. Details of the 
support offered is outlined in this section.  

With the war in Ukraine playing a major 
part in the high energy prices in 2022/23, 
SSE Airtricity committed to its customers 
that it would make no profit from them in 
financial year 2022/23.  That commitment 
was honoured with €8.6m of residual 
earnings of distributed back to domestic 
customers in the Republic of Ireland, after 
the year end in April 2023, amounting to a 
credit of €35 per customer.

Supporting customers through 
exceptional times
SSE Airtricity provided a holistic range 
of practical measures up to the value of 
€25m, including targeting families who are 
struggling financially. This has included:
• Price promise: SSE Airtricity held 

energy costs at June 2022 levels 
until the end of March 2023, for 
up to 60,000 financially vulnerable 
customers.

• Discretionary fund: a €1m 
discretionary fund was created to 

provide direct support to customers in 
difficulty.

• Energy efficiency measures: to 
help tackle one of the root causes of 
fuel poverty, SSE Airtricity supported 
vulnerable households with energy 
efficiency. This has included a 
commitment to deliver home energy 
upgrades for up to 600 vulnerable 
households through its affordability 
fund, at no cost, and a €2.5m 
donation to not-for-profit organisation 
EnergyCloud, which will help divert 
surplus renewable energy to up to

• Working with partners to support 
households: over 2022/23, SSE 
Airtricity made donations to trusted 
charity partners to support households 
in need of financial assistance across 
the island of Ireland, regardless of who 
their supplier is. This included a €1m 
donation to St Vincent de Paul (SVP) 
and donations totalling £2m to Bryson 
Charitable Group.

• Energy Bill Relief Scheme: SSE 
Airtricity also applied discounts to 
the value of £116m in the year to 
customers in Northern Ireland under 
the UK Government’s Energy Bill Relief 
Scheme.

Alongside these measures SSE Airtricity is 
working with customers to find a solution 
for those impacted by the cost-of-living 
crisis, including those on the priority 

services register and special service register.

External recognition of best practice 
customer support
In April 2023, SSE Airtricity was announced 
as the winner of The Social Responsibility 
Project Award, at the annual Business & 
Finance ESG Awards 2023. The award, 
sponsored by Unicef Ireland, was in 
recognition of SSE Airtricity’s significant 
efforts over 2022/23 to tackle the energy 
crisis and support vulnerable customers, 
including its establishment of the most 
comprehensive customer support fund of 
any supplier in Ireland.

Partnering to deliver cleaner energy
SSE Airtricity is proud to hold a 50% 
ownership share in Activ8 Solar Energies, 
Ireland’s longest established solar 
installation provider. Over 2022/23, Activ8 
carried out over 1,500 domestic solar 
installations, with growth ambitions to 

deliver up to 40,000 installations over the 
next 10 years. This activity is supporting 
local jobs, with the creation of 200 highly 
skilled green jobs over the next two years 
announced by Activ8 in 2022, supporting a 
just transition towards net zero. 

Helping business customers save energy
In 2022/23, SSE Airtricity continued to 
support businesses implement energy 
conservation measures, delivering 30.4GWh 
of energy savings, bringing the cumulative 
total of business energy savings supported 
since 2014 to over 580GWh. SSE Airtricity 
also directly offers energy audits to business 
customers, delivered by a registered energy 
auditor they provide businesses with a clear 
understanding of their significant energy 
users and a register of opportunities for 
energy conservation measures, including 
indicative payback periods and information 
on relevant grant supports available to them 
to help implement the measures.

Diverting excess renewable energy to those in need
Fuel poverty impacts thousands of Irish families every day 
and in 2020, according to figures from Government, 1,448 
GWh of zero carbon energy from wind generation alone was 
constrained. This means the transmission system operator has 
requested a renewable generator to produce less electricity 
than it could have otherwise, or even to stop generating 
completely. 

EnergyCloud is an innovative not-for-profit organisation 
which helps divert surplus renewable energy, which would 
be otherwise wasted, to homes, with a focus on those in 
fuel poverty. In 2022/23, SSE Airtricity donated €2.5m to 
EnergyCloud which will enable up to 10,000 households 

experiencing fuel poverty nationwide to have their homes 
fitted with smart technology that uses surplus renewable 
energy to heat tanks of water for free. By creating this ‘new’ 
electricity demand, it means there is now somewhere for this 
excess electricity supply to ‘go’, simultaneously supporting the 
decarbonisation of heat and helping people who are energy 
poor.  

EnergyCloud works with Approved Housing Bodies and Local 
Authorities to enable the delivery of this support to their homes 
and the delivery of the supports will be managed by a project 
team from SSE Airtricity and EnergyCloud.

Providing affordable and clean energy

SSE Business Energy  

Helping business customers go green
SSE Business Energy helps business 
customers of all sizes across Great 
Britain to reduce their carbon emissions 
through its green electricity offering. All 
SSE Business Energy green electricity is 
backed by Renewable Energy Guarantees 
of Origin (REGOs) and is independently 
verified. While in the past, SSE encouraged 
its business customers to choose a green 
tariff, in 2022/23, all of SSE’s fixed power 
quotes are now all provided as 100% green. 
That means a green power supply for 
business energy customers is, as standard, 
from renewable energy.  

SSE Business Energy has continued 
to support businesses through the UK 
Government’s Smart Programme, installing 
smart meters at a rate that exceeded its 
market share of the non-domestic market 
for 2022/23. Smart meters are crucial in the 
delivery of flexible products, like time-of-
use tariff for EVs, to empower and support 
businesses toward net zero and it continues 
to work to encourage its customers to 
choose to install smart meters. 

SSE Business Energy’s focus remains on 
driving smart adoption throughout 2023/24, 
building on its engaging smart propositions 
and incentives to encourage adoption and 
helping customers to manage and reduce 
demand. In 2022/23, it launched a suite 
of new and enhanced digital offerings to 
improve the customer journey, including 
a small business sustainability content 
hub providing help to customers with net 
zero guidance, and a free and easy-to-use 
carbon footprint calculator.

SSE Distributed Energy

A focus on heat networks 
Heat networks are a core feature of the UK 
Government’s Heat and Buildings Strategy, 
although they currently Only meet around 
2% of the UK’s heat demand. It is estimated 
by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) 
that around 18% of UK heat will need to 
come from heat networks by 2050, if 
the UK is to meet its carbon targets in a 
cost-effective way.

SSE Heat Networks has over ten years 
of experience in heat and cooling, with 
18 networks across the UK. SSE believes 
that heat networks have an important 
role to play in achieving net zero with 

important efficiencies and carbon savings 
in comparison to gas heating.  

In support of a maturing heat network 
sector, SSE was a founding member of the 
Heat Trust (the independent heat customer 
protection scheme) and the Heat Networks 
Industry Council (HNIC). HNIC is a group of 
heat network operators who are working 
closely with the government to create a 
policy framework that will unlock heat 
networks potential to deliver about 20% 
of the UK’s zero carbon heat by 2050. As 
part of this work, HNIC members have 
committed to decarbonise their existing 
networks by 2035.

Decarbonising home heat networks at 
scale
In April 2023, SSE Distributed Energy 
announced it had entered an agreement 
with Berkeley Homes that will help to 
decarbonise a heat network for up to 5,000 
homes in London, thought to be one of the 
largest retrofits of its kind in the country.
An Air Source Heat Pump system will 
connect directly to the existing district 
heating network pipes, reducing the 
carbon content of the heat provided by 
the network. The system will be installed 

in nearby Wellington Park, where a new 
landscape will be created through a 
unique planting scheme that broadens the 
biodiversity of the area by responding to the 
microclimate.  

The work, which will get underway in 2025, 
is a significant milestone in the evolution 
of SSE’s heat networks portfolio and paves 
the way for decarbonisation work across 
the remainder of SSE’s expanding UK heat 
networks.

Expanding district heating and 
electricity scheme
In 2022, SSE Distributed Energy announced 
the development of a new £25m low-
carbon district heating and electricity 
scheme in Aire Valley, Leeds, which 
is home to around 400 businesses 
employing around 15,000 people, mainly in 
manufacturing, wholesale and distribution. 
The energy network is planned to be served 
by enfinium’s new Skelton Grange energy-
from-waste facility which is currently under 
construction and scheduled for completion 
in 2025. SSE Distributed Energy is exploring 
potential opportunities to capture waste 
heat from the enfinium facility and 
distribute it via insulated pipes under the 

The challenge of transition planning 
for small businesses
While SSE’s scale allows it to invest resource into the process of net zero planning, 
it relies on, and has important relationships with many small businesses in the 
wider economy. SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) feature heavily in 
both its customer base and its supply chain. When listening to those customers 
and suppliers it is apparent that, while they are committed to the decarbonisation 
imperative, there are often limits to the resource that can be applied to their 
decarbonisation efforts.  That, coupled with the exceptionally challenging prevailing 
economic conditions these companies face, has led SSE to understand that it must 
be proportionate in its demands from its suppliers, and supportive in its provision of 
energy and energy related services.

With all this in mind, and in 2022, SSE, alongside other organisations, supported 
Business in the Community in Scotland (BiTC Scotland) to design and deliver a 
specialised mentoring and training initiative for small and medium sized businesses.  

Targeting its supply chain, 50 SMEs were invited in February 2023 to register, 
with 10 actively participating. Business owners and leaders were provided with 
mentoring support from both SSE’s Business Energy Team and wider sustainability 
specialists from across SSE. A second cohort is planned for June 2023, with 
300 business invited to take part. This has the double impact of supporting the 
understanding of carbon accounting amongst the small businesses SSE has a 
relationship with, and also supported the ongoing development and understanding 
from SSE’s own employees.

ground to local businesses. Some local 
businesses may also benefit by being 
supplied with lower-cost electricity directly 
from the energy-from-waste facility.

Scaling up solar and battery 
Over 2022/23 SSE announced significant 
milestones in its solar and battery storage 
business which now has a 1.2GW solar 
and battery pipeline secured, and a further 
1.3GW of other prospective sites under 
development. 

Battery: SSE Distributed Energy broke 
ground in September 2022 at its first 50MW 
battery storage project at Salisbury, which 
it is expected will become operational in 
September 2023. In addition, construction 
of a new 150MW battery storage project at 
Ferrybridge in Yorkshire is also getting under 
way with the assets expected to be fully 
operational in late 2024.

Solar: construction began in summer 
2023 at SSE’s 30MW solar farm at Littleton 
in Worcestershire. In January 2023, 
SSE Distributed Energy announced the 
acquisition of the rights to three solar sites 
in Nottinghamshire from Gridmove Ltd.

In April 2023, the standalone Solar and 
Battery business, that had previously 
reported alongside SSE Distributed Energy, 
was integrated into SSE Renewables. 
Transferring the business to SSE 
Renewables allows it to scale up and 
develop opportunities both domestically 
and internationally, as well as maximising 
the potential of co-locating projects. 

Ultra rapid charging for Glasgow 
In October 2022, SSE Distributed Energy 
opened its first ultra-rapid EV charging hub 
as part of a major new initiative to deliver 
300 such hubs across the UK and Ireland 
within the next five years. Located on 
Glasgow’s Castlebank Street, the six-bay 
EV charging hub is powered by traceable, 
renewable energy. 

It is estimated that at least 60,000 charges 
could take place at the hub each year, 
which aims to accommodate domestic 
vehicles, light commercial vehicles, mixed 
fleet drivers and taxis. The hub features 
ultra-rapid charging facilities from 150 
kilowatts that can put drivers back on 
the road within 20 to 40 minutes of 
plugging in.

Decarbonising the maritime 
sector starts on dry land
UK domestic maritime vessels contribute significant amounts of 
GHG emissions every year, and decarbonising the maritime sector 
will play an important role in supporting the UK meet its net zero 
targets.

In September 2022, Green Corridor Short Straits – a consortium of 
Port of Dover, University of Kent, SSE Distributed Energy and several 
others – won funding from the Department of Transport to create 
a zero-carbon trade route between Dover and Calais/Dunkirk. Port 
of Dover is the perfect candidate to lead the UK’s efforts on port 
decarbonisation as it forms a crucial link in Britain’s supply chain, 
with more than two million heavy goods vehicles passing through 
the port each year.

A green port does not simply mean swapping out vessels run on 
fossil fuels, for electric or hydrogen-powered ones – it involves low-
carbon infrastructure across the entire port. This could be energy-
optimised smart warehouses to process freight, private wire grids, 
supplying the port with energy from local renewable sources, and 
use of electric vehicles and cranes. Key partners in the consortium 
have begun the task of identifying the energy infrastructure that will 
be needed at the Port of Dover.

Decarbonising heat is 
mission critical to the UK’s 
pathway to net zero. A whole 
system approach means 
SSE Distributed Energy can 
be the trusted partner and 
one-stop-shop for clients 
looking to decarbonise 
their portfolios.”

PARTNERING IN ACTION



Investing in industry, 
innovation and 
infrastructure

The increasing demand for low-carbon infrastructure to support clean and secure national energy systems is accelerating the 
speed at which the transition is taking place, making it more important than ever that investment decisions are considered, ensuring 
they deliver value for society and other stakeholders. To meet the net zero challenge, innovative will be key and SSE’s focus is to 
demonstrate real world applications and accelerated readiness of new technologies in support of the energy transition. 

The scale of infrastructure development required for net zero will rely on innovation and new 
technologies, and brings with it a responsibility to manage social and environmental impacts 
carefully as large capital projects are planned, designed, constructed and operated.   

Enable low-carbon generation and demand 
Enable at least 20GW of renewable generation and facilitate around 2 million 
EVs and 1 million heat pumps on SSEN’s electricity networks by 2030.

SSEN Transmission connected around 1.4GW of additional renewable generation capacity 
to its network, in 2022/23, while SSEN Distribution progressed with partnership trials to 
support a fair and inclusive transition to smart grids.

At the end of 2022/23, there was just over 9.2GW of renewable capacity connected to SSEN 
Transmission’s network, up from 7.8GW the previous year. In the same period, SSEN Distribution had 
around 208,500 pure electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid vehicles registered in its licence areas and had 
connected around 52,500 heat pumps to its networks. SSEN Distribution continued to progress several 
key innovation projects with partners to support flexible markets and future infrastructure provision for 
the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).

Disciplined investment in 
the net zero transition 
SSE’s enhanced strategic plans must deliver a return on investment while addressing energy 
affordability and finding a balance between cost efficiency and a sustainable supply chain. 

Accelerating investment plans to deliver 
net zero 
With countries around the world seeking 
to secure national energy supplies, the 
demand for low-carbon energy investment 
has increased significantly and SSE has 
responded with accelerated ambition. 
In May 2023, 18 months after its initial 
launch, SSE’s Net Zero Acceleration 
Programme (NZAP) was revised to 
reflect the increased opportunities 
created as the world pursues net zero. 
The new ‘NZAP Plus’ includes investment 
of £18bn between now and 2026/27, 
compared to £12.5bn over the five years 
to 2025/26 through the original NZAP. 
The added investment means SSE’s total 
capital expenditure equates to more than 
£10m a day spent on critical national 
infrastructure. 

The Plan features revised growth targets to 
March 2027 for SSE Renewables of over 
9GW of installed renewable generation 
capacity , including battery storage,  
alongside a considerable enhanced 
projection of the gross Regulated Asset 
Value of SSE’s electricity transmission 
and distribution networks businesses of 
between £12bn and £14bn, up from £9bn 
in the original NZAP. 

With around 90% of the NZAP Plus 
expected to be invested in either 
renewables or networks, the substantial 
majority of the investment plan is focused 
on climate solutions to achieve SSE’s 2030 
Goals which are aligned to a 1.5oC pathway 
and linked to the UN SDGs most material to 
the business, and is aligned to the Technical 
Screening Criteria of the EU Taxonomy.

In 2022/23, the first complete year of the 
NZAP Plus, SSE made record investment, 
with £2.8bn in adjusted investment and 
capital expenditure*.

Embedding sustainability criteria into 
large capital projects 
The investment ambitions set out in 
the NZAP Plus provide an opportunity 
to create enhanced value for both 
shareholders and society. To ensure this 
is the case, SSE must build sustainability 
considerations into large capital projects 
at all stages of development, so that 
social and environmental value is 
enhanced. 

In April 2022, SSE implemented its 
Sustainability Assessment and Action 
Plan (SAAP) which must be undertaken 
for all large capital projects (defined as 
those with a value over £10m for SSEN 
Distribution and £20m for all other 
SSE businesses). The SAAP is a core 
element of SSE’s Large Capital Projects 
governance framework, requiring every 
project development team to assess the 
impact of the projects across a range of 
core sustainability-related issues including 

embodied carbon, human rights risk and 
local economic impact. 

Over 2022/23, project teams have been 
supported to run sustainability workshops 
to identify the most material social and 
environmental impacts a development 
project may have. Feedback was received 
around resource usability, team capability, 
and project feasibility, and over 2022/23 
the SAAP was updated to incorporate 
learnings. This led to the development 
of the SAAP 2.0 which will launch in 
Q1 2023/24 alongside an engagement 
and training plan for the project teams. 
Furthermore, to further elevate the 
strategic importance of sustainability 
in LCP decision making, core project 
documentation for key stages of a 
development project will be updated 
in 2023/24 to ensure the most material 
sustainability impacts are clearly identified 
prior to a project progressing to the next 
stage of development.  

From the hydroelectric power 
stations in the highlands of 
Scotland to offshore wind farms 
in the North Sea, SSE’s assets are 
built to last.  SSE is a long term 
business and our ‘NZAP Plus’ is 
a sustainable investment plan 
that will provide clean power for 
generations to come.”

44 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

Investing in industry, innovation and infrastructure 

A central role for innovation 
Core to SSE’s approach to innovation is to work in collaboration with external partners to share 
knowledge and accelerate the readiness of people and technologies to support the energy 
transition.  

SSE’s approach to innovation 
The transition to net zero will require the 
transformation across the energy system, 
and SSE’s focus is on enabling, harnessing 
and deploying new technologies and 
innovations which can accelerate this 
journey. 

SSE’s approach to innovation does 
not rely solely on internal knowledge 
and resources but recognises that 
external partnerships and collaboration 
are essential to achieve its innovation 
objectives. This approach provides a 
framework for SSE businesses to achieve 
their innovation priorities. It identifies the 
four partnership groups key to innovation 
(academia, SMEs, energy industry peers 
and supply chain) and establishes four 
enabling pillars: Partnering for Innovation; 
Innovation by deployment ; Digitalisation; 
and, Talent. More information on each of 
these pillars is available on page 45.

The approach supports SSE to achieve 
four core objectives:
1. Creating new markets and 

increasing revenue: developing 
credible business cases to harness 
new technologies to meet net zero.

2. Increasing efficiency and 
performance: accelerating readiness 
of technologies, harnessing external 
expertise and building capability to 
develop and leverage digitalisation.

3. Minimising risk: sharing knowledge 
and best practice to deliver net zero 
solutions which are supported by 
government and regulators.

4. Building future capabilities: creating 
an innovative culture with diverse 
perspectives, experiences and skills 
and align talent recruitment with 
future capability. 

In 2022/23, SSE employed 81 full-time 
equivalent roles, up from 57 in 2021/22, 
and invested £10.8m in research and 
innovation projects, compared to £12.0m 
the year before. This investment can 
often be in multi-year, multi-stakeholder 
projects, with values that far exceed SSE’s 

funding contribution. 

A Group approach to driving 
innovation
SSE’s strategic approach to innovation 
is centred on its Academic Partnership 
and Partnership Funding teams which 
co-ordinate cross-cutting innovation and 
growth ideas. 

SSE’s Academic Partnerships team 
facilitates SSE’s structured strategic 
relationship with two leading UK 
Universities, Imperial College London 
and the University of Strathclyde. SSE 
further partners in one of Ireland’s leading 
all-island energy research programmes 
‘NexSys’ hosted by University College 
Dublin. The objective is for knowledge 
transfer between academia and industry 
with teams in SSE gaining knowledge 
through collaborative and directly engaged 
research, conferences, webinars and 
roundtables. The reverse is also true: 
academic researchers, through the 
relationship have the ability to mine real 
world problems with access to our SSE, 
data and operational insights.
SSE’s Partnership Funding team supports 

the Business Units to access incentive 
programmes, building effective consortia 
that compete for grant awards to trial 
and prove new technologies and market 
models. This enables SSE not only to 
be aligned with government policy by 
understanding government innovation 
direction, but also to maintain a leadership 
position in stimulating and facilitating 
innovation that can yield significant 
performance and sustainability gains. 

Empowering Business Unit innovation 
Each of SSE’s Business Units is 
empowered to set their own innovation 
priorities, supported by the framework 
of the Group approach to innovation. A 
culture of innovation is promoted through 
a dedicated innovation team within 
SSEN and two Engineering Centres of 
Excellence. The Networks Innovation team 
provide expertise to leverage regulatory 
funding for innovation and their focus is 
on accelerating a low-carbon transition 
and co-creation with partners to develop 
whole-system solutions. The Engineering 
Technology Centres of Excellence within 
SSE Renewables and SSE Thermal enable 
technology and digital solutions for 
cost-effective renewables and innovation 
in pumped hydro, Carbon Capture and 
Storage (CCS) and hydrogen.

Embedding sustainable supply chain practices
With the potential for up to £40bn of investment over the next decade, high-quality 
collaboration with supply chain partners is essential to mitigate risks, enhance innovation, and 
create resilience to support the achievement of shared sustainability goals.

A strategic approach to sustainable 
procurement 
SSE’s enhanced investment plan, NZAP 
Plus, will see the Company invest 
on average £10m a day on critical 
national infrastructure. In 2022/23, SSE’s 
procurement spend totalled around £3.8bn 
and it typically has around 9,000 suppliers. 
This scale of investment and activity 
requires careful management of the most 
significant sustainability impacts that may 
arise. In 2022/23, a materiality assessment 
undertaken of SSE identified supply chain 
management as one of the Company’s 
top five most material sustainability issues, 
and identified the positive impact SSE could 
have through continued efforts in this area. 

While SSE’s suppliers can be large global 
organisations, it aims to work locally to 
share the economic benefit of low-carbon 
investments with sustainable domestic 
employment. This is a key component of 
sharing value: it means working people, 
particularly those currently in industries 
which are in decline, can access new skills 
and jobs.

SSE’s Sustainable Procurement Code and 
Supplier Guidance form the core of its 
approach to managing environmental and 
social impacts through its supply chain (see 
page 25 for more information). The Code 
sets out SSE’s expectations of its suppliers 
and, as well as setting out minimum 
standards, it outlines the role of suppliers 
in delivering common sustainability goals, 
from paying a real Living Wage to helping 
SSE achieve its net-zero emissions target. 

Core to SSE’s strategic approach to 
sustainable procurement is high quality 
supplier engagement. One key route of 
engagement is SSE’s established Supplier 
Relationship Management programme, 
through which it manages relationships 
with 45 suppliers identified as critical to SSE 
achieving its strategic aims. Engaging with 
suppliers allows SSE to understand and 
address sustainability issues throughout the 
supply chain by collaborating to identify 
opportunities for improvement, implement 

sustainable practices, and collectively 
improve sustainability performance. 

Aligning supply chain requirements with 
business objectives
Through its Sustainable Procurement 
Code, SSE seeks to create the conditions 
by which the Company and its supply 
chain can support the delivery of shared 
sustainability objectives. An example of this 
is driving increased climate action, with SSE 
having a target to engage with 50% of its 
supply chain by spend to set science-based 
carbon targets by 2024 (see page 
47 progress).

Complementing the Group approach, 
SSE’s individual Business Units are designing 
enhanced supplier requirements that more 
closely match the sustainability priorities 
of their business. For example, in 2022/23 
SSE Renewables, developed an enhanced 
environment, social and governance (ESG) 
and Sustainability Clause. This contractual 
clause outlines expectations on suppliers to 
comply with SSE’s Sustainable Procurement 
Code and align with its sustainability 
policies, enhanced reporting, increased due 
diligence, and auditing rights. 

With a more regional supply chain, over 
2022/23, SSEN Distribution undertook 
a comprehensive assessment of the 
maturity of its supply chain in relation to 
the management of sustainability risks 
and opportunities. This process, along 
with supply chain collaboration during 
engagement sessions for its RIIO-ED2 
business plan, led the business to produce 
a more tailored Sustainable Supplier Code 
as a framework for collaboration with 
its supply chain through the ED2 price 
control between 2023 and 2028. The new 
Sustainable Supplier Code was launched in 
May 2023 and outlines 11 targeted metrics 
for SSEN Distribution’s supply chain to 
follow.

Capturing increased supply chain data
In April 2021 SSE adopted a supply 
chain data capture tool to identify the 
sustainability impact of projects. Over 

Investing in industry, innovation and infrastructure 

At SSE our objective is to have 
a sustainable supply chain 
in every sense of the word. 
We need innovative and 
competitive suppliers, that 
are economically, socially 
and environmentally 
sustainable and as their 
customer, we seek to 
support them achieve that.”

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 47

2022/23, SSEN Transmission has been 
rolling the requirement to complete the 
tool to its suppliers. Tier 1 contractors are 
now contractually required to use the 
Sustainability Tool within the current RIIO 
T2 price control period, and so far 10 supply 
chain partners are using the tool across 
more than 20 projects. SSE Distributed 
Energy and SSE Renewables will be 
adopting the tool going forward.

Strengthening supply 
chain standards 

Enhancing SSE’s Sustainable Procurement 
Code
In 2022/23, SSE strengthened its Sustainable 
Procurement Code in several priority areas 
with the inclusion of circular economy 
principles, requirements to adhere to 
Living Hours and expectations for suppliers 
to report additional safety performance 
metrics. SSE is tracking its suppliers’ 
engagement and approval of its Sustainable 
Procurement Code and Guidance through 
a source-to-contract platform, finding 
that they had a 97% acceptance rate at 31 
March 2023. Over 2023/24, the Sustainable 
Procurement Code will be updated further 
to outline SSE’s sustainable procurement 
journey, future ambitions, supply chain 
goals and provide more specific material 
requirements.

Supporting compliance with the 
Sustainable Procurement Code
A comprehensive survey of over 160 

procurement professionals was undertaken 
in 2022/23 which identified skills and 
knowledge gaps relating to sustainability 
expertise. This analysis identified skills needs 
and training was developed to support and 
enable sustainable decision making within 
the procurement process.

In addition, as part of its System of 
Internal Control, an internal audit of 
SSE’s implementation of its Sustainable 
Procurement Code and Supplier Guidance 
was undertaken. This initial audit has 
produced high-level findings around 
potential areas of improvement, which 
will be used to create an action plan to 
implement any required changes over 
2023/24. 

Enhanced supplier payment practices 
SSE seeks to meet the requirements of the 
Prompt Payment Code, a voluntary code of 
practice for businesses, administered by the 
Office of the Small Business Commissioner 
on behalf of the UK Government. It was 
established in December 2008 and sets 
standards for payment practices between 
organisations of any size and their suppliers. 
To align with the code SSE commits to 
paying suppliers on time, within agreed 
terms, providing clear guidance to suppliers 
on terms, dispute resolution and prompt 
notification of late payment, and supporting 
good practice throughout its supply chain 
by encouraging adoption of the Code.

Over 2022/23, on average SSE paid 
invoices within 28 days (2021/22: 28 days). 

87% of invoices were paid within 30 days 
(2021/22: 86%), 11% paid within 31-60 days 
(2021/22: 11%) and 3% paid in 61 days or 
more (2021/22: 3%). 25% of invoices were 
not paid within the agreed terms (2021/22: 
26%). 

In 2021, the Code was strengthened to 
include a requirement to pay 95% invoices 
within 60 days, and a requirement that 95% 
invoices from small businesses (with less 
than 50 employees) must be paid within 30 
days (effective from 1 July 2021 for existing 
signatories). To align with SSE has been 
working to identify those suppliers who 
have <50 employees, analyse its payment 
performance for small suppliers, and create 
remediation plans for those that were not 
paid within the timeframe. Since 2021, SSE 
identified over 6,000 small suppliers and 
completed the analysis, and is working with 
local finance teams on the remediation 
plans where required. In April 2023, SSE 
completed its 6 monthly submission of 
Payment Practices, which included Small 
Business Data. To ensure small suppliers 
are identifiable moving forward SSE aims 
to update all supplier records with business 
size and update new supplier forms 
to include mandatory field to capture 



employee numbers.

Collaborating to drive 
industry-wide progress

Driving meaningful supply chain 
collaboration
The Powering Net Zero Pact (‘the Pact’) is 
a flagship collaborative initiative created 
by SSE with 10 key founding partners. 
Over 2022/23, the Pact has grown to 20 
member companies and brings together 
different companies across all tiers of the 
power sector, identifying five key topics 
for collaboration to a fair and just transition 
to net zero. The Pact members have 
operations across more than 120 countries, 
combined turnover of more than £75bn, 
over 350,000 employees, and more than 
170,000 suppliers. 

Over 2022/23, the focus of the Pact was 
establishing the working groups for the 
five topics of collaboration. In May 2023, 
the Pact released its first annual report of 
progress, which details the activity of the 
five working groups, their agreed priorities 
and what the joint deliverables are for the 
first two years. This report, alongside more 
information on the Pact, can be found at 
sse.com/pnzp. 

Providing supplier sustainability training
SSE has been a partner of the Supply Chain 
Sustainability School (SCSS) since 2020. 
Through this partnership, SSE provides its 

supply chain with information, resources 
and access to training on key sustainability 
topics. Over 2022/23, SSE improved its 
engagement and measurement with 
the SCSS to enable it to develop a plan 
to increase supplier participation in the 
training programs. As of 31 March 2023, 
192 of SSE’s suppliers (45% of SSE’s supply 
chain spend) have accessed sustainability 
resources through the SCSS. SSE has 
set a target to increase this to 55% by 31 
March 2024, using learning pathways and 
SSE’s Strategic Relationship Management 
meetings to stimulate engagement on the 
platform. 

Encouraging inclusion and diversity in 
SSE’s supply chain

SSE is committed to promoting inclusion 
and diversity throughout its supply chain, 
supporting businesses and people in the 
areas it operates by ensuring inclusion and 
diversity are part of the supplier selection 
process. SSE’s sustainable procurement 
strategy, underpinned by the Sustainable 
Procurement Code, includes expectations 
that suppliers will promote greater 
inclusion. Over 2022/23, the Code was 
updated to include further requirements of 
suppliers, including to: ensure their policies 
and processes are inclusive for all; provide 
evidence of policies and practices that 
result in improved inclusion and diversity of 
the workforce; and, provide information on 
the results of those practices, if requested 
by SSE. For more information see SSE’s 
Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023.

Investing in industry, innovation and infrastructure 

Creating social value with key suppliers 
As part of an initiative developed for SSE’s Procurement 
and Commercial department’s leadership development 
programme in 2020/21, employees were challenged to 
deliver a project that would add value to SSE. The group of 
developing leaders identified the potential for enhanced social 
value within SSE’s supply chain. A pilot was run which saw 
SSE work closely with two successful framework suppliers, a 
tree cutting contractor and a retrofit of an existing framework 
contractor within IT, to identify where social value could be 
built into the contract and the framework could be utilized 
to monitor the delivery of these commitments. Examples of 
social value commitments include apprenticeship schemes, 
local school engagement, donations to community projects, 
and mandatory volunteering requirements for operatives. 

These initial pilot projects confirmed the potential of the value 
that can be created through SSE’s supply chain activity, and 
following this success SSE is rolling out this approach across its 
supply chain over 2023/24.

As part of SSE’s social value approach over 2022/23, a Social 
Value Roadmap was created in collaboration with a third 
party, Action Sustainability. This comprised of conducting a 
gap analysis to determine how SSE performs on embedding 
social value and identify best practice. A list of key actions in 
a strategic timeline was produced, which SSE will begin to 
implement over 2023/24, collaborating with its supply chain to 
further create and measure social value.

Increased renewables 
ambition and growth
SSE Renewables is driving the net zero transition through the development, financing, 
construction and operation of world-class clean energy assets..

Accelerating the transition to net zero
SSE’s new NZAP Plus capex plan will see 
£18bn of investment over the five years to 
2027, with 40% of that investment being 
allocated to SSE Renewables. The NZAP 
Plus, combined with an enhanced growth 
target, seeks to deliver a fourfold increase in 
SSE’s owned renewables capacity to over 
16GW (net) by 2032.

SSE’s plans for increasing installed 
renewable generation capacity (including 
battery storage): 

Creating an optimal structure for 
growth
The SSE Renewables business comprises 
existing operational assets and those under 
development in onshore wind, offshore 
wind, flexible hydro electricity, run-of-

at its existing operational wind farm in Co. 
Wexford, Ireland. The planning application 
for the project, a 21MW solar photovoltaic 
(PV) array and a 10MW/2hr battery energy 
storage system, will be submitted in the 
coming months.

In April 2023, the standalone Solar and 
Battery business, that had previously 
reported alongside SSE Distributed Energy, 
was integrated into SSE Renewables, further 
enhancing the SSE Renewables’ focus on 
these technologies. Future ambitions for 
the Solar and Battery business are therefore 
referenced in this section, while information 
about performance for the past year can be 
found in the Distributed Energy section of 
this report on pages 38 and 39.

A year of milestones for flagship 
projects
SSE Renewables made good progress with 
its key flagship projects in 2022. First power 
was achieved at the 1,075MW Seagreen 
Offshore Wind Farm and significant 
progress was made on Dogger Bank, 
the world’s largest offshore wind farm, 
including the opening of the operations and 
maintenance base in South Tyneside. What 
will be the UK’s most productive onshore 
wind farm by output when complete, 
Viking Onshore Wind Farm, remains on 
track for operation in 2024. More detail on 
progress made for key projects can be seen 
on pages 30 to 32.

Using innovative technology at all stages in wind farm projects

Construction: In January 2023, the 
first-ever electron beam welded section 
was incorporated into an offshore wind 
turbine monopile foundation, which 
will be installed in the second phase of 
Dogger Bank Wind Farm later in 2023.

The pioneering £2.5m project, co-
funded by the UK’s innovation agency, 
Innovate UK, was led by SSE Renewables 
in collaboration with Sif, Cambridge 
Vacuum Engineering and TWI, and 
created a new, more productive and 
more sustainable manufacturing process 
for the welding of large steel structures 
for offshore wind.

Electron beam welding is significantly 
quicker, cheaper, more energy efficient 
and produces high quality welds 
compared to conventional welding 
techniques. This specific type of electron 
beam welding technology (EBflow) is 
an innovative development within the 
electron beam welding industry; instead 
of welding inside a costly and size-
limiting vacuum chamber, Ebflow uses 
a local vacuum system that creates and 
maintains a vacuum around only the 
seam that is being welded.

This technique opens up the potential 
to use electron beam welding on large 
structures, while reducing costs and 
enhancing productivity. The technology 
has been shown to weld monopiles 
at least 25 times faster than current 
methods, while using 90% less energy, 
costing 88% less, and producing 97% less 
CO

2
 emissions. 

Development: SSE has developed 
virtual reality (VR) technology to provide 
3D visuals of wind turbines which can 
be used during in-person consultation 
events. The VR application allows 
members of the public to explore 
the inside of a wind turbine and find 
out more about how they work in an 
immerse and effective way. Users can 
view impressions of development sites 
from key vantage points on the coastline, 
the sea area and the onshore cable route. 
The technology will help to facilitate 
meaningful public engagement and 
increase the transparency of project 
plans.

SSE is also using VR technology to create 
immersive training applications which 
take employees through processes in 
realistic environments, helping to reduce 
the risk of injury. More information about 
SSE’s immersive training programme for 
safety can be found on page 76.

Operation: In December 2022, SSE 
Renewables, with partners Microsoft, 
Avanade and NatureScot, won the 
Scottish Green Energy Award for 
Innovation for the use of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) when monitoring species.

The AI technology consists of cameras 
that gathers footage and automatically 
detect and count the species being 
monitored which enables the collection 
of valuable and accurate data, ensuring 
the environment is protected.

It was initially tested to monitor puffin
colonies as part of planning conditions
for the Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm and
since the successful trial, it has been
used to monitor other species, including 
salmon, across SSE Renewables sites.

This project is part of an ongoing 
partnership between SSE, Microsoft and 
Avanade on a series of digital innovation 
projects which are developing solutions 
to improve understanding of the impacts 
wind farms have on surrounding 
ecosystems.

A transmission network critical to net zero
SSEN Transmission is enhancing investment plans to unlock the vast renewables potential in 
the north of Scotland, in response to accelerated national renewable energy targets. 

Powering a pathway to 2030
In July 2022, the National Grid Electricity 
System Operator (ESO) published Pathway 
to 2030 Holistic Network Design (HND). 
The report sets out the blueprint for 
the electricity transmission network 
infrastructure required to enable the 
forecast growth in renewable electricity 
across Great Britain, including the UK and 
Scottish Governments 2030 offshore wind 
targets of 50GW and 11GW, and confirms 
the need for significant investment in 
electricity transmission infrastructure in 
north of Scotland. 

In December 2022, Ofgem published 
its Accelerated Strategic Transmission 
Investment (ASTI) framework decision, which 
provided the regulatory framework under 
which those HND investments will be taken 
forward. Ofgem’s ASTI decision confirms 
that all SSEN Transmission projects identified 
by the Electricity System Operator are 
required to meet 2030 offshore wind targets 
will now be taken forward as part of the 
ASTI framework. The combination of inflight 
investments plus the eight ASTI projects are 
outlined in the map and represent estimated 
total project costs in excess of £11bn.
 

Investing in industry, innovation and infrastructure 

The abundance of renewable 
energy in the north of Scotland 
means every plausible pathway 
to net zero in the UK requires 
the transportation of very 
large quantities of green 
electricity from the north to the 
south.  This urgent imperative 
motivates the whole of the 
team in transmission not only 
to provide electricity to our 
customers reliably, but to 
develop the new projects in 
an orderly, efficient and open 
way too.” 

Rob McDonald
Managing Director, 
SSEN Transmission

Unlocking clean, secure energy for the 
Scottish islands
Scotland’s island groups are home to 
some of world’s greatest resources of 
renewable energy and SSEN Transmission 
has long supported the need to provide 
transmission connections to help unlock 
their abundant potential, whilst also 
importantly providing security of supply 
for island communities.

In March 2023, Ofgem announced 
that it provisionally approved much 
needed plans to provide a subsea 
electricity transmission link to Orkney. 

Subject to timely and positive planning 
decisions and the outcome of 
competitive tenders for delivery of these 
projects, SSEN Transmission is committed 
to 2030 delivery of these projects. In 
light of these developments, SSEN 
Transmission has upgraded its long-term 
Regulated Asset Value target, which is 
now expected to exceed £15bn by 2032. 

Financing future growth 
In November 2022, SSE announced it 
had reached an agreement to sell a 25% 
minority stake in SSEN Transmission to 
Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, 
for just under £1.5bn. The sale of a 
minority stake allows SSE as the majority 
shareholder to retain control in relation 
to operating and managing the business, 
with Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan 
Board proportionately represented on 
SSEN Transmission’s Board of Directors. 
This partnering approach has been 
successful in other areas of the business, 
including SSE Renewables, and helps to 
unlock finance for significant growth in 
both SSEN Transmission and across the 
wider SSE Group.

To help cover the future long-term 
funding requirements SSEN Transmission, 
has developed its first sustainability-linked 
revolving credit facility of £750m, signed 
in November 2022. See page 33 for more 
information. 

SSEN Transmission’s proposed solution 
would enable the connection of up to 
220MW of new renewable electricity and 
consists of a new substation at Finstown 
in Orkney, and around 57km of subsea 
cable, connecting to a new substation at 
Dounreay in Caithness.

Ofgem’s decision is the final piece in the 
jigsaw to connect all three of Scotland’s 
main island groups, following its approval 
of the Western Isles link in December 
2022 as part of the ASTI framework 
decision and work to connect Shetland, 
which is already well underway. 

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 53

Progressing strategic innovation projects
In August, SSEN Transmission welcomed the decision to progress 
all three of its projects submitted to the Discovery Round 2 stage 
of Ofgem’s Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF). 

The SIF is designed to drive the innovation needed to transform 
gas and electricity networks for a low-carbon future. The fund 
seeks to identify and fund ambitious, innovative projects which 
can help shape the future of the energy networks and accelerate 
the transition to net zero, at the lowest cost to consumers. SSEN 
Transmission has been successful in securing three projects 
which are aimed at tackling some of the energy industry’s biggest 
challenges.

Innovative Network Status Intelligence Gathered by Holistic 
use of Telemetry and Simulation (INSIGHT)

Providing strategic insight to help inform network design
Delivery of a virtual, real-time alert and control system that 
can monitor and mitigate different types of oscillation events 
experienced on the networks. Combining learnings from past 
events with new modelling and simulation techniques, it will 
better understand the nature of new oscillations, how to predict 

them and how to address them in network design and operation 
for future events.

Rapid Evaluation Area Connection Tool (REACT) 

Early identification of grid connection alternatives
Creation of a geographical planning tool to provide a dynamic 
view of all future connection requests. The tool will enable users 
to identify alternative grid connections, by using modelling data 
that assesses grid impact of a connection, combined with a 
spatial planning tool which will incorporate the current and future 
power and gas infrastructure.

De-risking the HVDC cable supply chain (SECURE)

Ensuring greater supply chain resilience 
Employment of cutting-edge digital solutions and develop an 
innovative Digital Supply Chain Hub (DSCH) to achieve greater 
visibility and knowledge of the High Voltage Direct Current 
(HVDC) cable supply chain, ensuring greater supply chain 
resilience and strategic insight.

Powering communities to net zero
The need to tackle climate change, combined with increasing digitalisation of society, 
requires a transformation in the way that local electricity networks operate, with new forms of 
generation and demand already connecting to SSEN Distribution’s network.

Accelerating investment in local 
networks for net zero 
The RIIO-ED2 price control period, which 
runs from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2028, 
is a vital foundation supporting the UK and 
Scottish Governments meet their ambitious 
legally binding climate targets. Electricity 
networks will need to grow and adapt to 
accommodate the uptake of low-carbon 
demand , such as heat pumps and EVs, 
at the same time as connecting locally 
low-carbon generation, such as solar.   

SSEN Distribution is already seeing a 
significant rise in the uptake of low-carbon 
technologies, particularly EV charge 
points, heat pumps, and battery storage. 
The business has seen a 75% increase in 
the number of registered electric vehicle 
charge points connected compared to last 
year. 

The new price control period will see the 
acceleration of SSEN Distribution’s capital 
investment programme across both 
its network areas, delivering significant 
improvements for customers and 
supporting the delivery of future smart grids. 

Plans to power communities to net zero
SSEN Distribution’s Business Plan targets 
significant improvements to reliability, 

resilience, and services for customers 
alongside acceleration of investment in 
local network infrastructure and flexible 
systems needed to power communities 
to net zero. It is a culmination of over two 
years’ of work, during which extensive 
engagement was undertaken with more 
than 25,000 stakeholders, to ensure that 
the plan was shaped by industry specialists 
and co-created with those who live in the 
communities SSEN Distribution serves. 
Framed around a sector-leading 
commitment to a 1.5oC science-based 
target pathway, the plan aims to deliver 
positive impact to society through 
supporting a just transition and driving 
local economic growth.

In November 2022, Ofgem published 
its Final Determination for the RIIO-ED2 
electricity distribution price control, which 
allows SSEN Distribution £3.6bn of baseline 
total expenditure for the five-year period 
against an initial business plan ask of £4bn. 
This reflects positive movement from the 
Draft Determination in June, with baseline 
allowances increasing by £300m. The 
Final Determination also includes potential 
additional investment opportunities for 
SSEN Distribution of up to £0.7bn over the 
period through uncertainty mechanisms 
and reopeners.

Key milestone reached in heat pump 
trial
In December 2022, a key milestone was 
reached in the Re-HEAT project, with the 
first combined heat pump and home heat 
battery storage system installed in a home 
near Inverness.

The Re-HEAT project is testing the benefits 
of zero-carbon heating for households 
and how Distribution Network Operators 
(DNOs) can manage the impact that heat 
pumps may have on grids. It is the first 
DNO-led (SP Energy Networks and SSEN 
Distribution) large-scale heat trial and will 
see 150 heat pumps installed in domestic 
homes across three local authority areas. 
Those heat pumps will be connected to 

Networks will unlock the 
electrification of the economy 
with billions of pounds 
in investment to create 
modernised and flexible local 
electricity grids fit for a net-
zero world. At SSEN, we are 
completely focused on building 
a smarter, more flexible and 
more resilient network during 
and beyond the next five years.”

Findings from Project Local 
Energy Oxfordshire (LEO)

Delivering better outcomes for customers 
through innovation collaboration 

In February 2022, the final report was 
published from Project Local Energy Oxfrord 
(LEO), one of the UK’s most ambitious, wide-
ranging and innovative energy trials. The £40m 
collaboration, in which SSEN Distribution was 
the lead partner, sought to demonstrate how 
the growth in small scale renewables, EVs, 
battery storage and demand side response 
can be supported by a local, flexible and 
responsive electricity grid.

Over the four years since its launch, this 
collaborative project has conducted multiple 
trials, issued numerous reports and gained 
vital insight into what a smart and flexible 
energy system of the future could look like. 
The project has also studied the infrastructure, 
markets and regulations that should be put in 
place to make this flexibility commercially and 
technically viable. 

The final report shares 13 key learnings from 
Project LEO with industry and policymakers, 
to help deliver the structures that will enable 
and support the transition to net zero. Key 
recommendations include:  

1. Local Area Energy Plans should be 
mandatory: convened by local authorities 
whose central role is supported by 
appropriate resourcing, and dedicated 
to a ‘whole systems’ approach that will 
adopt the best solutions for each area, 
informed by the priorities of the local 
community.

2. Aggregators, in the widest sense, are 
essential to develop flexibility markets: 
offering the skills and expertise that can 
open up participation in flexibility markets 
to whoever wishes to engage – this will 
be core to delivering a fair transition.

3. The regulatory framework must support 
investment: from network operators in 
electricity infrastructure, data and digital 
for the long term and in anticipation of 
new demand, to ensure net zero targets 
are reached.

While the final report signals the end of 
Project LEO, it is just the beginning of the 
development of a smarter and more flexible 
energy system, and each of key learnings from 
the final report will help shape the blueprint. 

In July 2022, SSEN Distribution and UK Power Networks (UKPN) 
announced their Collaboration Charter through which they 
have committed to sharing innovation solutions to deliver 
customer benefits, by ‘fast following’ each other’s innovative 
solutions. The network operators have agreed to: share learning 
and best practice; deliver a programme of innovation projects 
more efficiently; and, innovate in Business as Usual areas in the 
RIIO-ED2 price control period. 

The two DNOs have an established relationship that is already 

delivering benefits for customers by increasing efficiencies. 
For example, UKPN was the first to adopt Light Detection And 
Ranging technology (LiDAR) to provide digital visualisation of 
future tree growth which was then swiftly adopted by SSEN 
Distribution, to inform its tree cutting programme.

There will be many challenges faced by network operators as 
they undergo a significant structural change, and collaboration 
between local authorities and network operators will be 
essential in delivering net zero in the best way for customers.

Project LEO Final Report:
a digest of key learnings

thermal storage units, enabling customers 
to be more flexible in the times they use 
electricity for heating.

The project will test whether participating 
households can reduce their energy bills 

compared to LPG, oil or pure electric 
heating, for example by taking advantage 
of times when electricity prices are lower 
to charge their heat batteries. In the future, 
smart devices will allow households and 
businesses to benefit from flexing their 

energy use in response to a request, 
which will give them greater control over 
their energy bills whilst helping to balance 
supply and demand on the local electricity 
network.

Investing in industry, innovation and infrastructure 

A strategic role for flexible 
low-carbon thermal generation
The value of SSE’s flexible thermal generation – to both shareholders and society – was 
demonstrated clearly in 2022/23. The energy market circumstances of the past 12 months 
make an even stronger case for accelerated policy and investment in its lower-carbon 
alternatives. 

Developing decarbonised alternatives 
to the existing CCGT fleet will be vital to 
deliver SSE’s goal to cut carbon intensity 
by 80% by 2030 and achieve its science-
based carbon reduction targets, aligned 
with a 1.5oC pathway. 

CCS key to the transition from 
unabated to abated gas generation
The critical nature of flexible, back up 
generation in the GB electricity system 
was reinforced by a key report from the 
UK’s Climate Change Committee in March 
2023. The report recommends to the UK 
government that new low-carbon back-
up generation some continued use of 
fossil gas, made low-carbon through use 
of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is 
urgently required. 

SSE recognises this requirement 
and is actively developing options to 
progressively decarbonise its portfolio, 
particularly at its sites at Keadby in the 
Humber and Peterhead in the north east 
of Scotland. 

In December Keadby 3 Carbon Capture 
Power Station became the first power-
CCS project to secure planning consent 
in the UK. Alongside the contract awarded 
in June for the completion of FEED 
(Front End Engineering Design), this 
demonstrates the project’s advanced 
development. However, in March the UK 
Government announced the first carbon 
capture projects to be supported by 
government-backed contracts in Teesside 
and the northwest of England. As a 
Humber-based project, SSE’s flagship CCS 
project Keadby 3 has not yet progressed 
to the final stage of negotiations for a 
Dispatchable Power Agreement, the 
key mechanism that will support the 
commercial application of CCS in the UK. 

The UK Government has instead identified 

the Humber as a region to be supported 
through subsequent phases of its cluster 
sequencing process by 2030 at the latest. 
At the same time, the UK Government 
set out detail for the next tranche of 
potential CCS projects in the UK. Projects 
in Scotland were identified as a “minded-
to” next tranche of CO

2
 transport and 

storage system for deployment by 2030. 
Acorn would provide CO

2
 storage for 

Peterhead Carbon Capture Power Station. 
Peterhead Carbon Capture Power Station 
is continuing to develop with a planning 
application submitted in March 2022 and 
announcement of the award of a FEED 
contract in July. It remains well-placed to 
participate in future Dispatchable Power 
Agreement allocation processes. 

SSE remains confident that CCS will, 
in time, be built at both Keadby and 
Peterhead, both of which are essential for 
the UK to meet its net zero targets.

The essential role of hydrogen in a 
decarbonised power sector
The UK’s Climate Change Committee 
further reinforced the essential role for 
hydrogen power generation in a future 
decarbonised power sector in 2035. While 
the hydrogen value chain must develop 
and mature quickly, SSE has established 
a pipeline of potential option which it is 
pursuing through government support 
frameworks and mechanisms.

Key to this is Aldbrough Hydrogen 
Pathfinder, SSE Thermal’s hydrogen value 
chain proof-of-concept project, which was 
shortlisted to progress to a due diligence 
phase after submitting a bid for funding 
and Hydrogen Production Business Model 
support through the Net Zero Hydrogen 
Fund. Aldbrough Hydrogen Pathfinder 
seeks to unite hydrogen production, 
hydrogen storage and a 100% hydrogen-
fired open-cycle gas turbine (OCGT) on 

Our team is wholly focused 
on our mission to deliver the 
flexible energy needed now 
while powering the transition 
to net zero. The strong 
performance of the business 
in the last year has simply 
reinforced our longer-term 
ambition to decarbonise our 
portfolio of unabated power 
stations.”

one site by the middle of the 2020s. This 
project will enable and inform the scaling 
up of SSE’s, the wider Humber, and the 
UK’s hydrogen ambitions and help de-risk 
further hydrogen investment. 

SSE is continuing to develop options for 
hydrogen blending at its new unabated 
CCGT plant at Keadby 2, with pre-FEED 
activity under way. Option assessment 
and scoping activity for a further 100% 
hydrogen-fired CCGT at Keadby also 
continues. 

Securing supply and finding a 
low-carbon pathway in Ireland
In Ireland, SSE Thermal is advancing 
projects using sustainable biofuel as a 
lower carbon alternative to fossil fuels 
and as a bridge to hydrogen. In March it 
provisionally secured 10-year Capacity 
Market agreements for two new low-
carbon power stations to commence in 
2026/27 delivery year: 260MW at Tarbert 
and 140MW at Platin. The proposed low-
carbon units at Tarbert in Co. Kerry and 
Platin in Co. Meath would help to protect 
security of supply and provide flexible 
backup to Ireland’s growing renewables 
sector. The proposed units will initially 
run on Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), 
which is produced by processing waste 
oils to create a fossil-free alternative to 
diesel in accordance with EU sustainability 
standards. This would provide a bridge to a 
hydrogen future with both units having the 
potential to convert to the fuel. 

Low-carbon projects in Ireland are 
progressing alongside activity to deliver a 
Temporary Emergency Generation unit, 
at the request of the Irish authorities. 
Following legislation and a site selection 
process undertaken by EirGrid, approved 
by the Commission for the Regulation 
of Utilities, the Tarbert site was selected 
to host 150MW of generation capacity, 
to run on distillate oil. It will operate as 
an emergency plant with a maximum 49 
running time of 500 hours per annum. 
Under the Irish Government’s emergency 
generation legislation, this capacity is to 
cease operations as soon as the temporary 
electricity emergency has been addressed, 
and no later than March 2028. The unit 
would only be utilised when it is clear that 
market-sourced generation will not be 
sufficient to meet system needs.

Increasing carbon capture efficiency
In June 2022, the Flexibly Operated 
Capture Using Solvent Storage 
(FOCUSS) project was awarded grant 
funding from the Department for 
Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy 
(BEIS). The project is being led by SSE 
Thermal and supported by AECOM 
and the University of Sheffield, with the 
US-based National Carbon Capture 
Center (NCCC) also involved in the 
collaboration.

The primary objective of FOCUSS is 
to reduce CO

2
 emissions from carbon 

capture and allow consistent capture 
levels of between 95% and 99% to 
be achieved. Testing will take place at 
the University’s Translational Energy 

Research Centre, before scaled up 
testing at the NCCC, which involves 
advanced modelling techniques and 
pilot plant test campaigns. During its first 
year, the FOCUSS project has achieved 
significant milestones with numerous 
public engagement campaigns, 
solidifying its position as a frontrunner 
in the field of carbon capture and 
utilisation.

BEIS awarded the grant as part of its 
Carbon Capture Usage and Storage 
(CCUS) Innovation 2.0 competition, 
which aims to accelerate development 
of next-generation CCUS technology in 
the UK so that it can deploy at scale by 
2030.

INNOVATION IN ACTION



Committed to  
decent work and  
economic growth 

SSE’s investment plans, while directed at low-carbon infrastructure, will deliver significant 
economic benefits to the places in which it operates. SSE recognises that the value it creates 
must be shared widely and in a way that creates lasting, positive impacts for employees, 
consumers, communities, suppliers, and wider society. 

In the transition to net zero, SSE seeks to share the value created 
widely in a way that is fair and just, leaving no-one behind. 

Champion a fair and just energy transition
Be a global leader for the just transition to net zero, with a guarantee of 
fair work and commitment to paying fair tax and sharing economic value.

To ensure accountability to its stakeholders, SSE took steps to measure progress against 
the 20 principles of its Just Transition strategy and achieved the Fair Tax Foundation’s 
new Global Multinational Business Standard accreditation.

Over 2022/23, SSE continued to drive both action and accountability towards a just transition, publishing 
two new reports detailing its progress and thought leadership around the topic. SSE’s commitment to 
fair tax was reaffirmed as it became the first company to transition from the Fair Tax Foundation’s UK 
HQ Multinational accreditation to the Foundation’s new Global Multinational Business Standard. SSE 
implemented the annual increase in the real Living Wage, which was brought forward by two months 
in recognition of the cost-of-living crisis, and continued to work towards rolling out its Living Hours 
commitment across its supply chain.

Scotland’s Just Transition Commission members Richard Hardy from trade union 
Prospect, Lang Banks from WWF Scotland and Rachel McEwen from SSE. 

Powering a just transition 
SSE is working to ensure the benefits and costs of climate action are distributed in the fairest way 
possible for working people, consumers and communities.

A pioneering strategy for a just 
transition 
In November 2020, SSE published its 
Just Transition Strategy which set out 
20 principles to guide the company as 
it transitions into a net zero world, and 
out of a high-carbon world, ensuring 
that the decisions it takes are fair and 
that it maximises the opportunities for 
all. With the scale and scope of the 
transition impacting both economically 
and socially, SSE explicitly recognises 
there is a business case for fairness to 
be experienced and perceived by its 
employees, customers and the wider 
public. In 2022/23, a materiality review of 
SSE’s sustainability impacts, identified the 
pursuit of a just transition as being one of 
three opportunities for enhanced impact, 
further reinforcing the priority given to 
managing the social consequences of the 
Company’s transition to net zero.  

The 20 principles sit under five key 
themes: good green jobs; consumer 
fairness; building and operating new 
assets; looking after people in high-carbon 
jobs; and, supporting communities. The 
20 principles guide SSE in its decision 
making and approach to ensuring that the 
benefits arising from the transition to net 
zero are shared widely. Social impacts are 
considered an important interdependency 
within SSE’s Net Zero Transition Plan with 
its just transition principles integrated into 
its actions for net zero. 

Making the case through practical 
action 
Since the publication of its Just Transition 
Strategy in November 2020, SSE has 
sought to make the case for a just 
transition through practical action and 
transparency. It understands it has 
influence on the way the transition 
is implemented, however, there is a 
recognition that SSE cannot, on its own, 
deliver justice across the entire energy 
sector. It believes practical real-world 
action can be a powerful demonstrator 

of the benefits of pursuing just transition 
principles.
In 2022/23, SSE continued to engage 
extensively with stakeholders on the 
impacts of its activities to exit from high 
carbon activity; and its low-carbon 
developments. A short documentary was 
produced to engage stakeholders on just 
transition principles, and two reports were 
published to develop thought leadership 
and accountability. 

Measuring progress 
towards a just transition 
SSE recognises the importance of being 
open and transparent around its efforts 
in progressing towards net zero and 
that, in order to assess performance, it is 
important that actions can be measured 
and the Company is held to account. 
In April 2023, following collaborative 
engagement with stakeholders, including 
its trade union partners, and key interested 
investors SSE published the fourth in its 
series of just transition reports, which 
focused on measuring the progress that 
SSE has made against the 20 principles 

of its Just Transition Strategy. The report 
seeks to demonstrate the impact that 
the 20 principles have had across the 
business, and how they have influenced 
SSE’s decision making and approach in 
the period since they were published 
in November 2020. The report can be 
accessed at sse.com/sustainability/just-
transition.

Normalising a just transition
In April 2023, SSE held a multistakeholder 
event in London aimed at normalising the 
just transition within net zero transition 
plans and corporate climate discourse, 
seeking to enhance accountability and 
bring the just transition from concept 
to action. The event was attended by a 
range of stakeholders, including academia, 
investors and peers. The event aimed at 
establishing a sense of collaboration and 
openness around a just transition and 
demonstrating SSE’s stewardship of its 
own transition to net zero and highlighting 
the business benefits that come from 
establishing the world’s first business 
strategy for a just transition.

Just transition documentary
In March 2023, SSE launched a short 
documentary featuring voices of SSE 
employees with the lived experience 
of transitioning from high- to low-
carbon work, supplemented by the 
perspectives of the Prospect trade 
union and conservation organisation 
WWF, aimed to bring the notion of a just 
transition to life. The film explains that a 
just transition is about protecting workers and communities in the face of substantial 
industrial change and that people must be at the centre of efforts to tackle climate 
and nature crises. 

This documentary has been shared widely with stakeholders including trade unions, 
investors, and NGOs, and was also shown to over 1,660 employees. While it has 
been produced by SSE, the aim of the documentary is to inspire and provide a 
source of reference for stakeholders and other companies when understanding the 
importance of a just transition and what it means in the context of their sectors. The 
short documentary can be accessed at sse.com/sustainability/just-transition.

Sharing the benefits from net zero

Committed to decent work and economic growth

SSE is creating and sharing value with society by generating economic value, contributing to 
the public purse, and investing in local communities.

Contributing to GDP and supporting 
jobs
SSE is a major contributor to the UK and 
Irish economies and in 2022/23 it invested 
record amounts (£2.8bn in adjusted capital 
investment and expenditure) exceeding 
the profits it made over the same period. 
Under its revised Net Zero Acceleration 
Programme Plus, SSE has plans to invest 
£18bn in the five years to March 2027, 
equivalent to around £10m a day. This scale 
of investment carries with it a responsibility 
to ensure it is done in the right way, and the 
considerable value it generates is shared. 

To understand its wider socio-economic 
contribution, SSE has commissioned 
professional services firm PwC to measure 
the value it adds to GDP and the jobs it 
supports across its home markets for the 
last 12 financial years. Over 2022/23, SSE 
contributed £6.04bn to UK GDP, including 
£2.23bn in Scotland, and €429m to Irish 
GDP. This represented a slight increase 
compared to 2021/22 figures, which were 
£5.98bn, £2.08bn and €417m respectively 

(adjusted for current prices). This means 
that over the past 10 years, SSE has 
contributed around £94bn to UK and Irish 
economies (in current prices).

Jobs supported in these countries fell from 
47,130 in 2021/22 to 42,370 in 2022/23, 
due to a reduction in supply chain spend 
in Scotland as SSE’s Seagreen Offshore 
Wind Farm moved from construction to 
completion, with a corresponding decrease 
in procurement spend. SSE’s activities 
over 2022/23 supported 2.5 jobs for every 
person it directly employed. All of SSE’s 
economic contribution reports can be 
found at sse.com/sustainability.

Paying a fair share of tax
SSE considers the responsible payment of 
tax a core element of how it shares value 
with society. SSE is one of the UK’s biggest 
taxpayers, and in the 2022 PwC Total Tax 
Contribution survey published in November 
2022 was ranked 16th out of the 100 Group 
of Companies in 2022 in terms of the taxes 
it pays. 

Over 2022/23, SSE’s total tax contribution 
was £1.3bn, consisting of £549m taxes paid 
and £764m taxes collected. This compares 
to a total tax contribution of £0.9bn in 
2021/22, consisting of £375m taxes paid 
and £569m taxes collected. 

Of the taxes paid in 2022/23, £217m was in 
corporation tax, up from £70m the previous 
year as a result of the higher level of UK 
profits for the year. 

Further increases in taxes paid in 2022/23 
were contributed to by higher levels of 
Climate Change Levy (a tax charged on 
energy used by non-domestic customers 
to incentivise increased energy efficiency 
and carbon emissions reductions) being 
paid as a result of fewer outages at SSE’s 
gas-fired power stations compared with the 
previous year.

Further information on SSE’s tax position 
over 2022/23 can be found on pages 
93 and 237 to 239 of its Annual Report 
2023. 

Maintaining fair tax principles 
while expanding internationally
SSE was the first FTSE100 company to be Fair Tax accredited in 2014 and 
in 2022/23 it realised another milestone, becoming the first company to 
transition from the Fair Tax Foundation’s UK HQ Multinational accreditation 
to its new Global Multinational Business Standard. SSE remains a firm 
supporter of the Fair Tax Foundation and has welcomed its international 
focus and expansion believing that multinational corporations must 
pay regard and respect to the jurisdictions where economic activity is 
undertaken, and profits arise. 

SSE took this step to purposefully demonstrate its ongoing commitment to 
upholding the principles of fair tax as it expands internationally. SSE remains 
committed to the transparency of its tax affairs and publishes an annual 
Talking Tax report with enhanced country-by-country tax disclosures 
alongside detail of SSE’s tax strategy. SSE’s Talking Tax reports can be found 
on sse.com/sustainability.

Creating lasting, local value 
Investing in local communities
An integral part of a just transition is sharing 
value with local communities. SSE is one of 
the largest corporate grant givers in the UK 
and Ireland and, over 2022/23, it invested 
around £16.5m in communities across the 
UK and Ireland. 

The majority of SSE’s community giving 
comes from renewables business, 
which for over a decade has provided 
communities close to its assets with 
funding for local or regional projects. SSE 
Renewables currently operates 47 funds 
across the UK and Ireland, with an expected 

lifetime value of over £310m.

Over 2022/23, £10m was awarded 
through SSE Renewables’ community 
investment funds, up from £9.7m the 
previous year. This funding financed 
over 1,000 community projects which 
supported 136 local  jobs,  improvement 
to 286 community owned assets, 111 
scholarships and 167 community projects 
which enhance local net zero ambitions. 
£2.7m of this total investment was from 
SSE Renewables’ regional Sustainable 
Development Fund, which awarded 
its largest single award ever of £1m in 

November 2022, to support the Highland 
Energy Efficiency Programme to support 
households in extreme fuel poverty.
Detailed disclosure on SSE Renewables’ 
community funding can be found on 
sserenewables.com/communities. 

Around £1.4m was also awarded through 
SSEN Distribution’s Resilient Communities 
Fund, which prioritises projects which 
protect the welfare of vulnerable members 
of the community in SSEN’s network areas 
during significant emergency events.

Leaving a lasting legacy through  
the Beatrice Community Fund
The Beatrice Community Fund was the first offshore wind 
farm fund delivered by SSE Renewables and partners 
Red Rock Power Limited, the Renewables Infrastructure 
Group and Equitix. The £6m fund operated between 2017 
and 2023 and has supported 361 local projects including 
helping 73 rural jobs and enhancing 64 community assets. 
An evaluation of the fund highlighted that 91% of projects 
supported are still in operation in the local areas and 100% 
of respondents would recommend offshore funds to other 
communities. A key success of the fund has been the 
agility it responded to local priorities and issues including 

providing emergency funding during the coronavirus 
pandemic.

The fund has also safeguarded local assets such as the 
East Beach Bridge in Lossiemouth. In 2019 access to the 
local beach was closed for safety reasons and the Beatrice 
Community Fund provided emergency funding of £50,000 
to Lossiemouth Community Development Trust to start a 
£1.8m infrastructure project to restore access. The beach 
is estimated to contribute £1.5m to the local economy 
each year.

With the significant scale of investment 
required in its network in the north of 
Scotland, SSEN Transmission engages 
closely with all communities and 
stakeholders with an interest in its 
infrastructure developments. Some 
stakeholders have raised whether some 

A custodian of cultural heritage 
SSE has played an integral role in the history 
of energy in the UK, with its roots in the 
hydro-electric revolution of the 1940s and 
1950s in Scotland. It recognises the high 
cultural value its heritage has and employs 
an in-house heritage team which maintains 
SSE’s historical archives dating back to the 
early 1940s, ensuring important documents 
and artifacts are retained for historical record.

SSE’s commitment to cultural heritage is 
embedded as one of the 20 principles of 
its Just Transition Strategy, and in April 2023 
it promoted this principle through an art 
exhibition covering an important part of its 
cultural heritage at a multistakeholder just 
transition event (see page 61). 

form of community benefit funding might 
be an appropriate way to share in the 
value of these developments in addition 
to the other economic and employment 
opportunities they bring. SSEN Transmission 
will continue to engage with Ofgem and 
its stakeholders to consider the potential 

The art exhibition, titled “the Cloud Factory”, 
was the culmination of work over a 
couple of years, in which SSE’s Heritage 
team in conjunction with SSE Thermal 
supported the work of artists who had 
been documenting the decommissioning 
of SSE’s former Fiddler’s Ferry coal-fired 
power station in Warrington, England, 
which closed in 2020. Shaun Smyth and 
Lee Harrison were granted access to the 
site during the decommissioning process 
and, through Harrison’s photography and 
Smyth’s large-scale paintings, their aim 
was to convey the scale of the site and the 
significant impact Fiddlers Ferry has had to 
the region and the local communities and 
workers. 

for a legacy fund being created, particularly 
to support the next phase of its network 
expansion which is critical to powering 
change and meeting Scotland and the UK’s 
renewable energy targets.

Supporting good, green jobs
In a net zero world, all jobs will be green jobs. Through the transition, SSE seeks to develop its 
existing workforce simultaneously maintaining current skills whilst upskilling people for the future.

Guaranteeing fair work
SSE is firmly committed to creating a workplace that offers meaningful, long-term careers, 
with all employees treated with fairness and respect.

Respecting fundamental human rights
SSE has no tolerance of human rights 
abuse or modern slavery in its operations or 
supply chain and its efforts to prevent such 
abuses are centered on its Modern Slavery 
Action Plan. 2022/23 represented the final 
year of its three-year Plan and progress 
was made identifying and mitigating key 
risks, educating employees, ensuring 
robust due diligence, and collaborating 
with partners. SSE completed its fourth 
on-site assessment with modern slavery 
experts, Stronger Together and drew from 
their expertise in two targeted supply 
chain deep-dive assessments for projects 
operating in higher risk areas. A revised 
three-year Human Rights Strategy and 
Action Plan for the period 2023-26 has 
been developed. The strategy incorporates 
learnings from recent years, including on-
site assessments, deep-dive assessments, 
and gap analysis work carried out external 
specialist.  It also considers external 
benchmarks requirements, and the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights. For more detail on SSE’s Human 
Rights Strategy and 2023-2026 Action Plan 
see its 2023 Modern Slavery Statement 
which will be published in August 2023.

Employee cost-of-living pay increase
In recognition of the cost-of-living pressures affecting its employees, on 1 
October 2022 SSE brought forward part of its trade union negotiated cost 
of living increase for 2023, by awarding up to a 5% increase to all employees 
earning less than £100,000 annually.

Depending on their salary, employees received either a 5% or3%, increase. 
Those on lower salaries received a higher percentage increase, so that the 
structure of the pay award prioritised helping those who are most affected by 
the rise in living costs. 

This decision allowed SSE to support colleagues managing cost-of-living 
challenges earlier than the planned cost-of-living pay reviews which are applied 
in April each year. 

ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 67

Investing in a workforce for net zero
With a decarbonised power sector by 2035 a stated ambition of governments, SSE’s focus is 
on delivery. The availability of a skilled workforce is now a core feature of that challenge to 
deliver the magnitude of infrastructure investment needed. 

The right skills at the right time
The scale and speed of SSE’s investment 
programme requires many skilled people 
to implement it. Without planning ahead 
of time, there is a potential risk of skills 
shortages. This is true for SSE and the 
energy industry as a whole. The 2022 
materiality assessment of SSE’s social 
and environmental impacts identified, 
for the first time, skills as a highly material 
sustainability issue to be managed.

While workforce planning is a permanent 
management feature at SSE, in 2022/23 a 
deliberate review was undertaken to identify 
the specific skills and job roles required in 
the medium and long term to deliver large 
capital projects and support the ongoing 
operations and digitalisation of business 
activity. As a result of this work a paper on 
key skills will be presented to the Group 
Executive Committee twice yearly. While 
there is need for significant employee 
growth in SSE, it is also recognised that 
career development opportunities arise 
for SSE’s existing workforce too. To ensure 
this, SSE has developed a three-pronged 
approach which involves developing the 
existing workforce, building a pipeline of 
talent, and shaping the future workforce. 

Creating jobs for net zero
Within SSE, at least 1,000 new jobs are 
expected to be created every year to 2025 
with the potential for many thousands 
more in the years to 2032. Opportunities 
will be created across a range of roles, 
which will mean developing existing skills 
at the same time as creating new skill 
sets as technology changes. To fill these 
roles, SSE’s recruitment strategy seeks 
to bring new talent into the organisation 
immediately, at the same time as 
developing a longer-term pipeline to meet 
the skills needs of the future.

Total external recruitment in 2022/23

(2021/22: 2,290)

3,226

At 31 March 2023, SSE’s headcount was 
12,180, up from 10,754 at 31 March 2022. 
This includes 100 employees in locations 
outside the UK and Ireland. To fill both 
new roles and vacancies, the total number 
of people recruited rose from 2,290 in 
2021/22, to 3,226 in 2022/23. Furthermore, 
and in support of developing careers, 1,175 
internal candidates changed roles across 
SSE in 2022/23, an increase of 30% from 
2021/22.

While SSE expects to make a direct impact 
by employing many more people in its 
businesses through its growth plans, the 
scale of each of its development projects is 
expected to make wider impacts on local 

economies. For example, Dogger Bank 
Wind Farm, in construction, has already 
created or supported 1,250 UK jobs through 
its development. Many of these roles are 
in Yorkshire and associated with onshore 
construction works and around Port of 
Tyne from where the wind farm will be 
operated. Berwick Bank Wind Farm, at an 
earlier stage development, has the potential 
to create around 4,650 direct, indirect and 
induced jobs in Scotland, and 9,300 in 
the UK. Keadby 3, SSE’s potential carbon 
capture plant could support around 250 
local jobs, 320 jobs for the wider region of 
Yorkshire, the Humber, and East Midlands, 
and 560 national UK jobs on an annual 
basis over the station’s operational lifetime.

A 
workforce 
delivering 
net zero

A framework for fair and decent work
SSE has a well-established framework 
for guaranteeing fair and decent work, 
which is focused on developing its existing 
workforce as well as investing in the future 
skills needed to deliver net zero. It does 
this whilst ensuring it creates a workplace 
which is inclusive for all. This framework 
is underpinned by fundamental principles 
defined by the International Labour 
Organisation (ILO) and the 10 principles of 
the UN Global Compact. 

Paying a fair wage
Fair remuneration is a cornerstone of 
responsible employment and providing 
good jobs. SSE is actively involved in the 
living wage movement. Having been a real 
Living Wage accredited employer in the UK 
since 2013, it has also paid the Living Wage 
in Ireland since 2016 and continues to chair 
the Living Wage Scotland’s Leadership 
Group. 

In September 2022, in response to the 
cost-of-living crisis, the Living Wage 
Foundation announced the new real Living 
Wage for the UK two months earlier than 
usual. This saw a 10.1% increase from the 
2021 UK rate. SSE welcomed the action 
taken by the Living Wage Foundation and 
implemented the increase from 1 October 
2022, therefore implementing the pay rise 
six months earlier than normal.

In recognition that the amount of pay 
employees take home can be affected 
by irregular and unpredictable hours, SSE 
became one of the first companies in the 
UK to become a Living Hours accredited 
employer in 2021. Living Hours employers 
must provide guarantees around working 
hours, including a minimum 16-hour a 
week contract and greater notice of shift 
patterns. Over 2022/23, SSE continued 
to roll the Living Hours out throughout its 
supply chain.



Committed to decent work and economic growth

68 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

The challenge of delivering a decarbonised power system 
over the next decade is one for the whole energy sector 
to meet. That requires an economy-level approach to the 
development of a workforce that is ready to exploit the arising 
job opportunities in energy. To support policy makers, SSE is 
proposing a suite of skills policy interventions that will help it, 
and the rest of the sector, to access the talent it requires.
• Create green energy training academies based on a 

collaborative public/private partnership model, that 
supports the development of core technical skills key to the 
growth of the energy sector. 

• Establish high quality conversion programmes at scale, 
to support working people in high-carbon industries to 
transition into low-carbon industries, particularly for roles 
with projected skills shortages, supporting an economy-
wide just transition.

• Provide funding for universities and colleges to increase 
employer partnership offerings in areas of high specialisms 
essential for net zero, such as HVDC and large capital 

project management.
• Invest, at scale, in the STEM curriculum encouraging 

children of all ages to gain an early understanding of the 
importance of careers in STEM.

• Modernise trainee and apprentice funding establishing 
greater flexibility in delivery models so the programmes 
provide incentives for the creation of sustainable, 
economically active jobs.

• Encourage upskilling of existing employees by extending 
funding support which also covers supply chain workers 
to meet projected skill shortages, as well as providing 
cost recovery incentives for upskilled trainees entering 
sustainable employment.

• Simplify work visa processes for areas of key skill 
shortages. 

• Encourage innovation around inclusion and social 
mobility by supporting programmes that aim to make 
green jobs available to the widest possible audience.

Advocating for a national approach to energy skills development

Developing the existing workforce
Growing skills and talent
Development and training is especially 
important to both address skills gaps 
and provide the opportunity for existing 
employees to develop their careers in 
SSE. A skills gap analysis in 2022/23 led 
to targeted investment in a series of 
specific skills, from upskilling existing 
electrical jointers, to developing new 
roles in system planning to support smart 

grids. Simultaneously, SSE is working to 
understand the skills required for new 
technologies of the future, for jobs that may 
not exist today, but which may be required 
to be implemented at pace to deliver net 
zero.

SSE has a well-established programme 
of learning and training for employees, 
recognising that continuous development 
is an important part of a fulfilling career. 
Over 2022/23 SSE invested £10.4m in 
learning, training, and development, 
representing nearly a 40% increase from 
investment the previous year. 

In addition, the average number of training 
hours per full-time equivalent employee 
was 19.8, a slight decrease from 20.7 
the previous year. In 2022/23, 85.5% of 
SSE’s employees received some form of 
development over the year. 

Developing leaders
SSE continues to take a comprehensive 
approach to developing leaders across the 
organisation to drive future success. This 

includes a range of initiatives that deliver 
feedback and measure performance, 
provide training and development 
opportunities, and encourage collaboration 
such as 360-degree feedback, personality 
assessments, performance metrics, and 
one-on-one coaching sessions. 

The objective is to create a future 
leadership population that does the right 
thing, discovers future value, builds an 
inclusive team, reads the energy contest 
and gets it done brilliantly. This defined 
Leadership Blueprint is reinforced through 
a series of interventions, not least a Speaker 
Series in 2022/23 to challenge leaders to 
develop their leadership skills.

Attracting diversity into SSE 
SSE focuses on improving recruitment 
practices to ensure a more diverse range of 
people are aware of SSE’s opportunities and 
can join its workforce. SSE has continued 
with the process changes implemented 
over 2021/22, which included adjusting job 
adverts to ensure the language is inclusive 
and including ‘happy to talk flexible 
working’ on all job adverts. SSE has also 
revisited the format of job adverts to keep 
the essential requirements to five key asks, 
remove unnecessary jargon, and provide 
contact details on adverts to support with 
candidate questions. SSE continued its 
focus on essential skills and strength-based 
recruitment, swapping technical skills for 
transferable skills where possible, and 
continued its relationships with specialist 
recruitment platforms to help reach people 
with a wide range of backgrounds, skills, 
and requirements.

SSE has been working with hiring managers 
to develop the skills required for diverse 
recruitment via hiring manager toolkits, 
building inclusive nudges into job profile 
templates to allow them to implement 
training in their day-to-day roles, and 
tracking the inclusive hiring processes that 
are driving change at a senior level. Over 
2022/23, SSE has recently launched the 
Women in Power campaign which features 
several senior SSE women sharing their 
stories on how they came to SSE and what 
it is like to work here.

Investing in early careers 
Core to SSE’s strategy to build its future 
workforce is consistent investment in 
its pipeline programmes. These pipeline 
programmes include apprenticeships, 
technical skills trainee programmes and 
graduate programmes. 

Over 2022/23, investment in pipeline 
programmes increased significantly to 

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 69

Building a pipeline of talent

£12.8 m from £9.8m in 2021/22. The 
number of people on SSE’s pipeline 
programmes (apprenticeships, technical 
skills trainee programmes, graduate 
programmes, conversion programmes and 
other pipeline programmes) has increased 
to 564 individuals in 2022/23 (2021/22: 
470 individuals). Continual focus on 
recruiting from a more diverse talent pool 
for pipeline programmes also increased the 
proportion of women across all of these 
programmes, overall increasing to 21.5% 
over 2022/23 from 19% over 2021/22. 
For more information on SSE’s approach 
to increasing diversity in its workforce 
see page 73 and see its Inclusion and 
Diversity Report 2023, available at sse.com/
sustainability.

Apprenticeships: 
SSE offers apprenticeships across the UK 
and Ireland which provide opportunities to 
develop skills within a variety of technical 
and business roles. SSE has removed 
minimum academic requirements for 
entry, instead seeking to attract individuals 
who can demonstrate key characteristics, 
which have been identified as enabling the 
employee to deliver the role. 

Apprenticeships support SSE’s critical skills 
pipeline for the future and include areas 
such as Power Distribution, Electrical and 
Mechanical Engineering, Data Science, 
Procurement, Finance, Laboratory 
Technician, and Electrical Power Network 
Engineering. Five new programmes 
launched over 2022/23 including 
apprenticeships in Trainee Construction Site 
Engineering and Occupational Health and 
Safety. 

While there is still a long way to go to have 
gender balance in SSE’s apprenticeship 
programme, the proportion of women 
has continued to increase with this year 
reaching 14%, up from 11% in 2021/22.

Trainee Engineers: 
SSE’s trainee engineering programme 
provides the opportunity to undertake 
work-based learning whilst studying 
towards HNC or HND level qualifications 
in Electrical Engineering and Energy and 
Environmental Engineering. Trainees 
undertake work placements to put 
their education into practice and gain 
practical, hands-on experience. While the 
proportion of women participating in the 
trainee engineering programme had been 
increasing in recent years, in 2022/23 
there was a disappointing fall from 21% 
in 2021/22 to 14.5% between in 2022/23. 
This further reinforces the importance of 
early intervention within schools to ensure 
such programmes are attractive to young 
women as a serious career pathway. 

Graduates: 
SSE’s graduate programme attracts, 
develops, and retains a pipeline of talent 
who are committed to deliver net zero 
solutions. The two-year programmes are 
delivered in all seven of SSE’s Business 
Units and graduates have the opportunity 
to work in areas including Engineering, 
Commercial, IT, HR, Business, Finance, 
and Project Management. The graduates 
gain practical hands-on experience, while 
building a valuable network and developing 
essential skills that support career 
advancement. The graduate engineering 
programmes have an additional benefit 
of achieving professional accreditation 
including chartership. Representation of 
women on SSE’s graduate programmes 
increased to 37% in 2022/23 compared 
with 23% in 2021/22.

Employability programmes: 
SSE’s employability programmes encourage 
social mobility and are designed to recruit 
talent from communities and social 
demographics that may not have otherwise 
applied to work in the energy sector. The 
programmes include Barnardo’s Works, SSE 
Works (in Ireland), and Career Ready.

Apprenticeships in Scotland and 11 in 
England.

Shaping the future 
workforce

Engaging the next generation in STEM
Attracting more young people into STEM 
(Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths) 
careers is essential for the energy industry 
to be able to meet its net zero ambitions. 
SSE’s STEM strategy is based around 
Tomorrow’s Engineers STEM Code to 
ensure its future workforce, supply chain, 
and communities are inspired to take up 
the opportunities in the energy sector. 

To support applicants into its range of 
pipeline programmes, SSE works to inspire 
young people into STEM careers through 
strategic partnerships with secondary and 
primary schools. Subject matter experts and 
education partners have built curriculum-
aligned STEM sessions to provide young 
people with an inspiring insight into the 
energy sector, the variety of roles, and 
real-life work tasks. Subjects include digital 
AI, data, electric vehicles, extending supply, 
sustainability, and wind turbines. These 
STEM education materials are published on 
SSE’s website to support teachers, parents, 
and pupils to access this content for free.

SSE undertook 319 recorded STEM 
interventions over 2022/23 up from 159 

in 2021/22, resulting in 5,148 student 
interactions. To support the delivery of 
the STEM programme, SSE has a STEM 
volunteer community made up of 
employees across the business. In 2022/23, 
the number of volunteers increased to 581, 
compared to 365 in 2021/22.

Embracing the digital energy system of 
the future
Digital and technology advancements are 

poised to transform the energy sector in 
the UK, bringing about significant changes 
and unlocking numerous opportunities. 
From smart grids, energy storage, and 
energy efficiency to decentralised energy 
generation and energy trading, technology 
will significantly impact the essential skills of 
the energy sectors workforce. 

As SSE strives to become a data driven 
organisation it is essential all employees 
understand data and are equipped with 
the skills to work with data effectively. 
Therefore as part of SSE’s Corporate 
Digital Programme to ensure everyone 
has the right knowledge, skills, and tools 
to embrace digital technology, from 
broad digital knowledge to tool-specific 
technical training, a digital skills framework 
is being designed with six critical pillars: 
Digital Confidence and Productivity; 
Digital Communication and Collaboration; 
Handling Data Information and Content; 
Digital Ways of Working; Digital Creation, 
Problem Solving and Innovation; and 
Being Safe and Legal Online. In addition, 
learning pathways are being built and a gap 
assessment is being undertaken to identify 
resources required. 

Providing local jobs through 
apprenticeships for net zero
SSE’s apprenticeships play an important 
role in attracting people into the 
Company at the beginning of their 
careers, but they can also be a valuable 
way to create local employment 
opportunities in rural areas. 

SSE’s 443MW Viking Onshore Wind 
Farm on Shetland, will be the UK’s 
largest wind farm in the UK when 
complete, in terms of annual output, 
and will help contribute towards the UK 
and Scotland’s net zero targets. 

With the Shetland Islands having an 
important role in the history of oil and 
gas exploration in Scotland, Viking 
Onshore Wind Farm will support the 
transition of Shetland’s economy away 
from fossil fuels, giving young people an 

alternative, low-carbon career path to 
take. In 2022, four young people from 
Shetland took part in an apprenticeship 
scheme giving them an opportunity 
to build a career while staying in the 
communities they come from. 

The apprentices are currently studying 
for one year at University of the 
Highlands and Islands (UHI) in Inverness 
as part of their training to become four 
of the first wind turbine technicians 
working at the Viking Onshore Wind 
Farm, when it enters operation in 2025. 
When the year ends, the apprentices will 
commence a three-year training course 
with Vestas, which has a 30-year service 
and maintenance contract for the 
project, to give them the skills to help 
maintain the turbines.

Supporting the next 
generation in STEM  
In partnership with the Edinburgh Science Foundation, an educational charity 
supporting STEM education in Scotland, SSE, through its customer businesses, is 
supporting their Generation Science initiative. Generation Science provides unique 
science experiences to schools in Scotland which, since Covid, has remotely 
delivered pre-recorded workshops and science kits to schools, with a plan to return 
to supporting teachers to deliver face to face lessons in 2023. SSE sponsored 
10 packages of support in August 2022 for the start of the academic year. This 
partnership aims to ignite interest in the areas of STEM for the next generation of 
potential colleagues who will take up roles supporting the drive to net zero.

PARTNERING IN ACTION

CASE STUDY

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 71

Building an inclusive workforce
The innovative solutions required to deliver net zero need a workforce with diverse perspectives, 
different experiences and new skills. 

A strategy to drive inclusion 
SSE’s Inclusion and Diversity Strategy, 
launched in 2021, builds on the inclusion 
and diversity initiatives that SSE has been 
undertaking since 2014. It is framed on 
four pillars: Ambition; Education and 
Development; Inclusive Processes; and 
Employee Voice.

The strategy addresses inclusion and 
diversity at all levels of the business, as well 
as considering the wider sector and societal 
impacts. It aims to drive change at the most 
senior levels, ensure everyone is included 
by listening to diverse employee voices, and 
seeks to welcome all into SSE. 

Increasing transparency around 
inclusion and diversity 
Because of the strategic significance 
of building a modern, inclusive and 
diverse workforce, and in addition to 
key disclosures in its Annual Report and 
Sustainability Report, in June 2023 SSE 
published its second Inclusion and Diversity 
Report, which provides comprehensive 
information around SSE’s Inclusion and 
Diversity Strategy and the progress against 
it. This enhanced transparency ensures that 
SSE is accountable to its stakeholders on its 
actions and performance.

For further information around SSE’s 
approach to inclusion and diversity over 
2022/23, the actions it is taking to drive 
improvements and plans for the coming 
years, see SSE’s Inclusion and Diversity 

Report 2023, available at sse.com/
sustainability. 

Driving inclusion 
across all levels

Progressing gender balance in senior 
leadership 
SSE has set gender ambitions for senior 
leaders in line with the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review. These targets, and 
performance against them, are outlined 
in the table above. 

Over 2022/23, SSE made progress in 
increasing representation of women 
amongst the Group Executive Committee 
and its direct reports, as well as in its 
leadership group. Female representation 
on the Board is currently 42%, following 
changes to the Board which took effect 
post 31 March 2023, which remains 
above the 40% Board Policy target. Full 
details of changes across membership 
and Nomination Committee focus are set 
out on pages 115 and 142 to 149 of SSE’s 
Annual Report 2023.

Developing more inclusive leaders
SSE’s leadership programmes are designed 
to build leadership confidence and raise 
awareness to drive an inclusive workplace 
from the top: 

• SSE’s Igniting Inclusion Programme 
supports managing directors and 
business unit executive committees to 
learn about three key diversity inclusion 

topics: the Neuroscience of inclusion 
and diversity, Growth Mindset, and 
Psychological Safety. See SSE’s 2023 
Inclusion and Diversity Report for more 
details. 

• SSE’s Leadership Blueprint  
captures the essence of SSE’s 
leadership culture, its strong values, 
and the behaviours required 
to innovate and solve business 
challenges. It is used during 
recruitment, in leadership and 
management development, and in 
performance reviews. Over 2022/23, 
inclusivity was embedded throughout 
the Blueprint ensuring that leaders 
build proud and inclusive teams. 

Ensuring everyone is included
SSE has a range of initiatives to drive 
diversity throughout its company at all 
levels seeking to listen to its employees 
and understand the lived experience of its 
culture of inclusion. This is instructive to 
know what more can be done to improve 
that experience for everyone. One way SSE 
does this is through its Belonging in SSE 
communities. Over 2,000 employees have 
joined a community, including Working 
Families, LGBTQIA+, menopause, Armed 
Forces, ethnicity and culture, disability, 
neurodiversity, and chronic health, health 
and wellbeing, and gender balance. See 
SSE’s Inclusion and Diversity report 2023 for 
detailed information on the Belonging in 
SSE communities and their action plans to 
drive improvement.

Measuring and 
understanding progress 

UK gender pay gap performance
Between 2021/22 and 2022/23, SSE saw 
a positive trend in its headline UK gender 
pay gap statistics. SSE’s gender pay gap 
reduced from 18.0% at 5 April 2022 to 15.3% 
at 5 April 2023. SSE’s mean and meadian 
UK gender pay gap performance over 
the last five years, can be seen in Figure 2, 
showing a continuous positive trend over 
this period. While SSE’s mean gender pay 
gap performance is more favourable than 
the median, SSE believes that the median 
data is a more accurate reflection of SSE’s 
UK gender pay gap. 

The reduction in SSE’s UK median gender 
pay gap between 2021/22 and 2022/23 
has been driven by three main contributing 
factors: 

• Interim cost-of-living pay increase: 
SSE brought forward part of its trade 
union negotiated cost of living increase 
for 2023 (full details can be found 
on page 66), the structure of which 
prioritised those on lower salaries. 
At SSE, representation of women is 
highest in the lower and lower-middle 
pay quartiles, resulting in a higher 
percentage of women receiving 
a 5% pay award. However, the full 
impact of the 2022/23 pay award on 
SSE’s gender pay gap will not be fully 
understood until the second part of 
the award is made for full-year in the 
first quarter of 2023/24 (backdated to 1 
April 2023). 

• Salary uplift for employees on 
Joint Agreement contracts: SSE 
introduced a new skill-based Pay 
Progression model in 2021, which 
saw employees’ salaries being 
mapped according to their skill-level. 
This resulted in many employees 
receiving salary uplifts, mainly those 
in the lower pay quartile. As SSE 
has higher female representation 
in this quartile, this meant a high 
number of women received a pay 
increase. Over 2022/23, the positive 
impact of this new pay model on the 
gender pay gap has continued with 
a slightly higher proportion of female 
employees progressing through the 
pay progression framework. 

• Increasing representation of women 
in high-paid roles: Over 2022/23, 
SSE saw an increase in women 
represented in high-paid roles, classed 
as those earning over £100,000 per 
year, which exceeded the increase of 
men represented in these roles over 
the same period.  

Between 2022 and 2023, there was also 
improvement in its UK bonus gender 
pay gap reducing from 17.6% at 5 April 
2022 to 14.7% at 5 April 2023. SSE’s bonus 
applies to a sub-set of employees and 
by its nature will fluctuate year on-year 
subject to corporate, business, and 
personal performance. An annual incentive 
accounts for around 60% of the total value 
of the bonus. A smaller and more senior 
population also participate SSE’s longer 
term share arrangements which account 

for a further 25% of the overall value.

More detail on SSE’s UK gender pay gap, 
including further statistics, disclosure of the 
wide range of actions taken to reduce the 
pay gap, and a full breakdown of its data 
by legal entity is provided in SSE’s Inclusion 
and Diversity Report 2023, available at sse.

SSE’s Irish gender pay gap 
SSE has voluntarily disclosed its Ireland 
Gender Pay Gap since 2021, calculating 
it in line with the UK Gender Pay Gap 
methodology, based on a snapshot date 
of 5 April. In December 2022, SSE 
disclosed its first set of Ireland gender 
pay gap data in line with the Irish 
Government’s new mandatory gender pay 
gap requirements which launched in May 
2022. This data is calculated using a 30

sse.com/sustainability.

Understanding the diversity of SSE’s 
workforce
Gaining deeper insight into the diversity 
of SSE’s workforce requires the voluntary 
disclosure of diversity information including 
ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disabilities. 
This data is collected anonymously and as 
of 31 March 2023, SSE had an employee 
disclosure rate of 39% of the total employee 
population. Increasing employees’ voluntary 
disclosure of their diversity data, even if 

they select ‘prefer not to say’, is essential 
for SSE to set develop strategies, establish 
ambitions and gain learnings that will 
increase its workforce diversity. 

Further detailed breakdown of SSE’s 
workforce diversity data can be found in 
its Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023, 
available at sse.com/sustainability.

*Data is collected on SSE’s HR data reporting system. Disability, Ethnic Minority, and LGBTQIA+ data is voluntarily 
disclosed by employees, with a 39% disclosure rate at 31 March 2023 and a 32% disclosure rate at 31 March 2022. 
Data excludes those without the facility to share information on the HR data reporting system.

Increasing transparency 
to drive improvement
For a company to improve the diversity of its workforce it needs 
to have a clear understanding of the composition of its current 
workforce. This provides the evidence base on which strategies 
are constructed, ambitions are set and progress is tracked. 

The right to privacy is important and, as a result, this wider 
diversity data is disclosed by employees on a voluntary basis. SSE 
is working to encourage more employees to disclose their data, 
so that it can improve external disclosure as it becomes feasible 
to do so. 

In March 2023, SSE launched its revised mandatory inclusion 
and diversity e-learning training. All employees are required to 
complete this training annually, alongside essential subjects such 
as anti-fraud, financial crime, and cyber security. Aligning with 
SSE’s Igniting Inclusion programme, the training covers allyship, 
privilege, and microaggressions, providing learners with the skills 
and confidence to become supportive colleagues, increase 
diversity, and comply with legal requirements. 

As part of this course, SSE has also introduced the functionality 
to capture voluntary diversity data from employees. Employees 
are encouraged to voluntarily submit their data or select ‘prefer 
not to say’, providing the opportunity to submit feedback on the 
rationale behind their choice. This approach keeps disclosure 
voluntary whilst ensuring all employees are aware of how to 
disclose their data. It aims to better understand why people 
may not be sharing data at present, so SSE can work to create 
a culture where everyone feels comfortable disclosing their 
diversity data.

Committed to decent work and economic growth

74 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

Valuing employee voice
Actively listening to and incorporating the employee voice, to respond to employee needs, is 
recognised by SSE as an important part of decision-making and strategy.

SSE’s all-employee survey
Every year, SSE gives employees the 
opportunity to share their views on a range 
of topics through an all-employee survey. 
An in-depth survey is carried out every two 
years and a shorter ‘pulse’ survey takes 
place on alternate years. 79% of employees 
provided feedback in the 2022 pulse survey 
which resulted in a Sustainable Engagement 
Score of 84% - up from 82% last year. 
Two questions in the survey focus on 
SSE’s strategy to support net zero. 93% of 
employees said they are committed to SSE’s 
vision to be a leading energy company in a 
net zero world and 73% said they know how 
they can contribute to SSE’s transition to net 
zero. 

The survey also includes questions on work 
life balance, recognising the importance of 
measuring the impact of work on quality of 
life. In 2022, 85% of employees said that they 
were able to balance work and personal 
commitments while 94% said that they were 
able to work well with team members who 
work differently to them. 

A range of other questions from the survey 
are references throughout this report where 
relevant.

Reviewing the employee value 
proposition
In a tight labour market with strong 
competition for energy-related skills, SSE 
seeks to be an employer of choice. In 
2022/23, SSE reviewed its employee value 
proposition to ensure a fair and competitive 
offering across all employee benefits. Key 
areas of focus were identified through 
analysis of feedback received in the 2022 
all-employee survey, through external 
benchmarking exercises, and engagement 
with Trade Union partners through the 
SSE Policy Review Group. The review led 
to improvements in a number of areas, 
including wellbeing services (see page 76) 
and SSE’s family leave offering (see case 
study on this page). 

New Non-Executive director for 
employee engagement 
To ensure Board-level direct engagement 
with employees, an appointed non-
executive director of the Board has 

responsibility for engagement. As reported 
previously and in line with succession plans, 
Dame Sue Bruce stepped down from the 
role of Non-Executive Director for Employee 
Engagement in early 2023. Lady Elish 
Angiolini assumed the position from 1 April 
2023, bringing rich experience in assimilating 
and interpreting views and translating 
findings into a required course of action. 

Working with employee representatives
Everyone in SSE has the fundamental 
right to freedom of association and to join 
a trade union. SSE has four recognised 
trade union partners (Unite, Prospect, 
Unison and GMB).  The Company has 
an established an effective network of 
employee representation forums, with the 
principal forum being the Joint Negotiation 
and Consultation Committee, and various 
sub forums with delegated responsibility, 
including the Joint Business Committees in 
each business area, the Joint Health, Safety 
and Environment Committee, the Policy 
Review Group and the Pay Sub Group. 

For employees who are not covered by 

SSE’s collective bargaining agreements, 
elected employee representatives are in 
place and an informal engagement group, 
the PC Forum, also meets regularly with 
representatives from the Trade Unions 
to discuss any matters concerning their 
Personal Contract members. 

Through the Joint Negotiating and 
Consultative Committee, local Joint 
Business Councils Committee’s and 
focused working groups such as the 
Policy Review Group and the Health Safety 
and Environment Committee, employee 
representatives have the opportunity to 
influence decision making and strategy. Over 
2022/23, examples of decisions influenced 
by this engagement included: SSE’s new 
family leave policies launched in 2022, 
which were developed in collaboration with 
Trade Union partners through the Policy 
Review Group, the implementation of a 
jointly designed skills-based pay progression 
model, and establishment of a joint review 
group to ensure that the new skills based pay 
progression system is operating as intended. 

Enhancing family leave 
to offer additional support
Core to SSE’s enhanced employee value 
proposition is the improvement of its family 
leave offering. Complementing SSE’s existing 
package to new parents the new family 
policy includes: an additional seven weeks’ 
paid leave for partners of parents who take 
maternity or adoption leave; two weeks’ 
leave at full pay for employees who suffer a 
pregnancy loss, including partners; up to 2 
weeks’ leave at full pay for those undertaking 
fertility treatment. 

While previous enhancements to family 
policies focused on additional paid leave for primary carers, the enhancements 
made over 2022/23 aimed to ensure that all new and prospective parents at SSE feel 
supported, regardless of personal or family circumstances and where they are on the 
journey to becoming a parent. Full details of SSE’s family leave offering can be found 
in its Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023.

ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION

The safety of everyone

Setting a strong safety culture
Everyone at SSE operates to the license 
“If it’s not safe, we don’t do it”. SSE’s safety 
strategy is focused on two goals: 
• We have no life changing incidents 

or major safety, health and 
environment incidents; and, 

• We are healthy and happy at work. 

These goals are reinforced by SSE’s Safety 
Family which sets the tone of its safety 
culture.

SSE has a well-established governance 
framework which underpins its top 
priority: the safety of everyone who works 
for and encounters the Company. SSE’s 
safety management system is certified to 
the internationally recognised standard 
ISO 45001 Occupational Health and 
Safety Management (certificate available 
on sse.com/sustainability).

A challenging year of performance
SSE measures overall safety performance 
using the Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) 
for employees and contractors. The 

rate for 2022/23 for employees and 
contractors combined was 0.19 per 
100,000 hours worked, an increase 
from 0.17 the previous year. This safety 
performance is in the context of the 
tragic fatality of one of SSE’s contractor’s 
employees, Liam Macdonald.

Compared to the year before, 2022/23 
saw a significant increase in construction 
associated with SSE’s record year of 
investment, which was a contributing 
factor to the rise in TRIR. SSE has 
established a programme of action to 
bring about improvements in contractor 
safety performance, and has set separate 
TRIR targets for 2023/24 for contractors 
and direct employees, of 0.31 and 0.11 
respectively. Considering the increased 
activities and workload within all Business 
Units, SSE expects that these will be 
challenging targets, but believes they 
are achievable. More information on 

contractor safety can be found on  
page 76. 

The concept of ‘Safe Days’ is also used 
to measure the number of days in 
which there are no minor, serious, or 
major safety incidents; serious or major 
environmental incidents; or any incident 
with high potential for harm to people 
or the environment. 255 Safe Days were 
achieved during 2022/23, a decrease of 
the 276 safe days recorded in the year 
before.

In addition to these core metrics, SSE 
monitors specific types of safety incident 
including road traffic collisions and 
number of people injured. The level of 
engagement in SSE’s safety culture is 
monitored through targeted questions 
in an annual all-employee engagement 
survey.

Protecting health, safety and wellbeing
Monitoring health 
and safety performance
Safety remains SSE’s first priority with the 
objective that ‘everyone gets home safe’ 
and that focus is all the keener following 
the tragic death of Liam Macdonald, a 
young contractor working on Shetland,  
in June 2022.

The Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR)  
for direct employees and contractors 
combined was 0.19 per 100,000 hours 
worked, up from 0.17 in 2021/22. This 
increase reflects a significant surge in 
investment and construction, and an 
associated rise in contractor hours worked. 
Further detail on SSE’s TRIR is outlined  
in Table 12, with additional information  
on contractor safety outlined on pages 66 
and 164 . 

SSE seeks to embed a strong safety culture 
and to ensure that all those working on its 
behalf feel confident to speak up around 
safety. In SSE’s 2022 all-employee survey, 
which had a 79% response rate, 92% of 
employees said that their manager sets  
the right example when it comes to Safety, 
Health and Environment and 94% said that 
SSE makes it easy for people to do the right 
thing on Safety, Health and Environment.

Detailed information on SSE’s health  
and safety performance over 2022/23 is 
provided in the Safety, Sustainability, Health 
and Environment Advisory Committee 
report on pages 162 to 165  of this report 
and in the Sustainability Report 2023 .

Taking a holistic 
approach to wellbeing
In 2021/22, SSE undertook a strategic 
review of occupational benefits which  
also included recruitment of a dedicated 
Head of Health and Wellbeing. The review 
recognised that while a very good range of 
support was already in place, there were 
opportunities for some services to be used 
more and/or expanded upon.

Building upon the outcomes of the 
strategic review and recognising the impact 
which Covid and the cost of living crisis 
have had on employees’ wellbeing, over 
2022/23 SSE developed a holistic range of 
benefits which support physical, mental 
and financial wellbeing. 

In addition to providing a wider range of 
support services, a key focus in 2022 was to 
make it easier for employees to access the 
right form of support when they need it. As 
a result, SSE launched the Health Hub, an 
online portal with clear signposting to all of

Increased investment  
in employee health
Over 2022/23, SSE made a significant 
investment to enhance the health support 
it provides to its employees. One of the  
key investments it made was the launch  
of a new service, WeCare, which enables 
employees in the UK and Northern Ireland 
to access free online GP appointments 
within 48 hours and access to a private 
prescription service, to help colleagues 
receive the medical care they need. 
WeCare can be used by all UK and 
Northern Ireland employees, as well as 
their immediate family who live in the same 
home, and it also offers 24/7 support on 
physical and mental health issues, general 
wellbeing and financial and legal matters. 
Employees in Ireland can receive similar 
support through SSE’s partnerships with 
VHI Healthcare.

Table 12: Total Recordable Injury Rates for SSE’s employees and contractors

In 2022, SSE also launched a pilot  
scheme in partnership with the British 
Heart Foundation providing employees 
with free health assessments. The service 
was accessed by over 150 colleagues in 
2022/23 and SSE plans to make it more 
widely available in 2023/24.

These initiatives build upon a strong 
foundation of existing support services 
including Nuffield mental health and 
musculoskeletal support, comprehensive 
Employee Assistance Programmes,  
a suite of toolkits covering mental health, 
menopause and other health issues, a 
series of health and wellbeing webinars  
and Nudge, a financial education resource.

Committed to decent work and economic growth

76 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

Upholding safety standards as contractor 
hours worked increases
SSE recognises that the significant surge in investment and 
construction required to achieve its business goals and the 
associated increase in contractor hours worked represents a 
higher-risk environment than for SSE’s operational activity. In 
2022/23, SSE’s contractor TRIR increased slightly compared to 
2021/22 performance (see table 3) and tragically, there was a 
contractor fatality on Shetland in June 2022.

In order to ensure that the necessary rigour and support is in 
place for its contract partners, SSE has formed a new central 
Contractor Safety Team supported by dedicated Contractor 
Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Managers and 
Assurance Auditors to improve contractor safety performance. 

In SSE’s plan for the next financial year, key actions have been 
captured in the following three categories:

1. Collaborate – how SSE aligns all parties to deliver; 
2. Support – how to provide direct support; and 
3. Check – Risk Based audit plan across SSE businesses and 

directly with contract partners to identify and address any 
issues systematically.

SSE continues to improve SHE Specification for its contractors 
and provide guidance for project management teams. In 
addition to the Contractor Safety Community, local SHE 
Communities are embedded across all SSE Business Units.

Immersive Training
SSE continually challenges itself on 
how to keep colleagues and contract 
partners engaged on safety.  Building 
on an already strong safety culture, 
this year and as part of a refresh and 
re-energise programme for SHE, SSE 
will be rolling out a new Immersive 
Training programme. The programme, 
which requires significant investment, is 
designed to evoke a much deeper level 
of recognition for what happens when 
something goes wrong.  

Following a successful pilot in 2022, 
the one-day training sessions will take 
place in two established training centers 
owned and run by SSE’s contract 
partners in London and Immingham. 
A third, due to open later in 2023/24 in 
Perth, will be owned and run by SSE. 

SSE will send all employees and some 
contract partners who undertake 
operational roles through this one-day 
immersive experience.

The training which is highly interactive 
and thought provoking, equips 
attendees with the right mindset, skill 
set and tool set to ensure that everyone 
gets home safe. 

Feedback from the pilot sessions 
has been very positive and for those 
who have attended, has resulted in 
a significant increase in confidence 
in challenging unsafe behavior and 
highlighting risks.

Focus on wellbeing
Recognising the impact of the pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis 
on employees’ health, SSE made employee wellbeing a priority in 
2022/23. Building on a strong foundation of existing wellbeing benefits, 
SSE introduced several new and enhanced benefits in 2022/23, for 
example, the We Care Health App through which employees and 
their immediate families can access 24/7 GP video consultations and 
support on physical and mental health issues, general wellbeing and 
financial and legal matters. Employees in Ireland can receive similar 
support through SSE’s partnerships with VHI Healthcare. 

SSE also launched a pilot scheme in partnership with the British Heart 
Foundation providing employees with free health assessments. The 
service was accessed by over 150 colleagues in 2022/23 and SSE plans 
to make it more widely available in 2023/24.

For further information on SSE’s new and enhanced wellbeing benefits, 
see SSE’s Annual Report 2023, available at sse.com/sustainability.

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 77

Embedding a healthy 
business culture

Doing the right thing
SSE has well established processes and 
procedures to embed a healthy business 
culture at all levels of its business, to support 
people to do the right thing. SSE’s ‘Doing 
The Right Thing’ guide to good business 
ethics applies to all SSE’s employees as well 
as people employed by other organisations 
to work on SSE’s behalf, and sets out 
clearly the behaviours and standards 
expected, which are underpinned by SSE’s 
values. The guide covers a wide range of 
topics, including how to raise concerns 
about wrongdoing, cyber security, fair 
competition, transparency in the wholesale 
energy market, preventing corruption and 
financial crime and engagement with 
politicians and regulators. 

The ‘Doing The Right Thing’ guide draws 
from SSE’s 19 Group Policies and sets 
out the principles and values from which 
a healthy business culture is established. 
These principles guide decisions and 
actions and make sure that SSE undertakes 
its activities in a sustainable way. For each 
issue, the Group Policies outline SSE’s core 
policy principles, roles and responsibilities 
within the Company and how SSE ensures 
its employees receive suitable training in 
the subject area. The policies also detail 
additional guidance and supporting 
documents which employees can access.

The full suite of Group policies and SSE’s 
‘Doing the right thing’ guide are available on 
sse.com/sustainability.

To ensure a consistent standard across 
SSE’s workforce of their responsibilities 
in relation to good business ethics, SSE 
also has a suite of mandatory ethics and 
compliance training modules. This includes 
three modules which selected employees 
must complete annually and Fraud 
Awareness, Bribery and Anti-Corruption, 
Anti-Money Laundering and Financial 
Sanctions  and Inclusion and Diversity 
which all employees must complete bi-
annually.  

SSE uses multiple sources to assess 
the strength of its business culture and 
understand how this is embraced by 
employees. One of the core tools is SSE’s 
cultural dashboard which provides a health 
check, comprising data covering people 

metrics and performance metrics under 
cultural strands, and which is reviewed by 
the Board twice annually. More information 
around the Board’s focus on culture and 
full details of SSE’s cultural dashboard, can 
be found on pages 137 and 138 of SSE’s 
Annual Report 2023. 

Creating conditions to speak up
A healthy business culture is one where 
everyone feels able to speak up in the event 
of wrongdoing. People that work for SSE, or 
on its behalf, are encouraged to speak up 
when they witness or suspect wrong-doing 
and are protected from retribution. 

Anyone who suspects wrongdoing at SSE 
can speak up through both internal and 
external channels. Incidents of suspected 
wrongdoing can be reported internally 
through line managers, nominated internal 
Speak Up contacts and the Board’s five 
sub-committees. Employees who feel this 
route is not possible can report incidents in 
a safe and secure way externally, through 
an independent whistleblowing channel 
hosted by Safecall, with the option to report 
anonymously. Details for how to report 
wrongdoing through all of these channels 
is made publicly available through SSE’s 
‘Doing the right thing’ employee guide. 

Once incidents have been reported, SSE 
has a Speak Up Aftercare Programme 
in place, which has been designed to 
promote good communication with people 
who speak up and provide reassurance 
that there will be no detriment for anyone 
speaking up in good faith.

The number of reports of suspected 
wrongdoing has remained stable year-on-
year, with 50 reports made through SSE’s 
speak up channels in 2022/23, compared 
to 49 the previous year. Every report is 
triaged and considered for investigation, 
and SSE monitors the trends of Speak Up 
cases closely. 

A detailed breakdown of the incidents 
reported, the topics they cover and 
outcome of investigations over 2022/23, 
alongside more information on SSE’s Speak 
Up Aftercare Programme, can be found on 
page 59 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023. 

SSE’s Group Whistleblowing Policy 
is available publicly on sse.com/
sustainability, and the effectiveness 
of SSE’s whistleblowing arrangements 
are reviewed twice yearly by the Group 
Executive Committee and the Board.



Protecting and 
restoring the natural 
environment 

While the greatest threat to nature is from climate change, ecosystems and biodiversity are affected 
by human behaviour in other ways too. Overuse of resources, land encroachment and pollution 
are combining with climate change to create a natural environment emergency that is described 
as profound to human life as global warming. SSE operates in places that are home to a variety of 
valuable ecosystems and habitats. Its environment strategy is designed to ensure that environmental 
impacts are considered throughout SSE’s business activities are carefully managed. 

The depletion of nature is posing a significant risk to the health of our 
communities and economy. SSE has a responsibility, where its business 
activities interact with the natural environment, to both prevent harm and 
restore depleted ecosystems.

SSE’s environment strategy provides a framework for SSE to manage and mitigate impacts to 
terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, and build a business that uses resources efficiently 
and embraces the principles of a circular economy.

are available at sse.com/sustainability. 

Furthermore, an enhanced environmental 
training module was implemented in 
2022/23 and is being rolled out across 
SSE. For the first time, the module is a 
mandated requirement of the induction 
programme for new recruits joining SSE. 
SSE also became a corporate partner of 
the Institute of Environmental Management 
and Assessment (IEMA) supporting the 
professional development of relevant 
employees and promoting collaboration on 
environmental matters. 

Monitoring environmental performance
The number of environmental incidents 
in 2022/23 saw a significant increase 
compared to the previous year increasing 
from 84 to 109 between 2021/22 and 
2022/23. This was in part due to improved 
reporting of incidents by operational teams 
during the year as well as the increased 
growth in business unit activity. 

The number of environmental permit 
breaches as a result of SSE’s activities 
totalled nine, compared to seven incidents 
in 2021/22. For the first time since 2018/19, 
SSE recorded one major incident, related 
to SF

6
, at SSE’s substation project in Alyth 

which led to the release of 63kg of SF
6
 

gas to the atmosphere. A breakdown 
of environmental incidents by severity 
category can be found on page 80. 

To review, assess and identify opportunities 
to improve environmental performance 
SSE will conduct a series of deep dives, 
alongside its contractors, across its main 
areas of environmental risk (including 
fluid filled cables, SF

6
 leakage, silt run off 

during construction projects and oil related 
incidents and spills). The results of this 
work will inform and improve processes 
and controls to ensure that performance 
improves for the future.

SSE’s environment strategy 
Whilst SSE’s GHG emissions are its most 
material impact, it also has a wider role to 
carefully manage its impact to the natural 
world. 

SSE’s environment strategy considers wider 
environmental impacts under three pillars 
inspired, in part, by the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The core 
pillars are: environmental management and 
governance; responsible consumption and 
production; and, the natural environment. 
The strategy provides a framework to 
engage internal and external stakeholders 
while holding SSE accountable for 
performance. SSE has set Group-wide 
environment goals, targets and indicators 
to measure success. Supporting these 
are Business Unit specific goals and 
management plans, as each of its 
businesses have different interactions with, 
and impacts on, the environment.

Effective environmental governance 
and management
SSE’s environment strategy is governed at 
both the Executive and Board level. The 
Safety, Health and Environment Committee 
(SHEC) advise and the Safety, Sustainability, 
Health and Environment Advisory 
Committee (SSHEAC) and have oversight of 
matters relating to the environment.

To ensure effective environmental 
management, SSE operates an 
environmental management system (EMS) 
certified to ISO14001, including controls, 
processes and procedures, across all its 
business activities that interact with the 
environment. In 2022/23, SSEN Distribution, 
SSE Energy Customer Solutions and SSE 
Enterprise all achieved certification for 
the first time. This means SSE is currently 
ISO14001 certified for 100% of its business 
activities by reported revenue, based on 
2022/23 figures. SSE’s ISO14001 certificates

82 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

Understanding nature 
impacts and dependencies
SSE operates in some of the UK and Ireland’s least populated places, home to a wide variety of 
valuable ecosystems and habitats. Measurable, science-based data will be key to ensuring nature 
impacts and dependencies are understood and integrated into decision making. 

Working to meet biodiversity targets
The ability to quantify biodiversity is 
key to how we better understand our 
impacts and identify how we continually 
improve our approach to developing and 
operating our assets. Due to the varied 
nature of operations and geographical 
locations, approaches are continually 
evolving and aligning with emerging 
recommendations and best practice. 

To target enhanced value for nature, SSE 
has made a commitment to achieve 
biodiversity net gain on all its large, 
onshore, capital projects. Recognising 
that this is a complex target to achieve, 
it is specifically working to ensure that all 
projects consented from 2023 onwards 
achieve no ‘net loss’ in biodiversity, and 
for those projects consented after 2025, 
to achieve ‘net gain’. 

In preparation to monitor and report 
against the ‘net loss’ in biodiversity target 
this year, several SSE business units have 
been developing methods to measure 
and baseline their biodiversity units. This 
Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) approach 
has been embedded in SSE’s electricity 
transmission business, through the 
development of its own BNG toolkit and 
SSE’s renewables business has further 
adapted the toolkit for its business needs 
(see case study).

Improving nature-related disclosures
In preparation of the launch of the 
Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 
Disclosures (TNFD) in late 2023, SSE 
has established a TNFD working 
group. Consisting of members of 
SSE’s Sustainability, Environment and 
Finance teams, the group will prepare 
SSE’s biodiversity-related governance, 
strategy, risk management and metrics 
disclosure ahead of the publishing of 
the Sustainability Report 2023/24. SSE 
recognises that next year will be its first 

in disclosing information guided by the 
TNFD requirements and accepts that 
it may not meet all the recommended 
criteria during its first year of disclosure. 
Similar to how SSE has developed 
its TCFD reporting, improvements to 
disclosures will be made with each 
future iteration of SSE’s Sustainability 
Report, to ensure complete and robust 
reporting. 

Delivering Biodiversity Net  
Gain in development projects
Every development site has an intrinsic 
‘biodiversity value’, which is determined 
by a wide range of factors including the 
type, condition and distinctiveness of the 
habitat. By quantifying the biodiversity 
value of a site pre-and post-development, 
the impact of the development on 
biodiversity value, whether positive or 
negative, can be understood. Importantly 
this provides insight into the most 
effective ways of mitigating biodiversity 
losses and maximising biodiversity gains. 

To achieve the goal of leaving the 
natural environment in a measurably 
better state than it was found, SSEN 
Transmission initially developed a 
project-level toolkit to quantify pre- and 
post-development biodiversity value, 
alongside a site optioneering toolkit to 
model the impact on biodiversity from 
different site decisions. The toolkits have 
now been applied to a number of new 
developments including the Kintore 
substation in Aberdeenshire, HVDC 
switching station at Noss in Caithness 

and as part of the development of a new 
substation and overhead line upgrades at 
Rothienorman. 
These toolkits, based on the Defra Metric 
(which is now at version 4.0) used in 
England and Wales, were then further 
developed by SSE Renewables over 
2022/23 to recognise the typical habitat 
types, in particular peatland, encountered 
by SSE Renewables in developing large-
scale onshore assets predominately 
in Scotland and Ireland. To support 
collaboration and encourage transparent 
decision making, SSE Renewables 
published comprehensive user guides 
in its ‘Positive for the Planet’ report. In 
this report, SSE Renewables outlined its 
10-point plan for Biodiversity Net Gain.

SSE Renewables and SSEN Transmission 
continue to engage at a strategic level to 
promote the adoption of standardised 
measures for biodiversity quantification 
across the renewables sector and more 
broadly. 

Our biodiversity net gain 
toolkits - which we have 
made open source - allow 
us to transparently quantify 
the progress we’re making 
to improve the natural 
environment on our onshore 
sites. This means we are 
building the renewables 
assets needed for net zero, 
while leaving the biodiversity 
at our sites in a measurably 
better state – tackling both 
the climate and nature 
emergencies, hand-in-hand.”

CASE STUDY

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 83

The next frontier: measuring marine 
and intertidal biodiversity
While the methods for confidently 
enhancing the value of nature on land 
are well understood by SSE, measuring 
and monitoring marine biodiversity, 
either intertidal or within the ocean 
environment, poses different challenges 
and is a key area of focus for the future. 
As part of its efforts to connect Scotland’s 

remote islands to the national grid and 
progress vital reinforcements for future 
offshore renewable wind projects, 
SSEN Transmission is working with 
environmental groups to enhance the 
collective understanding of the wider 
marine environment and to recognise 
the potential impacts that such offshore 
projects may bring to the submarine 
environment. In doing so, SSE will be able 
to identify actions to protect and restore 
Scotland’s marine species and habitats.

An example of collaboration on 
marine biodiversity research is SSEN 
Transmission’s work with Orkney Skate 
Trust. SSEN Transmission is providing 
funding to support the Trust’s research 
work to survey the seabed that will 
be used for the proposed Orkney 
transmission connection. The research 
will collect and share invaluable data 
on the current condition of the seabed 
and the population of flapper skate. 

The information gathered from this 
partnership will provide SSE with a much 
deeper understanding of the marine 
environment and provide the facts to 
determine how SSE can help to preserve 
and enhance the unique wildlife and 
habitat on the seabed. 

Given the complexity of the marine 
environment, and the extensive nature 
of its development ambitions, SSE 
Renewables is working in partnership 
to develop shared approaches and 
expand the amount of data available 
to developers to make informed and 
transparent decisions.
 
A broad array of industry collaborations 
are seeking to develop knowledge 
and understanding of cumulative 
environmental impacts from offshore 
wind, the interaction between species 
affected by offshore wind farms, methods 
for better monitoring of seabirds and 
the development of an environmental 
platform collating species data from 
the variety of surveys being undertaken. 
The core of this collaboration is being 
undertaken in Scotland and the UK so to 
support shared learning at an international 

level, SSE Renewables has joined the UN 
Global Compact’s Offshore Wind and 
Marine Spatial Planning Steering Group, 
created through the Ocean Stewardship 
Coalition, which runs a series of ‘sprint’ 
projects to quickly map existing initiatives 
and develop shared policy asks from 
offshore wind developers, academia, UN 
bodies and other institutions.

Finally, SSE Renewables is pursuing 
wider partnership opportunities with key 
conservation and research organisations 
to drive development of innovative 
approaches to measure marine and 
coastal biodiversity. This includes the 
adoption of artificial intelligence for 
species monitoring and exploring the 
potential for “ecological digital twins” 
to better understand the interaction 
between species and our assets. 

More information on SSE’s approach to 
biodiversity can be found in SSE’s Annual 
Biodiversity Report, available at sse.com/
sustainability. The report highlights the 
work SSE has undertaken to protect 
and enhance biodiversity, contribute to 
biodiversity research and knowledge, and 
connect people with the natural world.



Protecting and restoring the natural environment

84 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

Enhancing the 
natural environment
SSE supports the conservation, restoration and enhancement of the natural environment; and 
promotes the integration of amenity, ecosystem, and biodiversity improvement into business 
activities.

Conserving and restoring valuable 
species and habitats
SSE implements best practice measures 
to conserve, restore and enhance the UK 
and Ireland’s habitats and species. Where 
SSE’s operations interact with the natural  
environment, it strives to mitigate risks 
and works, wherever possible, to deliver 
biodiversity enhancement in line with its 
policy and legal requirements.

The strategic role of nature within the 
ED2 Business Plan
Within SSEN Distribution’s 2023-2025 
business plan, approved by Ofgem in 
December 2022, the role of nature has, 
for the first time, been identified as both 
creating future value for customers, and as 
a method of mitigating and adapting to a 
changed climate. 

A Customer Value Proposition (CVP), 
is a mechanism that Ofgem allows for 
network expenditure, outwith the normal 
set of expected outputs, in the pursuit 
of innovative ways to create value for 

customers. SSEN Distribution’s proposal 
to establish new seagrass meadows in 
the seas around its licence areas, due to 
its exposure to the marine environment 
when replacing subsea electricity cables, 
was granted funding. This CVP seeks to 
understand the value of seagrass both 
as a method of enhancing marine 
biodiversity and, potentially, providing 
important evidence on the contribution 
of seagrass replanting for carbon 
sequestration.

A second element of the Business Plan, 
is the funding of nature-based solutions 
for carbon removal. The objective of 
SSEN’s plans for a nature-based solutions 
approach, is to tackle residual emissions 
at the end of its science-based targets 
aligned carbon abatement activity, thus 
demonstrating nature-based solutions 
as a feasible and credible method, while 
delivering wider environmental and social 
ecosystem service benefits.

This work has set in motion a significant 

policy shift, it doesn’t just secure funding 
for investment in nature for the short term, 
but shifts the policy dial for future price 
controls, laying the pathway for others to 
follow. This enables a combined effort to 
tackle the nature crisis across the sector 
moving forward, whilst ensuring action is 
also taken now.

The co-existence of nature and 
renewable energy
SSE’s portfolio of hydro-electric power 
stations has co-existed with the valuable 
ecosystems of the north of Scotland, for 
nearly 80 years. Decades of experience 
exist in fulfilling statutory obligations to 
ensure that Atlantic salmon can follow 
their migratory path (see case study on the 
journey of the smolts). 

This includes the continued operation 
of adult fish counters at key strategic 
locations with fish count records dating 
back over 60 years in some instances. 
This information is invaluable in informing 
wider conservation strategies for Atlantic 
salmon and SSE Renewables have long-
standing commitments to sharing this 
with conservation agencies and fisheries 
boards. In addition, SSE Renewables 
currently commit to extensive and targeted 
management interventions to enable 
juvenile salmon (smolts) to migrate safely 
to sea each year (see case study on page 
83). A similar approach is in place to enable 
upstream migration of adults.

The development of onshore wind in 
Scotland, often in places where peat 
dominates the landscape, has led to an 
obligation on developers to both protect 
and enhance peatland habitats. Through 
sensitive site design and long-term habitat 
management plan commitments, SSE 
Renewables has extensive expertise in 
peatland restoration and management 
practices. For example, SSE Renewables’ 
Strathy South wind farm commits to 
an ambitious forest to bog restoration 
scheme involving the removal of 1,132ha 

SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023 85

of commercial forestry, considered to be 
of very low biodiversity value, and returning 
this to native peatland habitat. The project 
has also committed to a further 468ha of 
offsite open moorland bog restoration.

Managing habitats during Transmission 
upgrades
SSEN Transmission has introduced an 
‘Irreplaceable Habitats’ policy, which puts 
stringent processes in place to prioritise 
the avoidance of routing transmission 
infrastructure through ancient woodland, 
veteran trees and peatland wherever 
possible. 

In circumstances where impacts are 
unavoidable due to the extent of ancient 
woodland coverage in its network area, 
and where network resilience could 
potentially be put at risk, SSEN Transmission 
set out comprehensive and site-specific 
irreplaceable habitats plans to minimise any 
potential impacts wherever possible, such 
as exploring micro-siting, reducing standard 
operational corridors and restorative action 
where such impacts are unavoidable. 

In the case of ancient woodland specifically, 
SSEN Transmission is committed to funding 
appropriate restoration projects to enhance 
the condition of existing ancient woodland 
sites (for example, by removing invasive 
non-native rhododendron) or replacing any 
unavoidable tree removal (which historically 
tend to be commercial plantation) with 
native broadleaves to enhance woodland 
ecosystems. 

For example, in Scotland’s rainforest 
in Argyll SSEN Transmission is working 
with the Argyll Coast and Countryside 
Trust (ACT) to deliver 30 hectares of new 
woodland. The business also provided 
funding to ACT for a woodland officer to 
help develop plans for the planting activities. 
Over the next five years, SSEN Transmission 
will need to plant approximately 650 
hectares of woodland in this area.

Supporting communities to improve 
wellbeing and enhance nature 
SSE works to raise awareness and 
understanding of biodiversity and 
conservation, encouraging both employees 
and communities to connect with the 
natural environment around them. The 
importance of connecting with nature and 
having access to outdoor spaces remains 
essential for people’s physical and mental 
wellbeing. 

Many of SSE’s assets provide recreational 
amenity, for example Galway Wind Park 
in Ireland has a series of recreational trails 

open to the public called the Galway 
Wind Way; SSEN Distribution repurposed 
excess topsoil from its submarine cable 
reinforcement project at Loch Broom to 
support four wildflower meadow projects 
in Ullapool; and SSE Thermal’s dedicated 
liaison manager at its Aldbrough site has 

been working alongside the local community 
to deliver a number of biodiversity 
improvements to a local woodland, St 
Michaels Woodland, by introducing bird 
nesting boxes, wildflower planting and other 
infrastructure improvements to promote 
community use.

Using innovative techniques to 
improve salmon management
SSE Renewables is responsible for mitigating the impact of hydropower on salmon 
in water catchments in the north of Scotland, which can require trapping young 
salmon (called smolts) in spring during their seaward migration and transporting 
them downstream, to allow safe passage past dams. 

In 2022, to improve the number of smolts reaching the sea, SSE Renewables took 
over management of the Tirry trapping site on the Shin water catchment area. SSE 
Renewables’ dedicated hydro environment team, which includes a full-time fisheries 
biologist, has implemented several innovative changes, including the use of a 
motorised trap, a novel automatic release cage to preserve the nocturnal migration 
of smolts, and rock-filled bags to direct river flow and smolts into the trap. Total 
capture increased to 4,000 smolts in 2022 and 4,200 in 2023, almost four-times 
higher than the 10 year average capture rate.

Improving the number of smolts reaching the sea increases the likelihood of adult 
returns and has contributed towards increasing numbers in the catchment area in 
recent years, which is a positive trend at a time when the abundance of wild salmon 
is at an all-time low across Scotland. 

Full detail of the project can be found in the SSE Renewables Sustainability Report 
2023, which will be published later in the year at sserenewables.com/sustainability. 

Sensitive habitat conservation 
during network upgrades
In 2022/23, SSEN Distribution replaced the 11kv subsea cable between the isles 
of Mull and Coll. Through stakeholder consultation it was identified that the cable 
route would run through unique machair habitat. This habitat is a low-lying grassy 
plain that supports plant species such as red clover, bird’s-foot trefoil, yarrow and 
daisy, and rarer species such as lesser-butterfly orchid, Hebridean spotted orchid 
and marsh orchid. 

Working with NatureScot, Scotland’s nature agency, SSEN Distribution identified 
mitigation actions that would minimise the impact of the cable replacement to 
this unique habitat. Where the machair habitat was found to be sensitive (due to 
shallow root systems) coir matting, additional reseeding and temporary fencing 
were used to support re-establishment of the habitat. In addition, minimal trench 
width excavation was used, lifting as little of the machair as possible, for as minimal 
a time as possible. This ensured there was no detriment to the root system, 
allowing the machair to rapidly re-establish. 

The local stakeholders and NatureScot were satisfied with the retention efforts, 
with NatureScot planning to showcase SSEN Distribution’s efforts as best practice 
in machair preservation during construction. In 2023/24, SSEN Distribution will 
continue to monitor the integrity of the machair.

Protecting and restoring the natural environment

86 SSE plc Sustainability Report 2023

Responsible consumption 
and production 
SSE relies on natural resources and recognises the impacts of resource extraction on the natural 
environment. SSE supports the sustainable use of land and water resources and embraces circular 
economy principles alongside the waste hierarchy to seek opportunities to mitigate these impacts.

Resource efficiency 
SSE is working towards more sustainable 
patterns of resource consumption by 
reducing reliance on non-renewable 
and single use products. As a result 
of SSE’s rationalisation of its recycling 
and resource recovery services as well 
as working with suppliers on circular 
economy approaches, SSE is driving 
improvements in its recycling and 
diversion from landfill performance.

SSE has waste management controls 
within each of its businesses and seeks 
to follow the waste hierarchy to prevent, 
reduce, reuse and recycle its waste. It 
provides recycling facilities at its key 
offices and operational sites and adheres 
to the relevant regulatory requirements 

for waste management at its different 
sites and locations.

SSE’s target for 2022/23 was to divert 
85% of waste by tonnage from landfill 
and recycle 40% of waste by tonnage. It 
exceeded these targets, with 65% of SSE’s 
total waste being recycled/composted 
and only 5% being sent to landfill. The 
proportion of waste sent to landfill more 
than halved compared to the previous 
year, with a higher proportion of waste 
being processed as energy from waste 
and an increase in recycled waste 
that resulted from improved recycling 
processes implemented at sites and as a 
result of the inclusion of waste recycling 
data such as metals.

Over 2023/24, SSE expects to further 
broaden the coverage of waste 
performance data to include large 
capital projects and minor works. SSE’s 
2023/24 performance target is to divert 
95% of waste by tonnage from landfill 
and recycle 50% of waste by tonnage. 
It is expected that the planned scope 
expansion of waste data in 2023/24 will 
influence performance, in particular 
recycled waste data. SSE will continue to 
review its waste target to ensure that it 
remains stretching. 

SSE is also introducing the principles of 
circularity into its business activities and is 
collaborating with stakeholders to create 
solutions for industry-wide challenges 
and support circular supply chains.

Creating the Coalition for Wind Industry Circularity (CWIC)
In March 2023, SSE Renewables with partners the University 
of Strathclyde, National Manufacturing Institute Scotland 
and Renewable Parts Ltd, launched the Coalition for Wind 
Industry Circularity (CWIC). The creation of CWIC followed 
the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in July 
2022 with Renewable Parts and the University of Strathclyde 
which identified three priorities for collaboration: 1) Increase 
the circularity of in-service parts on onshore wind farms; 2) 
Establish an end-of-life strategy for onshore wind farm parts; 
and 3) Deliver a UK Wind Circular Economy Sector Deal to 
maximise the environmental and socio-economic
opportunities to ensure UK leadership on circularity.

CWIC seeks to bring together the UK wind sector to create a 
supply chain for the refurbishment and reuse of wind turbine 
components within the UK. Analysis, commissioned by CWIC 
undertaken by BVG Associates, modelled the economic value 
associated with this proposal, with the assessment identifying 
a potential European market of £8.9bn from 2025-2035 and 
creating 20,000 full-time equivalent jobs based on demand 
for just 10 wind turbine component parts. More than 25 
organisations have submitted an expression of interest to 

join CWIC, including some of the world’s largest global wind 
developers, government institutions, innovation bodies and 
SMEs.

Beyond component parts, SSE Renewables is also focusing on 
progressing solutions for large-scale and commercially viable 
options for the reuse, recycling and remanufacture of end-of 
life turbine blades. SSE Renewables remains active in SusWIND, 
with progress made on the development of a life cycle 
analysis toolkit to enable owners of wind turbines to make 
informed sustainable decisions when turbine blades must be 
decommissioned. 

The Company is a pilot partner of ReWind, a tool produced 
by DNV which profiles which materials are contained in wind 
turbines, how they can be disposed of in the best possible way, 
what can be recycled and what the recycling method would 
be. It is intended that SSE Renewables will use this tool to 
quickly assess turbine recyclability percentage and options for 
end-of-life planning and sustainable decommissioning. Digital 
solutions such as ReWind will aid the move towards increased 
recycling rates for decommissioned wind assets.

Reusing materials to support 
birdlife at Creag Riabhach
In 2022, SSEN Transmission continued its work to expand the transmission network 
in the north of Scotland. Several new overhead lines and substations to facilitate new 
renewable generation were under construction and some wooden boxes used to 
store equipment were identified as having reuse potential.

An opportunity was identified to reuse the wood and reduce waste by using it to 
build nest boxes for birds. Nesting sites for birds are in decline in many areas in 
Scotland. Discussions with Forestry and Land Scotland and the Highland Raptor 
Study Group identified that the wooden boxes could be used in the local area as 
well as further afield. In total, 36 boxes were built for a variety of birds, including 
barn owls, tawny owls and kestrels. The boxes will help support raptor populations, 
particularly kestrels which have been showing recent steep declines in numbers. The 
initiative has already proven to be a success, with two tawny owl chicks hatching 
in one of the repurposed boxes near Nethy Bridge in the Cairngorms and recently 
ringed by Highland Raptor Study Group for monitoring purposes.

Managing water use 
Water plays a significant role in SSE’s 
operations, being used in the energy 
production process including as a coolant 
in power stations and a source for power 
generation in hydroelectric generators. 
SSE also uses water as an amenity in its 
buildings.

In 2022/23, total water abstracted by 
SSE fell to 23,354 million m3 from 23,896 
million m3 from the previous year. This 
was largely due to a reduction in water 
passing through SSE’s hydro generation 
plant as a result of lower levels of rainfall 
compared to the previous year. The 
vast majority (97%) of water abstracted 
in 2022/23 was used in SSE’s hydro 
generation operations. This water is 
technically recorded as abstracted, but 

it passes through turbines to generate 
electricity and is returned to the 
environment almost immediately, and 
therefore has minimal environmental 
impact. 

Total water consumed increased 
significantly over this period, by over 
70%. This was due to increased output 
from thermal generation overall, as 
well as a proportional increase in the 
output from thermal power plant with 
cooling towers which have higher 
evaporative losses of water than 
once through (direct) cooling systems.
 
SSE has a water efficiency and saving 
programme in its non-operational offices, 
data centres and depots, and also runs 
a behavioural change campaign in its 

non-operational buildings to encourage 
water savings at work and at home. In 
2017/18 a target was launched as part 
of the programme, to reduce water 
consumption every year by 2.5%. Total 
SSE non-operational buildings water 
use in 2022/23 was 27,859 million m3, 
up from 22,875 million m3 the previous 
year as a result of a return to the offices 
after the lockdowns associated with the 
COVID pandemic. SSE provides more 
detail on water risk management and 
performance in its annual CDP Water 
Programme response. SSE received a ‘B’ 
rating for its 2022 submission, which is 
publicly available at sse.com/sustainability.

Managing air emissions 
In 2022/23, SSE’s thermal generation 
sites emitted 3,870 tonnes of nitrogen 
oxides (NO

x
), compared 4,573 tonnes 

the previous year, a reduction of around 
15%. Emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO

2
) 

reduced to 1,336 tonnes from 3,021 
tonnes the previous year. In addition, 
particulate emissions (PM10) fell to 116 
from 277 tonnes in 2020/21. The falling 
trend across these key air emission 
sources reflects the reduced demand for 
oil-fuelled peaking plant in Ireland that 
occurred the previous year as a result 
of the need to balance the grid. Finally, 
mercury emissions to air increased to 
10.6kg from 2.2kg in 2021/22 as a result 
of an increased level of test running on 
back-up fuel oil that was required during 
the year, as dictated by Transmission 
Operator on the island of Ireland.

Governance and accountability
The structures governing sustainability within SSE are designed to deliver clear lines of 
accountability and ensure the alignment of strategic objectives with social and environmental 
value. 

Structured governance pathways
Responsibility for the most material 
sustainable impacts lie at the highest 
levels of the organisation with 
sustainability integrated into the 
responsibilities of the Board, the Chair, 
the Chief Executive and the Group 
Executive Committee.  With the quantity 
and diversity of ESG issues of interest 
to stakeholders becoming ever more 
sophisticated, SSE regularly reviews 
the effectiveness of the governance 
arrangements which support its most 
material sustainability policies, practices 
and performance.  
The Board and its sub-committees 
At the highest level of the organisation, 
the Board sets SSE’s vision and purpose. 
The Group strategy that seeks to fulfil 
that vision and purpose is also set by the 
Board and is reviewed across the year 
through an iterative programme of work 
. Sustainability is articulated within the 
description of SSE’s strategy given the 
close alignment between its long-term 
strategic objectives and the pursuit of net 
zero. 

Within its supporting plan of work, and on 
an annual basis, the Board further reviews 
and approves SSE’s priorities relating 
to its principal sustainability impacts, of 
which, climate change is defined as the 
most material of all. This is in addition to a 
range of sustainability and climate-related 
issues which may be brought in response 
to the agreed sustainability priorities, or 
internal or external developments. 

In setting strategy and ensuring an 
effective framework for its delivery, the 
Board considers  both the spirit and letter 
of its duties under Section 172 of the 
Companies Act, including the long-term 
consequences of decision-making and 
promoting the success of the Company 
for the benefit of all stakeholders. A 
Board-approved framework for engaging 
with SSE’s key, defined stakeholder 
groups, sets expectations surrounding 
the understanding and incorporation 
of stakeholder views within business 

plans and objectives. Re-enforcing the 
approach to ethical business conduct 
and culture, the Board also owns SSE’s 
Group Policy suite which applies to 
all employees, and during 2022/23, 
it reviewed and approved specific 
policy statements on human rights, 
the environment, climate change and 
sustainability. While the purpose of 
these policies is to guide the behaviours, 
actions and decisions of SSE employees 
and their senior leaders, they are available 
for stakeholders to review on sse.com/
sustainability. 
The Board is advised on matters relating 
to safety, sustainability, health and the 
environment by the Safety, Sustainability, 
Health and Environment Advisory 
Committee (SSHEAC), which continues 
to be chaired by an independent non-
Executive Director. Its membership 
comprises four non-Executive 
Directors, the Chair of the Board, the 
Chief Commercial Officer, the Chief 
Sustainability Officer and three senior 
leaders from across the SSE Group. The 
SSHEAC has oversight of the annual SSE 
Sustainability Report and across 2022/23, 
it enhanced its oversight of ESG matters 
through deep dives on SSE’s external 
benchmark performance and an ESG gap 
analysis.   

The Remuneration Committee is also 
chaired by an independent non-Executive 
Director of the Board. It prepares SSE’s 
policy on executive remuneration which 
remains subject to consideration and 
approval of shareholders. Through this 
policy, the approach to performance-
based pay assesses Executive Directors’ 
progress against SSE’s 2030 Goals, 
which are aligned to the UN’s SDGs. The 
Remuneration Committee undertook 
its three-yearly review of SSE’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in 2021/22, and as 
part of that, the 2022/23 Annual Incentive 
Plan included a new measure aligned to 
ESG performance, with progress against 
the 2030 Goals now incentivised in the 
longer-term Performance Share Plan.  

Good quality governance 
provides more than a key 
‘check and balance’ on SSE’s 
social and environmental 
policies, practices and 
performance – it can 
provide support to the entire 
organisation as it seeks to 
pursue shared value for all 
its stakeholders.”

Governance report

Sustainability - linked Executive remuneration  
SSE’s approach to Executive remuneration 
reflects the role of sustainability and 
climate-related considerations within SSE’s 
purpose and strategy, with sustainability-
linked metrics and targets forming an 
element of performance-related pay. 

The framework of SSE’s 2030 Goals 
has been used since 2019 to assess 
performance, which was linked to the 
performance based Annual Incentive Plan 
until 2021/22. The updated Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, approved by 
shareholders at the 2022 AGM, has seen 
two important changes:

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Progress against SSE’s 2030 Goals, which 
are outlined on page 7, are linked to the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP), which 
will vests for the first time in 2025. The 
measures and targets used to measure 
performance are outlined in Table 5. These 

• performance against the 2030 Goals 
is now linked to the longer-term 
Performance Share Plan.

• average performance across three 
independent external ESG ratings, now 
being linked to the Annual Incentive 
Performance. 

Overall, the link between sustainability 
performance and Executive remuneration 
has been strengthened. 

Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)
The updated sustainability measures in 
the Annual Incentive Plan include average 

measures are worth 15% of the overall 
award. In 2022, SSE’s Shareholders also 
approved new ‘strategic’ measures which 
assess progress towards the successful 
delivery of SSE’s capital investment 
plan. This means that 30% of the shares 
awarded under the new PSP are linked

The TSR performance targets were strengthened last year with 20% of that element vesting for median performance (previously 25%) 
and full vesting of that element only achieved at 80th percentile ranking (increased from 75th percentile). 

The growth targets for EPS have been set based on SSE’s plan over the next three years and represents a CAGR between 12% and 17% based 
off FY22 EPS of 94.8p. The top end of the range exceeds the Board’s expectations and is considered stretching. The Committee will assess 
the growth targets for future awards under the PSP to ensure that they remain challenging and linked to the business plan. 

Strategic measures and targets for the 2023 PSP award
The measures and targets for this element are linked to the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of SSE’s performance over the three

Alliance (WBA) and others as they emerge.

Performance against the strategic and sustainability measures and targets will be assessed using the same scoring framework shown 
above in respect of the personal and operational measures and targets for the AIP.
Further detail on the performance outcome for 2022/23 and the changes to the Remuneration Policy can be found 
within the Remuneration Committee Report in SSE’s Annual Report 2023, on pages 166 to 187.

The risk that SSE’s strategy, investments or operations are 
deemed to have an unacceptable future impact on the natural 
environment and on national and international targets to 
tackle climate change.

The physical impacts of climate change, such as severe 
weather that can interrupt energy supply or generation, and 
the transitional risks relating to developments in political and 
regulatory requirements on the products and services SSE 
provides, have potential to impact SSE’s operations. SSE’s work 
to reduce its impact on climate change and the consideration 
of longer-term key climate-related risks and opportunities is 
detailed on pages 14 to 29.

The risk that SSE develops and builds major assets that do 
not realise intended benefits or meet the quality standards 
required to support economic lives of typically 25 to 60 years 
within forecast timescales and budgets.

SSE’s investment in large infrastructure projects can 
have considerable social, economic and environmental 
consequences. To deliver high-quality projects, SSE works 
closely with suppliers and contractors to ensure its values on 
issues such as environmental protection, safety, modern slavery 
and fair pay, are upheld. SSE’s work to promote and embed 
sustainability within its supply chain is detailed on pages 46 to 
48.

The risk that energy customers’ ability to meet the costs of 
providing energy, or their ability to access energy services 
is limited, giving rise to negative political or regulatory 
intervention that has an impact on SSE’s regulated networks 
and energy businesses.

SSE seeks to support the transition to net zero through 
disciplined investment in developing and operating low-carbon 
energy infrastructure, and delivering this in a way that represents 
value for money for energy customers. It works to ensure that 
the energy it supplies to customers is not only affordable but is 
accessible too, and it strives to offer services that are inclusive to 
all. See pages 30 to 39.

The risk that SSE is unable to attract, develop and retain an 
appropriately skilled, diverse and responsible workforce and 
leadership team, and maintain a healthy business culture 
which encourages and supports ethical behaviours and 
decision making.

An ethical business culture alongside the talent and skills of 
SSE’s employees enable it to fulfil its purpose and achieve its 
strategic goals. SSE has a long-standing commitment to fair 
and decent work and seeks to provide an inclusive, fulfilling 
and high-performing workplace. SSE’s responsible approach to 
attracting, developing and retaining a future skilled workforce is 
detailed on pages 65 to 73.

Climate Change Energy Affordability

Large Capital Projects Management People and Culture

The risk associated with operating in a fast-paced, highly 
regulated environment which is subject to constantly changing 
political, regulatory and legislative expectations and  
interventions.

SSE aims to work constructively with governments and regulators 
to help deliver net zero, whilst ensuring the energy system works 
in the interest of energy customers. SSE’s activities are influenced 
by international and national agreements on climate change, and 
sustainability issues are increasingly included in regulatory and 
legislative requirements. See page 26.

The risk of harm to people, property or the environment from 
SSE’s operations.

SSE has an uncompromising commitment to keep people 
safe and healthy, and to respect the environment in which it 
operates. SSE’s working environment includes challenging 
geographic locations and adverse weather conditions, which 
can impact its activities. It has clear safety and environmental 
processes and training in place to address these risks. SSE’s 
safety, health and environment performance and initiatives are 
detailed on pages 75 to 76 and 78 to 87.

Politics, Regulation and Compliance Safety and the Environment

Managing sustainability-related risks
The execution of SSE’s strategy and the creation of value from the opportunities arising from net 
zero are dependent on the effective identification, understanding and mitigation of the Group’s 
Principal Risks.

Sustainability in the Group Principal Risk context 
Whilst all the Group Principal Risks are relevant to the sustainable development of SSE, those with particular significance to social 
and environmental impacts are outlined below. More information can be found in SSE’s Group Principal Risk report and SSE’s 
Annual Report 2023, pages 68 to 77, which detail key developments during the year and key mitigations SSE has in place.

SSE disclosure 2022/23 
 
SSE’s generation activities in the UK are subject to the UK ETS and the carbon price support and in Ireland they are subject to the EU ETS (see page 26 of this report 
and page 51 of the Annual Report 2023. SSE is required to report its GHG emissions and energy consumption in the UK through the Companies (Directors’ Report) 
and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018 and the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) requirements. Information 
disclosed in the accompanyng data and perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting), alongside pages 49 to 51 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023 
represent SSE’s disclosure against these requirements. 

As of January 2020, SSE Energy Services, the retail division of the SSE Group, was sold to OVO Energy. This ended the direct supply of electricity from SSE to 
household customers in Great Britain. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) maintain responsibility for the distribution of electricity across central southern 
England and the north of Scotland, as well as the electricity transmission network in the north of Scotland. Details of the emissions associated with the losses within 
it’snetworks are dislcosed in the accompanyng data and perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting) .

Two of SSE’s science-based carbon targets cover SSE’s scope 1 GHG emissions. Discussion on trends and progress against these targets can be found on pages 20 
and 21 of the Sustainability Report 2023 and page 51 of the Annual Report 2023.

SSE’s customer facing businesses only serve customers in the GB market and the island of Ireland Single Electricty Market. Both these energy markets have mature 
carbon reduction and renewable support frameworks. In Ireland, there are government targets on particular forms of renewable energy (for example, 7GW of offshore 
wind by 2030) and, in the UK, renewable targets support statutory carbon budgets. Neither market has standards that mean electricity generators must secure a 
proportion of their portfolio of energy generation from renewable sources. 

SSE discloses NOx, SOx, PM10 and Mercury air emissions on page pages 80 and 87 of this report and page 54 of the Annual Report 2023 and in the accompanyng 
data and perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting). Data from other air emissions is reported to the environmental regulator and, while this 
information can be accessed through a request to the regulator, SSE is working to disclose it more readily to its stakeholders in future.

SSE depends on water in various ways across its operations, from use in electricity generation to an amenity in its buildings. SSE provides information on its water 
management approach and its operations in relation to water stressed areas on page 87 of this report and page 53 of the Annual Report 2023, alongside a detailed 
breakdown of water use data in the accompanyng data and perfromance tables (available at www.sse.com/sustainability/reporting).

In 2022/23, SSE had eight minor permit breaches in relation to water quantity and/or quality permits. Immediate action to rectify the non-compliance was undertaken 
and the environmental regulator notified in each case. Investigations were completed following these events and actions taken to prevent reoccurrence.

Detailed description of the strategies and pratcices SSE has in place to mitigate water management risks is provided in SSE’s CDP Water Programme response, which is 
publicly available on its website at sse.com/sustainability

SSE recognises the challenging circumstances faced by energy consumers, exascerbated by the cost-of-living crisis. In response, SSE Airtricity supported its customers 
through a combination of keeping tariffs as low as possible, a price freeze targeted at financially vulnerable consumers and customer support funds. More details can 
be found on pages 64 of the Annual Report 2023, and page 32 of the Sustainability Report 2023.

See the accompanyng data and perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting)  for SSE’s safety performance, as well as page 75 of the 
Sustainability Report 2023 and pages 63 and 163 to 164 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023.

Not applicable in the UK and Irish electricity systems.

With the smart meter roll out continuing in Great Britain, there are now 1,845,807 smart meters connected to SSEN Distribution’s network that can ‘communicate’ to 
SSEN’s system. This means that 50% of all SSEN’s supply points have communicable and smart capability*. 

See pages 34 to 38 for details of SSE’s fuel poverty and energy efficiency support.

N/A - SSE does not operate nuclear generation.

N/A - SSE does not operate nuclear generation.

SSE has robust processes and practices in place to manage cybersecurity and its datacentres are certified to ISO27001 for information security. SSE also has a suite of 
mandatory ethics and compliance training modules which all employees are required to complete, which includes Cyber Security eLearning module. SSE discloses 
the number of material or regulatory reportable incidents caused by cyber security breaches of SSE systems in the accompanyng data and perfromance tables 
(available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting).

A comparable indicator for GB is the Customer Interruptions and Customer Minutes Lost on SSE’s electricity distribution network. See the accompanyng data and 
perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting) for data.

See the accompanyng data and perfromance tables  (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting) for SSE’s domestic and business customer supply accounts.

See pages 106 and 107 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023 for volume of electricity sold to customers by business and domestic supply businesses.  

SSEN owns, operates and maintains around 130,000km of electricity distribution overhead lines and underground cables, and around 5,000km of electricity 
transmission overhead lines and underground cables.

See the accompanyng data and perfromance tables  (available at www.sse.com/sustainability/reporting) and pages 101 and 104 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023 for 
SSE’s generation by source. SSE has generation activities in the UK and Ireland which are both regulated markets.

See pages 106 and 107 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023 where the total volume of electricity sold by SSE Business Energy and SSE Airtricity is described. Because both 
these businesses act independently from SSE’s generation businesses in the market, the volume of electricity sold to customers represents the net amount of electricity 
purchased by SSE throughout 2022/23.
