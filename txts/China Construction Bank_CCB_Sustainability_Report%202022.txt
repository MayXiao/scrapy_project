MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT



4Sustainability Report | 2022

We are a bank that believes in long-term relationships, values partnerships, and 

supports the national economic environment.

 Being part of the conglomerate of one of the main financial institutions in the 

world, where people will always be our strongest point of support and our greatest 

source of reliability, is a great responsibility, which is reflected in the excellence of 

the businesses CCB Brasil promotes. We are a Brazilian bank under Chinese control 

and the main subsidiary of the group in the region, which proves the relevance of 

our organization for the headquarters’ strategic planning and our role in the 

promotion of trade between Brazil and China.

 Aware of our mission and committed to the good practices that guide the relationship 

with our stakeholders, we worked vigorously throughout 2022 to meet the 

expectations of CCB Brasil’s internal and external stakeholders. It was an extremely 

challenging moment marked by great uncertainty both in the local and global 

scenarios, but it reinforces and consolidates our commitment to valuing long-term 

partnerships and supporting Brazilian economic development.

 In 2022, after the country overcame the most turbulent phases of the COVID-19 

pandemic, we ended the cycle of social isolation for our employees. The process 

to return on site activities, which started in November 2021 and was concluded in 

April 2022, was carried out with the necessary caution and safety, and taking into 

account the health of the teams and their adaptation to the work environment. It 

is worth mentioning that at no time during this period of health emergency has our 

organization suffered with shutdowns or been subjected to unnecessary risks, 

whether from the point of view of contracts, people or relationships.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT

 As in 2021 and 2020, CCB Brasil maintained a conservative and restrictive stance 

regarding credit granting, thus prioritizing stability and the maintenance of the 

quality of the portfolio in order to offer excellent services to customers. The 

slowdown in the global economy associated with high inflation and rising basic 

interest rates, accentuated by the war between Russia and Ukraine, blocked the 

international supply chain and interrupted production plans, impacting the entire 

financial sector. In Brazil, the economic crisis and political instability, which intensified 

throughout the electoral process, created an even more challenging scenario for 

the development of new businesses.

In the financial scope, credit operations – especially those with companies in the 

Corporate and Large Corporate segments – totaled BRL 11.1 billion by the end of 

2022, compared to BRL 10.4 billion by the end of 2021. The portion of loans with 

an AA-C rating (lower risk credit range) represents 97% of the portfolio. Resources 

from the Head Office  represented 29.4% (30.1% in 2021) of CCB Brasil’s total 

funding, amounting to BRL 18.2 billion, which consisted of market funding, borrowing 

and onlending obligations, and capital-eligible debt instruments. The consolidated 

gross income from financial intermediation reached BRL 425.1 million in December 

2022 (BRL 428.6 million in 2021). Consolidated shareholders’ equity reached BRL 

1.1 billion, and the reference equity was BRL 2.0 billion, what caused the Basel 

Ratio to reach 15.9% (above the 10.5% minimum required by Brazil’s Central Bank 

– BACEN).

 The commitment to sustainability, which is inherent to the operational strategies 

and values of CCB Brasil, continued to be treated throughout the year with the 

seriousness that the subject demands from contemporary organizations, whether 

GRI 2-22



5Sustainability Report | 2022

from an environmental, social or governance point of view. In addition to a financial 

analysis, all our operations are supported by a financial analysis and a careful 

assessment of social-environmental risks, which are applicable to stakeholders at 

different stages in order to mitigate negative impacts, reinforcing our commitment 

to ESG practices in business development.

Concern for the environment and climate change, which are sensitive issues for 

our agribusiness clients – who amount to around 45% of our loan portfolio – were 

even more strongly on the bank’s radar during 2022. In accordance with the new 

resolutions and regulatory requirements of the Central Bank of Brazil and the 

National Monetary Council (Conselho Monetário Nacional – CMN) regarding 

international ESG best practices within the scope of financial institutions, which 

came into force in December 2022, we consolidated and further matured our 

sustainability management. We do not condone economic activities that are not 

in line with sustainable development, promote environmental damage or pose risks 

to people’s well-being and lives.

 I envision a future with many opportunities for the bank, in the national territory 

and in Latin America, where increasingly strengthen the commercial relationship 

between Brazil and China and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). We want to be recognized 

for our transparency and ethics and as an organization that is engaged not only in 

obtaining profit and profitability, but also in supporting investments that generate 

both direct and indirect improvements to society and the environment.

 I invite you to read our report with the certainty that we worked tirelessly throughout 

2022 to build a stronger and more sustainable CCB Brasil, but with the awareness 

that it is possible to go above and beyond. I take this opportunity to thank our 

shareholders, directors and employees for their commitment and dedication this 

past year, which was essential for our institution to face challenges and achieve 

favorable results.

 Good reading!

INTRODUCTION

MATERIALITY

GRI 2-4, 2-29, 3-1, 3-2, 3-3

CCB Brasil’s business strategy is associated with its materiality matrix, which 
guides all the content that is available throughout this report. Understanding 
the need for optimization and alignment with the latest update of the GRI 
Standards, in force since January 2023, the institution revised its materiality 
between December 2021 and January 2022. At the time, its main stakeholders 
– Regulatory Entities, Workforce, Customers and Suppliers – participated in a 
survey through an online questionnaire that was based on both guidelines from 
the Global Reporting Initiative and matters that are relevant to the banking sector.

During the survey, of which CCB Brasil’s senior management also participated, 
46 people shared their perceptions on three themes: Environment; Economy/
Governance; Social. Each of the themes incorporated seven items, which needed 
to be organized according to their degree of relevance in the opinion of the 
survey participants. The results presented qualitative and non-statistical data, 
which served as the base to define the most relevant material topics for the 
development of the organization’s business and are representative elements of 
its main impacts on the economy, environment, and people; these topics are 
highlighted in the 2021 Sustainability Report.

Understanding the need to keep up with the changes and challenges that are 
inherent to present times, as well as to meet the expectations of stakeholders, 
new priority topics were incorporated in December 2022. The process was 
performed together with the bank’s sustainability division and validated by 
the Board of Directors; it included three new material topics to the subjects of 
greatest relevance to the institution: assessment of social-environmental risk in 
credit; compliance and anti-corruption; economic value distribution.

ABOUT THE REPORT

GRI 2-2, 2-3, 2-5, 2-14, 3-3

By publishing the eighth edition of the CCB Brasil Sustainability Report, the bank 
underlines its commitment to ethics, integrity and best ESG practices. Released 
every year, this document aims to disclose the bank’s organizational profile, 
which is guided by respect for sustainability in its three dimensions, as well as 
the environmental, social and governance impacts related to its activities.

Over the next chapters, the results, risks, challenges, and opportunities observed 
in 2022 are disclosed to provide accountability to stakeholders and present the 
institution’s strategic positioning on different topics. In addition to transparency 
for stakeholders, this report offers an important mechanism for improving internal 
management and to advance processes based on a careful analysis.

This report brings information that covers the period from 1 January to 31 
December 2022, in line with the same interval described by the financial report. 
This document was prepared in accordance with the most recent version of the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)’s Sustainability Reporting Standards. As there 
is yet to be a specific standard for the financial industry, the decision was made 
to use equivalent indicators from the GRI G4 version.

All information disclosed in this report was analyzed and approved internally 
by CCB Brasil’s Board of Directors, who actively participated in all stages of 
development. The data presented over the following pages refer to the five 
companies controlled by the group, which operate with policies that are aligned 
with the conglomerate’s guidelines.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

GRI 2-9, 2-10, 2-11, 2-13, 2-16, 2-18, 2-24, 2-27, 3-3

CCB Brasil adopts the best governance practices to operate its business, in 
compliance with the legal requirements and rules of several institutions that 
regulate the activities of financial institutions, such as the Central Bank of Brazil 
(BACEN), the Securities and Exchange Commission (Comissão de Valores 
Imobiliários – CVM) and the National Monetary Council (CMN). Its management 
model is marked by solidity and integrity, which is recognized for the balance and 
development between profitability and sustainable development that is in line 
with its corporate strategy. This profile of excellence ensured that the institution 
did not receive significant fines or sanctions related to non-compliance with 
legislation in 2022.

The organization seeks to generate value and long-term results based on 
financial discipline and risk management and control, always prioritizing the 
good relationship with stakeholders and society in general. One of the bank’s 
main goals is to be a benchmark for commercial relations between Brazil and 
China, focusing on business continuity, growth, and sustainability, which are 
guidelines that are in line with the parent company’s culture. That goal can only 
be achieved with consolidated and excellent corporate governance, with entities 
that support the decision-making processes and propagate the organization’s 
values and policies, as is the case at CCB Brasil. Its policies, procedures and 
operational processes are periodically updated in accordance with the best 
market practices.

The structure of the organization comprises the Board of Directors, the Senior 
Management and Advisory Committees, with roles and responsibilities detailed 
in the Bylaws as well as in specific internal regulations. This model ensures 

safety and efficiency in operations by decentralizing decisions, collegially and 
constantly discussing strategic issues and delegating responsibilities for a better 
management of the organization’s impact on the economy, the environment 
and people.

Although CCB Brasil does not have a performance evaluation process for the 
Board of Directors regarding the management of economic, environmental, 
and social impacts, the heads, directors, and vice-presidents meet annually to 
evaluate themselves and the other members of the management. The results 
and performance of each professional directly influence changes in the bank’s 
management, with the aim of ensuring the best way to conduct business and 
the contribution to sustainable development.

ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE

GRI 2-15, 2-25, 2-26, 3-3, 205-1, 205-2, 205-3

The granting of credit is an initiative that requires great responsibility from 
financial institutions and needs to be supported by an excellent compliance 
management system. At CCB Brasil, the relationship with stakeholders and the 
compliance with regulatory requirements are regularly monitored in order to 
meet the expectations of the Compliance Department and the guidelines set 
by central office, when applicable.

The bank relies on monitoring and control mechanisms in order to ensure 
the implementation and adequacy of policy, procedures, and internal issues 
related to the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism that 
are continuously improved, considering the complexity of the conglomerate’s 
operations.

The implemented policy and manuals for internal procedures show the 
institutional principles and guidelines to carry out the due diligence to identify, 
qualify and rate according to the following risk profiles:

 I. of customers;

 II. of the institution;

 III. of operations, transactions, products and services;

 IV. of employees, partners, and outsourced service providers.

Throughout 2022, 1,725 operations were performed, they were efficiently 
managed through processes and by ensuring the elimination of any risk or the 
occurrence of suspected cases of corruption. During that period, the Board 
of Directors, Senior Management and employees were also both trained and 
retrained on the subject and were warned about the adopted policies and 
procedures to fight such crimes and mitigate their risks.

100% of operations with stakeholders are evaluated in advance 
to eliminate or mitigate risks of corruption and PLD

CCB Brasil also fully complies with the guidelines established by the regulatory 
entities, whose rules relate to different processes, including those that are 
inherent to the industry and the provision of products and services. Among 
those, we’d like to highlight the following: Banking Self-Regulation by the 
Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban); the Consumer Guidance and 
Protection Program (Procon); and the regulations of the Central Bank of 
Brazil (BACEN), which, in addition to the aforementioned topics, also address 
customer relations.

To strengthen CCB Brasil’s culture, our Code of Ethics and Conduct – which is 
the responsibility of the Ethics Committee and is intended for all stakeholders 
– compiles fundamental questions to guide good practices in the work

environment and in corporate business. By ensuring the compliance with 
current legislation, the Code of Ethics and Conduct  is extremely important 
to guarantee that the relationship with stakeholders is always guided by four 
principles: Consideration to Others; Commitment to Transparency; Compliance 
with Laws; Corporate Social Responsibility. Ethics are the guiding principle of 
the activities of the bank, which consolidates its brand and reputation in the 
market and society with integrity and flawlessness.

Any conduct disorder, conflict of interest or practices that do not comply with 
the Code of Ethics and Conduct must be reported immediately to the Ethics 
Committee through the Ethics Channel provided by the organization. The entity 
acts independently and communicates its decisions directly to the president; in 
addition to reports and complaints, it also receives suggestions and questions 
from internal and external audiences regarding ethical issues. All information is 
confidentially analyzed, and the Board of Directors is responsible for evaluating 
the applicable measures while considering the presumption of innocence 
and ensuring the personal and professional integrity of those involved. Other 
mechanisms, such as the Customer Support and the Ombudsman Office, are 
also available for stakeholders to report law infringement, misconduct, or 
situations that may result in negative impacts for CCB Brasil.

WHISTLEBLOWER CHANNEL

The Group offers a Whistleblower Channel that is available to 
everyone who has guaranteed freedom of access, anonymously 
or not, and which aims to make any communication that is 
in disagreement with laws or regulations or that not meet 
expectations of treatment.

External email: comite.etica@br.ccb.com

Corporate website: www.br.ccb.com/Fale-Conosco

Internal audiences can make reports through a specific e-mail or 
directly on the intranet.

Retaliation of any kind due to reports being made is not allowed.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

GRI 3-3

In order to offer a great customer relationship experience and fulfill the goal of 
maintaining long-term partnerships, CCB Brasil developed the Ombudsman 
Policy and Manual, which determine the compliance with, and improvement of 
the internal guidelines associated with the topic. The requests from customers 
help the process of reviewing the bank’s practices as well as its portfolio of 
products and services, and they are fundamental to ensure excellence in all 
levels associated with the relationship with customers.

In line with the rules established by the Central Bank of Brazil and the Banking Self-
Regulation System of the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban), a mandatory

customer satisfaction survey is offered by telephone after any interaction with 
the organization to evaluate the customer service. This tool allows the quick 
and efficient identification of flaws and problems that may be harmful to the 
institution, thus helping in the implementation of new strategies. The qualitative 
and quantitative results of this survey are available on CCB Brasil’s website,  this 
content is also forwarded by the Director in charge of the Ombudsman Office 
to the internal audit, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors through 
the Ombudsman Office’s biannual report.

Up until 2021, the Central Bank of Brazil provided transparency to society about 
these topics by preparing a document with the received data featuring banks, 
financial and payment institutions that provided Ombudsman services with 
greater quality and agility. Since 2017, the year in which CCB Brasil started 
its activities, the institution has maintained a leading position, ranking first in 
service quality in the first, third and fourth quarters of last year. Regarding the 
list of financial institutions with the highest number of complaints, disclosed 
by the same entity, CCB Brasil did not make the list in 2022, which reflects its 
commitment to an ethical relationship with customers.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

GRI 3-3, 418-1

Supported by a consistent corporate governance system and a solid due 
diligence process, CCB Brasil’s management of its relationship with stakeholders 
is guided by data security. The bank’s technological structure is committed to 
the responsible handling of personal information, in line with the General Data 
Protection Regulation (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados – LGPD) and the bank’s 
Privacy and Data Protection Policy, both of which establish rules for collection, 
processing, sharing, transmission, erasure and usage of data. Maintaining privacy 
is a corporate commitment; this commitment ensured that, in 2021 and 2022, 
there were no reports of incidents or complaints of customer information having 

been leaked. In line with best practices, CCB Brasil never transfers personal, 
sensitive, or confidential data of its stakeholders to headquarters without the 

due approval and knowledge of its clients.

There were no reports of incidents or complaints of data leakage 
in 2021 and 2022

Being aware of the speed of digital transformations and the need to adapt 
to new market demands, the bank works to offer stakeholders technological 
strategies that provide the best relationship. CCB Brasil’s infrastructure is regularly 
evaluated, as is its e-banking structure, a digital self-service channel that offers 
ease and convenience to use the available banking services. As the bank is 
attentive to new opportunities for improvements in terms of software, hardware, 
and automation, it joins debates in the Technology and Cybersecurity committees 
of the Brazilian Association of Banks (ABBC) and in the Technology Committee 
of the Brazilian Association of International Banks (ABBI).

Throughout the most intense periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, VPN and 
remote access solutions were essential to maintaining CCB Brasil’s routine 
activities amidst social isolation, giving employees the ability to perform their 
duties remotely from home. These efforts ensured the safety of both the internal 
stakeholders and the institution itself. The same concern was observed during 
the gradual return of employees to on-site work, a process that was completed 
in April 2022, a moment of re-adaptation that relied on the essential support of 
the IT Department.

RISK MANAGEMENT

All processes related to risk management are monitored and audited by the 
Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), which requires that institutions have governance 
models with specific structures to manage social-environmental and climate 
risks, as indicated through its new regulation, disclosed in September 2021. 
The parent company is also committed to being attentive to this topic, as 
China’s banking regulatory commission requires that financial institutions 
comply with guidelines related to the environment. However, even before 
these legal obligations, CCB Brasil already approached sustainability in a 
strategic manner in the way it conducts business, as it understands that social, 
environmental and governance impacts can also turn into financial risks.

In order to participate in important debates on the subject with other institutions 
and individuals, the bank’s Social-Environmental Risk Division annually 
participates in the National Financial Education Week (ENEF) promoted by 
the Brazilian Financial Education Forum (FBEF). In 2022, this initiative – which 
offers seminars, courses, workshops, campaigns, and other different formats 
of free activities on the subject – was held between 12 and 18 December; the 
year’s main topic was Financial Resilience.

SUSTAINABILITY IN BUSINESS

GRI 2-12, 3-3, FS1, FS16

Sustainable development is a commitment for CCB Brazil, a reality that can 
only be achieved through corporate action based on the respect for ESG 
practices. With a low appetite for social-environmental, climate and credit 
risks, the bank relies on a structure that promotes the permanent evolution 
of the control and mitigation of impacts caused by customers, suppliers and 
its own performance, which is expressed in its Risk Appetite Statement (RAS).

More than complying with policies, rules and procedures established by 
legislation, institutions need to recognize their social role and understand 
that contributions to the environment and future generations is everyone’s 
duty. To this end, CCB Brasil encourages its stakeholders to act ethically and 
transparently, in accordance with regulations, thus contributing toward the 
respect for human rights, healthy relationships in the work environment, the 
fight against corruption and the promotion of diversity. Supported by its Risk 
Management Department, which works in integration with different areas of the 
business and is organized into Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, Market & Capital, and 
Social-environmental and Climate Risk divisions, the institution continuously 
improves its processes for risk assessment, control and monitoring.

Governance is directly involved in this dynamic, deliberating through the Board 
of Directors, Executive Board and Committees on matters related to sustainable 
development, thus ensuring the alignment of risk management policies with 
CCB Brasil’s strategies and values. The Risk Committee, which assembles 
monthly, is responsible for identifying the main threats and challenges to the 
execution of the bank’s activities with the objective of mitigating possible 
impacts triggered by the provision of its products and services.

RISK ASSESSMENT

GRI 3-3, 207-2, 308-1, 308-2, 408-1, 409-1, 414-1, 414-2, FS2, FS3, FS5, FS9, FS10

Compared to same-size banks, CCB Brasil is among the pioneers in the social-
environmental assessment of suppliers and customers; it adopts internal standards 
of control and integrated monitoring of risks. With the support of this structure 
and of the Compliance area, the institution ensures that the relationship with 
stakeholders always considers the environmental, social and economic impacts 
that are either directly or indirectly promoted by the established contracts, which 
contain specific clauses on these subjects.

All steps toward granting credit to customers are defined by a strict due diligence 
process, which systematically verifies the risks involved in these operations. Upon 
registration, the Social-Environmental Risk Division performs a complete analysis 
of the client company, through which it verifies the compliance with various 
legal requirements, including compliance with current legislation as well as the 
occurrence of harmful actions toward the environment. As most of the bank’s 
corporate clients come from the agribusiness sector, assessing climate risks is 
also of great interest to the institution. The results influence the acceptance or 
rejection to provide products and services; the decision is made in line with CCB 
Brasil’s profile and the values of business sustainability, social and corporate 
responsibility, and respect for the environment, which are present in the bank’s 
Sustainability Policy.

The existence of contractual clauses to prevent forced and child labor in all of 
the businesses that are developed by the institution are a fundamental part of 
this process, which ensures that companies that appear on the TEI (Trabalho 
Escravo e Infantil, or Forced and Child Labor) list are immediately banned. 
Organizations that have already appeared in the list are closely monitored, and 
links are immediately severed with any stakeholder that is involved in incidents 
of this kind.

Such aspects also influence the relationship with suppliers, which are particularly 
concentrated in the service sector, thus confirming CCB Brasil’s commitment to 
risk management in different spheres. In the last three years, all of the institution’s 
new suppliers were chosen based on environmental and social criteria, with the 
goal of mitigating risks in how they provide services to the bank. In 2022, 11 
of these 226 partners were identified as causing actual or potential negative 
impacts, and the bank is analyzing improvements to be agreed with them 
regarding the observed issues and monitoring them periodically.

100% of new suppliers in the last three years were also selected 
according to social-environmental criteria

In addition to going through the social-environmental risk assessment, the 
activities performed by the bank and the relationships it builds are permeated 
by assessments of credit, liquidity, market and capital risks to meet the interests 
of shareholders and the financial health of CCB Brasil. Risks related to reputation, 
operations, information security, and prevention of money laundering and the 
financing of terrorism are additional sensitive topics that are responsibly and 
transparently monitored to prevent any criminal activity within the organization.

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RATING

GRI 2-16, FS10

CCB Brasil’s clients are rated according to three levels of social-environmental 
risk, these categories help the periodic assessments that are performed by the 
Social-Environmental Risk Division to manage the impacts that are associated 
with credit granting. To consolidate the rating of each client, the institution uses a 

RATING A | High risk

Customers whose activities carry a greater 
risk potential and thus require more careful 
analysis, as their impact can be unprecedented 
or irreversible. This group includes sectors and 
subsectors of the industries of agricultural 
pesticides and fertilizers, tanneries, 
infrastructure (such as road and power 
plant construction), cargo transport, energy 
production and distribution, etc.

RATING B | Medium Risk

This range comprises clients operating in 
industries with considerable risks, but which 
rely on responsible social-environmental 
management that is capable of mitigating 
possible impacts. This rating includes 
stakeholders from sectors and subsectors of 
the industries of food, agricultural products, 
engineering services, etc.

RATING C | Low risk

Clients with lower-risk businesses are part of this 
group, which includes technical, administrative, 
and financial consulting services, educational 
institutions, holding companies, and the 
wholesale/retail trade sectors, among others, 
which have responsible social-environmental 
management.

activity with its legal compliance structure. All the criteria that are applicable to 
this process are described in the bank’s Social and Environmental Rating Manual.

By the end of the year, CCB Brasil’s portfolio had 19.5% of clients 
rated “A” (High Risk) and 80.5% rated “B+C” (Medium and  
Low Risk).

Regarding those stakeholders with A-rating risk, the bank requires specific 
documentation that safeguards its interests and prevents possible non-
compliance reports at the level of self-regulation rules and the legislation of 
the various related regulatory spheres. However, with careful assessments and 
constant monitoring, there was a reduction in the number of CCB Brasil clients 
associated with this range of higher social-environmental risk, which highlights 
the commitment of the institution’s management to reducing impacts arising 
from the provision of its products and services. Of all those who underwent the 
social-environmental risk analysis in 2022, 49% had their ratings either reclassified 
or revised, with 3% of cases referring to specific reclassifications defined by the 
board in the Risk Committee.

Seeking to improve the Social-Environmental Rating analysis, the institution is 
adapting its assessment in accordance with BACEN’s Resolution 4943, from 15 
September 2021, by including a fourth level of rating: D – Irrelevant Risk. The 
results of the implementation of this new level will be reported in the next cycle.

EMISSIONS AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION

GRI 3-3, 201-2, 302-1, 305-1, 305-2, 305-3

The largest share of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with CCB 
Brasil’s activities comes from indirect sources, which does not exempt the bank 
from its responsibility to control these pollutants. Since climate change is a topic 
of extreme importance for the current times and future generations, the institution 
understands that it is essential to adopt measures that encourage a low-carbon 
economy and the conscious and responsible use of resources, in line with good 
ESG practices. This topic is systematically monitored by the Social-Environmental 
Risk Division, which works according to internal policies that are based on the 
principles of adaptation, mitigation, and compensation.

In 2021, the bank adopted the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program tool, coordinated 
by FGVces, which offers a globally recognized methodology for managing 
emissions; by doing so, the bank reiterates its commitment to transparency and 
the continuous improvement of internal GHG management processes, in addition 
to publicly disclosing its emissions inventory. By contributing to reducing the 
likelihood of adverse climate events, CCB Brasil positions itself as an institution 
that is committed to sustainability, thus ensuring the continuity of its business 
and the mitigation of social-environmental risks arising from the provision of its 
products and services.

Total 115.53 92.90

Emissions of biogenic CO2 (t) 6.95 24.12

This comprises the operational limits of the entire CCB Brasil conglomerate

The large decrease in direct emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent, which 
are part of Scope 1, from 125.59 tCO2 in 2021 to 20.50 tCO2 in 2022, is mainly 
due to a change in the way the information is reported. In 2021, CCB Brasil was 
conservative while compiling data and shared the total GHG emissions of the 
entire building complex where its headquarters are located, and not just the 
emissions related to its offices. The significant difference was also achieved due 
to the lack of need to recharge generators, which mitigated the impacts related 
to polluting gases.

Regarding Scope 2, which concerns indirect emissions from energy acquisition 
in metric tons of CO2 equivalent, a quantity of 68.74 tCO2-eq was observed 
in 2022, which is a much lower value than what was identified in the last year. 
Regarding Scope 3, which refers to the total of other indirect emissions in metric 
tons of CO2 equivalent, the accumulated value for this report’s base date is 92.90 
tCO2-eq, which is below the 115.53 tCO2-eq amassed in 2021. Such data reflect 
the bank’s efforts to promote eco-efficiency actions that reduce the impacts of its 
operations on climate and the atmosphere, which reflects our risk-management-
based governance model.

Simultaneously with the process of controlling and monitoring the emission 
of Greenhouse Gases, the bank has a strategic plan that aims to encourage 
sustainable businesses and the generation of renewable energy. In line with 
the parent company’s policies, which encourage operations to grant credit 
to the solar and wind energy and biofuels sectors, the institution sees great 
opportunities in supporting these sectors, whether from a financial perspective 
or to contribute to the country’s energy transition. In synergy with this movement, 
the bank is improving its internal processes to measure climate risks, which have 
already been approved by the Risk Committee and the necessary departments 
and will be put into practice later this year.

* Electricity consumption is obtained from the value in kWh shown in the electricity bills of 
the offices and building complex (common use) where the agencies, headquarters, and 
CCB Financeira are located. Some agencies do not have access to the building complex’s 
common use electricity bill. For these cases, we attributed the average common use 
electricity consumption by other agencies.

** Accumulated gasoline and diesel fuel. It considers receipts from fueling CCB’s fleet of 
cars divided by the monthly average for the city of São Paulo, based on the prices listed 
by the ANP, as well as the fuel used in the generators at the CCB headquarters and the 
ideal fraction of fuel used in the common-use generators in the branches’ office buildings.

Regarding the organization’s own electricity consumption,* in 2022 CCB Brasil 
saw a reduction of approximately 34% compared with the previous year; this 
percentage does not include renewable sources. Regarding the use of fuel**  
to ensure business travel and commutes by employees, a decrease of almost 
40% was observed in this report’s base year compared to 2021. These significant 
decreases, however, underline the bank’s commitment to good ESG practices 
when it comes to the responsible use of energy resources, highlighting the 
positive results provided by social-environmental risk management policies.

RECOGNIZING PEOPLE

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

People are CCB Brasil’s main asset, and they are responsible for the standard  
of excellence in the bank’s business. The staff is composed by talented 
professionals who are committed to achieving strategic objectives and dedicate 
their time to deliver the best products and solutions to customers. Offering 
excellent work conditions to the internal stakeholders is a commitment of the 
institution, which practices the management of human resources based on three 
pillars: professional development, adequate compensation, and quality of the 
work environment.

As a Chinese bank operating in Brazil, the institution prioritizes the cultural 
integration between the two countries, as it understands that this exchange 
promotes diversity and strengthens the connection between employees. The idea 
of a shared spirit to achieve business success is part of CCB Brasil’s organizational 
culture, which promotes its ESG values and practices in line with the challenges 
that are inherent to the reality of each nation. Recognizing the fundamental role 
of each individual in this process, the organization encourages in its employees 
the feeling of a sense of belonging and pride, recognizing their achievements, 
challenges and opportunities on a daily basis.

INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS PROFILE

GRI 2-7, 401-1, 405-1

CCB Brasil has a team of 407 people, including permanent employees and 
temporary workers, in addition to 43 contractors, in subsidiaries and agencies 
across seven regions in the country and one abroad. The permanent employees are 
distributed in teams across the following areas: Operational (111), Administrative 
(271), Management (21), and President and Senior Management (4). 

Compared to the previous year, in 2022 the percentage of women working at 
the bank grew by 2.3%, reaching 42.75% of the total staff, a number driven by 
the 55.29% increase in the hiring of women in the same period. The institution is 
currently undergoing an organizational restructuring, which explains the 85 new 
hires and 100 dismissals in the year in question. The increase in the voluntary 
turnover rate is associated with 70 departures, while 30 departures are associated 
with involuntary terminations.

REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS
GRI 2-19, 2-20, 2-21, 2-30, 3-3, 202-1, 401-2, 401-3, 405-2

CCB Brasil’s fixed and variable salary policy is in line with market standards 
and is periodically evaluated to meet the best practices adopted by financial 
institutions. With the individual performance assessment, carried out annually in 
all departments, branches and subsidiaries, the bank is committed to recognizing 
the work performed by employees through its Profit-Sharing Program (PPR), 
while also taking their needs and expectations into consideration. In 2022, 
the ratio between the base salary and compensation received by women in 
management positions and that received by men was 1.16, a significant increase 
when analyzing the previous year. Considering all the positions held by women, 
the corresponding minimum salary on the base date of this report represents 
28.19% of the lowest salary received by women in the organization, compared 
to 27.90% of the lowest salary received by men.

Regarding the guidelines that govern the compensation of its managers, CCB 
Brasil fully complies with Resolution Nr. 3921 of the Central Bank of Brazil 
(BACEN), which defines policies associated with the topic. It should be noted 
that the payment of salaries, fees, commissions, and variable compensation, 
among others, is also linked to the organization’s objectives and strategies 
regarding the management of its economic, environmental, and social impacts, 
always favoring transparency, integrity, and the maintenance of financial health.

In 2022, the ratio between the highest paid individual’s total annual compensation 
and the average annual total compensation of all employees (excluding the 
highest paid) was 23.36%. The Senior Management, interns, young apprentices, 
and expatriates were not considered in this calculation, precisely because of 
the specificities of labor legislation and conditions. The same happened in 
the calculation of the ratio between the percentage increase in total annual 
compensation of the highest paid individual in the organization and the average 
percentage increase in total annual compensation of all employees (excluding 
the highest paid), which both suffered a reduction of 8.9% and 6.3%, respectively.

All permanent employees of CCB Brasil, who are governed by the Consolidation 
of Labor Laws (CLT), are entitled to a benefits package that includes: standard 
and complementary life insurance, education insurance, funeral assistance, health 
and dental care coverage, accident insurance, maternity and paternity leaves, 
retirement plan, gym membership, daycare and/or babysitting allowance, food 
and meal stipends, transportation allowance, additional end-of-year food stipend, 
complementary illness and injury disability coverage, night shift commute, and 
help with professional reskilling, among others.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

GRI 3-3, 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-6, 403-7, 403-8

A work environment that prioritizes the well-being and quality of life of employees 
and provides health and safety in the context of their work activities is essential 
for the success of the business. At CCB Brasil, the attention to these matters is 
treated with the necessary seriousness; it is an integral part of the corporate 
culture, present in numerous initiatives to support the internal stakeholders. 
In addition to complying with current legislation, the bank promotes constant 
investments to ensure that its employees are provided an efficient, welcoming, 
and healthy work routine.

Considering the main norms of the Ministry of Labor that govern the theme, these 
efforts by the bank stand out: the PCMSO – Occupational Health Medical Control 
Program (NR 7), related to the set of procedures for the prevention and early 
diagnostic of damage to health resulting from work; the PGR – Risk Management 
Program (NR 1), related to the process of Occupational Risk Management 
through communication and multidisciplinary actions; the AET – Ergonomic 
Analysis (NR 17), which establishes rules for the mitigation of occupational risks 
related to ergonomics; and CIPA – Internal Commission for Accident Prevention 
(NR 5), which is responsible for the prevention of accidents and work-related 
illnesses. In line with the best practices related to the subject, the institution 
uses the SOC Occupational Management system, which is certified by the ISO 
27001 Information Security Standard and covers all workforce (employees and 
contractors).

At CCB Brasil, no workers are exposed to a high incidence or high risk of 
illnesses related to their occupation; however, there is systematic monitoring 
and evaluation of such issues through the bank’s Occupational Medicine supplier, 
which is responsible for annual inspections to map possible risks in the bank’s 
premises. The institution’s Occupational Safety team participates in the control 
and implementation of the necessary changes, always aiming at the quality of 
life of the internal stakeholders, who can report problems or complaints related 

to the topic to the Ethics Committee and the Human Resources Department, 
without fear of retaliation.

To monitor the health condition of its workers and provide a quick response to 
clinical events, the organization offers outpatient, medical, psychological, and 
nursing care on its premises. Additionally, throughout the year, various activities 
are performed through the Health Promotion Program with a focus on the well-
being of workers, such as campaigns for: vaccination; prevention of AIDS and 
breast and prostate cancer; handling stress; anti-smoking; and encouraging 
healthy eating habits. CCB Brasil also has an internal communication tool, the 
Corporate Portal, to address topics related to the dissemination of best practices 
and appropriate conduct.

There are also initiatives to raise awareness about security, preventive healthcare, 
and quality of life under the responsibility of the security committees structured 
by the members of the CIPA, who represent all the bank’s workforce. In 2022, 
the commission offered a course to employees on the following topics: study 
of the environment, working conditions and risks arising from the production 
process, as well as accidents and occupational diseases related to the premises; 
investigation and analysis methodology of occupational accidents and diseases; 
basic knowledge about AIDS and preventive measures; basic knowledge about 
labor and social security legislation that addresses safety and health at work; how 
CIPA is organized; general principles of occupational hygiene and risk control 
measures. Additionally, CIPA organized training sessions for the Fire Brigade, 
building evacuation drills, and the Internal Occupational Accident Prevention 
Week (SIPAT); these activities are promoted annually.

EDUCATION AND TRAINING

GRI 2-17, 2-24, 3-3, 404-1, 404-2, 404-3, FS4

CCB Brasil is committed to the professional and personal development of its 

internal stakeholders, as it understands that skilling its workforce is a strategy to 

retain talent and promote career advancement. With the support of the Human 

Resources Department, the bank offers training in different aspects related to 

business, behavior, regulations, and sustainability. In 2022 alone, the institution’s 

employees received workshops and courses, as well as educational incentives, 

which promoted the improvement of their skills.

In 2022, six types of learning programs were put into practice by the organization for 

the internship, young apprenticeship, operational, administrative, management, and 

executive board areas, in a total of 190 hours of training and an average of almost 

14,77 hours per person. The decrease in hours compared to 2021 was due to the 

return to on-site activities at the bank, which allowed the internal stakeholders to 

be reaccustomed to on-site work and a return to normal work routines.

Internal On-site/Video-conference Training

Held either inside or outside the institution’s premises, with either internal or 
contracted instructors, these are always offered under the guidance of the 
Human Resources Department, and with content established by the managers 
who requested the training.

Internal E-learning Training

Offered internally at the bank through the online learning platform Portal 
EducaRHoje, with both content and course development under the responsibility

Financial education and sustainability, including green finance, are two widely 
addressed topics in the training sessions provided by the institution, as they 
are directly aligned with the specificities and challenges faced by the bank’s 
businesses, as well as ethics, compliance and prevention of money laundering, 
corruption, and terrorism. Additionally, the workforce can also request specific 
training according to their interests, as long as those are in line with their activities 
and are justified to the management of their department. For CCB Brasil, the 
pursuit of knowledge directly influences high individual performance and the 
success of the business as a whole.

The workforce’s first contact with training cycles happens shortly after admission, 
when they join the Corporate Integration Program, an initiative to share 
information related to the bank’s rules as well as its values, mission, vision, and 
social-environmental risk management policies. Professionals are evaluated in 

terms of their performance and development throughout their entire time at the 
institution, in order to monitor their professional development.

Finally, aiming to assist with career transition, retirement plans, and contractual 
termination, CCB Brasil keeps the following commitments: before a dismissal 
takes effect, the Human Resources Department evaluates options for a possible 
internal rotation for the employee; when dismissals occur due to restructuring or 
cost reduction, the Human Resources Department keeps the CVs of professionals 
with an above-average performance assessment for future opportunities; bank 
clerks who are dismissed without just cause receive support to enroll in courses 
offered by private entities, educational institutions, or labor union entities.

SPECIAL DATES

To promote the cultural integration between Brazil and China, the bank sends 
several announcements related to special dates for both nations throughout the 
year. The announcements, sent to employees through internal channels, provide 
context about these celebrations and highlight their historical relevance and the 
fundamental role they play for each society.

Important events such as the Chinese New Year, Lantern Festival, Dragon Boat 
Festival, and Chongyang Festival gained prominence throughout 2022 and offered 
employees the opportunity to learn more about Chinese traditions. Additionally, 
during the Moon Festival and the Western Christmas and New Year, employees 
received special announcements as well as gift cards worth BRL 200 and BRL 500, 
respectively; these gifts are part of initiatives to reward the workforce that are 
regularly promoted by CCB Brasil.

The Moon Festival, also known as the Mid-Autumn Festival, is held on the 15th day 
of the 8th month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, it combines local symbols and 
legends to encourage family and friends to come together. This celebration, whose 
roots can be traced back to agrarian regions of China, originated so the population 
could show their gratitude to the moon for the harvest; currently, it is marked by 
the release of paper lanterns that adorn and color the skies of the country.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

In 2022, the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continued to influence 

business decisions across countries, including within the scope of CCB Brasil. 

By maintaining a more conservative attitude regarding the granting of credit, 

the bank managed to offer unrestricted support to clients through constant 

monitoring and evaluations of the economic sectors linked to the stakeholders. 

The health of the loan portfolio was treated as a priority to guarantee the 

excellence of the products and services provided by the institution, in particular 

to companies in the Corporate and Large Corporate segments.

This stance aligns directly with CCB Brasil’s tax strategy, whose objective is also 

the strict compliance with tax rules and respect for ESG, as well as the payment 

of all taxes and contributions as established by law. To act in favor of sustainable 

development, in all its spheres, also requires having a financial policy that is 

committed to ethics, integrity, and transparency, values that are part of the 

bank’s organizational culture. The institution’s economic and financial topics 

are managed by senior governance and the Tax Affairs area; they are guided 

and audited by the best market practices.

By offering resources to corporations in sectors such as agribusiness, energy, 

oil and gas, industry, mining, construction, retail, chemicals, and services, CCB 

Brasil contributes to the social and economic development of the regions where 

these clients operate, the institution also contributes toward the advancement 

of environmental topics, as the careful risk assessment carried out by the 

bank ensures that its customers are not promoting negative impacts on the 

environment and society. From the understanding that it is possible to increase 

benefits through the offer of its products and services, in the coming years the 

bank intends to establish its own initiatives and projects to help build a more 

sustainable reality for future generations.

MAIN RESULTS OF 2022

Credit operations reached BRL 11.1 billion, an increase of 6.7% compared to 2021 

(BRL 10.4 billion), especially those with companies in the Corporate and Large 

Corporate segments.

The share of loans that were rated AA-C (lower risk credit range) also grew compared 

to the previous year; they represented 97% of the portfolio (95.9% in 2021).

The central office’s resources represented 29.4% (30.1% in 2021) of CCB Brasil’s 

total funding of BRL 18.2 billion, which comprises market funding, borrowing and 

onlending obligations, and capital-eligible debt instruments.

Consolidated gross income from financial intermediation reached BRL 425.1 

million, compared to BRL 428.6 million in 2021.

Consolidated shareholders’ equity reached BRL 1.1 billion, and the reference 

equity was BRL 2.0 billion, what caused the Basel Ratio to reach 15.9% (above the 

10.5% minimum required by Brazil’s Central Bank – BACEN).

3. Governance 2-20 Process to determine remuneration - -

CCB Brasil has a Compensation 
Committee that focuses solely 
on the remuneration of the 
executives. Other compensation 
policies follow a supply and 
demand logic; that is, they are 
in line with the market averages. 
Definition of bonuses and 
awards is analyzed by HR and the 
Executive Board, including the 
Chairman. Profit-sharing bonuses 
(PSB) are determined following 
regulatory principles. Additionally, 
an annual Profit-Sharing Program 
(PSP) bonus is also analyzed 
and determined by directors; 
it can also be evaluated by the 
Board of Directors and the Head 
Office. Shareholders are part of 
the PSP evaluation and analyze 
the distribution of bonuses as a 
whole, while the union specifically 
evaluates the PSP and the PSB.
