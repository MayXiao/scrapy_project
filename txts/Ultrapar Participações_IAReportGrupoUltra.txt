OUR WORLD DEMANDS 
A NEW PACE

Our net revenue in 2022 was R$ 147 billion,
24% higher than in 2021, and we increased our sales  
in all our businesses.”

PEDRO  
WONGTSCHOWSKI
Chairman of the  
Board of Directors

The Ultra Group made significant 

progress in 2022. Despite the market 

volatility and uncertainties, Ultragaz 

and Ultracargo achieved record results, 

and Ipiranga continued to advance in 

recovering its profitability. The focus on a 

higher level of sophistication in our pricing 

and the increased effort to improve the 

engagement of our network, together 

with important operational changes 

and adjustments in our logistics and 

purchasing, enabled us to achieve a 

higher level of efficiency, and prepared us 

for a new phase of growth.

We completed the most wide-ranging 

process of rationalization of our portfolio 

in our history, with the completion of the 

divestments of Oxiteno and Extrafarma 

in April and August 2022, respectively. 

We announced the acquisitions of Stella 

Energia and NEOgás, which marked 

Ultragaz’s entry into the renewable 

electricity and compressed natural 

gas segments, expanding its range of 

products and services and enhancing its 

distribution capability, sales strength and 

brand name.

We continued to implement the 

succession and renewal process in our 

senior management and started the 

succession process for the Board of 

Directors. The Board will undergo a major 

renewal in April this year with the election 

of a new Chairman and members for the 

term of 2023 to 2025.

In 2022, we made progress in our 

ESG journey, with the preparation 

of a detailed ESG Plan for 2030, an 

essential component of the strategic 

plans of each of the businesses. This 

plan defines the Group’s commitments, 

ambitions and targets for the coming 

years and performance against the plan 

will represent one third of the individual 

variable compensation goals of the 

Ultra Group’s senior management. The 

plan’s targets were officially disclosed to 

external stakeholders in March 2023.

We are publishing this report to 

demonstrate and reinforce our 

commitment to doing business in line 

with the ten principles of the UN Global 

Compact, in the areas of human rights,

employment, the environment, and 

anti-corruption. We are demonstrating 

how we integrate these principles in our

business strategy, organization culture 

and day-to day operations, and also how 

we are contributing to achieving the UN 

Sustainable Development Goals. 

At year-end 2022 we recorded net 

revenue of R$ 147 billion, 24% higher than 

for 2021, even after the divestments of 

the results of Oxiteno and Extrafarma, 

with revenue growth in all the businesses. 

The Group achieved a recurring EBITDA 

of R$ 4.0 billion and net income of R$1.8 

billion in 2022, of which R$ 506 million 

were distributed as dividends and interest 

on equity to shareholders. 

We would like to highlight the reduction 

in our financial leverage, which is timely 

considering the current challenging 

macroeconomic context and the 

availability of investment opportunities 

with good returns. Our leverage decreased 

to 1.7x on December 31st, 2022 compared 

to 2.9x on December 31, 2021, due mainly 

to a combination of the completion of the 

sales of Oxiteno and Extrafarma and the 

operational improvements made in all the 

businesses. We used part of the proceeds 

from the sale of Oxiteno to pay interest 

on shareholders’ equity and to partially 

repurchase bond issues. The latter 

contributed to optimizing the management 

of our financial liabilities by reducing the 

carrying cost of the Group’s net debt. 

which reduced to 109% of the interbank 

deposit rate (CDI) in 2022 compared to 

129% of the CDI in 2021. We would like to 

emphasize that we still have receivables of 

approximately R$ 1.1 billion related to the 

above-mentioned divestments.

It was in this context, in December, that 

we announced our investment plan 

for 2023 totaling R$ 2.2 billion, which 

exceeded the amounts invested in each 

of the last five years. Around half of the 

amount will be allocated to expansion 

projects at Ipiranga, Ultragaz and 

Ultracargo, in addition to investments 

in the maintenance and safety of the 

operational units.

In 2023, with a committed senior 

management team and stronger 

businesses, we are well prepared to 

continue on our journey of growth and 

value creation. We would like to thank 

all our employees for their commitment 

and dedication during the year, and also 

our other stakeholders for their trust and 

contributions to the Group’s progress.

ABOUT
THE REPORT

This report, published on March 17th, 

2023, presents the main initiatives and 

consolidated results of the Ultra Group, 

namely, Ultrapar and its main subsidiaries 

Ultragaz, Ultracargo and Ipiranga, for the 

period from January 1st to December 31st 

2022. The information on the composition of 

the workforce now also included data for the 

abastece aí, AmPm and Iconic operations.  

To ensure transparency and clarity in our 

disclosures to our main stakeholders, namely, 

shareholders, employees, customers, 

suppliers, the surrounding communities 

and society in general, we have prepared 

the report  in accordance with the Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and 

indicated the correlations with the 17 United 

Nations (UN) Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs). In addition, we have followed 

the relevant guidelines of the Sustainability 

Accounting Standards Board (SASB), 

Technical Guideline OCPC 09 – Integrated 

Reporting and the Task Force on Climate 

Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

The report is divided into three parts: 

Sustainable Business, where we have 

presented the Group’s ESG Plan for 2030;  

The Ultra Group, in which we have provided 

an overview of the Group’s business model; 

and, finally, the Portfolio of Companies, 

section, in which we have presented the 

highlights of the results and initiatives of 

the Group’s main companies.

The Group’s performance has been 

presented according to metrics and 

indicators that follow the above-mentioned 

international standards, as well as through 

a number of ratings and indices. The Ultra 

Group’s performance in these indices and 

ratings can be accessed here.

In the next section, Sustainable Business, 

we have provided information on the Group’s 

material topics. Our materiality matrix was 

constructed based on consultations with 

representatives of the Ultra Group’s main 

stakeholder groups through an online survey. 

The main groups consulted were: senior 

management (Board Members, CEOs and 

Directors); shareholders and investors; 

employees; regulatory and supervisory bodies; 

sectoral and civil society entities; and the media. 

It should be mentioned that, for the second 

consecutive year, the report has been 

underwent limited assurance procedures by an 

external auditor. The content of the report was 

also reviewed by the Ultra Group’s directorates 

for Sustainability and Communication, and 

Finance and Investor Relations, which are the 

areas directly responsible for the reported 

information

DEFINITION OF THE MATERIAL TOPICS

The process of preparing the original 

materiality matrix was based on the 

analysis of: studies on sustainability issues; 

legislation and standards applicable to the 

Group; publications in the media; industry 

studies for the relevant sectors of each 

business; and the positioning in ESG of 

investors, government bodies, and other 

national and international entities. In parallel, 

the reality of each business and its respective 

sectors was evaluated.

In addition, the Ultra Group’s main stakeholder 

groups were consulted through a survey, 

namely: the Board of Directors and the senior 

management of the businesses; shareholders 

and investors; employees; regulatory and 

supervisory bodies; sectoral and civil society 

entities; and the media. After the data was 

consolidated, it was possible to identify the 

most important topics impacting the Ultra 

Group. The Board of Directors then evaluated 

and validated the materiality matrix resulting 

from this process, and the associated long-term 

commitments established by the Group.

In 2021, as part of the process to consolidate the 

Group’s sustainability strategy and to align it with 

its business strategy, the Group’s materiality 

matrix, originally established in 2019, was 

updated. The previously separate topics of data 

privacy and ethics were merged into a more 

comprehensive topic entitled Governance and 

Integrity that takes an overarching perspective of 

the corporate governance structure. 

Although none of the content of the original 

material topics was excluded, the materiality 

matrix was reorganized after the Board 

identified some opportunities to regroup topics, 

or to present them more clearly. As a result, 

the number of material topics in the matrix was

reduced from ten to seven. In the case of the 

pillar for Resources and the Environment, the 

former individual topics of Energy Efficiency 

and Soil and Water Contamination were 

grouped into a single topic denominated Eco-

efficient Operations.

 

 Furthermore, the topic 

entitled Climate Change was replaced by 

Energy Transition, which is more in line with 

the Group’s strategic planning and the sectors 

in which it operates. In the case of the pillar 

for People Management and Development, 

the topics of Work Relations and Diversity 

were combined into a single topic entitled 

Inclusive Culture and Diversity. In relation to 

the pillar for Value Shared with Society, the 

topic entitled Relations with the Surrounding 

Communities was changed to Responsibility 

for the Surrounding Communities, reinforcing 

the Group’s commitment to generate a positive 

impact for these stakeholders.  GRI 2-4

THE ULTRA GROUP’S 
ESG AGENDA 

S
 GRI 3-2

The Ultra Group believes that sustainability is a 

journey rather than a destination. Addressing 

sustainability themes appropriately is essential 

to the long-term continuity of our businesses and 

our performance in them must be continuously 

improved. Furthermore, they have been 

formalized through public commitments and 

integrated in our business strategy, aiming to 

create value for all our main stakeholder groups.  

It was in this context that the priority themes 

in our strategic plan were developed. Our 

material topics covered the three ESG pillars 

(environmental, social and governance) and 

represented the most important themes to which 

the Ultra Group must direct its efforts.

As a result of this process, the Group defined 

and consolidated seven material topics, and 

established the respective goals and indicators. 

The process for defining the material topics was 

originally carried out in 2019, and then updated 

in 2021. For more information access the section

ESG GOVERNANCE
In 2022, the Ultra Group took an 

important step in its ESG journey by 

presenting its goals for 2030 to the 

workforce, demonstrating the links to 

the Group’s business strategy. Due to 

the importance of these themes for 

the Group’s long-term success and 

business continuity, sustainability 

goals were included in the composition 

of the executives’ compensation, 

representing one third of their 

individual variable compensation.

The Group has improved its disclosure of 

ESG data and indicators in the quarterly 

earnings releases and in this integrated 

report. This improvement resulted in 

an increase in the number of important 

external awards and recognition. 

THE ULTRA GROUP’S 
SUSTAINABILITY 
JOURNEY

global trends that require it to accelerate 
its own structural transformation. This has

its growth and sustainability foundations.

 

Please find below a summary of the main

RESULTS FOR 2022

In 2022, the Ultra Group reported good 

results in all three of its main companies,      

namely, Ultragaz, Ultracargo and Ipiranga. In 

addition, we completed the largest exercise 

of portfolio rationalization in our history with 

the divestments of Oxiteno and Extrafarma, in 

April and August respectively. 

The highlights of the Investment Plan for 

2022, for each of the businesses were as 

follows:

     

 Ul tragaz expansion of bulk and reseller

ESG INITIATIVES

We have highlighted below the main ESG initiatives of each of the businesses.  

ULTRAGAZ: INNOVATION AND ENERGY SOLUTIONS

The company has consolidated its existing 

strong operation in the LPG market and is 

prepared to pursue new opportunities for 

growth, innovation and diversification. In 2022, 

Ultragaz completed the acquisitions of Stella 

Energia and NEOgás, marking its entry into 

the renewable electricity and compressed 

natural gas market segments.

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE | as a pathway 

to reduce costs and GHG emissions, improve 

safety and customer service: automation of 

bases; delivery of some gas bottles using 

electric tricycles – a pilot program was carried 

out in Recife (PE), with the aim expanding it to 

other regions in the future. 

INNOVATION | Ultragaz as an innovation

platform: process for developing new solutions 

and offering differentiated products and 

services.

 

STANDARDIZATION | Ultragaz developed 

the concept of a standard operations base, 

seeking to standardize the infrastructure 

of all its bases, prioritizing efficiency 

and sustainability. The two most recent 

operations bases, in Miramar (PA) and 

Mucuripe (CE), have already been built 

according to this concept with common 

attributes, such as, reducing heat islands, 

reducing water use, preventing damage to 

the environment and storing and collecting 

recyclable materials. 

 WASTE | in 2022, the company reduced the 

amount of waste generated in operations 

and sent to landfills by 50% and by the end 

of the year, six of its 39 bases had achieved 

the objective of Zero Waste to Landfill.

VEHICLE FLEET | conversion of its fleet 

of light delivery vehicles to run on ethanol, 

and pilot programs to use electric and gas-

powered trucks to transport LPG bottles.

company sees attractive opportunities in 

energy transition and, particularly, in the 

handling of bio-fuels.

ECO-EFFICIENT OPERATIONS AND 
SAFETY | the company made good 

progress in the areas of safety, 

productivity and eco-efficiency by means 

of its Operations System (SOUL) and its 

Digital Transformation Program (Conecta), 

INNOVATION AND EFFICIENCY | 
Ultracargo started using a new vertical 

tank cleaning system that saves 

1,000 liters of water per hour when 

washing tanks, helping to reduce water 

consumption. 

REDUCTION IN FRESH WATER 
WITHDRAWAL | the facilities at the Santos 

(SP) and Itaqui (MA) terminals have been 

adapted to maximize the reuse of rainwater,

electric vehicle (EV) charging points along the 

main highway linking São Paulo (SP) and Rio 

de Janeiro (RJ). In the short term, Ipiranga’s 

strategy has focused on sales recovery and 

improved profitability but, in the medium and 

long terms, it aims to improve its operational 

efficiency and to become a platform for the 

distribution of bio-fuels, thereby continuing to 

fulfil its role of providing mobility services for 

the Brazilian population. 

LOGISTICS OPTIMIZATION PLAN | the 

optimization of the processes to increase 

both efficiency and the level of service; the 

development of trading activities and new 

supply models; and, selective and profitable 

investments, aligned with the strategies 

defined for each region.

was further reinforced in 2022 with the launch 

of Ipiranga’s Golden Rules, which established 

mandatory safety principles that must be 

rigorously followed by both the company’s 

own employees and third-party service 

providers. 

COMMUNITY AND DIVERSITY a 

fundamental pillar in attracting, developing 

and retaining talented employees, which aims 

to develop and diversify the workforce. As an 

expression of the company’s commitment 

to local development, it provides training 

programs for residents of the communities

ECO-EFFICIENT 
OPERATIONS

The Ultra Group considers the efficient 

use of natural resources to be part of its 

management model. It seeks to go beyond 

that which is established by law, and to 

continuously evolve its practices. It aims to 

minimize its impact on the environment, 

reduce its consumption of energy and water 

and decrease waste generation. A reduction 

in these inputs will also contribute directly to 

improving the Group’s cost competitiveness. In 

addition, improving the management of eco-

efficient operations will lead to better relations 

with the authorities, minimize the Group’s legal 

risks and enhance its reputation. 

By making progress in addressing eco-

efficiency challenges, the Group is fostering 

innovation and creativity in the search for 

differentiated market solutions, including with 

partners, other companies in the sector, or on 

its own.

The work group for Eco-efficient Operations 

acts as a platform for exchanging experiences 

and seeking shared solutions between the 

businesses or with external partners that can 

contribute to the Group’s evolution on this topic. 

This work group is composed of employees 

from Ultrapar and the businesses and held 

meetings every two months during 2022. 

The Ultra Group’s risks associated with eco-

efficient operations are mainly regulatory 

and operational risks. For example, the use 

of water, especially in areas of water stress, 

the generation and disposal of waste and the 

GRI 3-3 Management of material topics - Eco-efficient Operations  

contamination of soil and water, all of which can 

result in significant costs. 

The management of environmental impacts 

is carried out through specific policies and 

management systems. The processes for 

the prevention, mitigation and management 

of impacts are centralized, and based on 

international standards. 

Specialist technical teams collect and monitor 

data on the consumption of energy, water, gas, 

diesel and coolant, among other inputs, in order 

to identify the risks and opportunities related to 

eco-efficient operations. 

Each Ultra Group business has a specific 

policy for managing the topic. The 

Sustainability Policies of Ultragaz and  

Ipiranga can be accessed at the links  

here and here respectively.

AMBITION

Ensure a level of excellence in the 
environmental management of 
operations, by the efficient use of 
natural resources and the optimization 
of waste management.

WASTE MANAGEMENT   GRI 306-1 | 306-2 | 306-3

In 2022, a study of waste was carried out at the Group’s 

headquarters to assess the main types generated, 

the methods of collection and the destination of each 

type. Following this study, an action plan was prepared 

with the aim of ensuring the best destination of each 

type of waste, from both social and environmental 

perspectives. It also included a review of the Group’s 

partners, processes and communication. Furthermore, a 

communication plan focused on employee engagement 

is under development, and will be deployed in 2023. By 

monitoring the amount of waste generated by type, it 

will be possible to monitor whether the action plans are 

effective and adjust them when necessary. As a result, 

we expect to reduce the waste destined to landfills, and 

also the usage of single-use recyclable materials, thus 

contributing to achieving the Group’s targets for waste.

The definition of specific targets for waste in the ESG Plan 

for 2030, has resulted in improved structural practices for 

reducing waste in our operations. Gradually, the topic has 

progressed in all our operations, contributing to improved 

performance and reduced impact.

In 2022, the total amount of waste generated by the 

Ultra Group amounted to 29,298 tons, a reduction of 

41% compared to 2021. The reduction of total waste in 

2022 was mainly due to the divestment of Oxiteno and 

Extrafarma, whose amounts of waste were included in 

the total for 2021. 

In Ultrapar, there was an increase 

of 41% in the generation of waste 

in 2022, compared to 2021, due to 

the return of employees to working 

in the office, and the renovations 

carried out on the headquarters 

building aimed at renewing the 

infrastructure. The total waste 

amounted to 103 tons, consisting 

mainly of organic and recyclable 

waste from human activity in the 

operation, with a minor impact on 

the value chain. The data on waste 

generation by type is monitored 

monthly, in order to ensure the 

most appropriate destination of 

each type, considering social and 

environmental factors. Partners 

provide guarantees related to 

recyclable materials and the 

environmentally correct destination 

of waste. Ultrapar’s activities do 

not result in significant amounts of 

waste and 6% of its waste was sent 

for recycling.

Ultragaz, generated 2,034 tons of 

waste in 2022, an increase of 24% 

compared to 2021. The increase in 

volume was due to renovation work 

at the company’s units in São José 

dos Campos (SP) and Mataripe 

(SP). It is worth highlighting that 

77% of the waste was destined for 

recovery, mainly recycling.

The total waste generated in 

Ultracargo was 25,082 tons, a 

reduction of 4% compared to 2021. 

The waste was generated in its port 

terminal operations, and the total 

included the effluents that are in a 

category defined by law as waste. 

Four percent of waste was destined 

for reuse, recycling and other 

treatments such as composting

Ipiranga generated 2,079 tons of 

waste, a reduction of 32% compared 

to 2021. Of this total, 29% were 

destined for recovery operations. In 

Ipiranga’s head office the organic 

waste generated in its restaurant is 

composted and the company has 

maintained a recyclable material 

sorting center for the last seven 

years with the aim of increasing the 

efficiency of the separation of types 

of waste and reducing the amount 

sent to landfills. The company 

also implemented awareness 

actions that aimed to minimize the 

environmental impacts from waste 

by prioritizing the avoidance of 

waste generation, increasing reuse/

recycling processes and reducing 

the amount sent to landfills. One 

of the results of these awareness 

actions was a 70% reduction in 

the number of disposable cups 

purchased by the headquarters.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION MANAGEMENT

In 2022, the total energy consumption of 

the Ultra Group was 485,905 GJ, composed 

of 58,253 GJ from renewable fuel sources, 

244,436 GJ from non-renewable fuel 

sources, and 183,216 GJ from purchased 

energy. There was a significant drop in the 

Group’s total energy consumption compared

to the previous year, mainly due to the 

divestments of Oxiteno and Extrafarma. In 

2022, Ultrapar reduced consumption by 

3,896 GJ, due to no longer utilizing the Ed. 

Margarida Igel building, which it had used 

until 2021.

In 2022, Ultragaz reduced its energy 

consumption by 32,047 GJ, a decrease of 

1.77% compared to 2021. By December, 

90% of its electricity consumption was from 

certificated renewable sources purchased 

in the free energy market. Ultragaz was 

the only Group company to record energy 

consumption outside the organization due 

to the monitoring of the fuel consumption 

of third-party fleets, resellers and employee 

air travel. The company’s total energy 

consumption for 2022 was 1,461,955 GJ, a 

variation of 2% compared to 2021.

Ultracargo’s energy consumption in 2022 

was 68,555 GJ, a reduction of 4% compared 

to 2021. This included the fuel consumption 

of its vehicle fleet and terminal operations, 

and purchased electricity.

As of 2022, Ipiranga’s indicators will be 

accounted for in the operational control 

approach. Thus, energy consumption 

was 86,028.69 GJ, 20% less than 2021, 

excluding data from AmPm and units 

operated by third parties in which Ipiranga 

has an equity interest. 

In 2022, Ultragaz’s energy intensity 

was 0.189 GJ/t of LPG sold. The energy 

intensities of Ultracargo and Ipiranga were 

0.0009 GJ/t of product handled and 0.004 

GJ/t of product sold, respectively. These 

results were not significantly different 

compared to 2021.

 WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
   GRI 303-1 | 303-3 | 303-4 | 303-5  

Ultrapar withdrew fresh water from the local distribution 

network and reused rainwater. Ultracargo’s terminal in Santos 

(SP) occasionally used water delivered by tanker truck. The 

Group is committed to reducing both water consumption and 

the volume of fresh water withdrawn, and this is a priority 

in water-stressed regions. Since its water consumption is 

not large compared to other industrial sectors this theme 

was not included in the Group’s material topics nor has the 

Group assumed public commitments. However, despite this, 

water management is one of the Group’s priorities. Water 

consumption is closely monitored, and there are ongoing 

efforts to reduce it in all the companies.

   GRI 303-4

The Ultra Group’s total water consumption in 2022 

was 70,113 m3. It is worth pointing out that this 

consumption reflected the volume of water withdrawn 

that was effectively used in the operational processes 

of the Group’s businesses and excluded water 

discharged or returned to water bodies.  

Ultrapar has no industrial operations and consumed 

only 1,900 m3, due mainly to evaporation in office air-

conditioning systems. On the other hand, Ultragaz 
and Ipiranga recorded 35,788 m3 and 32,425 m3, 

respectively. Due to the legislation, Ultracargo classified 

its water discharge as waste rather than as effluent.

The total withdrawal of water in 2022 for the Ultra Group 

was 281,523 m3. This represented a reduction of 16% 

compared to 2021.  With regard to the Group’s individual 

businesses, there were reductions in Ultragaz, Ultracargo 

and Ipiranga, of 6%, 24% and 21%, respectively.

In 2022, Ultrapar’s discharge of water increased by 

11% compared to the previous year. The total water 

discharged by the Ultra Group was 137,116 m3, a 

reduction of 21% compared to the previous year. 

One of the main factors for this reduction was the 

disinvestment of Oxiteno and Extrafarma in 2021. 

In the businesses, Ultragaz reduced its discharge 

of water by 24% due to its efforts to reduce water 

consumption in its bases. This resulted from the 

reduced discharge of both domestic and industrial 

effluents. Ipiranga reduced its discharge of water by 

20% in 2022 due to the exclusion of Millenium, Iconic 

and AmPm, which had been included in 2021.

Ultracargo’s total water withdrawal in 2022 represented 

a 24% reduction compared to the previous year. In 

2021, a high volume of surface water was captured for 

hydrostatic tests in tanks in Santos (SP), which was not 

repeated this year in the same proportion.

matrix of material topics, which have also been incorporated 

in the Group’s overall business strategy.

During the year, the Ultra Group undertook a 

comprehensive review of all its activities, with the aim of 

creating a more complementary and synergistic portfolio 

of businesses. As a result, in 2022, the Group completed 

the divestment of its subsidiaries Oxiteno (in April) and 

Extrafarma (in August). The Group is now better prepared 

for a new cycle of growth and long-term value creation.

The Group is now totally engaged in building a better, 

more agile and adaptable organization aimed at long-

term business success by focusing its business activities 

in the energy and infrastructure sectors. To achieve 

this, it seeks to: make its operations safer; serve its 

customers better; promote an integrated perspective 

in decision-making; continue to inspire the confidence 

of its stakeholders; create an increasingly stimulating 

and inclusive environment for employees; and invest 

responsibly with a focus on energy transition.

The Group’s ESG Plan for 2030 was launched in 2022. It is 

composed of seven strategic material topics and it defines 

the commitments and goals for the Group’s ESG actions. 

They cover all the key social, environmental, governance 

and financial factors that are intrinsic to ensuring the 

Group’s long-term business continuity and success. 

In addition, the Ultra Group has aligned the goals and 

targets in the ESG Plan for 2030 with the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals with the intention of contributing to 

the public agenda on sustainability.

GOVERNANCE 
AND INTEGRITY

The Ultra Group believes in the importance of 

governance and integrity for the long-term 

continuity of its business. Its ambition is to be a 

protagonist in these matters, actively seeking to 

positively influence employees, partners, sector 

peers and the general business environment 

in the adoption of best practices in governance 

and ethical conduct. In view of its long history 

and the good reputation it enjoys in society, 

the Ultra Group understands that it has a role 

to play in influencing its value chain. It seeks to 

encourage its business partners to increasingly 

adopt sustainable business practices and to 

strengthen management models that combine 

good financial results with good environmental, 

social and governance practices.

The highlights of the initiatives already 

implemented to achieve these goals were as 

follows:

CREDIBILITY | the Group has an Integrity

Program that follows the guidelines established 

in its Code of Ethics. The program has been 

approved by the Board of Directors and 

is supervised by the Conduct Committee, 

which was established in 2004, and has an 

independent chairman. In 2022, the Code of 

Ethics and the Policy for Anti-Corruption and 

Relations with Public and Private Agents were

revised, and employees were communicated 

and received training on the theme in order 

to disseminate and reinforce the content of 

the updated guidelines. The Group also has 

Corporate Policies for Competitive Practices, 

and Conflict of Interests and Transactions 

with Related Parties. The former contains the 

legislation, best practices and standards for 

fair competition, and the latter sets out the 

guidelines for transparency and independence 

in external relations. All information or decisions 

involving conflict of interests were recorded 

in the committee’s minutes and, respecting 

confidentiality, were made publicly available on 

the Group’s website.

 CULTURE OF INTEGRITY | in order to evolve 

in the development of the organization’s culture 

of integrity, since 2018, the Group has carried 

out regular surveys to measure the level of 

maturity already achieved on the theme.  In 

the last survey, the organization was ranked at 

the second level of the Hearts & Minds Matrix 

and the goal is to evolve even further in the 

coming years. The Integrity Program’s actions 

have used various training formats to promote 

a culture of integrity, and these training courses 

were also made available to business partners 

and critical third parties, to encourage ethical 

behavior in commercial relations.

The Ultra Group analyzed all the reports 

received through the Canal Aberto, including 

cases of discrimination. Reports received 

through other channels were shared with the 

Ultra Integrity area and registered in the Canal 

Aberto, ensuring they were processed in an 

independent, diligent and confidential manner. 

In 2022, 23 reports of discrimination were 

received, an increase compared to the 18 

reports received in 2021. Of the total number 

of reports received, eight were considered 

to contain elements of discrimination, and 

appropriate actions were taken. At year- 

end 2022, two reports were still under 

investigation and 13 had been  

considered to be unsubstantiated.

The consequences included dismissals, 

warnings and monitoring of the employee’s 

conduct by his/her manager and HR, as well as 

guidance, such as training and reinforcement of

the integrity guidelines.

Throughout 2022, the Ultra Group’s 

businesses promoted communication 

campaigns and provided training courses 

aimed at strengthening the organization’s 

culture of integrity, including the fight against 

discrimination. Among the various actions, 

we would highlight the integrity week events 

and the conversation circles promoted by 

the businesses, and the ongoing training 

and guidance provided by managers to their 

operations employees during the Daily Safety 

Dialogues (DSD).

ANTI-CORRUPTION

In 2022, 100% of the Ultra Group’s operations 

were submitted to an assessment of 

risks related to corruption. To organize the 

assessment of the risks, the Group’s business 

activities and operations were first broken down 

into the following sectors: holding company, oil, 

gas and storage. Ultrapar was considered to be 

a single activity, and was fully evaluated using 

a risk matrix prepared by the Risk Management 

area, which reports to the Risks, Integrity and 

Audit Directorate.

The Group’s tools for managing risks 

related to corruption are the Corporate Anti-

Corruption Policy, and a number of specific 

communications on the theme. Further 

measures included: employees received 

periodic training on the theme; anti-corruption 

clauses were included in contracts; an 

integrated risk matrix was used to assess the 

risk of illegal or unethical practices; reputation 

research was carried out before signing 

contracts with business partners, suppliers and 

service providers; payments made to critical 

suppliers and donations and sponsorships 

made by the Ultra Group were monitored as 

was the sharing of sensitive information. 

The Group also shared its integrity initiatives 

with opinion makers and society in general, 

through external publications, such as the 

Integrated Report, Integrity Program Results 

Report, CVM Reference Form, SEC 20-F report, 

presentations and participation in benchmark 

indices. 

In 2022, the Ultra Group did not record any 

confirmed cases of corruption. The Group 

analyzed all the reports received through the 

Canal Aberto, including reports of suspected 

corruption. After the verification of the reports, 

action plans were adopted to address the points 

identified and mitigate the risks involved. 

The Ultra Group is a signatory of the UN Global 

Compact, and has made commitments 

towards contributing to the achievement of 

the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The 

SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions, 

includes the exchange of experiences regarding 

the understanding of the risks and opportunities 

in the fight against corruption.

ADVANCES IN RISK 
MANAGEMENT

  GRI 2-13 | 2-25 | 3-3 Management of material topics -  
Governance and Integrity

The Group’s risk management approach 

follows the guidelines established in the 

Corporate Risk Management Policy, updated 

and approved in 2021 by the Board of 

Directors. This policy defines the main aspects 

of the risks to be monitored, and the risk 

mitigation instruments, as well as the roles 

and responsibilities of those involved in the 

risk management process. Risks are grouped 

into the following categories: Strategic and 

Sustainability; Operational; Financial and 

Capital Markets; and, Integrity and Cyber.

With the support and coordination of the 

Corporate Risk Management area, each 

business conducts discussions and assesses 

scenarios to develop its own risk matrix, based 

on the specific characteristics of its sectors of 

activity. The Corporate Risk Management area 

is responsible for preparing the Ultra Group's 

consolidated risk matrix and validating it with the

CEOs and Directors of the businesses, the Audit 

and Risk Committee and the Board of Directors.

 

In 2022, a detailed evaluation of the Group’s 

risk matrix was carried out in order to ensure it 

was aligned with the material topics. 

As a result, at least one ESG aspect was 

included in the evaluation of each risk category, 

for example, in the case of human capital the 

issue of diversity was added to the list of risks 

applying to the theme of people. 

Another important advance was the 

improvement in our climate risk analysis, by 

incorporating the recommendations of the Task 

Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 

(TCFD). The project teams of Ultrapar and 

the businesses worked together to develop 

methodologies and analyze the risks, establish 

roles and responsibilities for their management, 

and prepare action plans. In 2023, we will 

have the challenge of further improving our 

management of the subject, mainly in the 

evaluation of the possible financial impacts 

arising from climate  

change. 

The identification of our consolidated climate 

risks and the preparation of concrete actions 

on how we should mitigate them, were 

preconditions to support the strategic planning 

process. The next step is to prioritize the climate 

risk mitigation actions to ensure we achieve the 

Group’s established goals, by making all our 

businesses more resilient to climate impacts 

and preparing them for the transition to a low-

carbon economy. The Group has made solid 

progress in establishing an inventory of climate 

risks, and has improved its understanding of 

all risks thanks to the good work done by these 

dedicated project teams. 

In addition, the Internal Audit area 

monitors the procedures and controls of 

all the businesses, identifying risks and 

opportunities. This information is used to 

periodically update the risk matrix and also 

contributes to making ongoing improvements 

to the business risk management process. 

The area also conducts internal operational 

audits based on the Annual Audit Plan 

approved by the Committee for Audit and 

Risks. Furthermore, the area provides 

support for the preparation of the Group’s 

financial statements and the obtention of 

the certification of the organization’s internal 

controls required by the Sarbanes-Oxley 

(SOX) Law, for the United States capital 

markets.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2022  |   

CLASSIFICATION RISK DESCRIPTION RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH

CLIMATE RISK MATRIX

Energy Transition 
Risk: Regulatory

Carbon pricing -  
voluntary market

As a major player in the Oil and Gas sector, the Ultra Group understands the importance of carbon pricing and 
it already offsets part of its carbon emissions in the voluntary market. Ipiranga, for example, has been carbon 
neutral since 2014. With the fluctuations in the price of carbon in the voluntary market, as well as in the stocks 
of available credits, the Group is exposed to the risk of increased costs in acquiring credits.

The Ultra Group’s ESG Plan for 2030 established a goal that all of its businesses should be carbon neutral  
(Scopes 1 and 2) from 2025. In addition, the performance goals of the energy transition strategy encourage the 
Group’s companies to carry out their operations more efficiently, minimizing climate impacts. Thus, the better the 
companies’ performances, the lower both the emissions and the need to acquire carbon credits, and therefore, the 
lower the Group’s risk exposure to carbon price fluctuations.

Energy Transition 
Risk: Regulatory

Carbon pricing -  
regulated market

The debate around carbon pricing, either through voluntary emissions trading or through regulatory measures 
and taxation, is gaining momentum in Brazil. In 2022, Federal Decree 11,075 was approved. It establishes 
procedures for the preparation of Sectorial Plans for Mitigating Climate Change and institutes the National 
System for the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. There are still many uncertainties regarding carbon 
pricing mechanisms, and so they represent potential risks for the Ultra Group’s companies.

The Group has been monitoring and contributing to the developments in the evolution of a regulated carbon market 
in Brazil. In addition, together with the Brazilian Institute of Petroleum, the Group collaborated on the preparation of 
a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory for the Oil and Gas sector, in line with Federal Decree 11,075. It is not 
yet possible to make a conclusive analysis of the possible financial impacts on the Group’s businesses. This will be 
estimated as soon as a definitive mechanism for regulating emissions in the country is implemented.

Energy Transition 
Risk: Market and 
Technological

Substitution of existing 
products by alternatives with 
lower GHG emissions

The emergence and evolution of new large-scale technologies with GHG reduction potential, as well as 
customer behavior in search of products with a lower carbon footprint, could impact the Ultra Group’s 
businesses. 
In the case of Ultragaz, the expansion of the natural gas supply network and increased gas consumption 
may lead to a reduction in the demand for LPG, which is the company’s main product. In the case of Ipiranga, 
technologies that result in the replacement of fossil fuels (electric vehicles, for example) can lead to a loss 
of market share. For Ultracargo, in turn, the storage mix would change with a reduction in the demand for 
handling fossil fuels.

Grupo Ultra’s positioning in energy transition has the main objectives of contributing to the transition to a low-carbon 
economy and adapting the Group’s portfolio of businesses, its products and its performance to this new market 
reality. For some time, the Group has been seeking to reposition its portfolio towards more sustainable businesses. 
Noteworthy examples were the acquisitions of Stella Energia (renewable energy) and NEOgás (bio-methane) by 
Ultragaz. Ultracargo’s terminals are multi-purpose and enable the company to adapt its operations to handle a range 
of products including bio-fuels. Ipiranga is a pioneer in electric charging at service stations and its strategy is to offer 
a mix of products and services in line with consumer demand.

Energy Transition 
Risk: Regulatory

Increased ambition to use 
renewable fuels and achieve 
its RenovaBio targets

*Applies only to Ipiranga.

The increase in the share of bio-fuels in Ipiranga’s total sales mix, as well as the increase in its  
RenovaBio targets, may result in an increase in operating costs due to the higher costs of acquiring raw 
materials and CBIOs.

In 2022, the Ultra Group, through Ipiranga, spent R$ 638.5 million to acquire CBIOs. This expense will vary from year 
to year, depending on the Group’s growth, and the market prices of the certificates. The acquisition of CBIOs is a legal 
requirement and, therefore, the Group understands that it is an intrinsic risk for the business. Even so, Grupo Ultra 
works to promote improvements in the regulatory framework of the program that could, in addition to strengthening 
public policy, bring greater predictability and security to its operation.

Physical Risks
Water scarcity,  
flooding, storms, and 
increases in sea level

The physical risks identified as relevant for the Ultra Group’s operations have the potential to adversely impact 
the businesses’ operations. Water scarcity, for example, can impact safety, as water is used to fight fires. 
Other climate risks, such as flooding and storms, could result in production stoppages, interruption of critical 
supplies, and physical damage to infrastructure. An increase in sea level is an important risk to operations, 
since the Group’s companies have operations in coastal regions and ports.

In 2022, we prepared an inventory of all the climate risks that could impact the Group’s companies. The main 
sources of information were insurance underwriting reports and studies produced by consultancies for the National 
Agency for Water-based Transport (Antaq) and for the Group’s companies. Risks were categorized and we identified 
the internal functional areas that would be responsible for climate risk management.  These areas initiated the 
preparation of action plans for risk control and mitigation. The Group’s companies intend to make progress in 
establishing action plans in 2023 and, in the near future, estimating the financial impacts.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2022  |   

REGULATORY  
ISSUES AND PUBLIC 
POLICIES

The Ultra Group has an Institutional and 

Government Relations area dedicated to the 

monitoring of, and positioning in, strategic 

public policies that could impact the Group’s 

businesses or civil society.

The area’s mission is to focus on improving the 

business environment, by working to reduce 

unfair competitive practices and the regulatory 

burden, in order bring more legal certainty 

to the market. The area communicates with 

the stakeholders responsible for decision-

making both directly and indirectly, through 

sector associations and civil society entities, 

encouraging debate and the search for the 

most appropriate solutions. 

The major themes monitored by the area on 

an ongoing basis, are as follows:

 regulatory environment

 energy transition

tax simplification 

infrastructure

 

 

 irregular markets

The topic of energy transition is a high priority 

for the Ultra Group.

EM-RM-530a.1

We seek to be an active protagonist in the 

search for competitive and environmentally 

efficient solutions to reduce the carbon 

intensity of our operations and value chains.

As a way of contributing to accelerating the 

energy transition process and of achieving the 

Brazilian Nationally Determined Contribution 

(NDC) to reducing global GHG emissions, we 

are participating in the discussions on the 

development of a carbon market. We believe 

that this market should have the following 

features: balanced sectoral challenges; a 

governance structure that promotes the 

participation of regulated sectors; mechanisms 

to reduce illegal deforestation and incentives for 

forest preservation; support for the promotion 

of carbon pricing initiatives that leverage the 

ability of companies to take responsibility for 

their own emissions, thereby contributing to the 

advancement of the global climate agenda.

We also believe it necessary to open up the 

bio-fuels market to include new technological 

advances and allow unrestricted importation and 

freedom of contractual arrangements between 

economic agents. The resultant increase in 

availability of supply and reduction in costs of 

renewable fuels will lead to their representing 

an increasing share of Brazil’s energy mix, and 

contribute to a structural reduction in energy 

prices throughout the country. 

The organized market for carbon-credit trading 

in Brazil began in 2020 with the purchase and 

sale of CBios under the rules of the RenovaBio 

  GRI 203-2 

program. This was an important milestone for 

the liquid fuels sector and also demonstrated  

the sector’s potential for contributing to 

the achievement of the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. The co-

existence of the pursuit of these important 

goals and a functioning carbon market will 

be fundamental for taking the next steps to 

establish the relevant public policies. 

It is also extremely important to discuss Brazil’s 

tax and regulatory model. The current system is 

complex, inhibits investments and provides little 

incentive for innovation. This results in a volatile 

and inefficient process of price formation. With 

respect to the fuels sector, it is fundamental to 

implement a single-phase system where (i) 

the first link in the supply chain is taxed with a 

fixed value per unit (“ad rem”) and (ii) there is a 

national unified system of tax rates to ensure 

that there are no incentives for tax evasion or 

logistical inefficiencies 

We believe that a better regulatory and tax 

environment will increase the country’s 

investments and competitiveness. Brazil is one

of the world leaders in the production of bio-

fuels, and has an expanding and increasingly 

efficient logistics network. The country has all 

the necessary conditions to be a protagonist 

in the global energy transition process in 

equilibrium with its own economic development

are men. In geographical terms, 68% are 

located in the Southeast Region of Brazil, 

13% in the Northeast Region, 11% in the 

South Region, 5% in the Center-West Region 

and 2% in the North Region. There was a 

decrease in the number of employees in 

2022 compared to the previous year due to 

the divestment of Oxiteno and Extrafarma.  

  GRI 2-7 

People are at the core of our strategy. The 

Ultra Group’s actions are guided by ethics and 

respect. The Group promotes a workplace 

environment that values and encourages the 

professional growth of all its employees.

the Group, a number of initiatives were 

carried out in all the businesses with the aim 

of achieving our goals.  

Ultrapar and the businesses encourage 

diversity and do not tolerate, under any 

circumstances, discrimination or prejudice 

of any kind, whether related to gender, race, 

religion, age, political conviction, marital 

status, sexual orientation, disability, place of 

birth, social class, or any other factor.  

The Ultra Group seeks to ensure a more 

diverse representation in all areas of the 

organization, beginning with the recruitment 

process and entry programs for talented 

young people. Diversity leads to a plurality of 

perspectives on the Group’s strategic themes, 

enabling it to build strategies that are more 

relevant and attuned to society as a whole. 

The Group has established a Diversity 

Committee, which is developing a tactical 

and strategic plan to promote and monitor 

actions related to an inclusive organizational 

environment, diversity in leadership and 

an inclusive and safe workplace for all 

employees. It has also developed policies, 

guidelines and initiatives aimed at the 

attraction, retention, development and 

engagement of its employees. These include: 

the Internship Program; Young Apprentice 

Program; language course incentives; 

graduate and MBA course incentives; and 

actions aimed at increasing operational 

efficiency, such as the variable compensation 

program linked to individual and collective 

financial goals.

THE ULTRA GROUP’S 
AMBITION

Promote an inclusive workplace 
environment, enabling the full 
development of all employees and 
where each person can realize his/
her potential with improved prospects 
and a larger contribution to the 
decision-making process.

The long-standing challenges in the Brazilian 

labor market, especially, regarding gender 

and race, inspired the Group to select inclusion 

and diversity as one of its material topics and 

commitments for 2030. Taking 2020 as the 

base scenario, the Group has established 

goals to increase gender and ethnic 

equity in the Board of Directors and senior 

management positions in all its companies, 

considering aspects of accessibility, respect 

and representativeness.

Some of the Group’s businesses have already 

implemented their own affirmative action 

initiatives, such as: the establishment of 

quotas for young people who identify as black 

in the selection process for the Internship 

Programs at Ipiranga and Ultragaz; provision 

of training courses for operators for residents 

of the communities surrounding Ultracargo’s 

installations, with at least 50% of the places 

allocated to women; and  the inclusion of 

specific questions in the organizational 

climate survey aimed at measuring 

discrimination within the businesses.

purpose
Our 

Over the next three years, the Group intends to 

promote a more equitable, diverse and inclusive 

workplace, thereby enhancing its corporate culture, 

employer reputation and performance. 

To this end, we are investing in an action 

plan consisting of several important work

fronts that aim to enable the Ultra Group 

to achieve its goals on these themes over

the next three years. These main work 

fronts are listed in the table on the right.

  REPRESENTATIVENESS: we want 

to retain and train minority groups 

in order to be a diverse and inclusive 

organization. Our actions in 2022 were 

focused on planning and prioritizing our 

activities. Following this, in 2023, we will 

invest in an internal employee talent 

program, by identifying development 

gaps, and establishing hiring targets for 

minority groups.

  ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENT: 
provide a safe and welcoming workplace 

environment where all people can be 

themselves. In 2023, we will identify the 

requirements and barriers to create an 

inclusive environment. Furthermore, we will 

communicate our existing policies and carry 

out a campaign on the links between an 

inclusive environment and emotional health. 

We also plan to carry out a further edition of 

the internal census. 

 LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT: support

for leadership development, based on 

the creation of programs focused on 

awareness, education and co-mentoring. 

We will invest in the development of 

inclusive leaders, as well as reinforcing their

role and responsibilities

Ensuring a safe workplace environment 

and quality of life for employees, and 

providing support for the communities 

surrounding its business operations, are 

priority commitments for the Group. The 

commitment on safety also extends to third-

party staff and suppliers and processes.

Ultrapar and the businesses have health 

and safety management systems that are 

based on international standards. The health 

and safety indicators are closely monitored, 

including for example, accident frequency 

rates, incidence of occupational 

diseases and the number of 

lost days, and the evolution 

of procedures and 

programs related to both 

own employees and fixed 

third-party staff.

By means of the Risk Management Program 

(PGR) and the Occupational Health Medical 

Control Program (PCMSO), trained technical 

teams promptly identify the risks and 

dangers in the execution of activities. All 

incidents and accidents at work are analyzed

and result in improvements to management 

systems, incorporation of corrective 

measures, reinforcement of prevention 

practices and training and changes in the 

workplace environment, when necessary. In 

addition, all safety indicators are monitored 

and a specific corporate work group serves 

as a platform for exchanging experiences 

and seeking shared solutions between the 

businesses.

The Group’s occupational health and safety 

system has a number of security parameters 

to restrict the access to confidential information. 

Access is controlled by a token and only 

authorized users can consult employee health 

data. The system complies with the applicable 

Regulatory Norms of the Ministry of Labor (NR 

4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 23).

The theme of safety is managed in an integrated 

manner under the responsibility of the Safety 

Committee. This committee is composed of 

members of senior management and reports to 

the Board of Directors. The committee played a 

leading role in defining the targets for the material 

topic on health and safety in the preparation 

of the Group’s ESG goals for 2030. It 

meets regularly, according to 

an agenda determined at the 

beginning of each year, and 

is coordinated by one of the 

CEOs of the businesses, 

on a rotating basis. In 

2022, the committee was 

coordinated by Décio Amaral, 

CEO of Ultracargo, and focused 

on preparing the Plan for the 

Transformation of the Safety 

Culture, as well as other 

safety-related matters. 

In addition, safety is a 

recurring and obligatory 

item on the agendas of the 

meetings held by the Board 

of Directors and senior 

management.  GRI 403-4

INTEGRATED REPORT 2022  |   

The most significant impacts related to 

safety are present in the operations of our 

businesses and suppliers. The Group is 

constantly working to ensure that all the 

businesses adopt health and safety policies 

and practices that minimize these risks.

In 2022, none of the Ultra Group companies 

registered any occurrence of occupational 

diseases. 

Ultragaz’s health and safety management 

system covers all employees and third parties 

who work in the company’s operations. The 

company’s contracts with suppliers oblige 

them to meet the same requirements in their 

own internal operations.  Each operational unit 

undergoes an annual internal audit to measure 

its degree of compliance with the Health, Safety 

and Environment (HSE) processes. The annual 

average level of compliance in relation to the 

implementation of HSE procedures in internal 

audits was around 83% for the year, compared 

to the target of 75%. Work-related health risks 

were identified through process mapping. The 

following risks were identified: physical (noise); 

chemical (painting booth, exposure to LPG); 

ergonomic (carrying heavy loads, physical 

exertion, hyper-flexion of the spinal column, 

elevation of the upper limbs above shoulder level 

associated with weight bearing, triggering of 

work-related musculoskeletal disorder (WMSD)). 

Actions were taken to eliminate or mitigate each 

identified risk.

 GRI 403-5

 

 

 

 

 

In Ultracargo, all employees and outsourced 

workers working in operations were covered by 

the company’s health and safety management 

system, which is audited internally and 

externally. Third-party management was carried 

out by a partner company, which checked all 

documentation and only allowed employees to 

enter terminals that were 100% in compliance 

with the standards.

Ipiranga’s health and safety management 

system ensured the identification of work-related 

risks and the company carried out occupational 

medical exams to monitor the health and well-

being of its employees. The system was audited 

internally and excluded the third-party staff 

who were not under the organization’s control. 

Potential occupational health risks, such as 

chemical, physical, biological and ergonomic, 

were identified through the Risk Management 

Program (RMP). The company seeks solutions 

to eliminate or mitigate all occupational risks and 

provides guidance and collective and individual 

protection equipment to employees and third 

parties. It also carries out infrastructure works 

when necessary.

DAY-TO-DAY SAFETY PRACTICES
In order to engage all employees in a 

permanent, day-to-day commitment to 

exercising safety practices the Group has 

instituted the following measures: training 

courses; communication campaigns; risk 

assessments and inspections; safety 

discussion forums; channels for reporting 

deviations; regular medical monitoring of 

employees; and the formation of internal fire 

brigades. Representatives of the Ultra Group 

businesses meet periodically with the Internal 

Commissions for Accident Prevention (CIPAs). 

These meetings discuss all topics related 

to accident prevention, health and safety 

prevention campaigns, ergonomics, and other 

related themes of interest to the employee. 

All employees can access the Canal Aberto 

to report situations that present, or potentially 

present, safety risks or that violate the Group’s 

safety guidelines.   

The third-party contract staff who work in 

Ultrapar and the businesses also undergo 

training courses in safety. They are obliged 

to comply with the Group’s safety policies 

and practices and are included in awareness 

campaigns and other forms of engagement 

actions, such as the activities organized in 

the Internal Occupational Accident Prevention 

Weeks (Sipats).

The Ultra Group has instituted the following 

safety initiatives:

Ergonomic Work Analysis

Emergency Action Plan

Vaccination campaigns

Psychological monitoring

 New employee integration program

Chronic disease monitoring programs 

 Accident monitoring projects

HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING
  GRI 403-5 

In 2022, the Group provided the following 

health and safety training courses for its 

employees:

 Campaigns: Gr een April, Yellow May, 

Yellow September, Pink October and Blue 

November;

  Active Health Program: Identification of 

the employees eligible to participate in this 

program which was developed in partnership 

with the health-care operator SulAmérica 

and focused on pregnant women, chronic 

diseases and mental health;

 Heal th Week: live transmissions; medical 

consultations to measure blood pressure, 

blood glucose, body mass index (BMI), bio-

impedance; and a blood donor campaign;

 Sit e abandonment simulations; 

 L ectures from experts, simulations and a 

safety blitz (SIPAT).

Ultracargo has developed an Occupational Risk 

Management Program, which establishes roles 

and responsibilities, tools, ways of measuring, 

risk analysis, risk classification, qualification, 

quantification and actions such as training linked 

to identified risks and forms of control.

All occupational incidents and accidents 

are analyzed and are used as the basis for 

improvements in management systems, 

corrective measures, reinforcement of prevention 

and training and physical infrastructure changes 

in the workplace, when necessary.

In 2022, Ultrapar recoded two accidents 

involving outsourced employees who worked in 

its office.

Ultragaz has a system for identifying and 

evaluating hazards and risks in its processes.

A critical analysis of this process is carried 

out annually, and based on this, tactical and/

or operational plans are defined to focus 

efforts and actions on possible risk mitigation

opportunities. As a result, there has been a 

measurable improvement and the number 

of accidents has reduced year on year. In 

2022, there were 15 work-related accidents 

(with and without leave) involving employees.

There were no work-related accidents 

involving outsourced workers, with serious 

consequences and high-potential incidents.

 

 

 

In Ultracargo, the total number of high-potential 

incidents was 4 accidents in 2022, 1 with direct 

employees and 3 with third-party employees, 

and 6 near accidents were also recorded. 

Occupational hazards are identified in the work 

permit issuance process, in the preliminary risk 

analysis, in the hazard and risk matrix, and in 

work instructions. 

Ipiranga uses risk analysis techniques, 

to identify the possible causes of 

dangerous work-related scenarios and 

then recommendations are developed to 

implement improvements and protection 

devices in its processes and operations. In 

2022, there were 6 work-related accidents 

(with and without lost-time) with employees

and two high-potential work incidents. In 

relation to outsourced workers, there were 

8 accidents (with and without lost-time) 

and 6 high-potential work incidents. In 

addition and despite all the efforts made 

to offer maximum safety to professionals, 

unfortunately, there were three fatalities 

resulting from accidents at work with 

outsourced employees, caused by non-

compliance with safety procedures.

HEALTH-CARE BENEFITS

With the aim of promoting a safe and 

healthy environment and quality of life for its 

employees and their dependents, the Ultra 

Group has extended some of its benefits to 

include employees’ children. These include: 

medical and dental attendance; assistance to 

employees who have a child with a disability 

due to neurological problems; support for those 

unable to perform physical work; daycare 

support; and the provision of a gift pack of 

items for the new-born baby and mother. 

Together with its health-care plan operator, 

the Ultrapar identified the main health 

factors affecting its workforce. Based on this 

evaluation it provided appropriate programs 

to meet these specific needs, in addition to 

maintaining the existing Gympass benefit that 

subsidizes employee access to sports and 

physical activities.

All the Ultra Group’s businesses adhered to 

the Citizen Company Program and increased 

maternity leave by 60 days to a total of 180 

days, and paternity leave by 15 days to a total 

of 20 days.

In 2022, the Ultra Group had return rates of 

97% and 99% for maternity and paternity leave 

respectively.

97% 99%
The employees who have not yet returned to work were those 
whose period of leave extended into 2023.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2022  |   

Ultrapar and the businesses each have their 

own policies that encourage the home/office 

hybrid model of working. For specific eligible 

groups of employees, individual hour-bank 

agreements are also available, facilitating the 

balance between personal and work activities.

In order to meet the targets for the Group’s 

material topic of health and safety, a number of 

initiatives were developed, with an emphasis on 

Well-being Programs, Health Risk Prevention 

and ISO 45001 certification, as shown in the 

table below:

MAIN INITIATIVES IN HEALTH AND SAFETY

  Well-being Programs

The Group’s corporate health area monitors employee health through their responses to 
the weekly questionnaires of the Ultra Bem Estar project.

When necessary, individualized treatment and assistance is offered. Ultragaz has its 
own well-being initiative called Valoriza.

In 2022, Ultracargo launched a well-being initiative called the Cuidar Bem Program, 
which includes actions aimed at preserving the physical and mental health and quality 
of life of its employees and their families.

Ipiranga partnered with a digital platform that provides online consultations with 
specialized health and well-being professionals and access to content on self-care and 
self-knowledge. 

  Prevention of health risks

In 2021, Ultragaz, Ultracargo and Ipiranga carried out assessments of the level of 
maturity of the safety culture in their respective companies and, based on the results, 
established new strategic plans for the prevention of health and safety risks.

  ISO 45001

All Ultracargo’s terminals (except for the recently-opened Vila do Conde terminal), and 
Ipiranga’s pool base in Betim (MG) have been certified for occupational health and 
safety under ISO 45001.

The management of the negative impacts, 

both actual and potential, of the Group’s activ-

ities in the communities surrounding its oper-

ations is carried out directly by the businesses 

involved, based on principles of responsibility, 

transparency and actions to mitigate or reduce 

impacts. Due to the nature of its activities,  

Ultrapar does not have a systematic process 

for evaluating impacts.   GRII 413-2

The Ultra Group has revitalized the Ultra 

Institute. All the businesses now participate 

in its governance and it will be responsible 

for coordinating all the Group’s efforts and 

investments in social impact initiatives.

The initiatives and projects in the Ultra Group’s 

ESG agenda demonstrate its commitment to 

a responsible and systemic course of action in 

relation to the priority communities surrounding 

its business operations. Using both its own 

  
  

resources and those of the tax incentive laws, 

the Group supports actions and projects in the 

communities and maintains an on-going dialogue 

with their representatives, thereby contributing to 

social prosperity, and providing opportunities for 

the transformation of people’s lives. 

In 2022, the Ultra Group supported cultural, 

sports, employment training and education 

projects in a number of locations surrounding its 

operations.

In line with its related ESG commitment for 

2030, the Group’s priority for the coming years 

will be on the economic and social development 

of the communities surrounding the Group’s 

operations, focused on education and 

employment and income generation.

to the Ultra Group’s social impact strategies. The 
territories evaluated were: Cubatão (SP), Canoas 
(RS), Betim (MG), Barcarena (PA), Itaqui (MA) and 
Candeias (BA). After carrying out the evaluations, we 
developed a Systemic Impact Strategy and an Impact 
Monitoring Plan. Following this, Ultracargo and Ultragaz 
carried out additional evaluations in Suape (PE), and 
Ipiranga in Fortaleza (CE). The Ultra Group prioritized 
initiatives directed at children, adolescents and women 
in vulnerable circumstances. A training program for 
women was implemented in four of the six territories 
evaluated, in partnership with the NGOs consulted 
during the evaluation.

and in partnership with the Pedra Bruta 
NGO, Ultragaz supported a program that 
provided extra tuition on Saturdays for 
talented apprentices from public schools 
in poor communities in the municipality 
of Franca (SP). The program was 
complemented by a website called Pluga 
Cuca that enabled the students to access 
the lessons at any time, and without 
charge. The program lasts for seven years 
and attends 110 students per year.

P roduction Operator Program for 
Women Ipiranga invested in the 
training of women, who lived in 
the communities surrounding its 
operations, for future employment 
as production operators in the 
oil and gas sector.  In 2022, two 
editions of the program were held, 
in Paulínia (SP) and Fortaleza (CE), 
in which 85% of the participants 
completed the training course and 
20% were hired after the completion 
of the program.

 Social  Acceleration Program 86 employees of the Ultra Group acted 
as voluntary consultants for 13 NGOs. They focused on education, 
employment and female entrepreneurship in the Greater São Paulo 
(SP) and Campinas (SP) areas. They worked in teams and followed 
a methodology based on design thinking. The mission of each 
team was to work with an NGO to find a solution for a management 
challenge faced by that NGO. The results of this first edition were as 
follows: 9,000 people were benefited; 400 solutions were proposed 
for the management problems; 16 hours of work for each team; and 
102 employees were registered in the volunteer program.

 T he Rocinha School of Music  Ultragaz 
supported a program that offered free 
courses in playing musical instruments, 
choir singing, musical perception and 
theory, and group and orchestra practice. 
The program was attended by 250 
children and adolescents who lived 
in socially-vulnerable circumstances 
in the Rocinha (RJ) shanty-town and 
surrounding communities, contributing 
to keeping them safe from the actions of 
criminals.

REVITALIZATION OF 
THE ULTRA INSTITUTE

 

   GRI 413-1

  GRI 3-3Management of material topic - Responsibility for the 
surrounding communities

*

Due to the importance of the topic, and in order 

to increase the impact of its social initiatives, 

the Group revitalized the governance structure 

and scope of activities of the Ultra Institute.      

The main objective of the Institute is to 

strengthen the management and coordination 

of the Group’s numerous social impact 

initiatives, while at the same time respecting 

the autonomy of the businesses and 

expanding the actions in the priority territories. 

In 2022, the Ultra Institute established an 

Advisory Board composed of representatives 

from each business and two external 

members. The Board meets bimonthly to 

deliberate on the social impact initiatives.

One of the first initiatives under the new 

approach was an evaluation of the reality of 

six priority territories* where one or more of 

the Group’s companies was present. Based 

on this evaluation, it was possible to carry out 

activities in a number of municipalities.

 Ultracargo and Ultragaz later expanded the scope of the 
evaluation to include the municipality of Suape (PE). as did 
Ipiranga in Fortaleza (CE).

Based on the evaluations of the communities 

in these territories and discussions both 

internally and with external organizations, it 

was decided to focus the efforts of the Ultra 

Institute on Education and Entrepreneurship. 

The Group believes that these are the key 

factors that are necessary to produce 

profound structural improvements in Brazilian 

society. Action on these themes contributes to 

six of the UN’s SDGs:    

NO 
POVERTY

ZERO 
HUNGER

QUALITY 
EDUCATION

RESPONSIBLE 
CONSUMPTION
AND PRODUCTION

GENDER 
EQUALITY

REDUCED 
INEQUALITIES

It is important to note that, even though it 

will focus its social action strategy in the 

communities on these two themes, the Group 

will always support emergency actions. In 

addition, at the local and national levels, projects 

funded by tax incentives will continue to be 

developed in accordance with the specific tax 

incentive law, namely: Fund for the Elderly; 

Culture Incentive Law; Sports Incentive Law; 

Municipal Fund for Children and Adolescents 

(Funcad); National Program for Supporting 

Oncology Care (Pronon); and the National 

Program for Supporting Health-care for Persons 

with Disabilities (Pronas – PCD). Priority will 

be given to projects that are aligned with the 

Group’s main strategic objectives. The Institute 

has set up some pilot projects focused on 

combating school absenteeism and dropouts, 

and offering training courses to women in 

situations of social vulnerability.

In 2022, we partnered with Comunitas which 

is a civil society organization specialized in 

modeling and implementing sustainable 

partnerships between entities in the public and 

private sectors. The aim is to generate a greater 

impact from social investment, through a focus 

on improving public services and, consequently,

the lives of the general population. Its activities 

are based on a methodology composed of 

six dimensions: connecting, inspiring, thinking, 

training, doing and testing.

Through this partnership, the Ultra Group 

participated in the Juntos Program and the 

Bisc Network, seeking to generate positive 

impacts for society through its actions, 

responsible approach and relations with the 

communities where it operates.

VALUE CHAIN

The Group’s value chain management is 

committed to ensuring that all selected 

suppliers and resellers are engaging with ESG 

practices. It encourages suppliers, resellers and 

other business partners to go beyond the legal 

requirements in the areas of the protection of 

human rights, labor practices, environmental 

standards, ethical conduct and health and 

safety practices.

With the aim of building a value chain where 

commercial relations are ethical and transparent, 

Ultrapar is carrying out the following initiatives to 

achieve its goals in this area:

PURCHASING DEPARTMENT GOVERNANCE 

| Ultrapar created the corporate Purchasing 

Governance area, linked to the CSC, to 

support and monitor the interactions between 

the suppliers and the technical managers 

responsible for the supply contracts. 

Furthermore, it developed the Ultra Supplier 

Booklet that provides information to the 

suppliers on the measurement processes, 

invoicing and payments and defines the correct 

communication channel for responding to 

suppliers’ questions. Ultracargo also set up 

a Purchasing Governance area, focused on 

  GRI 3-3 Management of material topic - Value Chain    

 

supplier management. Em 2022, Ultracargo 

disseminated its Responsible Sourcing Policy to 

its suppliers, to provide guidelines for best ESG 

practices in the Group’s priority material topics.

MEU APLICATIVO PARCEIRO (MY PARTNER 
APP) created by Ultragaz, the app focuses 

on the reseller network. It connects more 

than 90% of the resellers and offers solutions 

and support for the financial and operational 

management of the reseller, including 

promotional materials and training.

| 

     

RESELLER EXCELLENCE PROGRAM 
(DESAFIO LAPIDAR) | focused on reseller 

training, the program was developed by 

Ultragaz and rewards partners for the progress 

made on their training journey. In 2022, 60% 

of the reseller network participated voluntarily 

in the program, of which 98% made progress 

compared to the previous year, as a result of 

their closer relations with the company.

CDP SUPPLY CHAIN | Ultragaz is an individual 

member of the CDP Supply Chain, in addition 

to reporting to the CDP through the Ultra 

Group. The CDP provides a questionnaire 

and a methodology for companies to gather 

environmental information, for example, GHG 

emissions, from their suppliers. The results of 

the questionnaires help all parties involved to 

identify and respond to environmental risks 

and opportunities. 

SUPPLIER APPROVAL PROGRAM | Ultracargo 

utilizes an approval process for screening 

its suppliers that requires information on 

governance, social and environmental practices. 

In 2022, the company prepared a Responsible 

Sourcing Booklet, which is available to all 

suppliers on its sourcing platform. Acceptance 

of the terms of the booklet is mandatory for 

all new supply contracts carried out after its 

publication last December.

a sales convention with more than 5,000 

participants, and the reactivation of the Clube 

de Millhão, which stimulated reseller relations 

and recognition.  In partnership with Estácio 

de Sá University, the company launched 

Ipiranga’s Technical Diploma in Service Station 

Management, an exclusive course aimed 

at improving the management and service 

quality of our resellers.

VALUE CHAIN | in 2022, with a focus on 

disseminating best ESG practices among its 

suppliers, Ipiranga revised its Supplier Policy and 

Booklet on Sustainability for Suppliers, which 

together set out the social and environmental 

guidelines that must followed by all its business 

partners. Also, during the year, the company 

identified its critical suppliers and revised their 

contractual clauses to incorporate ESG topics, 

reinforcing the obligation to be in compliance 

with the above-mentioned guidelines, with 

regular audits during the term of the contract.

MOVER | this is a pioneering program in the 

market that aims.to increase the levels of 

efficiency and safety, in an integrated manner, 

in the operations of the company’s transport 

partners. 

Ipiranga carries out a comprehensive evaluation 

of the partner’s operations using safety, 

efficiency and productivity criteria, in order 

to encourage the partner to adopt the best 

technological practices in the sector, improving 

the management of transport risks and 

enhancing the management of vehicle fleets. The 

transport partners were evaluated and ranked 

according to 30 indicators covering safety, level 

of service efficiency and competitiveness. Based 

on their position in the ranking they were given 

recognition and rewarded in four categories: 

diamond, gold silver and bronze.

Furthermore, there are consequences for 

partners that do not achieve the minimum 

requirement in the ranking, ensuring that only 

suppliers with adequate ESG practices are 

admitted into the company’s value chain.

SUPPLIER INTEGRITY AND ETHICS
Another aspect of the Ultra Group’s ESG matrix is 

the maintenance of best practices in the Group’s 

value chain. The Group seeks to encourage 

suppliers, resellers and other business partners 

to go beyond the legal requirements and actively 

pursue best practices in human rights, working 

conditions, respect for the environment, ethical 

behavior, and health and safety. 

The Group’s Code of Ethics and corporate 

policies related to integrity, also extend to its 

partners in the value chain, in order to promote 

transparent, impersonal, technical, honest and 

fair processes for all the parties involved.

Ultrapar and the businesses independently 

manage their respective value chains, based 

on the guidelines of the Group’s Integrity 

Program. In some of the Group’s businesses, 

the screening of suppliers is carried out in an 

even more comprehensive way. It can include 

a reputation analysis, evaluations of social and 

environmental aspects, audits, clauses related 

to aspects of sustainability in supply contracts, 

and other mechanisms.

The reputation analysis includes the use 

of official black lists of suppliers linked to 

allegations of the use of child labor or forced 

or compulsory labor. If identified, the Integrity 

team will evaluate the seriousness of the 

allegations in depth and may decide to block 

the registration of this supplier. In 2022, no 

suppliers were identified as having a risk 

or occurrence of child labor or forced or 

compulsory labor.   GRI 408-1 | 409-1

SCREENING OF SUPPLIERS BASED ON 
SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA

  GRI 308-1 | GRI 414-1

In 2022, 99% of the Ultra Group’s new 

suppliers were contracted after being 

screened for environmental criteria. It is 

worth noting that there are still significant 

differences in the practices of the Group’s 

companies on this theme.  Ultrapar uses 

environmental screening criteria in 100% of 

its new supplier contracts as does Ultragaz. 

The company has a formal internal 

guideline that determines that all suppliers 

are evaluated and approved through 

reputational analysis. 

Furthermore, in relation to social themes, 

99% of new suppliers were screened 

using social criteria. There were also some 

differences among the businesses on the 

approach to this topic. Ultrapar, Ultragaz 

and Ipiranga used social criteria to screen 

100% of their new supplier contracts.   

In Ultracargo, the supplier was asked to 

inform the status of its Environmental 

Operations License and also to respond 

to a questionnaire on Health, Safety and 

Environment Policies and Procedures, 

such as labor documentation, effluent 

and waste disposal, risk management, 

programs internal audit, employee training, 

emergency plan, and the availability 

of Personal Protective Equipment. In 

addition, the supplier undertook (whether 

agreeing or not) to minimize the impacts 

of its suppliers’ activities, use natural 

resources responsibly and build a culture 

of environmental protection among its 

employees, service providers, suppliers 

and customers. In Ipiranga, new suppliers 

were evaluated in the registration process 

using the reputation evaluation platform 

that consulted judicial processes, national 

and international black lists, articles in 

the media and other public sources, in 

particular, IBAMA and Forced Labor.

ENERGY  
TRANSITION

As a major player in the distribution of fuels 

through Ipiranga, in the distribution of LPG 

through Ultragaz and in the storage of fuels 

through Ultracargo, the Ultra Group is closely 

monitoring the deepening climate change 

crisis and the actions and trends aimed at de-

carbonizing the economy.

The main impacts for the Group on this topic 

relate to a reduction in the consumption of 

fossil fuel products since they are transported, 

stored and distributed by the Group’s 

businesses. 

Therefore, the Ultra Group’s main goal is 

to implement measures to reduce and 

mitigate the GHG emissions produced in 

its operations, in order to achieve carbon 

neutrality in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 

2025. A specialized strategic planning 

consultancy was hired to provide technical 

support to senior management on the 

alternative scenarios associated with 

climate change. Based on the results, new 

projects were initiated to reduce current GHG 

emissions and increased investments were 

made to strengthen the Group’s research 

and development capability in order to find 

alternative energy sources and more energy 

efficient solutions for customers.

Reflecting the critical importance of the topic 

for the Group, the management structure for 

energy transition starts at the highest level. The 

Board of Directors approves policies, targets and 

investment decisions that impact the Group’s 

energy transition objectives. The CEOs of Ultrapar 

and the businesses ensure compliance with 

the energy transition agenda in the planning 

and execution of their business strategies, 

including their budgets. The Sustainability areas 

in Ultrapar and the businesses have specialized 

professionals dedicated to the topic who provide 

technical guidance for the operational areas 

and monitoring of action plans. The Strategic 

Planning area defines the financial assumptions 

for climate issues that are included in the 

strategies of the individual businesses. Finally, the 

Risk Management area ensures the appropriate 

management of climate risks and reports on 

them to the Board of Directors and the relevant 

committees.

The Ultra Group believes in Brazil’s potential to 

be a leading player in the transition to a low-

carbon economy. It further believes that this can 

be achieved in an orderly and efficient manner, 

without affecting the supply of energy for the 

population, or negatively impacting value chains 

and the country’s economic development. 

In the Group’s view, however, to achieve this 

it is necessary to change the regulatory and 

tax models of the fuels sector, which, in their 

current formats, inhibit investments in new 

technologies and infrastructure and restrict 

competitiveness in the sector. To contribute to 

the discussion, Ipiranga participates in the Energy 

Transition Committee of the Brazilian Institute for 

Oil and Gas (IBP). It also conducted a study on 

the impact of carbon pricing on the sector and 

supported the IBP in preparing the first inventory 

of GHG emissions for the oil and gas sector (more 

information on this subject later in this section). 

Ipiranga is a member of the Brazilian Business 

Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS), 

and actively participates in the themes related to 

the company’s priority agenda.

In all cases, our actions will reinforce the Ultra 

Group’s foundations for the long-term growth and

sustainability of the organization. We will continue 

to develop our ESG strategy, seeking a balance 

between the pursuit of our business objectives 

and our contribution to solving the challenges 

faced by society. It is a process of continuous 

learning. We remain aware and alert to the 

direction and pace of energy transition and will 

adapt our strategic planning and management 

approach accordingly, as and when necessary.

THE ULTRA GROUP’S STRATEGY FOR ENERGY TRANSITION 

The Ultra Group seeks to stimulate and support its businesses to establish plans and 
commitments that enable them to act as catalysts in advancing the topic in their respective 
business sectors. The businesses will also be protagonists in the search for competitive and 
environmentally efficient solutions to reduce the carbon intensity of their operations and the 
net GHG emissions throughout their sectors’ value chains.  

The Group is structuring its efforts in energy transition by harnessing its substantial resources 
in innovation, technological development, investments, new business models and partnerships 
with other companies and organizations, and advancing in three main fronts, as follows:  

PERFORMANCE ensure the reduction of the Group’s total GHG Emissions (Scope 
1 - Direct Emissions and Scope 2 - Energy Indirect Emissions), in line with the best 
global practices in each industry sector and neutralize net carbon emissions, with 
complementary compensation strategies.   

PRODUCTS  based on the Group’s recent inventory of GHG emissions for each business 
(Scope 1 Direct Emissions, Scope 2 - Energy Indirect Emissions and Scope 3 - Other Indirect 
Emissions), analyze the generation and impact of emissions throughout the businesses’ 
value chains and develop strategies to promote the necessary transformation in customer 
and consumer demand, aiming to maximize the proportion of renewable products and 
energy sources in our range of products and services.

PORTFOLIO the Group will consider the potential for gains in energy efficiency, reduction
of GHG emissions and alignment with the challenges for the country’s energy transition 
when evaluating and taking decisions on its investment options.

In 2022, the Ultra Group’s total GHG emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) were 836,445 tCO2e. This 

represented a reduction of 44% compared to 2021, largely due to the divestment of Oxiteno 

and Extrafarma which were not included in the calculation for 2022 as they were no longer 

part of the Group. 

1. The base year for calculating GHG emissions 
for Ultrapar and Ultragaz was 2020. The base 

year for Ipiranga was 2018. The calculations 
were based on the figures for Global Warming 
Potential (GWP) defined by the Brazilian GHG 

Protocol Program.

2.The calculation of the emissions for the 
purchase of electricity (Scope 2) adopted the 

location-based approach. For companies 
located in Brazil, the calculation considered the 
emission factor of the National Interconnected 

System (SIN) for electricity distribution.

Ultrapar recorded a significant increase in its 

total GHG emissions due, firstly, to including 

the emissions of its own vehicle fleet in its 

direct and biogenic emissions (Scope 1) and, 

secondly, to initiating the reporting of Scope 3 

emissions.

Ultragaz recorded a 4% reduction in its total 

emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3). The reduction 

in Scope 1 emissions was due to reductions 

in its company-owned bases, stores and 

vehicle fleet. Its Scope 2 emissions in both 

2021 and 2022 were fully compensated by the 

acquisition of international renewable energy 

certificates (I-REC). Ultragaz succeeded in 

reducing its Scope 1 GHG emissions by 7%, 

compared to 2021, due to the substitution 

of fossil fuels by ethanol in its fleet of light 

vehicles. 

In 2022, Ipiranga’s activities gradually 

normalized following the disruptions of the 

Covid-19 pandemic, and consequently the 

company registered an increase in its Scope 

1 emissions mainly due to increases in the 

fuel consumption of the company-owned 

vehicle fleet. The reduction in the company’s 

Scope 2 emissions was due to a 60% 

reduction in the emission factor of the national 

electricity distribution grid, since its electricity 

consumption remained constant. The increase 

in Scope 3 emissions was mainly due to the 

higher volume of fuel imported via maritime 

transport. In addition, for the second year, 

the company purchased Renewable Energy 

Certificates (I-RECs) from wind generation 

projects, equivalent to the entire amount of 

purchased electrical energy consumed in 

2022, resulting in zero Scope 2 emissions 

under the purchase choice approach. For this 

reason, the purchase of carbon credits in 2022

related only to the compensation of Scope 1 

emissions, as it had done since 2014.

Ultragaz’s GHG intensity for 2022 was 

0.0096 tCO2e/t of LPG sold, a reduction of 15% 

compared to 2021. The company reduced 

its GHG emissions by 2,863.4 tCO2e in the 

year. It also decreased its total Scopes 1 and 

2 emissions by 15% compared to 2021. This 

was due, firstly, to a reduction in its Scope 1 

emissions from the lower utilization of its light-

vehicle fleet, and, secondly, a 66% reduction in 

Scope 2 emissions due to the decrease in the 

purchased electricity emission factor.

Ultracargo’s GHG intensity was 0,0012 tCO2e/t 

of product handled with a variation of 11%, and 

Ipiranga’s was 0.0006 tCO2e/t of product sold, 

unchanged from the previous year.

1. The base year for calculating GHG emissions for Ultrapar and Ultragaz was 2020. The 
base year for Ipiranga was 2018. The calculations were based on the figures for Global 
Warming Potential (GWP) defined by the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program.

2. The calculation of the emissions for the purchase of electricity (Scope 2) adopted the 
location-based approach. For companies located in Brazil, the calculation considered the 
emission factor of the National Interconnected System (SIN) for electricity distribution.  
The Group’s Scope 2 emissions were totally offset by the purchase of international 
renewable energy certificates (I-REC).

3 In Ultrapar, the gases included in the Scope 1 calculations were CO2, CH4, NO2, N2O, PFC, 
HFC, SF6, NF3, R-410, and for Scope 2 and Scope 3 it was CO2. In Ultragaz, the gases 
included in the calculations for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 were CO2, CH4 and N2O. In Ipiranga, the 
gases included in the calculations for Scopes 1 and 3 were CO2, CH4, NO2 and for Scope 
2 it was CO2. In 2022, Ipiranga no longer controlled the AmPm distribution centers (CDs), 
so the data for these units was excluded from the company’s GHG inventory. Data did 
not include emissions of Millenium, AmPm and Iconic, which were now independent 
companies.

As a result, its Scope 2 - Indirect Energy GHG Emissions were 

reduced to zero.

 In the second semester, the company provided training 

courses for the strategic areas of the business on the themes 

of climate change, GHG emissions and forms of mitigation.

 In 2022, identified alternative solutions for the reduction of 

its process and stationary energy emissions, and it plans to 

implement them in the near future.

IPIRANGA

 The company is a pioneer in installing electric vehicle (EV) 

charging points. In partnership with BMW, it has installed 

charging points in 41 service stations in 21 municipalities. 

  Installed EV charging points in six service stations along the 

Presidente Dutra highways in partnership with BMW and EDP, 

that links the cities of São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ).

 Ins talled 46 points for exchanging the batteries of electric 

motorcycles, in partnership with Voltz, an Ultra Group 

subsidiary.

In 2022, the Ultra Group’s 
improved score in the ranking in 
the Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) was highlighted by the CDP.  

The CDP is a non-profit organization 

that mobilizes investors, companies and 

governments towards building a truly 

sustainable economy. The Group advanced 

to a B score compared to a C score in the 

previous year. 

The Ultra Group participated  
in the preparation of the GHG emission 

inventory for the Oil and Gas Sector, organized by 

the Brazilian Institute of Petroleum and Gas (IBP), 

This will be used to support the process of de-

carbonizing the oil and gas sector by 2050. The 

goal was to identify the amounts and distribution 

of the sector’s GHG emissions and also the 

current de-carbonization actions and their 

impacts. The inventory aggregated information 

on 37 companies. The Ultra Group companies 

are all active in the downstream activities of the 

Oil and Gas value chain, namely, the production 

of derivatives and bio-fuels, logistics and 

distribution, sales and B2B. The inventory will 

serve as the basis for contributing to the sector’s 

energy transition strategy, and to public policies 

on climate change.

UVC Investimentos (Ultrapar’s venture capital arm) had been a shareholder since 2021. 
This was Ultragaz’s first step in entering the electricity market, in line with its strategy to 
expand its range of energy solutions for customers. This new business segment leverages 
the company’s delivery network, sales strength, brand name and its vast base of 
corporate and residential customers. Stella Energia is a startup with approximately 19,000 
active customers and a maximum potential power output of approximately 85 MWp. 
It also operates an electricity trading platform that connects generators of renewable 
energy with consumers. 

Also in 2022, the company acquired NEOgás, a pioneering company in the transport of 
compressed natural gas (CNG) in Brazil and a market leader, operating in the industrial, 
vehicular and infrastructure projects segments in partnership with natural gas distributors. 
The acquisition also represented the timely entry of Ultragaz in the markets for the 
distribution of methane and bio-methane. These acquisitions were in line with Ultragaz’s 
strategy of expanding the range of energy solutions offered to its industrial customers, 
taking advantage of its vast delivery network, sales strength and brand name. 

In the North and Northeast Regions of Brazil, the highlight was the inauguration of the 
bases in Mucuripe (CE) and Miramar (PA), which will allow Ultragaz to expand its share of 
the LPG market in these regions. 

ESG AWARDS AND RECOGNITION

ANPEI Call for Cases Award – The technical committee of the Innovation 2022 Conference,

of road movements was reduced by 
10%; in Itaqui (MA) and Aratu (BA) the 
productivity per ton handled per employee 
increased by 8% and 7%, respectively.

GRI 206-1, SASB EM-RM-520a.1. Lawsuits for unfair competition, trust and monopoly practices

In 2022, the Ultra Group registered a total of eight lawsuits, pending or closed, referring to 

allegations of unfair competition, violations of antitrust and anti-monopoly law, three of which 

in Ultragaz and five in Ipiranga. With regard to Ultragaz, the lawsuits are ongoing, without any 

judgments or other types of final decisions. They are as follows:  

 Annulment Action No. 0027922-21.2009.4.01.3400 - Triângulo Mineiro (1999-2000);

 ACP Promoted by MP nº 0313269-59.2002.8.13.0702 - Triângulo Mineiro (1999-2000);

 Public Civil Action - Process No. 0012251-70.2005.8.18.0140 - Piauí/Teresina.

In Ipiranga, of the five lawsuits currently pending on anticompetitive practices two were filed by 

the company itself to try to annul the condemnatory decisions and respective fines applied by 

the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE). These lawsuits came within the scope 

of the Operaçao Mão Invisível (Invisible Hand Operation) and the Joinville Operation. They were 

concerned with allegations of unified conduct influence in resale, not to the formation of a cartel. 

Another action was related to a Public Civil Action (ACP), also within the scope of the Operação 

Mão Invisível, which investigated an allegation of the formation of a cartel. Ipiranga was cleared 

of this allegation at the administrative level by CADE. Finally, the other two lawsuits are Public 

Civil Actions that were filed more than 20 years ago against all fuel distributors in the region, and 

present a remote chance of loss.

2-27. Compliance with laws and regulations

In 2022, the Ultra Group received five sanctions due to non-compliance with environmental laws 

and regulations. all in Ipiranga. No significant fines were applied.

GRI 401-1. Hiring rate of new employees and turnover  

In 2022, the Ultra Group hired 4,658 new employees, which represented 48% of the total number of 

employees in the Group. There were 2,688 terminations during the year and the turnover rate was 

27%. The turnover rate this year increased for employees under 30 years old (35%) and for women 

(29%) and was concentrated in the Southeast region, where there was a turnover rate of 116%. 

The high turnover in abastece aí was due to the changes in its strategy. The workforce was 

reorganized in the first quarter with the replacement of its senior management and changes to its 

organizational structure. Due to this, and to the search for information technology specialists in the 

market, there were increases in both voluntary and involuntary turnovers. In the case of AmPm, 

there was an increase in hiring at the beginning of the year due to the spin-off of the company 

from Ipiranga. Although AmPm is now independent it continues to be part of Ipiranga’s business 

ecosystem. In addition, AmPm opened a number of new stores during 2022.

GRI 405-2. Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to and men

In 2022, the ratio of the average remuneration of women compared to men was monitored using 

the indicator reported annually in this report. This ratio was higher for women compared to men: 

in Ultrapar, for managers; in Ultracargo, for coordinators; and in Millenium, for coordinators and 

operators. For Ultragaz. the ratio demonstrated equality for women and men, for managers.

When compared to 2021, with the exception of the director category, all other ratios increased. 

demonstrating the progress made in achieving the company’s commitment to improving gender 

equity. In Ultragaz and Ultracargo, there was a small increase in the remuneration ratio of women 

compared to men for the operator category.

applied to the base salary without and with bonuses, the two results were presented in sequence, starting with the comparison of base salaries without 
bonuses.
2. The indicator did not include data for Ipiranga for strategic reasons. In 2022, abastece aí, AmPm, Iconic and Milenium started to report separately. Up until 
2021, they were included in Ipiranga’s results.
n/a: not applicable. The ratio could not be calculated for the CEO category since it contained only one employee. There were no women in the manager 
category in Millenium and there were no employees in the operator category in abastece aí.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2022  |   

SASB EM-RM-540a.3. Discussion of measurement of Operating Discipline and Management 
System Performance through Tier 4 Indicators

To identify and manage the performance indicator for its management system, Ultracargo 

monitored the Operations Reliability Index (ICO) and used the indicators of proactive tools, such as 

the Safe Work Permit (PTS), the Attitude-Focused Approach (AFA), the Task Cycle Verification (VCT) 

and the Safety Assessment Process (ASP). The ICO is measured at each Ultracargo’s terminal 

individually, and then the results are aggregated to calculate an overall ICO for the company.

In relation to the level of criticality, Ultracargo had a reduction in the number of processes classified 

as Tier 1. The increase in the number of Tier 2 process events was related to the thermal expansion 

of products confined in its pipework and the integrity of the equipment.

In 2022, Ipiranga launched the Golden Rules, inviolable principles to be followed by employees and 

service pipes, in addition to expanding the Caçadores de Risco Program - official program for reporting 

deviations with the objective of strengthening risk perception and propagating safe behaviors in our 

operation. In addition, the main indicators are monitored by the committees in the management 

routines and, through the SIGA+ Integrated Management System, audits are carried out at the units in 

order to verify the performance and promote the continuous improvement of the requirements.

GRI 413-2. Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts on local communities

Ultragaz monitored the impacts of its operations on the surrounding communities, and carried out 

appropriate mitigation measures when necessary. The company carried out a risk analysis at all its 

units to evaluate the potential impacts on these communities. The risk analysis resulted in a set of 

recommendations in relation to safety, procedures, operational criteria, maintenance and training, in 

order to ensure a low probability of the occurrence of adverse impacts, such as a fire or a product spill.

In addition, the company prepared other studies and reports and carried out regular inspections 

to verify and remediate potential alterations in the quality of the soil, water and air, and the level of 

noise impacting these communities. The main procedures to manage impacts were: air emissions 

management; monitoring of black smoke; effluent management; waste management; and 

guidelines for preparing the GHG emission inventory.

Ultracargo regularly monitored its external impacts such as soil and groundwater quality. rainwater 

discharge and noise and emission levels, and took steps to minimize any impacts on the surrounding 

communities. Ultracargo has the technical and operational support of companies specialized 

in emergency services. which provide, among other items, spillage containment barriers and 

infrastructure for preventing and combating emergencies. In addition, it monitored and maintained its 

vehicle fleet and had equipment to control the atmospheric emissions from the storage and handling 

of volatile products. The company continued to comply with its financial obligations assumed in the 

Conduct Adjustment Term (TAC). signed in 2019 with the Public Prosecutor, to compensate for the 

impacts on the river estuary in Santos (SP) due to a fire on its premises in 2015.

Ipiranga’s operations, some risks of the nature of the activity are related to the compromising of soil 

and water quality due to spillage of fuel products or inadequate disposal of waste and/or industrial 

effluents, increased traffic of heavy vehicles in the region and generation of noise from the activity. 

Impacts were identified through risk analysis studies, soil and air monitoring reports, among others, 

which the company periodically monitors. In addition, in 2022, Ipiranga also developed its Social and 

Environmental Risk Matrix, with the aim of identifying potential social, environmental and technological 

impacts of its operations and directing the efforts of its relationship strategy with the surrounding 

communities.

GRI 418-1. Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of 
customer data

abastece aí is a digital wallet and loyalty program that offers cashback to customers refueling 

at Ipiranga service stations. The company was informed by the Brazilian Central Bank that 

there had been a data breach due to failures in its payment systems. No customer passwords, 

transaction information, financial balances or any other information protected by bank secrecy 

rules were exposed. The company would like to emphasize that the measures applicable to this 

investigation are already being taken.

In 2022. Grupo Ultra did not receive any complaints related to privacy and did not identify 

breaches, theft or loss of data of customers and other stakeholders. In the case of Ultrapar, it 

should be noted that the procedure for receiving requests from Data Owners has been improved. 

Previously, requests had to be forwarded to the Privacy Office’s e-mail address. Currently, a link 

has been made available on Ultrapar’s institutional and Institutional Relations websites, which 

directs the Data Owner to the One Trust page, where there are options to apply filters to the 

demand and so speed up the procedure.

of the Kyoto Protocol. 
2. In Ultracargo, the gases included in the calculations for Scope 1 were CO2, CH4. NO2, N2O, PFC, HFC, SF6, NF3, R-410, and for Scopes 2 and 3 it was CO2. In 
Ultragaz, the gases included in the calculations for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 were CO2, CH4 and N2O. In Ipiranga, the gases included in the calculations for Scopes 1 
and 3 were CO2, CH4, NO2 and for Scope 2 it was CO2, In 2022, Ipiranga no longer controlled the AmPm distribution centers (CDs), and so the emissions data for 
these units were excluded from the company’s GHG inventory.
