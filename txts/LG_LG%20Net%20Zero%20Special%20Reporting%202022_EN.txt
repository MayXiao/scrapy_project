Our First Stepping Stone 
to Net Zero

The Climate Crisis by Humans
The Paris Agreement of 2015 has opened up a new global climate regime, in which every nation 

is required to determine their own goals to reduce GHG emissions and monitor their progress. 

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC*) calls for global efforts to limit the  

rise of average global temperature to below 1.5C by the year 2100 compared to pre-industrial  

levels. In August 2022, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) warned in 

their Emission Gap Report** that the climate crisis calls for rapid social transformation.  

Even still, vast areas across the globe are currently experiencing the catastrophic effects of 

climate change even at this moment, and it will only get worse if we fail to limit the rising 

temperature.

Our Common Goal, Net Zero
Net Zero is a social responsibility to react against climate change as well as a survival and 

competitive strategy for sustainable growth in the face of climate crisis. As a multinational  

enterprise, LG Group is taking part in the worldwide effort to stop global warming by creating 

a feasible and profitable 2050 Net Zero strategy with a primary goal of sustainable value  

creation for all stakeholders including customers and shareholders.

Starting from LG Electronics’ first declaration of 2030 Net Zero goal in Korea, our six other 

major affiliates*** have developed their own goals to accomplish Net Zero as well as 100% 

renewable energy according to their internal plans. Furthermore, in order to achieve the common 

goal of Net Zero in a more systematic and effective manner, LG Group has integrated the Net 

Zero goals and execution plans of such affiliates, which were reviewed with consistent criteria, 

into a Group-level roadmap in 2022. We will continuously monitor the reduction plans of each 

affiliate in accordance with the Net Zero execution standards and update our integrated roadmap 

according to the changing climate agenda and technologies in the market.

Towards Net Zero, "LG Net Zero Special Reporting"
This report provides LG Group’s 2030 interim goal and 2050 final goal as well as detailed strategies, 

plans, implementation systems and current management with regard to GHG emission reduction.  

We will continue to transparently disclose the Group’s progress to all its the stakeholders 

through this annual report.

NET ZERO

LG Group adopted an integrated 2050 Net Zero roadmap to reach net zero GHG emissions by 

2050. According to the Net Zero path, the Group will accomplish Net Zero by 2050 through 

the reduction of Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions from domestic and overseas 

facilities by 27% by 2030 and 62% by 2040 compared to the base year level of 2018.*

As for the affiliates, LG Electronics will achieve Net Zero by 2030, and LG Energy Solution and 

LG Innotek, by 2040. Such an achievement of Net Zero will be a preemptive initiative in the 

global efforts to reduce GHG emissions. While the integrated roadmap provides that the Net 

Zero target of LG Display, LG Chem, LG Household and Healthcare and LG Uplus are 2050, it 

can be updated according to the development level of reduction technologies, etc.

Introduction Strategy Next Step AppendixRoadmap 07LG Net Zero Special Reporting 2022



GHG Emissions

Accurate measurement, management, and verification of greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions are 

the indispensable elements for setting a Net Zero strategy. Since the Target Management System  

for GHG and Energy was first enforced in 2011, LG Group has been conducting third-party  

verifications for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in the domestic facilities as well as applying this 

verification process to overseas sites to secure accuracy and completeness. Towards our goal of 

Net Zero, we will manage and monitor emissions, reductions, costs, implementation tasks, etc. 

of each affiliate. For this purpose, LG Group developed an ESG IT platform to integrate and systemize 

ESG non-financial information. The platform will enhance the objectivity and transparency of  

the data related to the GHG emission of each affiliate as such data will be managed in a  

comprehensive manner.

 

The domestic and overseas GHG emissions of LG Group in 2021 were 21.77 million tons. While 

GHG emissions generated in Korea account for 75% of the total, the GHGs emitted overseas 

were mostly in China, Europe, and the US. LG Energy Solution’s business expansion in North 

America and Indonesia is expected to cause an increase in indirect emissions for power usage.

The overall proportion of direct emissions from domestic facilities dropped from 55% in 2018 

to 49% in 2021 as a result of improved energy efficiency of the affiliates as well as reduction 

of process gases by LG Display, whereas the overall proportion of domestic indirect emissions 

slightly grew compared to 2018 due to the business growth of LG Chem, LG Energy Solution, etc.

Roadmap

Emissions features per affiliate in 2021

Our domestic facilities show higher direct emission rate, largely attributable to petroleum 

usage from NCC process and fluorine usage from LG Chem and LG Display respectively. Our 

overseas facilities show relatively higher indirect emission rate, as large portion of subordinate 

process is focused on fabrication and assembly with high energy consumption.

Resolution

LG Group’s integrated Net Zero roadmap is prepared upon the comprehensive review of the 

NDCs* of each country presented in accordance with the Paris Agreement, international organizations 

such as UNFCCC and IEA, and CDP and SBTi** Net Zero Standards. It also reflects the emission 

features of each affiliate's industry. To reach Net Zero, all available reduction methods both 

inside and outside of worksites needed to be utilized. Power should be switched to renewable 

energy, and the portion of GHGs that do not currently have any feasible reduction methods 

can be dealt with by creating GHG absorption sources like forests or applying innovative future 

technologies such as CCUS.*** To achieve the Net Zero goal, LG Group will further explore 

additional reduction measures as well as drive joint endeavors with its stakeholders including 

governments, academia, research institutes, local communities, and others. 

LG Group’s Net Zero goal was finalized with consistent criteria established based on the review of 

all applicable short-, mid-and long-term reduction methods as well as the cost-benefit analysis of  

reduction methods necessary for reaching 2050 Net Zero. The integrated roadmap will be updated  

according to the technology development level.The management coverage will be extended to 

Scope 3 and the number of affiliates participating in the integrated roadmap will also be increased.

Strategy

Introduction Strategy Next Step AppendixRoadmap 10LG Net Zero Special Reporting 2022



Strategy
LG Group’s Net Zero strategy is primarily focused on direct reduction, renewable energy power  

procurement, offset, and climate governance. Through direct reduction methods such as  

improved process efficiency, transition to low carbon/carbon-free fuels and innovative future  

technologies, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of domestic and overseas facilities will be  

reduced first. Transition to renewable energy power will also take place on a step-by-step basis.

  

The offsetting will only be used for the residual emissions that is technically difficult to reduce. 

Transparency and sustainable effectiveness of such offsetting will be guaranteed by applying  

global standards and focusing on those offset businesses allowing joint participation of the  

affiliates.

Renewable Energy
In 2018, LG Group’s emissions from electricity usage was approximately 10.6 million tons, 

which accounted for about 50% of its total emissions. It is expected that the percentage will 

increase to 60% in 2050 due to the Group’s plan to open new facilities in North America, 

Europe, and Southeast Asia. LG Group will begin to adopt renewable energy in its overseas 

facilities located in areas where renewable energy usage is feasible. By 2050, it will be able to 

procure all energy from renewable sources.

LG Group plans to continuously increase its renewable energy transition goal (except LG Display) 

to 54% by 2025, 83% by 2030, and 94% by 2040, and finally 100% for all its domestic and 

foreign sites by 2050. In order to proactively develop and secure renewable energy, LG Group 

plans to invest about 1 trillion KRW in Self-Generation from solar photovoltaic energy, purchase 

PPAs and RECs, etc., by 2030.

Renewable Energy
Switch to Zero Carbon 

In order to secure stable renewable energy supply, LG Group is continuously monitoring the market  

and procurement condition in the regions where its facilities are located. Also, LG Group is 

strengthening its internal communication channels such as the establishment of an inter-affiliate 

council to identify changes in the Net Zero policies and regulations of each country in a timely 

manner. Such channels will allow for the sharing of valuable information such as renewable energy 

procurement policies and technological development among our affiliates and thereby serve as a 

common ground for joint reaction as required. 

 

For newly constructed overseas facilities, LG Group is planning to procure 100% renewable 

energy for power usage from the commencement of operations. For the existing overseas 

facilities, renewable energy procurement portfolios will be optimized for each region to achieve 

100% renewable energy by 2030.   

For domestic facilities, LG Group will increase its usage of renewable energy to 50% level by 2030 

by taking initiatives such as participating in the bidding for Green Premium, purchasing renewable 

energy certificates (RECs), and others. In the mid- and long-term, LG Group will increase the portion of 

Self-Generation and PPAs implementation to procure renewable energy for power usage by 2050.

Portions of emissions from power usage in 2050 per country is currently estimated as 31% from 

Korea, 21% from China, 18% from Europe, and 13% from the US. In transition to renewable energy, 

LG Group plans to increase the portion of renewable energy usage first in the facilities located 

within the countries where high portion of emissions comes from power usage and the availability 

of renewable energy procurement is relatively high, such as China, Europe, and the US.

Offsetting

Construct a cooperative network for offsetting

For the efficient execution of offseting, LG Group will create domestic and global collaborative networks where co-planning and development of government, academia, research institute, and 

regional society can take place. Our plan includes short-term reduction by distribution of carbon efficient equipment (e.g., water purifier), and long-term absorption and removal by offsetting (e.g., 

forest development). Beyond the Net Zero, LG Group is committed to establishing sustainable regional ecosystems.

Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting*

Prioritize self-reduction projects over 

high-quality offsetting 

Regular supplementation of offset 

strategies reflecting technological 

development

Transition from avoidance and reduction 

to removal

Transition from short-term storage to 

long-term storage

Establish trustworthy offset 

market for Net Zero

* The Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting

LG Group’s principles of offsetting projects for Net Zero are currently under review, and it will 

eventually reflect the global-level recommendations for offsetting projects in the long term. It 

will seamlessly monitor the process to prevent potentially negative environmental and social 

impacts, overestimation of reduction, and redundancy of credit application. 

※  Expected amount of offset carbon credits to be secured by 2050: Approximately 5 million tons  

(about 9% of expected emissions in 2050)

LG Group will consider high-quality offsetting projects only for the residual emissions not  

addressed by other reduction plans for direct emissions (through improved process efficiency, 

fuel transition, etc.) and indirect emissions (through transition to renewable energy for power  

usage). Through the Group's offsetting projects carried out under close coordination with  

governments and regional societies, LG Group aims to contribute to its Net Zero goal and global 

GHG reduction. For credibility, LG Group will secure reduction credits with external offsetting 

projects in which strict verification procedures in accordance with internationally recognized 

UN methodologies are required.

in a timely manner. Further, LG Group will enhance its decision-making process by developing a price 

prediction model to examine economic feasibility and timeliness of its carbon reduction projects. 

 

LG Group will also establish a policy and process to identify and respond to the risks of climate 

change in advance. LG Group will develop an ESG checklist for large-scale investments as well 

as consider a policy to reflect the costs of carbon reduction into the total investment costs. 

Furthermore, a Scope 3 management plan and guideline that reflects business characteristics 

will be developed in accordance with recent international trends including the U.S. Securities 

and Exchange Commission's new Scope 3 disclosure obligation. Lastly, from the project aspect, 

LG Group will seek opportunities to carry out group-wide offsetting projects and secure exter-

nal offset credits compliant with global reduction methodologies.

System Policy·Process Project

Operation of LG Group’s Net Zero implementation inspection 

and reporting system

LG Group will regularly review the Net Zero roadmap according 

to the changes in the market and business plans of the affiliates. 

Setting of detailed milestones for implementation tasks (e.g., 

process efficiency, fuel transition, renewable energy transition 

portfolio, offset projects) for each reduction method will contribute 

to the actual reduction of carbon emissions.

Development of energy, RECs, and carbon emissions credit 

price prediction model

Economic feasibility, cost effectiveness, and timeliness are 

major considerations in developing the model. Related to DX,  

development of a price prediction model can provide practical  

information at points where cost is associated, such as RECs 

and carbon credit purchase. We look forward to utilizing the 

model in making major decisions to invest in carbon reduction. 

Operate policies and processes to review climate change 

risks in advance

LG group will develop a framework to identify and assess  

climate risks (heat waves, floods, droughts, tropical storms, etc) 

reflecting the characteristics of each nation, region, and company.

For use in large-scale investments or choosing business locations,  

LG Group will establish guidelines reflecting ESG items including 

responding to climate change. Our future operation plan will  

include detailed estimation of carbon reduction cost as a  

component of total investment cost.

Guideline for Scope 3 calculation and management plan*

LG Group recognizes Scope 3, managing the emission rate 

throughout the entire value chain, as an essential part of the  

Group's carbon emission management. However, current  

ambiguous scope and standard for Scope 3 emissions demands 

an attentive approach. LG Group will establish calculation and  

management standards for Scope 3 in a gradual manner,  

aiming to achieve comparability and verifiability at each  

affiliate in the long term. 

External offsetting and credit procurement

To accomplish the Net Zero goal, LG Group will deploy limited 

offsetting to residual emissions with difficulties in reduction by 

nature of their sources. LG Group’s reduction and removal of 

greenhouse gases will be conducted by a group-wide offset 

project based on global standards.

Renewable Energy Procurement Method

Green premium

Green premium in renewable energy procurement program is an item for implementing 

K-RE100 in which additional charges due to power usage being utilized to generate renewable 

energy. With the implementation of the 2021 Green Premium Program, LG Chem procured a 

total of 120GWh of renewable energy and LG Display also purchased 57GWh worth of electric 

energy as part of its efforts to procure renewable energy.

LG Group is reviewing various types of renewable energy procurement plans both domestically 

and internationally. By 2030, we will accelerate our transition to renewable energy by focusing 

on green premiums and RECs purchases. From 2031, our long-term plan to maximize utilizing  

methods to directly procure renewable energy such as PPAs and self-generation will be concretized.

RECs(Renewable Energy Certificates)

RECs is issued by reflecting the weighted average to renewable energy generation produced 

by a power generation business from facilities registered with the Korea Energy Agency. By 

purchasing RECs and converting into renewable energy usage certificate, any business with 

electric power usage can have its energy consumption recognized as renewable energy use. LG 

Chem is the first Korean company to enter long-term RECs purchase agreements with Korea 

South-East Power and the Samcheonpo Solar Power Plant.

PPAs(Power Purchase Agreements)

PPAs is a program to exchange renewable energy under agreed price. It is further divided into 

of third-party PPA, involving Korea Electric Power Corporation as a mediator, and direct PPA, in 

which generator business and consumer directly makes a deal. LG Electronics became the first in 

Korea to enter a solar power plant construction MOU with off-grid direct PPA in September 2022.  

Self-Generation

Self-generation is a method in which an electricity consumer installs renewable energy equipment  

and uses its produced power, and it is considered the most effective method in terms of  

procuring renewable energy for reducing greenhouse gases. LG Energy Solution, LG Household 

and Health Care, etc. are planning to invest in solar generator within its business sites.

Third-party Verification Opinion

To readers of the 2022 LG Net Zero Special Reporting

Preface

The Korea Management Registrar (KMR) received a request to verify the 2022 LG Net Zero Reporting 

(hereinafter referred to as Report). Responsibility on the drafting of the report lies with the management of 

LG, and the responsibilities of KMR are limited to issuing verification opinions for specific data and information 

within the scope explicated below.

Verification scope and standards

LG describes its Net Zero road map and strategies for achieving its Net Zero goals. The verification team applied 

the SRV1000 verification review model commentary guide of the KMR Global Management Committee and 

referred to the information disclosure requirements proposed by the CCRF of CDSB to perform verification 

with limited guarantee for the report. The verification team verified the reliability of the information of the Net 

Zero integrated roadmap and reduction strategies listed in the report based on the rule of understandability 

and verifiability.

Confirmation on whether the reporting requirements of the report were satisfied were reported in the scope 

of verification, and the verification team reviewed the following to confirm.

‘Strategic analysis’ information disclosure requirements proposed by CCRF
• Impact of climate change for the long-term and short-term strategy goals

• Long-term and short-term strategies including greenhouse gas reductions to respond to climate change

•  Explanations on the impact of climate change issue on business strategies and application of decision-making by 

the board of directors

•  Details on the current and future financial impact related to climate change strategies, risks, and greenhouse gas 

emissions

• Information for internal use and external disclosure to make decisions on strategies and goals

Among the reporting boundaries of the report, data and information from outside of the organization such as 

LG’s partners and contracted parties were excluded from the scope of verification.

Verification procedure

The verification team of KMR completed the following procedures for verification according to the verification 

standards described above for the agreed-upon verification scope.
•  Review on the possibility for understanding and verifying the Net Zero road map and strategies described in the report

• Review on the completeness of application of information required to be disclosed

•  Confirmation of organizational boundaries and scope of operational control rights set among the 7 participating affiliates

• Review on consistency of greenhouse gas emissions disclosed by participating affiliates

• Interview with persons responsible for drafting the report

Verification results and opinions

The verification team discussed about the revisions of LG’s report several times based on document reviews 

and interviews and reviewed the final version of the report to check whether revisions and recommendations 

were applied. Verification results showed that our verification team did not discover any inappropriate parts 

regarding compliance listed in the LG’s report. Furthermore, no evidence that the above data included in the 

scope of verification were inappropriately described was discovered.

| Possibility of understanding |   The LG report provides a road map and strategy for achieving Net Zero and 

provides accurate and sufficient information in detail. It is judged that the information provided in the report is 

clearly and simply categorized and characterized, and it is judged that it is concrete and described in a manner 

making it easy to compare.

| Possibility of verification |   During the verification process, the review team discovered errors in some data 

and information, and LG corrected these prior to publishing the final report. It is judged that the data and 

information carried in the report were described accurately and reliably, and no evidence was found that LG’s 

response activities for major issues were published inappropriately in the report.

Proposals for improvements

KMR hopes that the report published by LG will be actively utilized as a communication tool for stakeholders, 

and it recommends the following in the hopes of continuous improvements.

LG drafts and discloses the Net Zero report for carbon neutrality, and it gathered the will and goals of the 

seven participating affiliates of LG Group for carbon neutrality into one, and well expresses the direction of 

the LG Group’s intent to move forward to. It is recommended to continue research and investments so that 

reduction activities with high rate of mitigation can be applied to greenhouse gas emission reductions.

The Research provides the road map and strategies for achieving the Net Zero goals concretely and 

systematically. In order to make information for the disclosed report more useful, it is recommended to include 

information that may be relevant to climate change risks, Net Zero strategies, financial performance, and 

greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.
