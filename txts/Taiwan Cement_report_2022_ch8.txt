Note 1: The GHG emissions were inventoried in terms of operational control. The formula used is emissions = activity data × emissions factor (EF) × global warming potential (GWP). ((The EF used for Taiwan 

is subject to the EPA GHG Emissions Factor Management Table (v. 6.0.4); the GWP for the Cement Plants is derived from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007); the GWP for RMC Plants and Operation 

Headquarters is derived from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2021). The EF for Mainland China is subject to "Guidelines for Accounting and Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions: China Cement 

Production Enterprises (Trial)", the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the 2019 Refinement, and the GWP is derived from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2021).)

Note 2: For the data of cement plants in Taiwan in 2022, the Scope 1 draws reference from the EPA GHG Emissions Factor Management Table (v. 6.0.4); the Scope 2 draws reference from the electricity EF of 

0.509 kg of CO2e/kWh from the Bureau of Energy, MOEA in 2021. Note 3: Since 2018, we have been inventorying the most important activity associated with Scope 3 emissions: Upstream Transportation 

and Distribution, which is verified by a third-party entity and calculated based on the GHG Protocol - Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (WRI & WBCSD). Note 4: The GHG 

emissions from the RMC Plants only factor in the CO2 emissions from gasoline, diesel (added in 2022), and purchased electricity. Note 5: The disclosure of the GHG emissions from the grinding stations in 

Mainland China started from 2022, so the data for the previous three years are not available. Note 6: Based on the cementitious materials yield of 5,629,943.3250 metric tons in Taiwan in 2022, the emission 

intensity in 2022 (Scope 1 & Scope 2) is 0.8033 tCO2e/metric ton of cementitious materials. Note 7: The base year for GHG inventory in Taiwan is 2016 with the GHG emissions of 4,621,312 metric tons of 

CO2e. Note 8: The GHG emissions from Operation Headquarters in Taiwan in 2022 goes up compared to the 2021 level due to the addition of Low-carbon R&D Center in the inventory scope.

Air Pollutant Emissions on Cement Plants｜Unit: metric ton

Note 1: Heating values of coal for the cement plants in Taiwan are converted per the respective settings of the plants. The converted heating value of coal for the Suao Plant: 5,532.69 kcal/kg; the converted 
heating value of coal for the Hoping Plant: 5,570.14 kcal/kg; the converted heating value of coal for other plants: 5,500 kal;/kg；The values for other items are converted based on the heating values in the 
Emissions Factor Management Table (v. 6.0.4) released on the Bureau of Energy’s website. The values are 8,400 kcal/l for diesel, 7,800 kcal/l for gasoline, 3,600 GJ/GWh for electricity, and 8,000 (kcal/m3) for 
natural gas. The scope 2 draws reference from the electricity EF of 0.509 kg of CO2e/kWh from the Bureau of Energy, MOEA in 2021. Note 2: The data of energy use is subject to the reported data to the Bureau 
of Energy. Note 3: The Cement plants in Taiwan started collecting data on gasoline use in 2022, which were used all by corporate cars. Note 4: The RMC plants in Taiwan started collecting data on gasoline 
use in 2018. Note 5: The Operation Headquarters in Taiwan started to collect data on natural gas use in 2019, estimated as the natural gas fee of the year/unit fee per kWh. Note 6: Based on the cementitious 
materials yield of 5,629,943.3250 metric tons in Taiwan in 2022, the unit energy consumption in cementitious materials production is 3.2505 GJ/metric ton of cementitious materials. Note 7: The use of 
alternative fuels in Taiwan in 2022 increased by approximately 3.5 times compared to the 2021 levels due to the increase in diesel consumption by forklifts in short-barge transportation of feed. Note 8: 
Based on the concrete yield of 5,056,211.5 m3 in Taiwan in 2022, the unit energy consumption in concrete production is 0.014 GJ/m3 of concrete. Note 9: Based on the 184 employees on the Operation 
Headquarters in Taiwan in 2022, the energy consumption per capita is 101.21 GJ per capita. Note 10: The purchased electricity includes the electricity consumed by the mining system; nevertheless, now 
that the mining system is owned by the subsidiary, Ho Sheng Mining Co., Ltd., it is not included in the ISO 14064 GHG inventory data.

Note 1: The emissions were calculated as the emission factors of the third-party testing multiply by the usage data. Note 2: Starting from Q3 of 2018, heavy metal monitoring data was added at the request 
of the Environmental Protection Administration. The heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, and hexavalent chromium) emitted in 2022 was 0.94517 metric ton. Note 3: Starting from Q4 of 2018, 
the cement plants reported mercury emissions in accordance with legal requirements. The mercury emitted by cement plants in 2022 was 0.226347 metric ton, and there was no mercury emitted by RMC 
plants.  Note 4: The Hualien Plant did not operate in 2022 and thus had no air emissions. Note 5: The dioxin emissions at the cement plants in 2022 were 0.7576 g I-TEQ. Note 6: The business of our RMC 
plants was cement product ingredients mixing and transportation and thus had no air pollutant emission. Note7: Shaoguan Cement Plant in Mainland China was completed construction in November, 2021, 
thus Shaoguan Plant's air pollution data was included from 2022.

Water Resources Use in 4 Years｜Unit: million liters

Note 1: The water use data on cement plants is the sum of the reported data. The municipal water use on RMC plants is the sum of water used on the water bills, and the groundwater data is the sum of the 
reported data, as the water use data is subject to the actual months of water use. The municipal water use data on Operation Headquarters is the sum of water used on the water bills. Note 2: The scope of 
disclosure is the water for which TCC holds water rights. Disclosure of groundwater began in 2019. The water use data for the water for which TCC holds no water rights in 2020 is estimated on the basis of 
sales. Note 3: All the sources of water are freshwater. Note 4: TCC employed WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to conduct analysis with the distribution of water resources in Taiwan taken into account. The result 
revealed that all the operation sites in Taiwan are not located in the regions of high-water stress.  Note 5: Since the Hualien Plant did not operate in 2022, the scope of data disclosure for 2022 covers Suao 
Plant and Hoping Plant. Note 6: Based on the cementitious materials yield of 5,629,943.3250 metric tons in 2022, the water withdrawal intensity per unit cementitious materials is 0.000293 million liters 
per metric ton of cementitious materials. Note 7: The increase in water use data in Taiwan's RMC Plants in 2022 compared to 2021 is attributed to the expansion of scope. Note 8: The water discharge from 
cement plants in Mainland China amounted to 2,126 million liters, while the water discharge from grinding plants amounted to 5 million liters.

8.3 /  Material Topic Analysis

Dialogues with Sustainability Stakeholders
Pursuant to the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard (SES), TCC 
employs the five principles, i.e. Responsibility, Influence, Tension, 
Diverse Perspectives, and Dependency in identifying 10 stakeholders 
and ordering the stakeholder significance as follows: government 
agencies, clients, employees, local communities, shareholders/inves-
tors, environmental groups/NGOs, the media, industry associations/in-
dustrial and academic organizations, suppliers/contractors, and 
sustainability associations.

Sustainability Topic Identification
In line with the results of the material topics in 2021 as well as in 
consideration of the international trends of sustainable development, 
ESG ratings and benchmarks (MSCI, DJSI, and CDP), ESG standards (GRI 
Standards and SASB Standards), industry characteristics, and 
benchmark corporate practices, TCC compiled a list of sustainability 
topics covering facets of corporate governance, economy, environment, 
and society.
In 2021, a total of 225 valid stakeholder questionnaires were collected, 
with which 5 executives of the Company assessed their levels of impact 
on the Company from the respective topics, financially and non-finan-
cially, in the short-/mid-/long-term, producing a list of concerned topics 
of stakeholders and a list of topics with operational impact. The 
Corporate Sustainable Development Committee convened a meeting. 
Based on the results of questionnaire analysis, combined with 
experiences of stakeholder engagement and the recent trends of 
sustainable development, the topics include climate actions and 
net-zero emissions; pollution control and management; legal 
compliance; resource co-processing; ethical management; local 
inclusion; green energy and energy storage; sustainable products; 
workplace health and safety; risk control; operational performances; 
talent cultivation and development; and biodiversity. Hence, a total of 
13 material topics were identified for TCC in 2022.

8.4 /  Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder Policy
TCC seeks a balanced relationship between human civilization and nature and stresses on the communication between industry and 
society. The three cornerstones are Reasonable Profits (G), Mutual Benefit with Earth (E), and Human Well-Being (S).
The purpose of the stakeholder engagement policy is to offer an overall framework for TCC to engage in communication and 
interaction with stakeholders across all the activities of TCC.

1 Respond and protect the legal rights and interests of stakeholders.
2 Encourage stakeholders to participate in the corporate businesses and the communities the Company operates in to bring about   
       shared sustainable values for all. 
3 Strengthen the bilateral communication with stakeholders, build the sense of trust, and establish long-term, stable, and firm 
        relationships via various channels. 
4 Improve stakeholders’ level of identity with the sustainable development and ESG of the Company, including items pertaining to 
        professional development diversity. 
5 Maintain sustainable actions in different countries and industries through the above mentioned framework.

In addition to the rules stated above, the Board of Directors may approve any other corporate policy concerning specific stakeholder(s) 
as well.
Pursuant to the GRI Standards and AA1000 SES, TCC employs the five principles, i.e. Responsibility, Influence, Tension, Diverse 
Perspectives, and Dependency, as well as the three steps of Identify, Analyze, and Determine to examine the sustainability topics, 
perform materiality analysis, and align the strategies and long-term goals of TCC on sustainability management. Meanwhile, they 
serve as the guidelines for the preparation of Sustainability Report so as to inventory the status of sustainability of the Company, 
promote ongoing improvement of various organizations, and create shared values for the society and the Company.
TCC values the opinions of our stakeholders, actively communicating and engaging to capture material sustainability topics, which are 
incorporated in the corporate sustainable development blueprint. In line with the nature of the industry and with reference to the GRI 
Standards, SASB Standards, and Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) as well as AA1000 SES, it employs the five principles, i.e. 
Responsibility, Influence, Tension, Diverse Perspectives, and Dependency in the identification and ordering of stakeholder 
significance. Upholding the spirit of open transparency, TCC discloses information through a variety of communication channels, 
ensuring effective and quality communication results with our stakeholders. TCC systematically designed sustainability topic survey 
questionnaires, with which it collects and analyzes feedbacks of stakeholders; meanwhile, TCC evaluates the impacts and risk levels 
of sustainability topics on corporate operation, identifying material topics to prioritize responses and reactions to meet the 
expectations of stakeholders toward TCC. In addition, TCC values expectations of our stakeholders for the Company and incorporates 
the topics of concern as the reference for corporate operation and sustainable development blueprint, so that TCC may better promote 
sustainable management, fulfilling our corporate social responsibility. TCC is convinced that only with smooth and effective communi-
cation channels with our stakeholders can TCC capture the pulses in the markets, economy, society, and environment, and ultimately 
put TCC’s sustainability missions of “Nature First” and “Benefit to Society” into action.

Industry Associations/Sustainability Initiatives & Organizations
TCC supports and participates in the initiatives relevant to the issues of climate change, circular economy, biodiversity, and new 
technology R&D. Also, TCC proactively engages with various associations on sustainability topics. For instance, TCC presented on GCCA 
as well as formulated the carbon neutrality route for the cement industry together with our fellow peers worldwide. In addition, TCC 
has been actively involved in the seminars and the domestic public hearings on laws and regulations concerning sustainability, 
assisted in the development of Guidelines for Safety and Heath at Work for the Cement Industry, and translated the Circular Transition 
Indicators (CIT) and Water Circularity Metric (WCM). Meanwhile, echoing with the international trends, TCC joined the Taiwan Nature 
Positive Initiative and signed the Business for Nature “Make it Mandatory” aligned with the UN SDGs. Together with experts, scholars, 
peers, and predecessors, TCC learns and exchanges on sustainability practices.

The actual emissions of airborne particulate matters from the manufacturing process of TCC are registered through the system on a quarterly basis.

After communicating and explaining the contents and concepts of fire safety and safety standards such as NFPA855 and UL9540A with the National Fire Agency, the 
Fire Prevention Division agreed to amend the fire safety guidelines for outdoor energy storage. The contents amended include:
◤The proviso was added to the capacity limit specified in Article 7 of the guidelines; the original regulation was limited to only 50 kWh per unit.
◤Explanation was made concerning the illogicality and issues with design and installation in Article 4 to 6 of the guidelines, and approval was obtained from the 
NFA for exemption (performance-based regulations) by means of risk assessment or emergency contingency, or certification against the international standards like 
IEC62933 or UL9540.
◤Article 7 of the guidelines stipulates that installation of a firewall with 2-hour fire rate can reduce the distance required for the installation of energy storage 
system to a location away from buildings, public roads, or parking lots from thirty meters to three meters, allowing compliance by NHOA.TCC with the use of UHPC 
plates with fire-resistance in line with the 2-hour curve of temperature increase of CNS12514-1/-8, certified by a TAF-accredited laboratory with report presented.

TCC participated in the seminar on fire safety regulations, suggested that the fire safety certification for UHPC cabinets could be proposed by the American UL 
Standards, with UL 263: Fire Tests of Building Construction and Material + UL 10C: Standard for Positive Pressure Fire Tests of Door Assemblies and UL 1479 
Standard Method of Fire Tests Through-Penetration Firestops + NFPA 5000: Building Construction and Safety Code for certification, along with assessments with the 
corresponding European Standards, in an attempt to sold the products worldwide.

The Green Factory Program was executed by the Foundation of Taiwan Industry Service, which TCC assisted in the evaluation and discussion of the green 
environment sustainable optimization indicators questionnaire.

TCC was involved in the pilot, including the on-site interviews and fill-out of the pilot questionnaire to firstly understand the material content of the taxonomy and 
the policy direction of the competent authority, followed by feedbacks on the fill-out of the questionnaire to help optimize the content of the guidebook and Q&A 
content.

Description (Synopsis included)

The total energy consumed in the organization in 2022 was 18,028,914 GJ, of which the non-renewable fuel consumption accounted for 

18,027,806 GJ, and the renewable fuel consumption accounted for 1,108 GJ. The renewable fuel consumption was calculated based on the 

308 MWh of renewable energy used in power production for self-consumption. Converted with 3.6 GJ per MWh, it was equivalent to 1,108 

GJ.

The plants’ energy-saving plans in 2022 reduced consumption of 8,941.134 MWh in total. Converted with 3.6 GJ per MWh, it was equivalent 

to 32,188.08 GJ.

TCC had no operational site in protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas.

TCC conducts biodiversity survey and observation of environmental changes yearly as well as environmental monitoring and survey quarterly. 

Please refer to TCC official website for the survey results.

No TCC operational site was situated in areas of IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species.
