3. Business Review

In 2022, facing the complex and severe external environment, the Bank fully and faithfully 
applied the new development philosophy on all fronts, centering on the 20th CPC National 
Congress and its guiding principles. We acted on the general working principle of pursuing 
progress while ensuring stability and fully implemented the important requirements of 
responding effectively to COVID-19, maintaining economic stability, and ensuring security 
in development. We improved our work through rectification following the disciplinary 
inspection by the CPC Central Committee. We took proactive actions to overcome 
difficulties and promoted our own high-quality development while serving the new pattern 
of development. As a result, we delivered an operating performance that improves quality 
whilst ensuring stability.

The core indicators about the “Strong, Excellent and Large” orientation of development 
continued to improve. The Bank maintained its position among top large global banks 
in terms of assets and profit. In terms of being “Strong”, the Bank’s capital adequacy 
ratio rose to 19.26% and allowance to NPLs registered 209.47%, maintaining at a sound 
level. The balance of asset allowance was nearly RMB800.0 billion, indicating stronger 
risk resistance. NPL ratio decreased to 1.38%, marking the eighth consecutive quarterly 
decrease. In terms of being “Excellent”, return on average total assets (“ROA”) stood at 
0.97% and return on weighted average equity (“ROE”) stood at 11.43%. Net interest margin 
(“NIM”) recorded 1.92%, indicating more profit concessions for the real economy and 
maintaining at a reasonable range. In terms of being “Large”, total assets rose by 12.6% 
to RMB39.6 trillion, operating income was RMB841.4 billion, and net profit increased 
by 3.1% and reached a new record high of RMB361.0 billion. The foregoing performance 
results have fully reflected an overall balance in value creation, market position, risk 
control and capital constraint and again demonstrated the Bank’s stable operation feature 
and strong development resilience as well as great potential for growth in future.

These results were mainly attributed to the Bank’s efforts in “stability, progress and 
reform”.



8

“Stability” means effectively ensuring overall economic stability by serving policies 
and measures to stabilize the economy and effectively controlling risks.

Always keeping in mind the top priorities of the country, we placed our focus of operation 
on serving the real economy and implemented a full range of policies and follow-up 
measures to stabilize the economy. Through instruments such as loans, bonds, leasing, and 
debt-for-equity swaps, we provided a total of over RMB6.4 trillion funds of all types to the 
real economy. RMB denominated loans of domestic branches increased by RMB2.6 trillion, 
representing a year-on-year increase of RMB428.3 billion. While maintaining a reasonable 
growth in volume, we continued to adjust and optimize the structure to make our financial 
services more adaptable, competitive and inclusive. The Bank maintained the lead in terms 
of the size of loans to manufacturing, green industries, and sci-tech innovations, and the 
growth rate of loans for key areas such as inclusive and agriculture-related areas was 
significantly higher than the growth of total loans. We innovated in supply of financial 
services and optimized the payment environment, which helped improve the quality and 
expand the scale of consumption. We intensified support to ensure stable performance in 
foreign trade and foreign investment and actively served high-standard opening up and the 
high-quality development of the Belt and Road.

Risk is the biggest variable in business. The Bank adheres to the coordinated development 
and security, and earnestly implements arrangements to prevent and resolve major 
economic and financial risks, and adjusts risk prevention and control strategies based on the 
circumstances. Our asset quality is stable overall and all types of risks are generally under 
control. We advanced the Five-pronged Risk Management Approach in depth, strengthened 
the bonding force of the three lines of defense, and upgraded the enterprise-wide risk 
management system. We refined the system of new rules and regulations on credit 
approval, enriched the application of intelligent risk control, and focused on improving risk 
governance in key areas and key large accounts. We enhanced joint control of market risks, 
which effectively responded to fluctuations in global financial markets. We actively share 
risk control technologies and tools with over 300 peers, thereby helping them to maintain 
financial stability.

“Progress” means continuing to strengthen the foundation of high-quality development 
by promoting implementation of plans and basic projects.

We revised the strategic plan for the development of the Group to effectively align with 
the national 14th Five-Year Plan. We adhered to the combination of overall advancement 
and breakthrough-making in key areas, and accelerated the implementation of the strategic 
layout of “leveraging our strengths, tackling areas of weaknesses and solidifying the 
foundation”. The leading strengths of business segments such as corporate finance, 
settlement finance, institutional finance and financial markets were consolidated. New 
achievements were made in strategic focuses including personal finance, foreign exchange 
business, key areas and urban-rural collaboration and some potential segments have been 
growing into new growth drivers. Personal financial assets maintained the leading position 
in terms of scale; international settlement, cross-border RMB settlement, and foreign 
exchange sale and settlement saw their business value increase by about 5%, and the ICBC 
Xingnongtong APP covered over 1,800 counties in the year of launch.



9

We continued our efforts in basic work and in areas that are good for long-term 
development. Based on our strength in customer base and interactions among government, 
business and consumer (GBC), we continued to implement basic projects including Net 
Making and Patching, fund retention, urban-rural collaboration, agency business, merchant 
marketing, etc. and sped up the formation of the customer ecosystem with coordinated 
development of micro, small, medium and large enterprises and personal customers. At the 
end of 2022, corporate customers, cash settlement accounts and merchants all exceeded 10 
million, and the number of personal customers increased by 16.72 million to 720 million. 
The synergistic effect became more apparent, and a record high in annual increase in 
customer deposits exceeding RMB3.4 trillion was set.

“Reform” means constantly energizing growth drive through reform, innovation and 
digitalization.

We take reforms as the fundamental driving force and innovation as the first of such 
driving force, formulated and implemented the comprehensive reform plan, and accelerated 
connotative development. We deepened mechanisms innovation. We refined the 
supervision and assessment system, optimized the competitiveness evaluation indicator 
system, improved the green finance management mechanism, enhanced ESG management 
efficiency, and boosted the balanced, coordinated, sustainable high-quality development 
state. We deepened innovation in services, launching series service solutions for new urban 
residents, rolling out the first personal pension savings product, and continued to expand 
high-frequency service scenarios concerning people’s livelihood such as government 
affairs, medical and pension. We also deepened innovation in channels. We accelerated the 
building of “Cloud ICBC”, strengthened online and offline integrated operations, enriched 
functions of “ICBC Sharing Stations” for the benefit of the people, and continued to 
improve outlets’ competitiveness and customer satisfaction.

We took digitalization as a new driver of growth. We sped up the development of D-ICBC, 
promoted digital upgrading of businesses, products and services, and continued to cultivate 
new growth engines. We launched Mobile Banking 8.0 and ICBC e Life 5.0 and established 
an open wealth community. The number of mobile banking personal customers reached 516 
million and monthly active users on the mobile end exceeded 174 million, both ranking first 
in the industry. We upgraded the ECOS and intensified efforts to achieve breakthroughs in 
core technologies of key areas, further consolidating the technical foundation. The Bank 
ranked first among domestic banks in terms of new and cumulative numbers of patents 
granted in the year, and comprehensive technological strength continued to lead the 
industry.

4. Discussion and Analysis

4.1 Income Statement Analysis

In 2022, the Bank maintained steady progress, improved quality in operation, and 
continuously improved its capability to achieve balanced, coordinated and sustainable 
development. The Bank actively performed its responsibilities as a large bank and 
continued to strengthen its support for the real economy. In the year, the Bank realized a 
net profit of RMB361,038 million, representing an increase of RMB10,822 million or 3.1% 
as compared to the previous year. Return on average total assets stood at 0.97%, and return 
on weighted average equity was 11.43%. Operating income amounted to RMB841,441 
million, representing a decrease of 2.3%. Specifically, net interest income grew by 0.4% 
to RMB693,687 million; non-interest income was RMB147,754 million, down by 13.2%. 
Operating expenses amounted to RMB240,884 million, representing an increase of 2.0%, 
and the cost-to-income ratio was 27.43%. Impairment losses on assets were RMB182,419 
million. Income tax expense decreased by 17.6% to RMB61,527 million.

Net Interest Income

In 2022, net interest income was RMB693,687 million, RMB3,007 million or 0.4% higher 
than that of last year, accounting for 82.4% of the Bank’s operating income. Interest 
income grew by RMB118,158 million or 10.2% to RMB1,280,376 million and interest 
expenses increased by RMB115,151 million or 24.4% to RMB586,689 million. Net interest 
spread and net interest margin (“NIM”) came at 1.73% and 1.92% respectively, both down 
19 basis points from the previous year, largely due to the Bank’s enhanced support for the 
real economy, multiple reductions in the Loan Prime Rate (LPR), a steady decrease in loan 
yield, and a rise in the average deposit interest rate driven by the regularization of time 
deposits.

4.6 Outlook

2022 was an extraordinary year. Adhering to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese 
Characteristics for a New Era, ICBC continued to earnestly implement the decisions and 
arrangements of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (“CPC”) and the 
State Council. Following the “48-character” guideline, the Bank coordinated development 
and safety, and advanced the “Strong, Excellent and Large” features by making efforts 
in “stability, progress and reform”. It achieved the admirable performance of making 
progress and improving quality while ensuring stability, which was better than the 
expected and the best over recent years, and reached a new stage in the high-quality 
development of the Bank.

2023 is the start for comprehensively implementing the guiding principles of the 20th 
National Congress of the CPC. The fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain 
unchanged, and they will maintain long-term growth and demonstrate strong resilience, 
great potential and sufficient vitality. The economic operation is expected to recover in 
general, creating favorable conditions for the high-quality development of the banking 



36

industry. However, the world has entered a new period of turmoils and changes and the 
world economy may be troubled by stagflation, producing adverse influence for the stable 
and healthy operation of banking.

ICBC will continue to follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with 
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, study and carry out in depth the guiding 
principles of the 20th National Congress of the CPC, and fully and faithfully apply the 
new development philosophy on all fronts. Following the “48-character” guideline, the 
Bank will focus on serving the Chinese path to modernization and driving high-quality 
development. It will strive to further practice the arrangements of “leveraging our strengths, 
tackling areas of weaknesses and solidifying the foundation” and seek new breakthroughs 
in development plans. With concrete action, the Bank will contribute to the efforts to kick 
off to a good start for building a modern socialist country in all respects.

First, it will stabilize growth to fully serve the Chinese path to modernization. The 
Bank will firmly implement the decisions and arrangements of the Central Committee 
of the CPC, put stability first and pursue progress while ensuring stability, and fulfill its 
responsibilities as a large bank in promoting larger domestic demand, optimized supply and 
smooth circulation. It will deepen the implementation of key strategies such as the No.1 
Personal Bank, the Preferred Bank for Foreign Exchange Business, Sharpening Competitive 
Edge in Key Regions, and Urban-Rural Collaborative Development. By providing 
high-quality financial services, the Bank will contribute to the efforts of stabilizing growth, 
employment and price.

Second, it will adjust structure to create the new ecosystem of high-quality 
development. Aiming to develop into a world-class and modern financial enterprise with 
Chinese characteristics, the Bank will construct a balanced and coordinated customer 
structure, a stable and reasonable asset structure, a diverse income structure, an innovative 
and leading product structure, and a fully integrated channel structure. In doing so, it will 
solidify the “Strong, Excellent and Large” features and move closer towards balanced, 
coordinated and sustainable developments.

Third, it will provide driving forces by enhancing support in technology, data and 
talents. The Bank will accurately follow the direction of modern financial development 
and remain committed to technology self-reliance, development empowered by digital 
technology and development led and driven by talents. It will advance the building of 
“D-ICBC”, a strong bank with technology advantages and top-notch talent teams, and 
first-class think tanks. Continuous efforts will be made to improve customer experience, 
business efficiency and value creation capability. The Bank will continue to plan in a 
well-coordinated way and fully deepen the comprehensive reform to build new engines for 
high-quality development.

Fourth, it will prevent risks and put up new high-level defense lines for security. 
Adhering to a holistic approach to national security, the Bank will refine the Five-pronged 
Risk Management Approach, strengthen source control and joint prevention, and keep 
a close eye on major fields, weak links and critical positions in promoting the iteration 
and upgrading of the comprehensive risk management system. It will enhance building, 
execution and supervision of the internal control system and unremittingly reinforce 
production safety to effectively prevent and eliminate major risks.



37

Fifth, it will break new ground in the guidance of the Party building. The Bank will 
keep cementing the results of the disciplinary inspection by the CPC Central Committee, 
continue to refine the implementation mechanism for the major decisions and arrangements 
of the CPC Central Committee, and promote the guiding principles of the 20th CPC 
National Congress to be carried out throughout the Bank and produce vivid practice. It will 
remain firmly committed to the full and strict Party self-governance, continue with strict

4.7 Hot Topics in the Capital Market

Hot Topic 1: Bright Spots in High-quality Development

Since 2019, ICBC has adhered to the “48-character” guideline, implemented the strategy 
of “leveraging our strengths, tackling areas of weaknesses and solidifying the foundation”, 
strived to be stronger, bigger and better in a push for high-quality development and 
managed to make its financial services more adaptable, competitive and inclusive. The 
Bank delivered better-than-expected results and year-on-year improvements in major 
performance indicators, showing steady progress with higher quality. With more evident 
features of high-quality development, ICBC has made fresh headway in its drive for a 
world-class and modern financial enterprise with Chinese characteristics.

First, the “strong” foundation was effectively cemented. The capital adequacy ratio rose 
to over 19%, remaining on the rise for 10 consecutive quarters since 2019 and cementing 
the Bank’s position among the world’s top banks. Allowance to NPLs was stable at around 
200%, suggesting strong resilience to risks. Asset quality was further consolidated with 
NPL ratio standing at 1.38% in 2022, in a downtrend for 8 quarters in a row.

Second, the “excellent” quality was effectively maintained. In 2019-2021, the Bank’s 
return on average total assets (“ROA”) remained above 1% and the return on weighted 
average equity (“ROE”) was kept at around 12%, both at relatively good level. Net 
interest margin (“NIM”) stayed above 2.1%. ROA and ROE were 0.97% and 11.43% in 
2022, respectively, and NIM stood at 1.92%. The Bank maintained a comparable range of 
profitability and return to those of its peers.

Third, the strengths in “large” scale were effectively consolidated. Scale indicators 
registered further growth. Total assets rose to nearly RMB40 trillion from RMB28 
trillion. Total loans expanded from RMB15 trillion to more than RMB23 trillion. The 
balance of deposits (including deposits from banks and other financial institutions) 
exceeded RMB32 trillion from RMB23 trillion, leading the global banking industry. 
Net capital base grew from RMB3 trillion to RMB4 trillion. Profitability continued to 
improve. Operating income grew to RMB841.4 billion from RMB725.1 billion, being 
the first bank to break the mark of RMB800.0 billion in the domestic banking sector. 
Net profit rose to RMB361.0 billion from RMB298.7 billion, the first among comparable 
peers to break the mark of RMB300.0 billion, RMB350.0 billion and RMB360.0 billion 
respectively, an all-time high topping the world.



38

Fourth, the “specialized” brand image was effectively enhanced. Loans to 
manufacturing, sci-tech innovation, green and other specialty fields registered 
faster-than-average growth, maintaining an edge over peers. Specifically, the balance of 
loans to manufacturing exceeded RMB3 trillion, and both the balance and increment of 
such ranked first in the industry. Total loans to strategic emerging industries exceeded 
RMB1.7 trillion. The balance of agriculture-related loans exceeded RMB3 trillion.

Hot Topic 2: Serving the Real Economy as a Pillar to Ensure its Stable Growth

In 2022 when domestic and international situations were complicated by various risks and 
challenges, the Bank adhered to the principle of commercial sustainability, maintained a 
prudent risk appetite, selected customers and projects on the basis of merit, and effectively 
transmitted the monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank expanded the total supply of financial 
resources, boosted precise and direct access to funding, provided high-quality support for 
the real economy and effectively bolstered business development and competitiveness 
enhancement.

First, aggregate investment and financing grew fast to support profit growth. The 
continuity and stability of financing were boosted to help stabilize the economy and growth 
while maintaining strong momentum for income and profit growth. Total credit supply 
expanded. The Bank introduced a series of financial service policy tools, including 30 
measures to help stabilize the macroeconomy. Credit supply registered higher year-on-year 
growth than a year ago, leading the banking sector in both quantity and quality. In 2022, 
the Bank’s RMB denominated loans of domestic branches increased by RMB2.6 trillion 
from the end of last year, with the increment increased by RMB428.3 billion year-on-
year. Quarterly growth of loans registered a higher year-on-year increase thanks to all-out, 
front-loaded and targeted lending at a more balanced pace. A combination of financing 
channels was utilized. An all-time high of more than RMB6.4 trillion of financing was 
channeled into the real economy in the form of loans, bonds, leasing and debt-for-equity 
swaps. In addition, the Bank aligned its lending activity with the structural monetary 
policy instruments for carbon emission reduction, clean and efficient use of coal, sci-tech 
innovation and transportation and logistics, and supplied the largest amount of funding for 
these fields across the banking sector.

Second, the allocation of credit funds became more targeted to further sharpen the 
competitive edge. The Bank recorded an increase of RMB775.1 billion in loans to new 
basic industries when compared with the beginning of the year, leading the market by 
both total size and increment, with a focus on five key areas (including the financing of 
infrastructure fund-backed projects and the transportation, water conservancy and energy 
network infrastructures) and the marketing of key projects in the 14th Five-Year Plan. 
Focused on primary responsibilities and core businesses, loans to manufacturing increased 
by nearly RMB870.0 billion when compared with the beginning of the year. Industry 
chain-wide financial service plans were rolled out for integrated circuits, the automobile 
industry and machinery and equipment. Targeted efforts were made at the intersection of 
innovation and industrial chains. The Bank’s loans to emerging industries increased by 
65% from the beginning of the year, and loans to enterprises featuring “Specialization, 
Refinement, Differentiation and Innovation” increased by more than 85%. The inclusive 
service models were innovated. The Bank forged a “targeted, smooth and smart” new 



39

image of digital inclusive finance and continued to improve the three product lines of 
e-Mortgage Quick Loan, Quick Lending for Operation and Digital Supply Chain. The 
inclusive loans increased by more than RMB450.0 billion or 40% from the beginning of 
the year, and the number of customers exceeded 1 million. The green finance layout 
was optimized. The Bank built the green finance brand “ICBC Green Bank+”, and 
improved the “green technological transformation” product line. At the end of 2022, the 
balance of green loans reached nearly RMB4 trillion, leading the banking sector in both 
balance and increment. The Bank launched the “Chunrong Action” to stabilize foreign 
trade and foreign investment. More than RMB1.17 trillion of new loans were issued to 
foreign trade and foreign-funded enterprises in the fields of advanced manufacturing, 
“Specialization, Refinement, Differentiation and Innovation” fields and domestic and 
foreign trade integration. Making the most of its global network, the Bank issued more than 
USD48.5 billion of loans to overseas upstream and downstream of key foreign traders and 
foreign-funded enterprises. The Bank boosted its competitiveness in major regional credit 
markets leveraging its strengths in comprehensive financial services, and its RMB loans in 
key regions, such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Integration, the Yangtze River Economic 
Belt, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Chengdu-Chongqing 
Economic Circle grew faster than the beginning of the year. In addition, in 2022, the Bank 
continued to deepen and improve the LPR pricing authorization system for classified loans 
and accurately implemented loan pricing. On the other hand, the Bank applied strict “access 
control” to new loans, maintaining a low NPL ratio through the year.

Hot Topic 3: Working Hard on “GBC+” Projects to Improve the Customer Ecosphere

In 2022, the Bank made solid progress in deepening the development of “GBC+” projects. 
With the construction of scenario-based financial services and digital marketing as the 
core means, the optimal integration of online and offline channels as effective support and 
customer groups such as “agriculture, rural areas and farmers”, payroll service customers 
and merchants as the important points of breakthrough, the Bank improved the customer 
ecosystem where customers of different sizes are well coordinated and customers at 
different age groups are well balanced. It further optimized the D-ICBC digital ecosystem 
and the ECOS technology ecosystem, unblocked the internal circulation of funds and 
effectively achieved rapid growth of deposits in 2022.

First, key GBC (government, business and consumer) scenarios were effectively 
implemented. With a focus on 22 key scenarios including rural revitalization, basic 
living consumption and medical insurance services, the G (government), B (business) and 
C (consumer) are integrated and mutually promoted to achieve all-round development. 
During the reporting period, the key scenarios created 6,994 new G-end customers 
(up 195% year-on-year), 473 thousand new B-end customers (up 141% year-on-year), 
and 72.75 million new and active C-end customers (up 85% year-on-year), showing 
faster improvement of the customer ecosystem. G-end customers’ deposits increased by 
RMB151.9 billion, B-end customers’ deposits increased by RMB338.8 billion and payroll 
service for C-end customers amounted to RMB1.9 trillion, indicating remarkable results of 
deposit taking and customer attraction.



40

Second, the Bank’s customer base achieved bigger size and higher quality. During the 
reporting period, the number of either corporate customers or corporate accounts exceeded 
10 million, a historical high. New corporate customers drove an increase of RMB283.8 
billion in corporate deposits and new personal customers fueled an increase of RMB178.0 
billion in savings deposits compared with the end of the previous year. The Bank registered 
a substantially larger number of corporate customers with average daily financial assets of 
more than RMB10,000 and personal customers with average daily financial assets of more 
than RMB50,000, showing an improving quality of customers. The number of corporate 
borrowers increased by nearly 30%, and corporate loans rose by RMB1.63 trillion from the 
end of the previous year, hitting a record high.

Third, the inner circulation of funds was unimpeded. Backed by the GBC panoramic 
fund flow data system, the Bank continued to use high-quality financial services to promote 
the improvement of quality and increase of fund retention from existing customers and 
attracted new customers to open accounts with the Bank. During the reporting period, the 
fund returning ratio of the Bank reached 43.58%, an increase of 3 percentage points.

Fourth, the coordination of channels gained momentum. Basic strengths in offline 
channels were consolidated to boost the competitiveness of outlets. New areas of online 
services were opened up and mobile banking and other online channels were improved to 
provide customers with faster, stronger and more interesting experience of digital finance. 
The Bank pursued in-depth integration of online and offline channels so that all channels 
could complement each other better to enable “one-point access, all-channel response”, 
providing strong support for the implementation of key strategies and development of 
various work of the Bank.

Fifth, key customer groups grew at a faster pace. Though urban-rural collaboration, the 
Bank as a top-notch player has had its rural revitalization work take root in rural markets. 
During the reporting period, the personal, corporate and institutional customers in county 
areas increased by 4%, 14% and 11%, respectively. The balance of agriculture-related loans 
exceeded RMB3 trillion to hit a record high, leading the banking sector in both increment 
and growth rate. Payroll service deepened interaction between business segments and 
integration of resources to achieve growth on multiple fronts in parallel. During the 
reporting period, the Bank provided payroll service for 814 thousand corporate customers, 
an increase of 87 thousand corporations, serving a total of 110 million personal customers, 
an increase of 1.25 million individuals, with the balance of relevant AUM growing by 
RMB844.5 billion to RMB6.9 trillion. The number of merchant customers exceeded 10 
million, the first to break the mark worldwide, and the number of new merchant customers 
exceeded RMB3.2 million, far ahead of peers by both total size and increment. Fund 
inflows from merchants totaled RMB3.79 trillion, an increase of 5.8%. Incremental savings 
deposits and financial assets reached RMB127.7 billion and RMB149.3 billion, up 59% and 
43%, respectively, providing a new model and a new driving force for the Bank’s profit 
growth.

In addition, the Bank stepped up efforts to build the D-ICBC digital ecosystem 
and the ECOS technology ecosystem, providing a powerhouse for the GBC+ customer 
ecosystem. In terms of the D-ICBC digital ecosystem, empowering industry development, 
the Bank participated deeply in digital transformation of the industry and innovated the 
ICBC Global Pay – Overseas Direct Payment, which won the first prize of the PBC’s 



41

FinTech Development Awards. In serving the public wellbeing, the service processes were 
continuously streamlined, and Mobile Banking 8.0 and ICBC e Life 5.0 were launched 
to provide over 500 million customers with personalized service experience. The Bank 
was the first to complete aging and barrier-free transformation of internet services. In 
strengthening government-bank cooperation, the Bank unleashed its technological and data 
strengths to facilitate the digital government construction. It was the only bank to develop 
the nationwide pooling system for pension insurance funds, and cooperated with local 
governments in developing the dedicated government App. The annual transaction value 
of the Anxin fund supervision platform exceeded RMB330.0 billion. In terms of ECOS 
technology ecosystem, driven by both technology and data, the cloud computing platform 
continued to lead in the banking sector by size, with the data scale growing rapidly in 
excess of 270PB, up about 30% year on year, and the number of intelligent models in use 
exceeding 2,200. The distributed and open architecture transition was deepened, with more 
than 5,000 open API services exported. The Bank helped deepen innovation in the R&D 
mechanism and adopted the open competition mechanism to better unleash the vitality 
of sci-tech innovation. The requirement R&D cycle was shortened by 11% year-on-year, 
suggesting significant improvements in quality and effectiveness of R&D.

In the future, the Bank will adhere to systematic thinking, strengthen FinTech 
empowerment, coordinate the development of “GBC+” projects, provide a strong growth 
momentum for the customer ecosystem and accelerate the cultivation of a balanced, 
coordinated and sustainable ecosystem of high-quality development.

Hot Topic 4: New Breakthroughs in High-quality Development of Deposits

In 2022, the Bank worked hard to build the customer base and progressed steadily toward 
volume-price coordination, making new breakthroughs in the high-quality development of 
deposits. At the end of the year, due to customers increased by RMB3.43 trillion over the 
end of last year, RMB2.12 trillion more than the increase at the same period of last year. 
The deposits showed continued improvements in stability and equilibrium, leading the 
market by both aggregate and incremental size.

First, the Bank had a stronger influence in aggregate deposit base. With its 
farsightedness in the pattern of fund flows in the society, the Bank was a frontrunner 
in competing for deposits and achieved rapid growth of total deposits. The balance of 
domestic deposits in RMB and foreign currencies (including deposits from banks and other 
financial institutions) exceeded RMB30 trillion to reach RMB30.9 trillion, an increase of 
RMB3.5 trillion over the end of last year, and RMB2 trillion higher than the same period of 
last year, providing more stable and sustainable financial support for the real economy. The 
incremental size hit an all-time high for the same period.

Second, the average daily growth in deposits led the banking sector. The Bank attaches 
great importance to the daily accumulation of deposits, highlighting the daily average 
level. The deposit base has been gradually stabilized and increased by expanding channels, 
strengthening product portfolio, improving system functions and enhancing service 
experience. The equilibrium rate of new deposits reached the highest level in recent years, 
with the deposit curve trending up steadily and upward, leaving a “distinctive curve” 
pointing to an average daily increment ahead of peers.



42

Third, breakthroughs were made in the coordinated growth across deposit business 
segments. The Bank scientifically grasped the new trends and features of fund flows to 
expand the flow and stock and enlarge the deposit and AUM capacity. The balance of 
domestic personal deposits in RMB and foreign currencies exceeded RMB14 trillion. 
Domestic corporate deposits in RMB and foreign currencies broke the mark of RMB13 
trillion, with a focus on payroll service, pensions, new urban residents, merchants, 
county areas and entrepreneurs, and stronger synergies among sectors and business lines. 
Incremental personal deposits and corporate deposits reached a record high for the same 
period.

Fourth, the competitiveness in deposits in key regions has steadily improved. The Bank 
served the coordinated regional development strategies of China, focused on the changing 
spatial patterns of the national economy such as industrial upgrading, redistribution of 
factors of production and evolution of metropolitan areas. It actively seized business 
opportunities in key regions and tapped deep into the deposit markets in key regions, 
leading the market by both balance and increment of deposits in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei 
region, the Yangtze River Delta, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, 
Central China and Chengdu-Chongqing region.

Fifth, deposits showed a prominent feature of coordinated volume and price 
development. The Bank took the initiatives to adapt to the market-oriented reform of 
deposit interest rates and actively implemented the market-oriented adjustment mechanism 
for deposit interest rates. In September, the Bank lowered the quoted rate of RMB 
deposits, which marks an important step forward in promoting the market-oriented reform 
of deposit interest rates. Tools were flexibly used to improve the deposit mix to stabilize 
the proportion of demand deposits. The deposit cost was kept at a relatively low level 
among comparable peers by constantly optimizing the terms, interest rates and structure of 
deposits. The Bank has enhanced its ability to coordinate volume with price of deposits and 
create value.

Sixth, the overall customer base continued to consolidate. The Bank fully harnessed 
its strengths in comprehensive financial services including products, services, channels 
and technology and strengthened its overall customer base with higher-quality financial 
products and better comprehensive services, retaining funds more efficiently. The customer 
base expanded effectively on the G (government), B (business) and C (consumer) ends. 
With stronger ability to reach customers with targeted services, the Bank saw a broader 
range and a higher activity level of customers, a higher ratio of fund retention from 
institutional and corporate customers, a higher on-boarding ratio of target customers outside 
the Bank and a higher retention rate of payroll service customers.

The Bank continued to improve the customer ecosystem and the structure of new deposits 
with well-coordinated quality and quantity, volume and price. The Bank sharpened its 
competitive edge in market by effective growth of daily average deposits and boosted the 
ability to provide more stable and sustainable funding support for the real economy while 
pursuing its own high-quality development.

7.3 Significant Accounting Policies

(1) Mandatory amendments to IFRSs effective for the current year

In the current year, the Group has applied, for the first time, the following 
amendments to IFRSs issued by the IASB which are mandatorily effective for the 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 for the preparation of the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements:

–Amendments to IFRS 3: Reference to the Conceptual Framework
–Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended 

Use
–Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract
–Amendments to IFRSs: Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2018-2020

The adoption of the above-mentioned amendments to IFRSs has had no material 
impact on the financial position and financial performance of the Group.

(2) Issued but not yet effective IFRSs and amendments to IFRSs

The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued 
but are not yet effective.

IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts and the related Amendments 1

Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an 
Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture2

Amendments to IFRS 16: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback3

Further information about those changes that are expected to affect the Group:

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and the related amendments

IFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts .

IFRS 17 outlines a general model, which is modified for insurance contracts with 
direct participation features, described as the variable fee approach. The general 
model is simplified if certain criteria are met by measuring the liability for remaining 
coverage using the premium allocation approach. The general model uses current 
assumptions to estimate the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows and 
it explicitly measures the cost of that uncertainty. It takes into account market interest 
rates and the impact of policyholders’ options and guarantees.

In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 to address concerns and 
implementation challenges that were identified after IFRS 17 was published. The 
amendments defer the date of initial application of IFRS 17 (incorporating the 
amendments) to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.

In December 2021, the IASB issued Amendment to IFRS 17 Initial Application of 
IFRS 17  and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information  to address implementation challenges 
that were identified after IFRS 17 was published. The amendment addresses 
challenges in the presentation of comparative information.

IFRS 17 is to be applied retrospectively unless impracticable, in which case the 
modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach is applied.

The adoption of the new and revised IFRS is expected to have no material impact on 
the financial position and financial performance of the Group.

Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a 
Single Transaction

The amendments narrow the scope of the recognition exemption of deferred tax 
liabilities and deferred tax assets so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on 
initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. 
Upon the application of the amendments, the Group will recognise a deferred tax asset 
(to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary difference can be utilised) and a deferred tax liability for all 
deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with the right-of-use assets 
and the lease liabilities.



65

The adoption of the amendment is expected to have no material impact on the 
financial position and financial performance of the Group.

Other new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective 
are expected to have no material impact on the financial position and financial 
performance of the Group.

(2) Fair value hedges

Fair value hedges are used by the Group to protect against changes in fair value 
of financial assets and financial liabilities due to movements in market interest 
rates. The Group mainly used interest rate swaps as hedging instruments to hedge 
the interest risk of financial assets and financial liabilities.

The changes in fair value of the hedging instruments and net gains or losses 
arising from the hedged risk relating to the hedged items are set out below:

(3) Net investment hedges

The Group’s consolidated statement of financial position is affected by exchange 
differences between the functional currency of the Bank and functional currencies 
of its branches and subsidiaries. The Group hedges such exchange exposures 
under certain circumstances. Hedging is undertaken by using customer deposits 
taken in the same currencies as the functional currencies of related branches 
and subsidiaries which are accounted for as hedges of certain net investments in 
foreign operations.

As at 31 December 2022, an accumulated net losses from the hedging instrument 
of RMB675 million was recognised in other comprehensive income (31 
December 2021: accumulated net gains of RMB1,650 million). There was no 
ineffectiveness in profit or loss that arises from the net investment hedges in 
2022 and 2021.

(4) Offsetting of financial instruments

In accordance with the principle of offsetting financial instruments, the Group 
offsets certain derivative financial assets and derivative financial liabilities, and 
presents the net amounts after offsetting in the financial statements.

7.4.14 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

(a) Capital commitments

At the end of the reporting period, the Group had capital commitments as 
follows:

31 December 31 December
2022 2021

Contracted but not provided for 19,427 31,307

(b) Credit commitments

The Group has outstanding commitments to extend credit including approved 
loans and undrawn credit card limits.

The Group provides letters of credit and financial guarantees to guarantee the 
performance of customers to third parties.

Bank acceptances comprise undertakings by the Group to pay bills of exchange 
drawn on customers. The Group expects most acceptances to be settled 
simultaneously with the reimbursement from the customers.

The contractual amounts of credit commitments by category are set out below. 
The amounts disclosed in respect of loan commitments and undrawn credit card 
limits are under the assumption that the amounts will be fully advanced. The 
amounts for bank acceptances, letters of credit and guarantees represent the 
maximum potential losses that would be recognised at the end of the reporting 
period had the counterparties failed to perform as contracted.

129,075 135,796

(d) Legal proceedings and arbitrations

The Group is involved in lawsuits and arbitrations during its normal course of 
operations. As at 31 December 2022, there were a number of legal proceedings 
and arbitrations outstanding against the Bank and/or its subsidiaries with a total 
claimed amount of RMB4,738 million (31 December 2021: RMB6,165 million).

In the opinion of management, the Group has made adequate allowance for any 
probable losses based on the current facts and circumstances, and the ultimate 
outcome of these lawsuits and arbitrations will not have any significant impact 
on the financial position or operations of the Group.

(e) Redemption commitments of government bonds and securities underwriting 
commitments

As an underwriting agent of the MOF, the Bank underwrites certain PRC 
government bonds and sells the bonds to the general public. The Bank is obliged 
to redeem these bonds at the discretion of the holders at any time prior to 
maturity. The redemption price for the bonds is based on the nominal value of 
the bonds plus any interest accrued up to the redemption date. The MOF will not 
provide funding for the early redemption of these PRC government bonds on a 
back-to-back basis but is obliged to repay the principal and the respective interest 
upon maturity. The redemption obligations, which represent the nominal value of 
government bonds underwritten and sold by the Group, but not yet matured as at 
31 December 2022 were RMB62,140 million (31 December 2021: RMB75,553 
million). Management expects that the redemption obligation of these PRC 
government bonds by the Bank prior to maturity will not be material.

As at 31 December 2022, the Group has not had any outstanding securities 
underwriting commitments (31 December 2021: RMB6,350 million).



81

2022 2021

Designated funds 3,420,373 2,783,961

Designated loans 3,420,106 2,783,778

The designated funds represent the funding that the trustors have instructed the 
Group to use to make loans to third parties as designated by them. The credit risk 
remains with the trustors.

The designated loans represent the loans granted to specific borrowers designated 
by the trustors on their behalf according to the entrust agreements signed by the 
Group and the trustors. The Group does not bear any risk.

(g) Fiduciary activities

The Group provides custody, trust and asset management services to third 
parties. Those assets held in a fiduciary capacity are not included in the Group’s 
consolidated statement of financial position.

7.4.15 Segment Information

(a) Operating segments

The Group is organised into different operating segments, namely corporate 
banking, personal banking and treasury operations, based on internal organisation 
structure, management requirements and internal reporting system.

Corporate banking

The corporate banking segment covers the provision of financial products and 
services to corporations, government agencies and financial institutions. The 
products and services include corporate loans, trade financing, deposit-taking 
activities, corporate wealth management services, custody activities and various 
types of corporate intermediary services.



82

Personal banking

The personal banking segment covers the provision of financial products and 
services to individual customers. The products and services include personal 
loans, deposit-taking activities, card business, personal wealth management 
services and various types of personal intermediary services.

Treasury operations

The treasury operations segment covers the Group’s treasury operations which 
include money market transactions, investment securities, foreign exchange 
transactions and the holding of derivative positions for its own accounts or on 
behalf of customers.

Other

This segment covers the Group’s assets, liabilities, income and expenses that 
are not directly attributable or cannot be allocated to a segment on a reasonable 
basis.

Management monitors the operating results of the Group’s business units 
separately for the purpose of making decisions about resources allocation and 
performance assessment. Segment information is prepared in conformity with the 
accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the financial statements 
of the Group.

Transactions between segments mainly represent the provision of funding to 
and from individual segments. The internal transfer pricing of these transactions 
is determined with reference to the market rates and have been reflected in the 
performance of each segment. Net interest income and expense arising on internal 
fund transfer are referred to as “internal net interest income or expense”. Net 
interest income and expense relating to third parties are referred to as “external 
net interest income or expense”.

Segment revenues, expenses, results, assets and liabilities include items directly 
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable 
basis. The basis for allocation is mainly based on occupation of or contribution 
to resources. Income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to 
operating segments.
