MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Sustainability Report  2021-22



From physical and operational risks arising from extreme weather events 

and rising input costs; to transitional and reputational risks stemming from 

new government policies, changing consumer preferences and evolving public 

sentiment - sustainability has multiple ramifications in the business world. 

To address these issues, progressive businesses have been consciously paring 

down their carbon footprint. While this focus on carbon neutrality has shown 

positive effects, sustainability is a multivariate phenomenon and it cannot be 

achieved by simply focusing on energy consumption and emission. 

There is a critical need for humanity to put in a concerted, multi-focal, 

multi-nodal and multi-modal effort to become sustainable in the true sense. 

There is a need to look beyond the carbon tunnel vision that plagues the 

mainstream narrative and see the larger picture that addresses all SDGs. 

There is a need to become

At Mahindra, our Planet Positive journey 
is well-thought-out and punctuated with 
quantified milestones till 2040. Our 
roadmap factors in the risks posed, as 
well as the tremendous opportunities 
presented by sustainability. 

So, while we are greening our operations by cutting emissions, water 

consumption and waste, we are also greening our product portfolio by 

adding more sustainable products and focusing on electric mobility. While 

on-ground, we are cascading sustainability principles and best practices 

deeper across our supply chain, we are also taking the thought-leadership 

role in shaping the wider sustainability narrative by actively participating 

in global forums and forming partnerships. 

We are rejuvenating nature by scaling up our biodiversity initiatives and 

alongside, we are also enabling stakeholders to rise by multiplying 

opportunities through skill-building, girl child education and infrastructure 

support. While we are doing all this, we continue to grow our businesses 

profitably and ensure that the resulting prosperity is divided equitably so 

that we continue to enable our stakeholders and communities to Rise.

This year's cover is inspired by our core operating principle that what gets measured 

gets managed. This systems-based approach is fundamental to all our initiatives, 

including Planet Positive.

MESSAGE FROM
THE CHAIRMAN

Since inception, Mahindra has upheld 

its  philosophy of 'Rise for Good'

doing good for the communities it 

operates in. Determining what is 

right for the environment and our 

communities is not one big decision - 

it is a series of
several small
everyday choices.

Sustainability is an integral part of the Mahindra Group's 

heritage. Our enduring commitment to work with a purpose 

began over 75 years ago, and over the decades, this power of 

purpose has become a driving factor in our culture. In recent 

years, a focus on sustainability and the determination to tackle 

the climate crisis have become significant elements of our 

corporate purpose.

We like to say in the Mahindra Group that our destiny is 

intertwined with that of the nation. India has made bold 

commitments at the COP26 - commitments such as taking the 

share of renewables to 50%, to reduce carbon intensity of the 

economy by more than 45%, and to reduce emissions by

1 billion tonnes by 2030. The national goal is to reach net-zero 

by 2070.

Corporate involvement is crucial in reaching that goal, and we, 

at Mahindra Group, are ready to play our part. Sustainability is 

central to our thinking and strategy. Carbon consciousness is 

already entrenched in all our decisions. We are proactively 

reducing emissions from our existing businesses. We are building 

new green businesses. 

We are maintaining a balance between growing our existing 

portfolio of ICE vehicles and leading the way in the industry's 

transition to EVs. And we are expanding the scope of our 

responsibilities to become Planet Positive.

to adopt an accelerated path to sustainable,
low-carbon operations; 

to o�er a portfolio of green products and 
services in their existing businesses and 

to further streamline their e�orts on waste & 
water management and circular economy.

Going forward, it is becoming increasingly obvious that 

sustainability is the key to business survival. It is essential for 

businesses

To achieve Planet Positivity, we must go beyond carbon and 

ensure that the other sustainability goals like eradicating 

poverty and hunger, enhancing good health and well-being 

and reducing inequalities too, are met.

Since inception, Mahindra has upheld its 'Rise for Good' 

philosophy of doing good for the communities it operates in. 

Determining what is right for the environment and our 

communities is not one big decision - it is a series of several 

small everyday choices. Making tangible change begins with 

us, and the choices we make. While I am proud of how far we 

have come in our efforts to meet ambitious climate targets, 

there's still more work to do for the Mahindra Group to achieve 

our 2040 goal of becoming Planet Positive. We pledge that we 

will rise to both - the challenge and the opportunity, inherent 

in the drive for sustainability.

To give just a few examples, we have:

Ÿ Increased the share of renewables in our energy 

consumption, reduced freshwater consumption and recycled 

waste to increase sustainability in our operations.

Ÿ Continued to invest heavily in electric vehicles, across both 

PV and CV segments, to be able to offer green products to 

our customers and work with industry stakeholders to 

accelerate India's e-mobility transition. 

Ÿ Built a portfolio of solar businesses, - Susten, Solarize, and 

Teqo - to scale renewable energy production, provide 

distributed energy production, and manage solar assets. We 

have also pioneered sustainable automobile recycling in India 

to aid our portfolio transition to green businesses.  

Ÿ Committed to increasing our efforts to achieve net-zero. We 

intend to reduce emissions across our value chain, and are 

further focusing efforts on decarbonising our supply chain.

Ÿ Created meaningful social impact in the lives of communities 

through Project Nanhi Kali - our girl child education 
thprogramme in its 25  year, Project Hariyali - the biodiversity 

thprotection initiative in its 15  year, and many other impactful 

initiatives. 

From F23, SEBI will accelerate the sustainability process by 

requiring new disclosure requirements from public companies. 

Boards will have to provide oversight for these new reporting 

standards. At Mahindra Group, we believe that 'what gets 

measured, gets treasured' and have already instituted robust 

internal measurement processes. We also recognise the need 

for the involvement of the Board in managing climate risk, the 

importance of making commitment and triggering action, and 

lastly, the necessity for judicious capital allocation, all to 

accelerate the path to net-zero.

MESSAGE FROM
MD & CEO

We plan to build a  

'Planet Positive Mahindra'

by focussing on three key aspects:

Across every sphere of human influence and activity, 

'Sustainability' has become more important than ever. 

Businesses, governments, and society at large need to step up 

their action on sustainability. We, at Mahindra, recognise that it 

is in everyone's best interest to play a meaningful role in 

combating climate change and its effects. The current climate 

trajectory will lead to >2.5°C global warming by 2100, resulting 

in countless negative externalities for society. It is critical for 

our planet to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 

Over the years, Mahindra has been leading the way through 

multiple industry-first initiatives in sustainability - first 

company globally to commit to doubling energy productivity in 

2016 | building India's 1st carbon neutral and zero waste to 

landfill factory in Igatpuri in 2018. But stakeholders' 

expectations on sustainability continue to increase across the 

board. Today, we see an increased preference by customers to 

buy from ESG-friendly companies; and for employees, 

especially young leaders, to work at companies doing well on 

ESG. Investors too prefer sustainable companies due to less 

volatility & higher returns.  

We have always believed in fulfilling our responsibility in line 

with our Rise philosophy. We aim to realise our purpose to drive 

positive change in our stakeholders' lives and to build enduring 

businesses while rejuvenating the environment. Businesses 

that lead in all aspects of sustainability are enduring and 

resilient, and will continue to Rise.

At Mahindra, we continue to take actions to advance towards 

carbon-neutrality. We have primarily focussed our efforts on 

reducing emissions and greenhouse gases. However, we now 

need to set a higher bar, think ,'Beyond Carbon, Proactively'

i.e., move from focussing only on 'carbon neutrality' towards 

being  - by focussing on all aspects of 'Planet Positive' 

environmental impact (incl. water, soil, biodiversity, etc.) to 

make a positive impact.

We plan to build a 'Planet Positive Mahindra' by focussing on 

three key aspects:

Greening Ourselves, i.e., ensuring deep 

decarbonisation in our operations through 

energy management, use of renewable energy, 

embedding material circularity, focussing on 

water productivity, and ensuring zero waste to 

landfills at our sites

Decarbonising Our Industry, i.e., enabling our 

supply chain to decarbonise by learning from 

our practices, pushing the industry's transition 

to the use of electric vehicles and other 

alternate fuels, both in commercial and 

passenger vehicle segments, and lastly, 

enabling a circular economy by focussing on 

end-of-life vehicle recycling at scale in an 

environment-friendly manner

Rejuvenating Nature beyond our industry 

boundary - we aim to achieve this by enabling 

'regenerative farming' through our Krish-e 

platform, further strengthening the Mahindra 

Hariyali programme - our flagship biodiversity 

initiative, making strategic investment in 

technologies for the future such as solar, etc., 

and undertaking large-scale integrated 

watershed management projects to benefit the 

communities

Managing Director & CEO, Mahindra & Mahindra Limited
Dr. Anish Shah

Our approach to becoming 'Planet Positive Mahindra' is defined 

by a clear action plan. We will aggressively pursue efforts to 

create business impact while supporting the ecosystem with 

thought leadership and leading the way in effective reporting & 

disclosures. Having a holistic approach to sustainability is not 

new to us. We have spearheaded long-term and high-impact 

programmes pertaining to water resilience, waste 

management, biodiversity rejuvenation as well as social 

campaigns like Project Nanhi Kali and Project Prerna. 

Here is a brief glimpse of how we have risen in F22

Ÿ 55% increase in RE consumption vs. previous year, to reach 

12% cumulative RE share in electricity mix

Ÿ Commissioned 60-MWp captive solar plant, expected to take 

cumulative RE share to >40% in the coming year

Ÿ >80% M&M locations are 'Zero Waste to Landfill', with 71% of 

generated waste recycled this year

Ÿ Continue to be 'water positive', with 44% of water being 

recycled & reused out of total water consumption 

Ÿ 1.32 million trees planted this year, taking cumulative tree 

plantation under Project Hariyali to 20.65 million

Ÿ 1.85 lacs+ girls supported under Project Nanhi Kali this year, 

cumulatively benefitting 5 lacs+ girls since launch

Ÿ 20,000+ women farmers benefitted through Project Prerna

We look forward to your continued support and feedback as 

we endeavour towards becoming 'Planet Positive' in the years 

to come.

HIGHLIGHTS

At Mahindra, we're empowering enterprises across sectors and borders, with tools that will drive them towards growth. Carrying 

that thought forward, some of the highlights of F22 include:

Announcing our presence
on the World Index

During the reporting period, we 

became the first Indian Automobile 

and Components Company to enter 

the World Index list of companies in 

the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 

(DJSI) 2021. We also featured in the 

Emerging Market Index of DJSI for the 

12th time in a row. This inclusion 

reinforces our position as one of the 

global leaders in the ESG domain.

A Great Place to Work -
consistently

The Automotive & Farm Equipment 

Sector was ranked #2 in the list of 

India's Best Companies to Work For 

2021, by Great Place to Work (GPTW). 

As another feather in the cap, we also 

entered the prestigious club of 'The 

Laureates' – organisations that have 

consistently been ranked as a great 

workplace over last 10 years.  

Transforming business
systems for disability
inclusion

The Valuable 500, launched at the 

World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 

at Davos in 2019, is the world's biggest 

CEO collective for disability inclusion. 

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. was one of 

the pioneering businesses to join the 

campaign and is also part of the 

second phase where 13 CEOs will co-

fund, co-build and co-test the 

programmes and solutions, using their 

industry experience to transform the 

business system for disability 

inclusion.

Bullish on
EV technology

We are one of the few domestic 

passenger vehicle companies who are 

gearing up to disrupt the EV segment. 

We plan to invest INR 3,000 crore in 

the segment over the next 2-3 years 

and also looking to leverage 

partnerships in areas like EV 

technology build-up, battery 

management and charging 

infrastructure set-up.

Synergising to strengthen
the EV portfolio

In December 2021, Reliance BP 

Mobility Limited (RBML) operating 

under the brand name Jio-bp and 

Mahindra Group, announced an MoU 

for exploring the creation of EV 

products and services, along with 

identifying synergies in low-carbon 

and conventional fuels. The MoU also 

covers evaluating charging solutions 

by Jio-bp for Mahindra EVs. The EV 

market in India is still at a nascent 

stage and this MoU leverages the 

strengths of both companies in the 

areas of EV products and services.

Leading India's shift
to e-mobility

Treo Zor has been a game changer for 

Mahindra and more importantly for our 

customers who have decided to lead 

India's shift towards e-mobility. In Q3 

of F22, we clocked the highest ever 

quarterly sales of Treo Auto and Treo 

Zor in the EV 3-wheeler segment. In 

just six months of its launch, Mahindra 

Treo Zor became India's number 1 

selling electric cargo and garnered a 

market share of 59% in its category.

Booking
new milestones 

On October 7, 2021 Mahindra XUV7OO 

set an unprecedented milestone in the 

Indian automotive industry when it 

clocked 25,000 bookings within just 

57 minutes of its booking 

commencement. This constitutes up to 

six months of production depending on 

the variant at the committed launch 

prices. It also makes the XUV7OO the 

first four-wheeler in India to hit this 

milestone.

HIGHLIGHTS

Tackling air
pollution together

Mahindra Group joined WEF's 

initiative 'Alliance for Clean Air' as 

one of the founding members. It is 

the first global corporate initiative to 

bring together leading businesses to 

tackle air pollution.

First movers in
unleashing innovation

Mahindra Group joined WEF's initiative 

'First Movers Coalition' as one of the 

founding members. The coalition 

companies are leveraging their 

collective buying power to leverage the 

market conditions required to unleash 

innovation which will reduce the 

amount of carbon emitted in certain 

particularly pollutant industries.

SUVs of tomorrow get
an all-new visual identity

The 'Twin Peaks' logo for Mahindra's 

Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) was 

unveiled in August 2021 as part of a 

new brand identity meant to reflect the 

portfolio's transformation - the 'SUVs 

of tomorrow'. The new symbol captures 

where the brand comes from and 

where it wants to go, encapsulating a 

journey that began 75 years ago. The 

all-new visual identity is in tune with 

the company's focus to be makers of 

sophisticated and authentic SUVs.

Redefining
endurance standards

The XUV7OO has been designed to 

redefine benchmarks - not just in 

terms of performance and features, 

but also endurance standards. This 

claim was proved true when the 

vehicle set a series of new Indian 

national records at the 24 hours 

Speed Endurance Challenge held at 

the Mahindra SUV Proving Track 

(MSPT) near Chennai. Four XUV7OOs 

entered the challenge and all four 

recorded over 4000 km at an average 

speed range of 170-180 km/h.

Ushering in an age
of solar power

We are committed to achieving our 

target of carbon neutrality by 2040 

and are well on the way to reduce 

carbon emissions across our 

manufacturing operations. Towards 

this endeavour, we have adopted a 60 

MWp captive solar plant located at 

Parbhani in the Marthwada region of 

Maharashtra. Expected to generate 

100 million units of power, this plant 

will also help us to achieve our 

science-based targets by mitigating 

79,000 tons of annual carbon 

emission - equivalent to nurturing 3.7 

million trees a year.

Since we introduced India's first utility vehicle over 75 years 

ago, our endeavour has been to make journeys smoother. 

Two decades back, we redefined how urban India experienced 

the SUV with Scorpio and since then we have strengthened 

our SUV portfolio with a number of blockbuster vehicles. 

We were one of the pioneers of EV mobility in India and 

today we are gearing up to drive sustainable mobility in 

India. Additionally, our pickups, light commercial vehicles, 

trucks and buses are transporting goods while being good to 

the environment. Today, we are preferred for delivering on 

durability, reliability, environment friendliness and fuel 

efficiency.

AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR FARM E�UIPMENT SECTOR

Our foray into India's agriculture sector coincided with the 

Green Revolution of 1960s. Since then, 'driving rural 

prosperity' has been one of our defining goals. Today, we are 

the world's number one tractor company (by volume) with 

current annual sales of over 354,000 units.

Our farm equipment and support services empower farmers 

everywhere through end-to-end mechanisation solutions, 

agri-inputs, advisory and post-harvest services, among 

other things.



CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE 

Corporate governance is the foundation on which Mahindra has been delivering innovation 

and driving sustainable growth. 

Our governance

philosophy stems from

our resolute commitment to

Robust governance along with world-class products and unparalleled service has 

enabled us to earn the trust of our stakeholders. It has also helped us attract and 

retain financial and human capital, and maintain social & relationship capital. 

We have institutionalised the highest benchmarks of corporate working and 

behaviours in our processes. We have been reporting back to our shareholders on 

corporate governance, long before the law made it mandatory. 

Mahindra places great emphasis on empowerment, integrity and safety of 

employees, maintaining a diverse and vibrant work environment, and upholding 

transparency in all dealings. Towards this, we have clearly defined principles, 

policies, procedures, responsibilities and accountabilities.

We have articulated our corporate governance policies and established structures 

like the Corporate Governance Council to ensure that all governance issues are 

effectively and transparently addressed. 

Our governance efforts have paid off sustainably, not just in financial value,

but also in delivering on intangibles such as increased reputation and goodwill. 

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. has also been proactively complying with regulatory 

requirements. Out of 12 members on Mahindra & Mahindra Limited's Board,

seven are Independent Directors (including three Women Directors), which is 

approximately 58% of the total strength of the Board. The Audit Committee of 

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. was constituted in 1987, which was 17 years before 

regulations made it mandatory. We have been spending 1% of our net profits on

CSR since 1995, much before the Companies Act 2013 made it mandatory. Post the 

act, we adhere to the requirement of spending 2% of the average net profit for the 

past three financial years. 

Mahindra follows UNESCO's definition
of Governance - it refers to the 
structures and processes that ensure 
accountability, transparency, 
responsiveness, rule of law, stability, 
equity and inclusiveness, empowerment 
and broad-based participation.

ECONOMIC
PERFORMANCE

While the last two financial years were about resilience, recovery, and making commitments, 

F22 was more about focussing on the future, walking the talk, putting learnings into practice, 

and translating commitments into actions. In F22, Mahindra continued to take actions on 

ESG, maintain financial discipline, accelerate core growth, and enhance customer experience. 

In a nutshell, we reignited value creation. 

Leadership in Auto and Farm sectors 

was one of the key commitments we 

made last year. In Automotive, we had 

four blockbuster launches with 1.78 lac 

open bookings. We are now a market 

leader in SUVs in revenue market 

share. In electric three-wheelers, we 

have a 73% market share, and in LCV 

<3.5 tonnes, we continue to be a 

market leader with a 43% market 

share. On the farm side, our share is 

We have shown a 26% 
growth in profits for F22 
compared to F21 driven by 
the Auto & Farm business, 
and the performance of 
our growth gems. Our PAT 
after Exceptional Items 
has seen a 5x increase, 
which is really a function 
of the capital allocation 
actions. 

In F22, the auto industry has showed 

partial recovery due to impact of the 

pandemic, shortage of semi-

conductors, and increase of vehicle 

prices due to inflationary pressure on 

commodities. 

This year, the industry witnessed 

growth in UV-styled vehicles and a 

shift from compact cars to compact 

UVs. In the last two years (F20 - F22), 

there were 16 new launches in the UV 

segment, and these accounted for 11% 

of UV volume in F22. 

The key growth drivers were:

Increasing affordability

Growing demand for farm 
mechanisation

Emergence of newer technologies 
in the farming sector

Increasing Government spend in 
rural sector, and 

Continued focus of the 
Government on improving the 
state of agriculture in India

THE YEAR
UNDER REVIEW

over 40% with 180 basis point gain 

and product launches. Another 

commitment we made was about 

international subsidiaries. Those are 

on their path to an 18% ROE while 

delivering good financial results. 

We are moving beyond carbon 

neutrality to be a more sustainable 

company. Apart from reducing scope 1 

& 2 emissions, increasing energy 

productivity and growing the share of 

renewable energy, we have also taken 

up societal and governance 

interventions. From being a local 

leader, we are in the process of 

becoming a global leader in ESG. 

But we are aware that individual 

actions alone will not meet our goals of 

reducing or pulling back to 1.5° Celsius. 

We are taking collective actions, 

playing a role on the Indian and the 

global stage to work closely with other 

companies and governments to really 

make a meaningful difference in 

sustainability.

3-wheelers; the key drivers being 

improving operating economies, easy 

deployment for last/first mile 

connectivity (including at metro 

stations) and the growth of start-ups 

as 3-w aggregators.

Agriculture sector stood strong with 

multiple factors favouring rural 

sentiments. The long-term growth 

outlook for the Indian tractor industry 

remains positive.

Our allied businesses continued to 

grow in the reporting period.

BEYOND FINANCIALS – ELECTRIC MOBILITY 

Mahindra is the pioneer of Electric 

Vehicles and its technology in India. 

We will be revealing three new EV 

concepts this year in Oxfordshire, UK, 

on 15th August. Christened 'Mahindra 

Advanced Design Europe', or MADE, 

this new studio has been instrumental 

in designing these forthcoming 

concept electric vehicles. From being 

inducted in the French Presidential 

fleet with Peugeot electric two-

wheelers to opening a new customer 

base of women entrepreneurs with 

Mahindra Treo, and to Formula E races, 

R&D 

Research & Development helps us to find opportunities beyond just carbon 

neutrality. We have been investing in R&D heavily to create mobility that reduces 

negative impact on the environment and sustainable farming solutions that 

increases farmers' productivity. Mahindra has R&D facilities across the world. 

Through this global network of innovation, we focus on disrupting existing norms to 

give rise to newer business models with 'FUTUrise' - where we are not only equipped 

for the present, but also ready for the future. 

Mahindra Research Valley (MRV) serves as a crucible of innovation and technology 

for the Auto and Farm Divisions of the Company. Automobili Pininfarina has 

innovative and pioneering technology for luxury electric hypercar, and Mahindra 

Advanced Design Studio, UK, is designing the future range of Born Electric vehicles 

with a team of global designers and experts. Sampo Rosenlew has become a global 

name for light weight Combine Harvesters and it continues to Rise with Mahindra 

acquiring a 35% equity stake in the company.

Mahindra offers a range of unique EV 

capabilities to its customers and 

partners.

In F22, we sold 17,006 EVs (59 four-

wheelers and 16,947 three-wheelers) 

as against 5,418 EVs (10 four-wheelers 

and 5,408 three-wheelers) in the 

previous year. Mahindra is the first 

Indian manufacturer to surpass more 

than 400 million electric kilometres 

through a fleet of Treo, e-Veritos and 

E2O Plus vehicles. 

The company has also partnered with 

major e-commerce players such as 

Flipkart and Amazon, fleet logistics 

firms such as Mahindra Logistics, 

Terrago Logistics and Magneta for 

expansion of their carbon-free fleet 

delivery vehicles. Mahindra has a wide 

range of offerings including diesel and 

CNG 3-wheelers with the latest 

addition to Alfa range, Alfa CNG - both

LOCAL SUPPLY

The second wave of COVID-19 hit India 

in Q1 F22 disrupting business because 

of its intensity.  

The global supply chains were 

affected, impacting logistics cost and 

lead time due to port congestions and 

container unavailability. The 

Automotive industry also got badly 

affected due to semi-conductor 

unavailability. 

Mahindra lost significant volumes in 

the 1st two quarters of F22 due to this. 

In the last quarter, another challenge 

emanated in the form of the Russia-

Ukraine conflict, which led to soaring 

commodity prices and impact on 

availability of material. Mahindra took 

aggressive steps to de-risk the supply 

chain to meet the business demand. 

The Company comprehensively 

brought down costs and conserved 

cash, yielding good results in F22 and 

is expected to deliver benefits in the 

future.  

Mahindra continues to focus on buying 

from local suppliers, geographically 

Ÿ Capability, performance and on-

Ÿ Compliance on environment, health 

& safety guidelines

Ÿ Readiness to participate in

Local supply not only 
vitalises the local industry 
and provides jobs to the 
local community, but also 
reduces our carbon footprint. 
It reinforces our commitment 
to Make in India as well.

An analysis of the top 10 suppliers 

as per monetary value for each 

business shows that on an 

aggregate basis, 100% of our 

requirement was sourced locally.

nearest to our manufacturing facility. 

Almost the entire sourcing work is 

done from the country with a very 

small percentage of input being 

procured from overseas. In F22, many 

of our suppliers faced challenges due 

to labour unavailability, limited working 

hours, and adherence to COVID-19 

safety norms. We are working closely 

with our key suppliers to minimise any 

supply constraints through capacity 

planning and longer-term contracts.

FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

The financial implications of climate 

crisis are massive, and it is imperative 

that we take into account the health of 

our planet and our society to work out 

solutions that create a more 

sustainable future.

With manufacturing and agricultural 

sectors making up the bulk of our 

operations, we are highly vulnerable to 

climate change and unpredictable 

weather. Such dependence on 

monsoon, rising energy costs, 

restricted access to raw materials like 

water and changing consumer 

preferences, etc., pose serious threats 

to the sustainability of our business.

Going beyond carbon turns these 

challenges into opportunities. Our 

journey in sustainability started with 

energy saving initiatives and emission 

reducing processes. Today, it has 

evolved from 'conservation' to 

'rejuvenation' leading to investing in 

clean and renewable energy, and 

recharging of resources. When it comes 

to climate change, we believe in taking 

the lead to raise the bar from Carbon 

Pricing to Science Based Targets.

Carbon Neutral by 2040

Mahindra has taken multiple initiatives to achieve the target. Right from bringing in 

energy efficiency and productivity, adopting renewable energy, planting more trees, 

and committing to SBTi.

Some of the key initiatives taken towards being carbon neutral by 2040:

The following are some of the ways in which we kept emphasis on 

addressing climate change:

Ÿ Carbon Offsets

through tree plantation

Planting trees is a great way to 

build natural carbon sinks and 

reduce air pollution. Mahindra has 

been planting trees every year to 

increase the green cover

Ÿ Science Based

Targets initiative (SBTi)

SBTi champions science-based 

target setting as a powerful way of 

boosting competitive advantage of 

companies during the transition to 

the low-carbon economy. Mahindra 

has committed to SBTi to support 

innovation, reduce regulatory 

uncertainty, strengthen investor 

confidence and credibility, and 

improve profitability. 

Ÿ Energy Productivity

The work we are doing on carbon 

neutrality is not only helping us to 

respond to the climate change 

challenge, but also results in 

improved efficiency, innovation and 

more importantly delivers on the 

business case for sustainability. 

Mahindra & Mahindra was the first 

company in the world to commit to 

doubling its energy productivity by 

2030, signing on to The Climate 

Group's EP100 programme

For more information related to Energy 
Productivity or SBTi, please refer to 
Greenifying Our Operations section of 
this report.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Ÿ To conserve energy, we replaced 

high energy consuming 

conventional blower with energy-

efficient EC (electronically 

computed) blowers in Air Handling 

Unit applications

Ÿ Changed 200 old air circulators 

with Brushless Direct Current Motor 

(BDCM) air circulators that consume 

35-40% less energy compared to 

conventional air circulators

Ÿ Installed demand side controller for 

air compressors in the smart device 

which precisely maintains the 

compressed air pressure and 

eliminates losses while delivering 

the higher compressed air pressure 

to the user area

Ÿ Adopting Renewables

Mahindra is committed to achieve 

carbon neutrality target by 2040 

and is on the way to reduce carbon 

emissions across manufacturing 

operations. To accelerate the 

journey, Mahindra is increasing the 

share of renewable energy to the 

mix. Mahindra has adopted a 58-

MWp captive solar plant which is 

expected to generate about 100 

million units of power annually 

beginning 2022

Carbon Pricing 

At Mahindra, we implemented internal 

carbon price to bring us closer to 

achieving our climate action targets. 

The carbon price enables informed 

decision-making by management on 

investments in technologies that help 

reduce emissions and aligns the 

company's operations to a low carbon 

economy. Our internal carbon pricing 

of $10/tCO2. We plan to observe the 

progress, trends, and developments in 

the space and business for another 3-

4 years and accordingly decide, if 

there is a need/possibility to modify 

our carbon price.

Actual investments 
made by Mahindra using 
carbon pricing since 
2017 is USD 5.88 million.

INTERNAL CARBON
PRICING ADVANTAGES

Ÿ Funded projects on energy 

efficiency, renewable energy and 

water productivity 

Ÿ Enabled us to contribute to national 

and global climate goals

Ÿ Helped reduce our emissions and 

operating costs

Ÿ Reallocated resources to low carbon 

endeavours

Ÿ Created markets for low carbon 

products and services, increasing 

green revenue opportunities

Ÿ Paved the way for innovation

Sustainable Financing

An organisation's ability to raise resources to fund its activities, based not only on 

financial criteria, but also on environmental, social and corporate governance 

related dimensions is considered Sustainable Finance. More and more businesses 

are in the process of raising sustainable finance to fund their activities today. 

Mahindra believes that linking business to a larger purpose of caring for people and 

the planet to positively impact their lives is the magic mantra for business success. 

Mahindra has always put ESG aspects before business. Mahindra Group Chairman 

put it succinctly that people plus planet equals profits. 

Mahindra has been a pioneer in investing and scaling planet-friendly practices like 

energy efficiency, clean energy, water efficiency, zero waste to landfill and 

afforestation; investing in climate-friendly businesses like electric vehicles, shared 

mobility, green buildings, automobile recycling, micro-irrigation, waste to energy 

and sustainable cities; driving social development programmes like girl child 

education, integrated watershed management and community health interventions. 

World Economic Forum,
COP26

COP (Conference of the Parties) is a 

pivotal moment in the fight against 

climate change. In 2021, United 

Nations climate change conference 

COP26 took place in Glasgow where 

world leaders alongside tens of 

thousands of negotiators, government 

representatives, businesses and 

citizens participated in Scotland.

At COP26, the Mahindra Group 

became the founding member of the 

Alliance for Clean Air, a corporate 

movement for clean air to accelerate 

climate action and create healthy 

communities around the world. 

Mahindra also committed to 

commercialise decarbonisation 

technologies by becoming a member 

of the 'First Movers Coalition' along 

with companies like Apple and 

Amazon.

INTRODUCTION By minimising our impact on the planet and contributing to its well-being through sustained 

efforts, we want to create an environment where our stakeholders Rise and become resilient. 

We have been taking strong and substantial steps towards being Planet Positive through 

interventions in decarbonisation, waste management, water security, and ensuring overall 

sustainability across our business.

We understand that environmental and social impacts are interlinked and have a 

cascading effect on stakeholders and the planet. Therefore, our sustainability 

actions simultaneously encompass a range of critical concerns from water 

rejuvenation, biodiversity preservation and rural prosperity, to community 

well-being, gender equality and livelihood opportunities.

These include a programme on 

watershed management and 

regenerative agriculture - a system 

meant to restore soil and ecosystem 

health. 

We are also educating the girl child 

through Nanhi Kali and empowering 

women by providing them livelihoods.

Through the Hariyali project, we are 

planting trees to improve the health of 

the environment.

As a leader in the Automotive & Farm 

industry, we see an incredible 

opportunity in creating a sustainable 

business that positively impacts our 

customers, employees, communities, 

and the planet on a large scale.

cascaded across the length and breadth of our organisation, we also have a Sustainability Policy that guides operational activity 

to create widespread change effectively.

MATERIALITY

Materiality is a compass that provides 

direction to our sustainability journey 

and also helps us to prioritise our 

itinerary. Every three years, we 

consistently evaluate our material 

issues to introspect our sustainability 

matters as well as shape future course 

of action across the triple bottom line. 

We have continually enhanced the 

breadth and depth of our analysis to 

sharpen our materiality identification 

process.

Process

It is a collaborative exercise involving 

all our stakeholders. Determining the 

material issues is a step-by-step 

approach, with a detailed stakeholder 

engagement exercise and a 

comprehensive materiality analysis, 

and finally dovetailing the insights to 

upgrade the roadmap.

The process begins with the 

identification of material topics. These 

material topics are screened, grouped 

into categories or themes, and 

prioritised. Relevant stakeholders are 

then identified, grouped into 

categories and prioritised based on 

criteria. Engagement strategies [mode, 

frequency, etc.] are developed 

according to the stakeholder mapped 

categories. The  questionnaire is 

designed to ask pertinent queries and 

record feedback.

Each material topic is assessed based 

on impact, and the materiality 

threshold is determined. Material 

topics are then prioritised as per the 

score for disclosure using defined 

criteria.

The engagement mechanisms included 

one-on-one interactions, telephonic 

conversations, online surveys, visits 

and email exchanges with various 

stakeholders.

Our methodology included capability 

building workshops and a feedback 

session with Group Sustainability. After 

benchmarking our issues with our 

peers, we prepared and prioritised the 

updated materiality issues for 

validation. 

Next, we conducted one-to-one 

engagement with our top management 

for validation and review. This led to 

the development of the Final Material 

Assessment Matrix, based on which 

the Strategic Roadmap for the 

company was prepared with relevant 

functions. 

We revalidated our material 

issues in F22 by engaging 

with senior management, 

employees, suppliers, 

dealers, customers / 

drivers, community, 

academicians, government, 

regulatory authorities, 

industry associations and 

investors. 

At M&M Ltd.,

our key materiality issues are

The chapters ahead will elaborate 

more on activities undertaken by us on 

these issues. 

The sensitivity of an issue to the 

stakeholders and to the Company, in 

terms of importance, forms the basis 

of the materiality analysis, which in 

turn guides the processes for 

identifying, devising and managing 

specific action plans for addressing 

these material aspects.

OUR OPERATIONS

OUR IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENT 

The automotive industry's 

environmental footprint on the planet 

ranges from manufacturing to the use 

phase and even after the end-of-life 

of a vehicle. In manufacturing, apart 

from the use of energy and water, raw 

materials such as steel, plastic, rubber 

and paint add to the footprint. In use 

phase, petroleum derivatives drive up 

the GHG emissions. The end-of-life 

phase of a vehicle doesn't mean the 

end of environmental impact. The 

plastic, battery acids, and other 

materials continue to impact nature. 

Being one of the largest 

car and tractor 

manufacturers in the 

world, we are aware of the 

impact we have on the 

environment. Therefore, 

we are taking planet 

positive initiatives to 

mitigate the risks.

Mahindra's environmental 

sustainability strategy is aligned with 

the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting 

global warming to 1.5° Celsius, 

compared to pre-industrial levels. To 

contribute on this ambitious target, 

Mahindra has committed to being a 

carbon neutral company by 2040 

through Science Based Target 

Initiatives (SBTi). Mahindra is a leader 

in the ESG space in India and is well-

poised to become a global leader. 

Mahindra joined the 'First Movers 

Coalition' to work towards driving 

demand for zero-carbon technologies 

at the World Economic Forum, along 

with global giants such as Amazon and 

Apple. We are the only one named to 

the leadership band for corporate 

sustainability by the global 

environmental non-profit CDP.

We are the first 
company in the world 
to announce doubling 
of energy productivity; 
the first Indian 
company to announce 
internal carbon price 
of USD 10 per ton of 
carbon emitted; and in 
2019, we also got the 
SBTi targets approved.

We have not only made commitments, 

but have progressed through actions 

for greening our operations. In our ESG 

journey, we have achieved 

considerably, but a lot still needs to be 

done. To accelerate the process, we 

are taking collective actions and 

working closely with partners to make 

a meaningful difference. 

M&M has become the first 
Indian 'Automobile and 
Components' company to 
enter the World Index of 
DJSI.

ENVIRONMENTAL
POLICIES AND
MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS

Mahindra has policies and 

management systems in place to 

manage climate related risks. 

Managing risks is integrated into our 

overall Risk Management framework 

that works at various levels across the 

enterprise with a robust organisational 

structure for managing and reporting 

on risks. 

The policy includes identification of 

risks, including Climate Change and 

related risks, and also those which 

may threaten our existence. The risk 

management process has been 

established across the company and is 

designed to identify, assess and frame 

a response to threats that affect the 

achievement of objectives.

KEY ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALITY TOPICS

Mahindra engages with internal and external stakeholders to identify key 

environmental topics that concern our stakeholders and businesses the most. These 

are then benchmarked against peers and the final materiality matrix emerges after 

mapping, prioritising, preparing and validating the topics. Apart from reporting 

sustainability, we use materiality topics as a strategic business tool to identify and 

manage risks, opportunities and megatrends. Following materiality topics were 

found to be of importance for all stakeholders during assessment:

These core topics were given due importance while formulating the sustainability 

strategy. We are committed and took initiatives pertaining to each topic mentioned 

in their respective section.

MANAGEMENT
APPROACH

Mahindra has a thorough 

understanding of climate 

change and focusses on 

long-term initiatives that 

have a positive effect on 

environment. We are 

committed to achieving 

carbon neutrality target by 

2040 and are well on the 

way to reduce carbon 

emissions across 

manufacturing operations.

We follow a comprehensive approach 

for carbon emissions mitigation and 

removal. It includes focussing on and 

investing in low carbon energy, 

automobile recycling, waste to energy 

and electric mobility.  We continuously 

measure, control and mitigate 

emissions to reduce our carbon 

footprint and the risks associated with 

it. For removal of carbon from the 

environment, we continue to plant 

trees through our tree plantation drive 

- Project Hariyali.

CARBON REDUCTION INITIATIVES

Measures Taken to Reduce
Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions

ACCELERATING ENERGY TRANSITION
TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY  

It is essential for us to shift from fossil-fuel based energy systems to renewable 

energy to achieve carbon neutrality targets. Apart from reaching our targets, the 

initiatives will contribute to India's solar power target of achieving 175 GW by 2022. 

In the reporting year, we took two initiatives to reach our goals, harness the power 

of renewable and carbon-neutral resources to be energy secure, and reduce the 

cost associated with fossil-based energy.

Measures Taken to Reduce
Scope 3 GHG Emissions

Mahindra has been exporting products 

to several countries and focusses on 

mitigating the emissions due to 

transportation by three methods: Load 

Consolidation, Route Optimisation, and 

Alternate Mode.

LOAD CONSOLIDATION

By vehicle optimisation (changing the 

vehicle or making modifications), more 

load per truck can be carried, reducing 

the number of vehicles for the same 

load, and corresponding decrease in 

emissions.

ROUTE OPTIMISATION

Route optimisation is achieved by 

various methods, including vendor 

localisation, direct dispatches to the 

dealer from the plant, creating a cross 

dock, etc. This reduces the amount of 

fuel burnt, and corresponding 

decrease in emissions. 

ALTERNATE MODE

Alternate modes of transport, like a 

train instead of a truck to carry 

tractors or cars, considerably reduce 

the amount of emissions.

M&M adopted a 60 MWp captive solar plant located in 
Parbhani in the Marathwada region. The solar plant will be 
built, owned, and operated for 25 years by ReNew 
Sunlight Energy Pvt. Ltd., which is a 100% subsidiary of 
ReNew Power Pvt. Ltd.

POTENTIAL OUTCOMES

This project is set to result in significant progress towards the achievement of 

carbon neutrality and SBTs by mitigating 79,000 tons of carbon emissions per year, 

equivalent to nurturing 3.7 million trees every year or the provision of a year's 

supply of power to about 20,650 Indian households.

CASE STUDY

Innovative Solution for
a Complex Problem | M&M Chakan

M&M Chakan is one of the largest plants in M&M comprising a 40-km compressed air pipeline feeding press, paint, 

and aggregate shops. Owing to the complex network, we faced air leakages.

Due to air leakages in shops, we 

were required to run a 315-kW 

capacity compressor instead of a 

160-KW capacity in 3rd shift. To 

avoid this additional compressor 

operation in 3rd shift, we used to 

send an operator to close the 

shop valves at the start of 3rd 

shift and open them again at the 

beginning of 1st shift. This used 

to take a lot of time (3-4 hours). 

Till that duration, an additional 

compressor was kept 'on' which 

consumed higher energy. 

We installed a motorised valve at 

the shops' incoming receiver to 

start and stop the main valve 

remotely, simultaneously, and 

instantaneously to reduce activity 

duration. We also installed valves 

as modulators and a timer mode 

instead of manual operation. 

The entire integration work was 

done in-house by the team, as 

external visitors were not allowed 

due to COVID restrictions. The 

knowledge of replicating this for 

the other plants remains with the 

team. 

This project will save 700 tons 

of CO  annually. Between 2

September 2020 and March 

2021, the project already 

resulted in a cost saving of 

INR 3.1 million, taking potential 

annualised savings to around 

INR 7.0 million.

CASE STUDY

Defining Novel Trail
in Energy Saving

New welding class innovated 

that is energy efficient and 

superior in weld integrity, and 

won the Most Impactful 

Sustainability Project Award 

2021 at Mahindra.

The spot-welding operation falls in variable load in energy consumption and 

since it is standard, no one looks at it as an opportunity. At Scorpio body 

shop PU, Nashik Plant, our aim was to take the leap and challenge this 

domain, as it has got 67% share in total energy consumption, without 

affecting the weld quality. Inspired by the Rise philosophy, we wanted to 

create something unique which should establish a benchmark.

Challenge 

Worldwide there are only three welding class types in resistance spot 

welding. We challenged the standard and established the exact correlation 

between weld cycle, current and energy consumption. We innovated the 

fourth weld standard class (prior three welding class that exist - A class / B 

class / C class). This new type combines A class and C class weld implying 

new theory of getting more heat generated in spot welding with lower force 

and reduced weld cycles. Our innovation has given a breakthrough solution 

for energy reduction in spot welding process (in coated as well as non-

coated sheet) which was never thought before.

The implemented solution is applicable to all spot-welding processes in all 

industries, but this is not identified for power cost reduction aspect by any 

industry. We are the first one in Nashik plant who thought about it and 

implemented it successfully.

Action

AIR �UALITY

Air quality is the most serious 

environmental risk affecting the 

health of humans and business. Poor 

quality of air leads to respiratory and 

cardiovascular diseases. On the 

business front, it impacts crop yields 

and ecosystems affecting economic 

growth. Mahindra recognises the 

importance of both - health of the 

people and the environment. 

We adhere to all the statutory norms 

and regulations, in the state and the 

countries we are present in. We also 

meticulously monitor systems to keep 

track of various pollutants that 

contaminate the air.  In accordance 

with the revised National Ambient Air 

Quality Standards (NAAQS 2009), 

PM10 (size less than 10 μm), PM2.5 

(size less than 2.5 μm), Sulphur 

Oxides (SOx) and Nitrogen Oxides 

(NOx) are regularly monitored across 

our manufacturing and service 

locations. 

Some manufacturing plants also 

monitor more specific pollutants 

applicable to their processes, like 

Respirable Suspended Particulate 

Matter (RSPM), Carbon Monoxide 

(CO), Methane (CH4), Ozone (O) and 

Lead (Pb), among others.

Ozone Depleting
Substances (ODS)

The ozone layer is like an invisible 

natural shield that protects earth from 

sun's ultraviolet rays. When 

consumption of chemicals rise, ODS 

such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 

halons, hydro chlorofluorocarbons 

(HCFCs), etc., deplete this natural 

shield. We continuously monitor and 

improve our processes to reduce our 

consumption of resources and emission 

of ODS, to keep the shield intact.

BIODIVERSITY

Mahindra is committed to conserving 

and rejuvenating biodiversity. 

Mahindra Hariyali, our initiative 

designed to improve India's green 

cover and protect the country's 

biodiversity, was launched in 2007. 

The project has now revised its target 

to plant 5 million trees annually 

instead of earlier 1 million trees.  So 

far, 20 million trees have been planted 

under the project. Besides addressing 

the climate change risks, it also 

supports livelihood opportunities and 

encourages better socio-economic 

benefits.

Globally, Project Hariyali has 

contributed to climate change 

resilience. The project has aided in the 

sequestration of more than 390,000 

tonnes of carbon since its inception. 

The project's work at Araku, registered 

with the Ministry of Environment, 

Government of India, qualifies as a 

carbon sequestration project 

compliant with UNFCCC's Kyoto 

Protocol guidelines. Under a 

memorandum of understanding signed 

between Mahindra and Nandi, its 

implementation partner, Paris-based 

Global Livelihoods Fund - a Carbon 

Offset Fund led by Danone, has used 

carbon credits from Phase 1 of Project 

Hariyali in the European ETS 

programme.

In F22,
Mahindra Group
planted 1.57 million
trees across India.

None of our operations are adjacent 

to protected areas and close to key 

biodiversity areas.

Renewable
Energy Adoption

Growing the share of RE in the total 

electricity consumption of M&M 

ensures environment custodianship as 

well as sustainable growth. 

M&M's renewable electricity 

consumption stood at 12% in F22.

Ÿ Solar power capacity at Nashik 

Plant 2 stood at 42 kWp and is now 

utilising 40% of the total energy 

consumption from renewable energy

Ÿ Mahindra Group's first wind turbine 

with 4.2 MW capacity installed, 

which saved 80 lac units leading to 

approximate financial savings of

INR 56.7 million

55% increase in utilization 
of total renewable
electricity compared to F21.

Enhancing
Energy Productivity 

Mahindra recognises that we cannot 

manage what we can't measure. 

Therefore, we continue to monitor 

Energy Productivity (EP) and coming 

up with energy efficiency initiatives. 

We record Energy Productivity data 

separately for AS (Auto Sector) as well 

as FES (Farm Equipment Sector).

WATER
SECURITY

The Mahindra Group's goal 

is to be water positive, i.e., 

harness more water than we 

consume. M&M is aligned 

with the goal. We are 

enhancing water 

productivity by reducing 

the intake of fresh water 

and reusing, plus recycling 

to ensure water security at 

each of our locations. At 

Mahindra, we have been 

contributing our bit to 

water security for our 

community and business. 

Following are some of the key water security initiatives taken in the

reporting period at our divisions.

MANAGEMENT
APPROACH

Mahindra follows a comprehensive 

approach that looks at multiple facets 

of conservation and rejuvenation of 

water including water management 

and reporting practices, identifying 

and eliminating water leaks, adoption 

of new technologies that reduce water 

use, building rainwater harvesting 

structures, and adopting ponds for 

water storage. All these initiatives are 

in line with the Group's commitment to 

become water positive.

INITIATIVES - SAVING THE PRECIOUS RESOURCE 

AS NASHIK PLANT 1

RAINWATER HARVESTING

Harvested 154,550 Kl of rainwater to 

become a certified water positive plant

WASTE WATER
TREATMENT AND REUSE

Achieved 100 days without raw water 

in paint shop through 100% use of 

treated water

WATER REUSE

Installation of water aerator in place of 

conventional taps, water cascading 

through reuse of water and no usage 

during idle cycle

WATER CONSERVATION

Ÿ Waterless urinals

Ÿ Four water recharge pits

Ÿ Measuring daily water balance

SWARAJ DIVISION

WASTE WATER TREATMENT

Swaraj Foundry Division uses 

groundwater for day to day operations. 

For water management, we have 

individual meters at individual bore 

wells monitoring the water consumption 

on daily basis. We have a STP-cum-ETP 

with a capacity of 55 Kl/day for the 

treatment of our wastewater and the 

treated water from it is being used for 

gardening purposes.

GROUNDWATER RECHARGE

As per Dynamic Ground Water 

Resource India data, Swaraj Division 

Foundry falls under Non-notified area - 

Safe Category. Hence, the total 

groundwater recharging requirement is 

50% of 75,000 cubic metres. That 

comes to 37,500 cubic metres per 

year. In order to achieve that, we 

constructed 3 rainwater harvesting 

pits with a capacity of 7,024 cubic 

meters per year.

POND ADOPTION

Adding to harvesting pits, we have 

adopted a pond in the local area with a 

recharging capacity of 33,795 cubic 

metres per year. A storm water 

collection tank of 320 Kl capacity has 

already been constructed at the site. 

We have constructed this tank for 

storage of the storm water from areas

other than the rooftop. The stored storm

water shall be kept for firefighting, 

irrigating green areas, and other such 

purposes, instead of using fresh water.

OTHER INITIATIVES

Ÿ Installation of R.O. water plant at 

ETP outlet

Ÿ Replacement of water-cooled 

compressor with air-cooled 

compressor

Ÿ Installation of: 

Ÿ Piezometer

OTHER KEY WATER
CONSERVATION INITIATIVES 

RO FOR STP 

At Auto division, Kandivali plant, a new 

containerised reverse osmosis plant is 

installed which treats the STP treated 

water and converts waste water to 

potable quality water. The permeate 

water is being recycled for processes 

and cooling tower make-up water.  

RAINWATER REUSE 

At Chakan plant, infrastructure is 

created wherein softener and filtration 

system is installed to reuse the 

harvested rainwater in paint shop 

processes.

Sector

No water source was 
significantly affected by 
M&M operations.

M&M has worked on various water 

conservation and water efficiency 

improving strategies which has helped 

in reducing the municipal and fresh 

ground water consumption in F22.

We have a target of reducing 3% net 

fresh water consumption year-on-year 

for the next 3 years. This is in line with 

our water security goal from our 

sustainability roadmap.

The total net fresh water 
consumption was well below 
the target for this year.

DISCHARGED WATER �UALITY

At Mahindra, waste water is not seen as a waste but as a potential opportunity. This 

perspective helps us to consider waste water as a resource which can be recycled 

and treated suitably within the organisation for operational purposes such as 

heating and cooling, and non-operational purposes such as gardening, to replace 

groundwater use. 

Mahindra has implemented safe waste water management practices to protect the 

ecosystem. Some of our key initiatives are in the area of treating effluents before 

releasing them into natural water bodies, continuous monitoring of waste water 

discharge to ensure that it is free from pollutants, and adhering to the limits 

specified by the state and national pollution control boards.

WASTE TO
WEALTH

MANAGEMENT
APPROACH

In this resource-constraint 

world, challenges such as 

increasing scarcity of land, 

energy, water and materials 

are quickly intensifying. 

One of the ways to address 

this challenge is to 

transform waste generated 

into a valuable resource. 

Mahindra has been on the 

path of circularity, where 

effective and efficient 

waste management 

practices help waste 

become a source of raw 

material to produce a 

valuable product. 

Mahindra follows a waste-to-resource 

approach. For us, waste is not a 

burden but a resource that can 

produce sustainable benefits not only 

for our business, but also for the 

health of the people and planet. We 

are committed to responsible disposal 

of waste as per all applicable norms, 

leading to better ecosystems.

MINIMISING WASTE TO LANDFILL

For us, hazardous waste is a valuable 

resource that can be turned into 

something new and useful to give us 

the competitive edge without having a 

negative impact on the environment. 

Since most of our plants follow the 

ZWL process, the hazardous waste is 

now sent to authorised recyclers and 

for co-processing to cement industries 

to ensure that we minimise the waste 

going to landfill.

The total hazardous waste generated 

in the current year was 5,864 tons, out 

of which 4,543 tons was recycled.

Turning Waste into Resource 

Sanitary waste usually ends up in 

landfills and seas. In order to turn this 

waste into resource, Mahindra installed 

37 PadCare bins which can break 

down toxic waste of sanitary napkins 

and recycle disposed pads into 

cellulose for further use in packaging 

industry. Mahindra turned this waste 

material into flower pots.

Paint Sludge is the waste generated 

during the painting process. This waste 

is hazardous material and legal 

permissions are required for disposal 

as it is harmful for the environment.

We used this waste and turned it into 

sludge powder that is used as one of 

the ingredients to manufacture powder 

coating paint. We used 20% dried 

paint sludge in the powder paint 

keeping the quality intact.

REUTILISATION OF
PAINT SLUDGE

Through optimisation of battery usage 

in office UPS infrastructure at MRV, we 

were able to reduce hazardous waste 

generation.

The number of batteries during 

replacement cycle reduced from 96 to 

76. This led to a decrease in 

maintenance cost, reduction of energy 

usage to charge the batteries, and cut 

the space utilised.

WASTE REDUCED THROUGH
OPTIMISATION OF BATTERIES

MRV took a frugal and sustainable 

initiative to transport unsuitable soil 

from the MSTP premise. The soil was 

dumped in 4x4 track area (which was 

not planned in phase-1) to create 

heaps, which later converted into 

critical gradient climbing in 4x4 

adventure tracks. The soil was also 

used in raising the ground level at the 

lake boundaries resolving the issue of 

costly elevated boundary construction 

at the lake side to restrict water inflow 

during rains.

More than 2 lac+ m3 excavated earth 

material was filled in the lake side low 

level areas and 4 x 4 adventure track. 

This not only solved the problem of 

unsustainable soil, but also saved a 

significant high cost. 

REUSE OF EXCAVATED SOIL
TO MAKE 4X4 TRACK

SPILLS

Spills can pose safety and 

environmental risks. At Mahindra, we 

have SOPs for all processes to 

eliminate spillages. The chances of 

spill reduce considerably if the SOPs 

are followed. In case of a mishap, 

requisite preventive steps are taken to 

mitigate the risk of spillage, and to 

ensure the safety of employees and 

the environment.

No significant spill 
incidents were recorded
during the reporting period.

MATERIAL
CIRCULARITY

Doing more and better with less has 

been a part of Mahindra's DNA. For 

further greening our operations, we are 

focussing on discarded products that 

can serve as raw materials for new 

products or materials. This material 

circularity eliminates financial, 

environmental and accessibility of raw 

materials risks, and helps us in 

contributing substantially to low-

carbon and green economies.

We leverage technology and innovation 

to find better processes and improve 

our efficiencies to reduce our material 

consumption. We also recycle and 

reuse waste to minimise the amount of 

material used. We understand that 

consumption of raw materials and their 

processing impact the soil, water, 

biodiversity, and ecosystem functions; 

and ensure circularity to make the 

process more sustainable.

Innovation in Material Use

The connecting rod is one of the 

critical components which govern the 

weight of reciprocating parts of engine 

crank train system. The new engine 

project was crucial for three major 

launches of M&M - All New Thar, and 

the upcoming XUV7OO and Z101. 

Hence, it was necessary to implement 

technologies to improve fuel efficiency, 

emission control and wise utilisation of 

raw material. We used Micro-Alloyed 

Steels which is high strength with 

optimum raw material cost. This not 

only reduced 40.8 tonnes of steel 

usage for 60k engines, it also made 

the engine lighter leading to 

significant improvement in fuel 

efficiency and emissions reduction.

NEW MICRO-ALLOYED
CONNECTING ROD FOR LIGHTER,
GREENER NEW THAR ENGINE

Core shop in Swaraj Division Foundry is 

responsible for core making. Out of 23 

raw materials, use of four raw 

materials is quite high - Mix Sand 

Wastage, Amine gas, Resin, and 

Hardener. In order to reduce the 

consumption of Mix Sand Wastage, we 

used the loose sand coming from blow 

plate; to cut down the use of resin and 

hardener, we used closed plastic tank 

that stopped moisture absorption; 

sand level sensor provided in hopper 

set the required sand level in order to 

reduce the sand holding time resulting 

in reduction in mix sand wastage. 

These steps helped bring down the raw 

material use significantly.

REDUCING THE RAW MATERIAL
CONSUMPTION USED
FOR CORE MAKING

Hydraulic system is a key feature which 

controls the position and draft of the 

tractor implement. Existing hydraulic 

lift arm was higher in weight (11.2 kg 

per tractor) and in cost. In order to 

optimise weight, hydraulic lift arm had 

to be re-designed.

We designed a new Solid Solution 

Ferritic (SSF) Casting grade to 

optimise weight of the new lift arm 

with the same strength and function, 

but at lesser material cost. The new 

design also led to reduction in overall 

weight of the tractor leading to better 

fuel efficiency.

OPTIMISING THE RAW MATERIAL
OF LIFT ARM

Ÿ Weight of lift arm -

reduced to 4.3 kg from  5.6 kg

Ÿ Total weight saving per tractor -

2.6 kg

Ÿ Total weight saving per annum - 

260 ton

PACKAGING

Wasteful packaging runs the risk of 

ending up as landfill waste. Mahindra 

focusses on the design, material and 

process of packaging to reduce waste, 

and make it eco-friendly, cost-

effective and convenient. It helps us 

enhance the productivity of resources 

and environmental performance.

COMPLIANCE

Environmental risks and compliance are closely aligned. A robust risk management 

programme without compliance, or vice versa, is not feasible.  At Mahindra, we go 

beyond compliance. We follow globally benchmarked best practices and standards, 

and adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines and specifications relevant 

to our business for the betterment of the planet and people. We also learn from 

others and share our experiences to raise industry standards in the areas of 

environment, health and safety.

We have not paid any fines related to environmental or 
ecological issues in the past five years. During the year, 
there was no environmental violation by M&M.

INITIATIVES

At Spare Business Unit Jaipur, 

we have been taking several 

initiatives for reducing 

packaging and making it more 

sustainable. 

Ÿ Corrugated box strips 

produced by shredding 

machine to eliminate the 

use of bubble wrap

Ÿ Metal pallets used instead 

of wooden pallets

Ÿ Truck loading optimisation

Ÿ Reuse of good quality box

From unveiling the SUVs of tomorrow with unprecedented value proposition and cleaner 

engines, to spearheading farm prosperity through mechanisation, digital products and 

sustainable solutions - we are decarbonising the industry; one product at a time. 

Our focus continues to remain on embedding innovation, safety and sustainability at the design and manufacturing stage, and 

infusing greater economic value and pride of ownership in the use phase. We are also actively working with stakeholders across 

our value chain to ensure that our products are good for the health of the people as well as the planet, even after their useful 

life ends.

F22 saw a plethora of launches across the spectrum of our offerings; from XUV7OO - the global SUV to the FURIO 7 range of 

LCVs, from a rice transplanter and a self-propelled combine harvester to an e-cart for last-mile mobility. 

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Our approach remains proactive as ever. We manufacture products and provide 

services that are powered by innovation and answer a specific need of any segment 

of the market. They not only provide comfort and safety to our customers, but are 

also more environment-friendly by consuming less fuel and reducing emissions.  

Mobility is what connects India - the people who reside here, as well as the larger 

concept of Bharat that resides within it. Having catered to the needs, wants and 

aspirations of the urban customers as well as the rural farmer for over 75 years, we 

have a fair understanding of what drives them and what they are likely to drive. For 

urban India, we design mobility solutions that reduce congestion and pollution while 

enhancing comfort, safety, and driveability. For rural India, our range of tractors, 

farm equipment and services like Krish-e catalyse agricultural growth and increase 

farm prosperity while streamlining resource consumption. 

NEW PRODUCTS

Our products are a manifestation of 

our purpose of helping people to Rise. 

They are an outcome of human 

intellect, endeavour and perseverance, 

aided by technology and global best 

practices.

The FUTURise framework 

shapes our ambition to 

transform ourselves into 

a global innovation 

powerhouse driven by 

technology. This 

approach is rooted in 

three guiding principles: 

Do more with less, Do it 

together, and Do it for all. 

FUTURise

In F22,

455,570 vehicles and 

354,698 tractors

were sold.

The All-new
Global SUV

Launched on August 14, 2021, the XUV7OO (pronounced as XUV, 7 

double 'O') packs a commanding presence, a sophisticated driving 

experience, and spirited performance, along with world-class safety 

features and a whole gamut of first-in-class technologies. The XUV7OO 

is powered by Mahindra's tried and trusted mStallion and mHawk 

engines in the petrol and diesel variants respectively. These engines 

combine amazing horsepower and low-end torque with impressive fuel 

economy for its class.

It boasts the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) in the top-spec 

AX7 variant. ADAS includes road safety features like adaptive cruise 

control, lane keep assist, high beam assist, automatic emergency 

braking, amongst others. All these features together made XUV7OO 

India's first full-size 7-seater SUV to get 5-star Global NCAP rating.

XUV7OO has taken the Indian automotive market by storm. Its booking 

started on October 02, 2021 and within 90 days, 14,000 vehicles were 

delivered. It also became the fastest SUV in India to hit the 1 lac 

bookings mark. As of March 2022, XUV7OO had won 29 awards, out of 

which 14 were car of the year awards.

Every once in a while, an 
automobile comes to 

change the future course 
of its manufacturer and in 
the process, it transforms 

the segment itself. The 
XUV7OO marks the 

beginning of a whole new 
Mahindra and a new era for 

the SUV segment in India.

Driving Electric Mobility Forward
The future of mobility is set to shift owing to the combination of climatic change, 

growing fuel prices and urban transportation issues. To a large extent, e-mobility 

addresses all of these issues. According to NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute, 

India's EV market could touch USD 152.2 billion by 2030, and about 80% of two- 

and three-wheelers and 50% of the country's four-wheelers could be electric 

vehicles.

The Electric Vehicle (EV) space is, thus, set to see tremendous changes in the next two to three years and Mahindra is 

gearing up to play a leading role in it by investing INR 30 billion to build-up technology, launch new products, ramp up 

production and forge strategic partnerships.

E-ALFA CARGO SMALL CART, BIG BENEFITS

In February 2022, Mahindra entered the burgeoning electric cart segment 

in India with Mahindra Electric's e-Alfa Cargo. Despite its small dimensions, 

it has a large and wide cargo tray with a 310 kg payload. On a single charge, 

customers can travel 80 km with a top speed of 25 km/h. With a low running 

cost of just 59 paise per km, the e-Alfa cargo is an affordable product in 

the company's growing electric portfolio, which already includes the 

Mahindra Treo Zor electric three-wheeler available in three variants.

Electrifying the last-mile mobility

India, the world's top market for motorcycles, is also one of the biggest for 

three-wheelers. In the last two years, despite subdued demand for three-

wheelers owing to the pandemic, the sales of electric models have been 

strong and positive. In the last-mile delivery, electric rickshaws are also 

gaining ground with their fuel cost advantages.

The demand is also buoyed by the government, which has been promoting 

e-mobility as a means to curb oil imports and worsening air pollution. 

This increased adoption is also the 

reason why EV leasing as a 

concept has become increasingly 

popular. EVs can be cost-effective 

in the long run given prevalent 

petrol and diesel prices, but the 

initial cost is prohibitive. Since EVs 

are still nascent, banks are 

sceptical about sanctioning loans. 

Moreover, the delivery partners 

are often cash-strapped 

individuals for whom meeting 

monthly down payment obligations 

could be difficult. 

This is where leasing makes a 

strong case for itself. It offers a 

number of benefits like zero down 

payment, no additional expenses 

like road tax, registration and 

yearly insurance, no cost of 

maintenance, and cost-effective 

vehicle upgrades. 

MAKING EV ADOPTION EASY

Quiklyz, a vertical of M&M 

Financial Services Limited, offers 

the largest portfolio of EVs for 

leasing and subscription to 

prospective customers. It offers 

all the aforementioned services 

with benefits like vehicle 

upgrades every 2-3 years and 

monthly subscription charges for 

EV four-wheelers.

While mechanisation in land preparation and rice harvesting is 

widespread, less than one per cent of rice transplanting is mechanised. 

A rice transplanter addresses this need. It offers uniformity in planting 

depth, plant-to-plant distance, row-to-row distance as well as number 

of saplings per spot, resulting in faster speed of operations, lower cost 

of cultivation and increased yields.

Designed by Mitsubishi Mahindra Agricultural Machinery of Japan and 

customised to the specific needs of the Indian rice farmers, the 

Mahindra PlantingMaster Paddy 4RO is India's first 4-row ride-on type 

rice transplanter. The new technology offers state-of-the-art features, 

quality and ease of operation. They come with the ability to 

accommodate different paddy varieties, agronomic practices and field 

conditions.

LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT

True sustainability of a vehicle is not 

just measured from the tailpipe but 

across the entire value chain - from 

the quality of input materials, design, 

manufacturing, transportation, and 

fuel consumption, to the end of life of 

the product. 

We have been following the End of Life 

of Vehicle (ELV) Directive for the 

European M1 & N1 products as part of 

the compliance. The vehicles are 

exported and certified as per European 

Emission Compliance (EEC) Directive 

2005/64/ EC.

In F20, we worked on an experimental 

basis to evaluate a full LCA. Under the 

study, assessment of one UV pickup 

model Bolero Maxi Truck (BMT) and 

one XUV5OO have been completed. 

For more information about the long-, 

medium-, and short-term recommendations 

that came out of the LCA, and being 

considered for the global XUV5OO, please 

refer to page 104 of 'Mahindras 2019-20 

sustainability report.

Vehicles Designed for Life and the End-of-Life

We are aligned with the 'ELV Directive' by European Union, which is aimed at 

dismantling and recycling of End-of-Life Vehicles (ELVs), making them more 

environmentally friendly by:

The scope of the directive includes:

Ÿ M1 and N1 category of vehicles

Ÿ Regulation applies to vehicle including all their components and materials

Ÿ Regulation applies irrespective of how the vehicle has been serviced or repaired

We reiterate that none of our major models contain any hazardous materials like 

Lead, Cadmium, Mercury, etc. Also, dismantling manuals have already been 

developed for Mahindra vehicles. We have instituted special processes to ensure 

compliance to EEC directive 2005/64/EC for ELV regulation.

For European exports, in line with the EC directive on Recycle, Recovery & Reuse 

(RRR), here are the recyclability and recoverability rates of some of our best-selling

Health and Safety Impacts

Product safety may not seem to have 

a direct correlation with 

decarbonisation, but a connection still 

exists. Safer vehicles last longer, and 

are designed to be more productive 

and efficient across their life cycle. 

This in turn reduces the overall 

footprint of the vehicle. 

Our mission is to bring safer vehicles 

on Indian roads. For that, we are 

building cars with maximum structural 

integrity loaded with tech-enabled 

features for maximum safety, 

performance and efficiency. Mahindra 

is one of the leading manufacturers in 

India, committed to improving their 

vehicles in response to Global NCAP's 

call to democratise vehicle safety.

Our vehicles meet the Indian market 

regulations on emission, noise and 

safety which are enforced through 

Central Motor Vehicle Rules. 

Compliance of other safety 

requirements like a crash, seat belt 

anchorage, head impact, steering 

impact, pendulum impact is also 

required under CMVR. All our vehicles 

comply with the existing norms. But 

achieving the bare minimum is just a 

start. We continue to improve our 

safety beyond compliance and 

benchmarking our standards to global 

benchmarks.

MAHINDRA MAKES INDIA'S
SAFEST VEHICLE YET AGAIN 

In 2021, we surpassed our own safety 

records and secured 5-star rating in 

the Global New Car Assessment 

Programme (Global NCAP) for the 

XUV7OO. It has the highest combined 

safety score (Adult + Child) of 57.69 

out of a total of 66.00, among the 

Indian vehicles tested so far by Global 

NCAP. This makes XUV7OO the safest 

Indian vehicle and the first full-size 

7-seater SUV in the country to 

receive 5-Star Rating. 

In addition to the rating, it is 

heartening to be recognised by Global 

NCAP for being the first Indian made 

and owned brand to offer Autonomous 

Emergency Braking (AEB) as a safety 

option, as part of ADAS. 

In addition to the features, there is a lot under the hood that makes XUV7OO India's 

safest vehicle. In XUV7OO, the Body In White (BIW) including the B-pillar and the 

Cantt rail is designed to absorb the impact of an accident better than most other 

cars - not just from the front but also from the sides. We have used steels of 

different grades like hot form steel (boron steel) and advanced high-strength steel, 

keeping in mind their strength as well as crash absorption ability. Crash energy 

management is also extended to the engine compartment and how it absorbs the 

crash impact.

In April 2022, the Global NCAP, under its Safer Car 
for India Mission, crash-tested various made-in-
India cars and ranked them. In the top 10 list of 
India's safest cars, three Mahindra vehicles - the 
XUV7OO, XUV3OO and the Thar, were ranked 1st, 
3rd and 6th respectively.

Features may differ by variants

Some of the best- in-class safety features in XUV7OO include

7 Airbags Latest Generation Electronic Stability Programme

ADAS: including Front Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Keep 

Assist and Departure Warning, Smart Pilot Assist and High Beam Assist

Social Impacts

Our vehicles help us Rise for a More Equal World. They move people closer to their 

life and livelihood, and to realise their social ambitions. They are, in their own 

special way, engines of societal growth. Following are some of the interventions 

taken up during the year to cater to the societal needs.

AUTO SECTOR

Be it facilitating a much-needed 

breath of air or address the special 

needs of a Paralympian, we provided 

appropriate, timely and trusted 

solutions:

Oxygen on Wheels 

From raising funds to sustain the 

government's relief efforts and 

providing ICU beds, emergency cab 

services, quarantine centres, monetary 

support and dry rations for the 

underprivileged, to re-engineering our 

production lines and facilities to 

manufacture much-needed PPE, face 

shields, face masks and aerosol boxes 

to aid the fight against coronavirus - 

the Mahindra Group was steadfast on 

the frontline in the fight against 

COVID-19.

A major initiative we undertook was 

the Oxygen on Wheels (O2W), a free 

service extended to strengthen oxygen 

availability by connecting producers 

with hospitals and medical centres 

that were in dire need of it. Helmed by 

Mahindra Logistics Limited (MLL), the 

initiative began with 100 vehicles 

ferrying medical oxygen to seven cities 

in Maharashtra - Mumbai, Thane, Pune, 

Pimpri-Chinchwad, Chakan, Nagpur 

and Nashik. During the second phase, 

O2W was launched in Delhi and Punjab 

as well.

Specially Designed
for the Specially Abled 

For the world to prosper, everyone 

must have the ability and the 

opportunity to move forward. Quite 

often, passenger vehicles still ignore 

the needs of the differently abled. 

Certain features can be retrofitted only 

via aftermarket route. But when Deepa 

Malik, the first Indian woman to win a 

medal in the Paralympic Games, voiced 

the need for a new SUV specially 

designed for the specially abled, our 

R&D team swung into action and within 

a span of 2 months, Ms. Malik was 

invited to the Mahindra Research 

Valley to test out the modifications 

made on a customised XUV7OO. 

The major change was the motorised 

co-driver seat for easier ingress and 

egress. The seat could swivel and lower 

so that not much effort is required to 

sit on it. Once seated, the seat would 

get back to position at the push of a 

button. It was indeed a privilege to be 

of service to someone who brought 

great laurels to the nation.

Pickup to boost
the entrepreneurial spirit

IN F22, the Mahindra Group extended 

support to 'Project Mumkin' - part of 

Mission Youth J&K, a government 

initiative aimed to provide a vibrant 

medium for youth engagement and 

empowerment in Jammu & Kashmir. 

Along with Mission Youth J&K, we will 

also be providing financial assistance 

to the youth in the region to acquire

2022 we handed over 500 Bolero 

Pickup vehicles to help revive the agri 

produce-daily needs market as these 

vehicles are primarily used for 

intercity goods transportation.

FARM SECTOR

Whether it is facilitating financial 

assurance during the pandemic or 

providing support to a new generation 

of agriculture engineers - we continue 

to empower farmers by providing 

timely solutions. In F22, we also 

strengthened our commitment to 

Krish-e and furthered the idea of 

Farming as a Service (FaaS).

M-protect COVID Plan

At Mahindra, we care about our 

customers and the community at large, 

and took a series of initiatives to help 

those most in need to overcome the 

challenges related to COVID. Our 'M-

Protect COVID Plan' is a new initiative 

in that direction targeted at farmers, 

as we stand by them to drive positive 

change even in these tough times. The 

Plan covered all tractor purchases 

made in May 2021 and offered the 

following benefits:

Ÿ A COVID-19 Mediclaim policy with 

home quarantine benefits, along 

with a health cover of INR 1 lac

Ÿ Pre-approved loan benefits to cover 

medical expenses incurred during 

COVID-19 treatment

Ÿ Mahindra Loan Suraksha securing

Mera Swaraj Education
Support Programme

We believe that the true potential and 

yield of India's agriculture sector can 

best be realised through adoption of 

new-age practices and technologies. 

Towards this, we aim to nurture and 

create a competent pool of engineers 

for the future by engaging students 

early on in their careers and giving 

them the opportunity to appreciate 

varied mechanisation possibilities in 

agriculture. 

The 'Mera Swaraj Education Support 

Programme' is an early career 

development initiative for students 

across the country that aims to create 

a pool of competent agricultural 

engineers. In F22, 37 first-year 

engineering students from 8 premier 

colleges were selected and will be 

exposed to critical and holistic 

industry experiences necessary for 

long-term career development. The 

students, who mostly hail from the 

farming community, will also receive 

financial support for four years, 

subject to consistent academic 

performance and work on live farm-

mechanisation projects mentored by 

industry experts. Successful graduates 

will eventually be subsumed into the 

organisation's final placement process.

Krish-e
Building Big Bharat

Krish-e is a new but ambitious business vertical from Mahindra that provides 

technology driven services, which are progressive, affordable and accessible to 

farmers. With an omni-channel presence, Krish-e aims to increase farm income 

through physical as well as digital services across the complete crop cycle. In F22, 

we affirmed our vision of making Krish-e, India's largest ecosystem of digital 

products and solutions, by launching the Krish-e app. 

The Krish-e app is part of Mahindra's digital foray into developing a marketplace 

that provides a range of services centred on mechanisation and advisory.

For more information about Krish-e, please refer to page 79 of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. 

Sustainability Report 2020-21

We made our initial investment in Carnot Technologies, an agri-tech start-up, in late 

2020. Since then, it has been our partner in leading the digital product & technology 

vision for Krish-e and in just under 18 months, we have built a digital platform with a 

big Bharat footprint - including 500,000 app users, 4 million rental hours and 4 

million acres of farmland. We have now deepened the ties and enhanced our 

strategic commitment to Carnot by increasing our stake to 69% in F22.

It is one of the fastest-growing apps in the agriculture 
technology space having amassed over 3 million 
downloads. The app is also integrated with on-ground 
activities undertaken in Krish-e's 100 centres across 
16 states.

Deepening the grass-root connect 

Our focus continues to remain on 

delighting rural customers with better 

quality, value proposition and comfort. 

Prospective customers can visit their nearest CSC VLE store to make an enquiry 

about select Mahindra vehicles like the Bolero, Bolero Neo, Scorpio, XUV3OO,

MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS

We constantly engage with and listen to our customers in order to better 

understand their needs and aspirations. This is the only way we can strive to help 

them to satiate their needs via our products and services. Through consistent 

engagements with our customers, we not only get their feedback, but also identify 

the areas where we can do better, gauge the demand and expand our product 

portfolio.

Communication is, for us, always two-way. Whatever information we give to the 

customers is in step with the marketing plans, and in full compliance with all the 

statutory laws and standards related to marketing communication, advertising, 

promotion and sponsorship. 

We connect far and wide through multiple channels including traditional and new 

media to promote our products/services and their advantages, and to build brand 

equity. All our campaigns on these media adhere to the code of conduct defined by 

the Advertising Standards Council of India. Some of the key initiatives conducted 

under marketing and communication were:

XUV7OO Launch Sets the Trend

As we geared up for the coveted launch of the XUV7OO, we wanted to build hype 

and excitement around it. While the vehicle is engineered to dial-up the adrenaline 

of auto enthusiasts, we also wanted to give fans a chance to feel the rush and share 

it with fellow auto aficionados.

We followed a multi-pronged communication strategy using different mediums. In 

Twitter, for example, we deployed different tools at each stage. We kick-started with 

a 'Set Reminder' function to build a buzz and urge the target audience to mark the 

launch event in their calendars. We also became the first auto brand in India to 

unveil a vehicle using the Live Events page on Twitter. On the launch day, XUV7OO 

took over the Twitter timeline for a 24-hour period and became a national trend.

Promoting
the Krish-e App Suite 

The Krish-e suite of mobile apps 

comprises Krish-e and Krish-e Nidaan 

app. While the Krish-e app provides 

scientific, field validated and 

personalised crop advisory that is 

presented in an easy-to-follow 

understandable format for farmers, 

the Krish-e Nidaan app is a real time 

crop disease identification app that 

helps farmers to identify common 

plant diseases and pests affecting 

over 20 most popular crops.

The DVC highlights the challenges a 

farmer faces when planning and 

executing his farming operations and 

is focussed on telling farmers about 

the unique benefits of the Krish-e app 

by bringing expert advisory and best 

farming practices across different 

crops and regions in multiple 

languages using audio & video 

content.

The AdrenoX Rush

In the run up to the launch of XUV7OO, 

we piqued the customer as well as 

media interest by unveiling AdrenoX, 

the intelligent cockpit technology that 

provides a cutting-edge driving and 

ownership experience to XUV7OO 

owners as it strings together many 

segment-leading immersive 

experiences.

The gateway to these experiences is 

through integrated 10.25-inch dual 

screens with the widest display in the 

segment and SmartCore™ cockpit 

domain controller technology with the 

third-generation Qualcomm® 

Snapdragon™ Automotive Cockpit 

Heralding the SUVs of Tomorrow with a brand new identity

Mahindra's core has always been 'authentic SUVs'. Since decades, we have been designing SUVs with an unmissable presence on 

roads. To underline this distinctiveness, last year, we created a distinct identity for the SUV business within the conglomerate. 

The 'Twin Peaks' logo for Mahindra's Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) was unveiled in August 2021 as part of a new brand identity 

meant to reflect the portfolio's transformation - the 'SUVs of tomorrow'. The new symbol captures where the brand comes from 

and where it wants to go, encapsulating a journey that began 75 years ago.

Platforms developed in collaboration with Visteon. Additionally, under AdrenoX, we teamed with Amazon to deliver India's first 

vehicle with Alexa built-in functionality. The AdrenoX also brings an immersive audio experience by adopting Sony's 3D Sound 

Technology and enhances the spirited performance of the vehicle via intuitive drive modes in its diesel variants.

The new identity was launched via a 

brand film that featured the voice of 

veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah with 

the background score composed by 

maestros Ehsaan Noorani and Loy 

Mendosa. The film got rave reviews and 

was described as 'bold', 'cool', 

'futuristic' and sort of like 

'Transformers' by various members of 

the audience. Although introduced with 

the XUV7OO, the new Twin Peaks 

identity will be seen throughout the 

SUV product portfolio and will cover 

1,300 customer (sales) and service 

touchpoints across 823 cities. The 

existing 'Road Ahead' logo will be 

retained for the commercial vehicle 

products and the farm equipment 

sector.

Mahindra FURIO 7 Performance Now Guaranteed 

At Mahindra, we continue to design our vehicles to address the unmet needs of 

customers. Our customer insights for the LCV category revealed that owners need a 

truck that can deliver higher earnings, lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), best 

warranty offer, lowest maintenance, safety and comfort - all these leading to a risk-

free business and complete peace of mind. These insights led to an unprecedented 

double guarantee of 'More Mileage or Truck Back' and 'Guaranteed Resale Value' 

after five years when the Truck and Bus Division commercially launched the new 

Mahindra FURIO 7.

The FURIO 7 LCV range, manufactured at Mahindra's world-class Chakan facility in 

Maharashtra, has been designed by Pininfarina for Indian road conditions and sets 

benchmarks with its world-class design and engineering excellence. They are 

powered by two super-efficient, lightweight, low-friction engines - MDi and MDi 

Tech with popular Dual Mode FuelSmart technology. It also boasts of the Most 

Advanced Telematics technology, Mahindra iMAXX. The FURIO 7 is the culmination 

of focussed efforts over the past six years of over 500 Mahindra engineers and 180 

suppliers, and an investment of INR 6,500 million.

A Value Proposition
that Reaffirmed Faith 

This covers BLAZO X Heavy, FURIO 

Intermediate, and Light Commercial 

trucks including FURIO 7 and JAYO. 

The new range features engines with 

FuelSmart Technology, Mild EGR with 

proven Bosch After Treatment System 

that leads to lower AdBlue 

consumption and many other 

technological advancements. This 

campaign not only reaffirmed our 

customers' faith in our ability to create 

technologically advanced, class-

leading products, it also set higher 

standards for the Indian CV industry.

SUSTAINABLE 
SUPPLY CHAIN 

A streamlined supply chain ensures smooth flow of the 

three most important aspects of business - the product, the 

information and the finances. Apart from access to raw 

materials, components and services, the supply chain helps 

companies become more responsive to customer requests, 

improves inventory management, enhances communication 

between teams, and aids in the movement of money. The 

automotive industry relies heavily on the supply chain to 

optimise manufacturing and distribution as well as 

minimise costs.

Mahindra is embedding environmental, social and governance considerations into 

the supply chain to strengthen it further because unsustainable practices in supply 

chain become a risk to the sourcing company and the planet. We ensure the 

sustainability of our tier-1 suppliers and in turn, they cascade the same to their 

suppliers. Once it is implemented across all tiers, the entire supply network 

becomes sustainable. 

Post COVID-19 and Ukraine-Russia crisis, the supply chains have disrupted 

globally. Mahindra is reinventing the supply chain by making them more agile, 

flexible and resilient to such disruptions. We are also ensuring that the highly 

localised supply chain continues to self-sustain and is as minimally impacted as 

possible. By guiding our suppliers to take the necessary steps, we are moving 

towards making the entire value chain sustainable. 

Effective management of the supply chain helps conserve 

resources, reduce costs, and increase productivity of an 

organisation.

Some of the other key sustainability initiatives that Mahindra has taken up in the reporting period include: 

Capability Building

CONDUCTING AWARENESS

SESSIONS ON SUSTAINABILITY

This is the first step in greening the 

supply chain. We conducted 26 

webinars to create awareness on 

sustainability among our suppliers, 

which were attended by 768 suppliers. 

The e-learning module launched in F20 

on MSetu App continues to help supply 

chain partners gain more awareness 

and knowledge to de-risk their 

operations. 

ENHANCING SKILLS

AT THE SUPPLIERS' END

Mahindra suppliers are aligned with 

our goals and we support them in 

accelerating their sustainability 

journey through capability and skills 

building.  Focussed activities drive in 

key areas has been undertaken, and 

the organisation work structure for the 

same has been put into effect in the 

purchasing group in the last few years. 

In F22, initiatives and the areas 

covered were Supplier Business 

Capability Building (60 suppliers), 

Mahindra Supplier Evaluation Standard 

(136 suppliers) and Supply Risk 

Mitigation & Management (392 

suppliers). As a part of the supplier 

skill building programme Parivartan, 

the number of supplier personnel 

trained cumulatively till F22 were:

Mahindra Yellow Belt

28 MGB
Mahindra Green Belt

143MC�E
Mahindra Certified Quality Engineer

193MCPE
Mahindra Certified Production Engineer

61MCTE
Mahindra Certified Technical Engineer

Supplier Sustainability Assessment

The sourcing process at Mahindra is based on supplier sustainability assessments. 

Suppliers who follow sustainability practices grow with us and gain a competitive 

edge in the market. In the reporting year, 17 supplier assessments were conducted.

Supplier facilities were assessed based on revamped Sustainability Assessment 

Check Sheet under six categories, 45 checkpoints in line with GRI standards, ISO 

standards, legal and other requirements. This enables us to classify the suppliers on 

the Sustainability Maturity Model.

We initiated Supplier Safety Audits through third party auditors and inputs were 

given to suppliers for improvement to maintain a safe working culture. Suppliers 

were encouraged to replace conventional lighting with energy-efficient LED lighting 

and solar panels under the Carbon Footprint Reduction initiative. 

The initiative led to 128.5 MWp solar installations by
38 supplier partners together generating about
140.7 MU p.a. contributing to save 111,159 tCO2.

Supplier Sustainability Assessment

The sourcing process at Mahindra is based on supplier sustainability assessments. Suppliers who follow sustainability practices 

grow with us and gain a competitive edge in the market. In the reporting year, 17 supplier assessments were conducted.

Supplier facilities were assessed based on revamped Sustainability Assessment Check Sheet under six categories, 45 

checkpoints in line with GRI standards, ISO standards, legal and other requirements. This enables us to classify the suppliers on 

the Sustainability Maturity Model. We initiated Supplier Safety Audits through third party auditors and inputs were given to 

suppliers for improvement to maintain a safe working culture. Suppliers were encouraged to replace conventional lighting with 

energy-efficient LED lighting and solar panels under the Carbon Footprint Reduction initiative.

MAHINDRA DEALER EXCELLENCE PROGRAMME (MDEP) 

The MDEP evaluates dealerships on customer intimacy, operational and 

organisational excellence, timeliness in the execution of services, and whether 

these endeavours result in a 'consistent delightful experience' for customers. The 

evaluation findings lead to rewards and recognition for the dealerships that score 

the highest, and the best performers become role models for other dealer 

partners.

In F21, 285 out of 300 dealers have taken part in an MDEP sustainability drive, 

which amounts to 95% of the total number of dealers.

Other Initiatives
using sustainability lever for logistics

Ÿ Started using trains for outbound - 

this saves diesel consumption and 

saves emission

Ÿ Wood waste reduction programme 

in packaging continued and 

achieved ~40% reduction w.r.t. FY16

MONITORING ENERGY EFFICIENCY
OF MAJOR SUPPLIERS

Investing in supplier sustainability 

makes us more sustainable and helps 

us deliver seamless and sustainable 

value creation. We have been 

monitoring energy efficiency of our 

top tier suppliers and helping them to 

reduce consumption through various 

initiatives.

DEALER SERVICE
QUALITY INDEX (DSQI)

The DSQI's two-step evaluation 

process assesses dealers every six 

months based on parameters ranging 

from infrastructure, tools and 

manpower to dealers' involvement and 

service quality through a score on 100. 

Further, it uses customer satisfaction 

survey findings to strengthen existing 

processes. Based on these parameters, 

the Service Coupon rates are derived. 

The quality of dealer service positively 

influences the brand's image and the 

market share. Mahindra continues to 

engage with the dealers to improve 

the service quality and support 

dealers in creating customer delight.

THOUGHT LEADERSHIP 
& PARTNERSHIPS

At the core of everything 

we do at Mahindra, lies a 

strong desire to realise our 

purpose to drive positive 

change in our stakeholder's 

lives as we continue to 

become planet positive.

Mahindra has been proactively 

participating in various national and 

international forums to promote 

climate action. At the World Economic 

Forum 2021, Mahindra Group Chairman 

Mr. Anand Mahindra had announced 

the commitment to implement the 

Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, stating 

that purpose-driven businesses are 

likely to be more resilient than those 

that do not embrace people and planet.

Mr. Mahindra had also called upon the 

businesses around the world to set a 

science-based emission reduction 

target at the WEF in 2018. In the same 

year only, as co-chair at the Global 

Climate Action Summit in California, he 

was one of about 20 members on the 

UN Global Compact Board, that plays 

an important role in shaping the 

strategy and policy of the initiative for 

responsible business action.

ENSURING EMPLOYEE HEALTH, 
SAFETY & WELL-BEING 

The world we live in has 

changed post-pandemic. 

The world of work has also 

gone through a profound 

change. In these two rapidly 

changing worlds, Mahindra 

has been consistently and 

strongly standing with the 

employees. 

We are ensuring that our 

people, who are our 

strongest assets, continue 

to do their job and live 

their lives with ease despite 

the pace and scale of 

disruptive changes. At 

Mahindra, our focus is not 

only on physical, but also on 

the mental health and 

wellbeing of employees.

Post pandemic, wellness has become a 

major challenge. Through the design 

and implementation of creative health 

and wellness solutions, we are 

addressing this unique need of our 

employees and their families. We are 

creating a workplace environment that 

is conducive for employees to perform 

at their best. New policies have been 

introduced and old ones related to 

workplace flexibility, contractual staff, 

and pay to offer more benefits to our 

workforce have been reviewed. 

Mahindra continues to engage with 

employees, invests in their professional 

development and provides them with a 

meaningful purpose so that the work 

remains enjoyable. We are also 

reimagining and reinventing the 

workplace by bringing in policies, 

procedures and technology essential 

for the changing world. We also 

support and celebrate innovation, 

out-of-the-box thinking, and well-

reasoned risk-taking and reward our 

employees for their performance. Such 

initiatives make Mahindra an employer 

of choice.

Management Approach 

Mahindra is a people-first company. 'CAPable People, REAL Experience' encapsulates our Employee Value Proposition that stems 

from our core purpose of inspiring people to Rise. It sums up the ideal we aim to live up to as an employer, and embodies the

therapy and training, engage with them on regular basis on new realities and emotional challenges they face on daily basis.

During the pandemic, we formed Special Rapid Action Force teams to ensure safe and healthy working conditions for our 

workforce. We also got the units OHSAS Certified. All permanent workers and officers at Mahindra were provided periodic health 

check-ups as per our health and wellness policy. We assess their health based on a Unique Health Index. Apart from this, we 

conducted webinars, communications and internal newsletters to create awareness on health and well-being.

employees adopt a healthier lifestyle. The initiatives focussed on the physical, as 

well as emotional wellbeing of employees, helping them realise its importance for 

them and their family members. The DilSay series addressed four pillars of wellness 

- physical, emotional, nutritional, and healthcare consultation.  While taking a 

'satisfaction survey' on the company's health and wellness initiatives, it was seen 

that 81% of participants were very satisfied. Participants went on to say they found 

the programmes helpful for them and their families.

DilSay along with MLU's Academy of Leadership, Emcure and FW Academy

Mahindra's progressive Human Resource policies and robust engagement mechanisms are designed to go above and beyond 

standard requirements, to actually nurture, motivate, reward and retain talent. It is through this talent that we replace

Alternative thinking has always been the normal at our 

workplace. As we relentlessly seek to break fresh ground and 

solve problems, the ingenious use of our resources and our 

ability to think differently power us on. 

Drive Positive Change in the Lives of Our Customers and 

Communities 

We expect everyone at Mahindra to work for the greater 

good, to advance humankind, and transform the world into a 

better place. A significant part of our job is to create lasting, 

positive change in the lives of the customers and 

communities we serve. 

OUR PROMISE TO OUR EMPLOYEES 

Recognition for Outperformance  

We encourage healthy competition, and create a high-

performance culture by recognising breakthroughs, and

human rights. We not only advocate, 

but also implement highest standards 

of human behaviour and respect the 

dignity of everyone associated with us. 

Mahindra is also signatory to the UNGC 

global compact and our Chairman has 

been instrumental in introducing UNGC 

in India.

We have zero tolerance against any 

kind of human rights violation. We 

strictly condemn acts like 

discrimination, forced and compulsory 

labour, and child labour, within and 

beyond Mahindra boundaries. We also 

discourage any form of corruption, 

including bribery or other negative 

practices. 

We adhere to UNGC Principles on Human Rights, including: 

PRINCIPLE 1

Businesses should support 

& respect the protection 

of internationally 

proclaimed human rights 

PRINCIPLE 10

Businesses should work 

against corruption in all 

its forms, including 

extortion and bribery 

PRINCIPLE 2

Ensure that businesses 

are not complicit in 

human rights abuses 

Our Policy on Human Rights does not end at our gates, we take this further out to 

those who we partner with. Human Rights issues are a part of the selection process 

for anyone we choose to work or have contractual agreement with. We have also 

developed a training module on human rights and how human rights issues can arise 

or be relevant to a business across a diverse set of operating environments.

Human Rights Assessment is a part of our annual sustainability assessment process. 

We also have an active and well-defined, four step Grievance Redressal Mechanism 

available at each plant for workers, through which all types of grievances are 

redressed. No complaints have been received or reported for the reporting year. No 

child or forced labour was found prevalent in our system. We also verify the age of 

workers recruited in our operations to ensure that no child labour is engaged.

A comprehensive risk management system is also in place that takes into account 

any risks for Human Rights violation and our ability to curb it. 

This result reflects our stand on the issue that's stated in our Code of Conduct and

Speak Up 

24X7 Ethics Helpline

As part of our Speak Up campaign, 

this year we launched a 24X7 

ethics helpline for all Mahindra 

employees. This secure and 

confidential helpline is our 

endeavour to keep our workplaces 

safe, transparent and friendly for 

people to work in. The helpline is 

being managed by external partner 

to ensure that concerns and 

conversations remain completely 

anonymous. 

INITIATIVE 

POSH

Mahindra initiated the POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) policy even 

before it was made mandatory by the government. We have measures in 

place to prohibit any form of intimidation, harassment, retaliation or violence 

against workers. To spread awareness about POSH, the Mahindra Group 

launched the Speak Up campaign.

The initiative was born with the aim to stem any such situations/behaviour 

that comes across as uncomfortable for an individual, then and there, to 

avoid it becoming an issue that can be constituted as harassment. Our 

gender-neutral POSH policy provides protection against any form of sexual 

harassment at work – in office or virtual. Please do not hesitate to 'Speak up' 

should you feel harassed at work. All POSH-related matters are treated with 

utmost sensitivity and confidentiality, with a fair hearing to all parties 

involved.”

For more on the same visit  https://www.mahindra.com/speakup 

We have instutionalised the highest benchmarks of corporate 

working and behaviours in our processes. It is because of our 

high standards, we have been globally recognised for our ESG 

mandate and won the trust of our stakeholders.

Equal Remuneration

At Mahindra, we do not differentiate compensation amongst 

employees based on gender or any other aspects, at any 

locations of operation. Remuneration is based solely on merit 

depending on the level, grade, and number of years of 

experience, skills, competence and performance of the 

individual.

We pay our workers regularly, in full and on time and all 

workers receive a payslip with their wages explaining any 

legitimate deductions.

Women in Manufacturing 

Mahindra is committed to improving overall diversity in the 

automotive and farm sector. More than 70 women 

successfully work on the shop floor of Swaraj - one of our 

leading tractor brands - breaking the myth that core 

manufacturing roles are best suited for men. 

In Mahindra corporate office, more than 

30% of the workforce are women and 70% 

of the new hires last year were women. 

Our manufacturing teams are blessed to have some of the 

hardest working women employees. At Mahindra, we have 

consistently been working on ensuring women get equal 

opportunities across levels. Our initiatives are aimed at 

connecting with women across the Group to help them grow in 

their careers. With our steady efforts, we are striving to get 

more women on board.

TALENT MANAGEMENT 

While the work environment has transformed, the 

expectations of candidates looking for employment have also 

changed in the new normal. The pandemic has forced 

Candidates to reassess their priorities and expectations. 

They are now more interested in knowing the operational 

stability of a business, the company's vision for the future, 

and transparency. Mahindra continues to be a desirable 

employer among experienced and first time candidates alike. 

The key components of talent management at Mahindra are 

attracting, developing, and retaining high-performing 

employees. Talent works wonders when it is nurtured. At 

Mahindra, talent management is a comprehensively planned 

and executed process to create leaders from those with 

known potential, as well as those with untapped capabilities. 

Our Talent Management Aspiration 

Mahindra has been consistently featured in the Great Place 

to Work list for a decade now. This is a testimony of how 

successful we are in managing talent aspiration. We have 

robust talent management processes designed to enable our 

employees to rise. We revamped our Talent Management 

Architecture to build best-in-class leaders across levels, for 

a future-ready global organisation. 

The three key features of this initiative are: 

Ÿ Broadening of target pool in junior and middle 

management for focussed development 

Ÿ Providing customised development opportunities to 

identified target groups in mid to senior management in 

focussed functional streams 

Ÿ Evolving specific programmes focused at building expertise 

in various areas of Product Development 

Our updated process aims to nurture, revitalise and retain 

some of the finest talents from across the automobile and 

farming sectors. This strategic implementation structure 

involves leveraging individual and team strength.

Integrated Development Strategy 

With fast-changing world and equally fast evolving economy, 

continuous learning and development are key to ensuring 

employees keep up with change. We provide our employees 

ample opportunities to hone their skills, reinforce their 

learning, stimulate imagination and invigorate passion. We 

motivate our team to go the extra mile through well-integrated 

growth strategies and diverse engagement tools.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

Businesses fuel the economic growth 

of a nation, but no business thrives in 

isolation. For businesses to truly 

succeed, this economic growth must 

reflect in the progress of its 

community. From extreme weather 

events to lack of essential natural 

resources, it is the most vulnerable 

sections of our society who bear the 

brunt of climate change. This is why 

we are striving to be planet positive as 

well as work in the sphere of 

community development by

Ÿ empowering our communities

to be resilient

Ÿ fostering inclusive growth

Ingrained in our business strategy since 

inception, community development is 

one of our key material issues. Enabling 

communities to Rise, we deploy 

'Alternativism' in our approach to 

devise innovative interventions that 

overcome social challenges and 

advance community progress. 

Executed with high precision, our 

community development initiatives are 

designed to trigger self-sustaining 

transformations. This in turn gives rise 

to self-sufficiency and equal 

opportunities among the most 

marginalised sections of our society. 

Aligned with the SDGs, these initiatives 

seamlessly work towards achieving 

multiple goals, be it through our income 

generation initiatives that focus on 

eliminating poverty, education and 

women empowerment initiatives that 

focus on providing quality education 

and bolstering gender equality, or our 

watershed development programmes 

and tree plantation initiatives that 

focus on conserving natural resources. 

At Mahindra, driving positive change 

through business has been a part of 

our definition of success. Since 2005, 

we voluntarily contributed 1% PAT 

towards CSR, and smoothly 

transitioned to contributing 2% 

average net profit of immediately 

preceding 3 years as per the New 

Companies Act, 2013.

Our Vision

Our CSR vision aligns with our core 

purpose and focusses on three key 

constituencies - girls, youth and 

farmers. We support them through 

innovative programmes, in the domain 

of education, health and environment, 

which harness the power of 

technology to maximise change. By 

investing our CSR efforts in these 

critical constituencies who contribute 

to nation building and the economy, 

we will enable our stakeholders and 

communities to Rise.

FOUNDATIONS
AND TRUSTS

We aim to empower the disadvantaged 

sections of our society through our 

Foundations and Trusts. As 

professionally managed institutions, 

the Foundations and the Trusts enable 

us to take up initiatives that address 

vital issues at local and national levels, 

and bring about meaningful changes 

that balance competence and 

compassion. We constantly improve 

our efforts by analysing our 

programme outcomes, scaling up 

successful models and sharing our 

progress with the stakeholders.

EDUCATIONAL
SUPPORT

Education is the driving force of 

positive change in our communities. A 

critical cog in our approach to social 

responsibility, we believe that only 

quality education can truly break the 

inter-generational cycle of poverty. 

Aligning with SDG 4 - Quality 

Education, SDG 1 - No Poverty, and 

SDG - 5 Gender Equality, our 

educational initiatives are devised to 

uplift and empower the most 

marginalised and disadvantaged 

members of our communities. By 

resolving the roadblocks that hamper 

quality education, these initiatives 

ensure the development of the nation 

and the economy.

Ÿ Empowering the girl child by 
providing her with access to
quality education

Ÿ Providing livelihood training and 
creating employment opportunities 
for underprivileged youth

Ÿ Providing monetary aid and 
scholarships for deserving and 
underprivileged students

The three key objectives of our well-

designed and ably-implemented 

interventions are: 

Project Nanhi Kali 

Project Nanhi Kali was instituted in 

1996 with the objective of empowering 

underprivileged girls in India with 

access to quality education.

Jointly managed by
K.C. Mahindra Education 
Trust and Naandi 
Foundation since 2005, the 
project has transformed
the lives of over 500,000 
girls from economically
and socially disadvantaged 
backgrounds, across
14 states. 

With the aim of helping girls complete 

schooling, Project Nanhi Kali provides 

girls with comprehensive support 

including daily after-school academic 

support at Academic Support Centres, 

where locally recruited women tutors 

facilitate concept-based learning and 

mentor the girls. Every girl is provided 

with access to personalised adaptive 

learning software pre-loaded on digital 

tablets. This AI-powered software 

matches instructions to the unique 

learning level of each girl. Driven by 

technology, the innovative pedagogy 

addresses the challenges of 

overcoming the gender digital divide in 

India and the lack of qualified 

teachers, especially in rural / tribal 

locations.

The girls also receive an annual school 

supplies kit (comprising of a school 

bag, stationery, pullover / raincoat and 

feminine hygiene material) to enable 

them to attend school with dignity. 

Further, a professionally designed 

sports curriculum is integrated into the 

programme to promote holistic 

development. Through regular 

engagements with parents and 

community stakeholders, the project 

creates conducive, girl-friendly 

ecosystems in underserved 

communities across India. 

Despite prolonged disruptions in 

government school schedules caused 

by the COVID-19 pandemic, Project 

Nanhi Kali ensured that girls continued 

to receive educational support, 

thereby mitigating the risk of learning 

losses and dropouts amongst the girls. 

Aligned with UN Sustainable 

Development Goal four of Quality 

Education and Goal five of Gender 

Equality, Project Nanhi Kali affirms that 

every girl is given the opportunity to 

learn and achieve her full potential. 

In F22, Project Nanhi Kali 
supported the education of 
185,759 underprivileged 
girls across more than 
7,000 Academic Support 
Centres in 9 States of India.

CASE STUDY

Born to an economically disadvantaged family, Shobha 

Gehlot lives with her parents and two siblings in a 

tribal village in Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh. While her 

father, a teacher by profession, encouraged her 

education, the patriarchal village elders were against 

it and compelled girls to stay at home to learn 

household chores and marry at a young age. 

Breaking these shackles of discrimination, at the age 

of 8, Shobha enrolled into Project Nanhi Kali in Class 3. 

She received daily academic support at Nanhi Kali 

Academic Support Centres as well as annual school 

supplies. When in secondary school, she was 

introduced to digital tablets through her Nanhi Kali 

tutor. Having access to a technology-driven learning 

platform meant she could learn concepts at her own 

pace. Eventually, Shobha went on to excel in her 

academics and successfully completed her Class 10. 

She cherishes not only the academic support she 

received throughout her schooling by her Nanhi Kali 

tutors, but also the confidence they instilled in her to 

pursue her dreams of a college education. One of the 

500,000 girls in India whose life has been transformed 

through Project Nanhi Kali, Shobha had enrolled into 

Project Nanhi Kali as a student but today, continues 

her journey with Nanhi Kali as a tutor empowering the 

next generation of girls in her village.

In our village, the childhood of 

a girl is spent in learning 

household chores to be eligible 

for marriage. After becoming a 

Community Associate (tutor) of 

Project Nanhi Kali, I have set an 

example for the villagers that a 

girl can study and get a job in 

her village if she is determined. 

My dream is to educate every 

girl in the village so that they 

can be the future and the pride 

of their village, like me.

SKILLING INITIATIVES

Mahindra Pride School and Classroom

To harness the advantage of our demographic dividend, skill development of our youth is essential. Aligning with this national 

priority, the Mahindra Group began a livelihood and skill development programme, Mahindra Pride, in 2017 with an aim of 

equipping youth with employable skills.

The Mahindra Pride School (MPS) is a unique 90-day 

livelihood training programme provided majorly in four 

domains of ITES, Retail, Hospitality and Auto sector. Along 

with domain training, students undergo training in life skills, 

spoken English and computer skills. This programme has a 

100% placement track record; however, placements of 

students from F21 and F22 were adversely impacted due to 

the pandemic. 

The Mahindra Pride Classrooms (MPC) provide 40-120 hours 

training modules to final year students studying in Government 

Colleges, ITIs and Polytechnic Institutes on spoken English, life 

skills, interview preparedness and digital literacy.

Most of the youth trained under this programme were 

females. Since inception, this intervention has trained more 

than 5.6 lakh youth. The MPC model also engages a full-time 

placement coordinator in every state who is entrusted with 

the responsibility of ensuring that placement goals are met. 

'Job Utsavs' i.e. placement drives, are organised annually to 

bring together employers and the talent pool of MPC alumni 

to ensure that placement goals are met. 

Mahindra Pride Schools were implemented through 7 schools in 5 States

(Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra)

Mahindra Pride Classrooms were conducted in 20 states through 3,681 classrooms

CASE STUDY

Born to a farmer in Andhra Pradesh, Uma had to 

shoulder the responsibility of being the breadwinner

of her family. Her father made a switch from farming 

to masonry, to make ends meet. Unfortunately, he lost 

his legs in an accident in Surat where he fell into an 

iron furnace. With the wheel-chair being his only 

means of mobility, he lost the opportunity to continue 

his work. Uma dreamed of supporting her family and 

pursuing a great career that would give her a decent 

income. She took the lead and worked hard to join a 

course in Medical Coding. However, due to COVID, job 

prospects in Hyderabad disappeared and her mother 

lost her job as well. 

During this time, she heard about the training and 

placement opportunities provided by MPS - Hyderabad 

from her senior who was an alumnus placed at Wipro. 

She enrolled for the ITES online course at MPS-

Hyderabad, and honed her communication and public 

speaking skills that gave her confidence a significant 

boost. She credits the course with teaching her the art 

of clearing interviews and to be empathetic.

She bagged opportunities from Concentrix and 

Teleperformance Global Services, and decided to join 

Teleperformance as an 'Analyst' with an annual CTC of 

INR 0.176 million. She expressed her gratitude to the 

entire MPS team that helped and guided her, to 

support her family and herself financially. 

Stories of Transformation 

Sakshi, a BCom student from Keshav Memorial Institute 

of Commerce and Sciences in Hyderabad, became the 

sole earning member of her family when her father 

met with an accident and was paralysed. Her mother is 

a homemaker and she is the only daughter. Since this 

incident, Sakshi singlehandedly looked after the 

expenses of her family. After attending her BCom 

classes, she took up a teaching job where she tutored 

students in Begumpet, Hyderabad. From these classes, 

she earned approximately INR 8,000 that she spent on 

the household expenses.

CASE STUDY

Korra Arjuna Rao and Korra Varahalamma from 

Gurragaruvu village (Paderumandal) have a close 

affinity to their coffee farm. Over the years, the farmer 

family has embraced agronomy and principles of 

regenerative agriculture to care for their farm through 

Mahindra Hariyali. 

"The primary shade in our coffee farm is silver oaks 

and the coffee lacked diverse trees around it", says 

Rao. The bulk of their 2-acre coffee farm is under 

silver oak trees in dark brown soils at an elevation of 

about 1,100 metres. A shade grown tree like coffee 

depends heavily on its surrounding trees for nutrients 

and derives flavour notes from its environment. Coffee 

also needs multi-tier shade - a primary and 

secondary shade to allow sufficient amount of sunlight 

to nurture the produce evenly.   

As part of the Mahindra Hariyali initiative, the family 

received 400 saplings of 14 varieties of fruit and forest 

trees, for shade and boundary planting in their coffee 

farm this year. Additionally, they received 282 coffee 

saplings for gap filling - 200 to improve the farm 

density and 82 to replace the uprooted stem borer 

infected plants. As farm density remains consistent

In 2021, the farmer family generated a 
31% increase in income from coffee by 
supplying Grade 1 fruit to SAMTFMACS - 
Araku's coffee cooperative. This is just 
the beginning, considering that the 
farm has the potential to yield 
additional, quality coffee fruit in the 
years to come, securing sustained 
livelihoods for their family.  

and biodiversity thrives, the overall farm ecosystem 

remains healthy and resilient. 

Varahalamma and Arjuna Rao are grateful for the 

support. This is an investment they could not have 

made into the farm otherwise, given their financial 

constraints. Their daughter, Jyothi, is pursuing her 

graduation, and with this support and better coffee 

yield in the years to come, they hope she continues to 

study further.

WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT

Women Empowerment through
Regenerative Agriculture

The multi-fold objective of the programme is to enable 

women farmers to use regenerative agriculture as a 

technique to transform the soil on their land, increase 

productivity and earn profits throughout the year, in addition 

to ensuring food and nutrition security for their families.

Three regenerative agriculture hubs have been set up, each 

having a demo farm for practical knowledge sessions on 

various agricultural practices, and training on various farm 

tools, equipment and techniques.

Women's Initiative for
Synergistic Empowerment (WISE)

The programme aims at the economic empowerment of 

women by promoting enterprises through building 

entrepreneurial capabilities, financial management and digital 

technology with specialisation in better marketing of products.

The programmes run with a focus on addressing gender barriers 

to enterprise. To further support women specifically in branding,

packaging and digital marketing, 12 economic empowerment 

hubs have been created as part of the programme.

As part of the programme sponsored by 
Mahindra, 20,000 SHG members from 14 
districts in Maharashtra and Madhya 
Pradesh got an opportunity to explore their 
entrepreneurship capabilities through 
enterprise awareness programmes.

Through this Mahindra-backed project, 
3,400 women farmers from Moga, Tarn 
Taran (both Punjab) and Shravasti (UP) 
were skilled and provided knowledge in 
regenerative organic farming practice.

Project Prerna Krishi Mitr

Mahindra launched the unique initiative 

called Project Prerna Krishi Mitr to 

empower the woman farmer - the 

unsung heroes of our agricultural 

landscape. This ambitious woman 

empowering model aligns with the 

contemporary prerequisites of modern 

agriculture, which is needed for the 

overall progress of rural economy. The 

project works with women farmers for 

major crop productivity enhancement 

and farm mechanisation at grassroots 

level to ensure improved income and 

focusses on providing economic 

support, digital support, and social 

upliftment. In addition, the model also 

focussed on empowering individual 

farmers especially women farmers from 

Farm Producer Organisations (FPOs)

Project Prerna Krishi Mitr has been 

implemented in eleven states, namely 

Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, 

Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, 

Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar 

Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar. 

Ÿ Trained and strengthened seven 

women led FPOs for improved 

forward market linkage practices in 

Bihar and Madhya Pradesh

Centres (CHCs) to provide user-

friendly farm equipment for 

cultivation at affordable costs

Ÿ Established lift irrigation systems in 

farmlands and brought 45 acres of 

additional land under irrigation

Ÿ Established 12 micro-units which 

will enable each FPO shareholder's 

income to increase by INR 10,000

Ÿ Ensured nutritional security by 

using 30% of the vegetable 

produce for home consumption

Ÿ Established linkages with existing 

Government welfare schemes to 

provide life and health coverage to 

700+ women farmers

Ÿ Women Gram Sabhas conducted by 

respective Gram Panchayats to 

discuss challenges faced by women 

across 9 districts

INTRODUCTION In the past two years, humanity has been put through astounding challenges - ranging from a pandemic to geopolitical crises; 

from supply chain disruptions to skyrocketing input costs. However, in the medium to long term, climate change continues to be 

the biggest threat facing us.  How we tackle this challenge will be the defining moment of our times. The latest report of the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted the need for urgent action in addressing climate change. In the 

17th edition of the Global Risk Report in 2022 by World Economic Forum (WEF), out of 10 the most severe global risks over the 

next 10 years, five are environmental and climate related. 

Our material topics identified in consultation with various stakeholders (please refer to the 'Material topics for a sustainable 

business' section in this report) lay the foundation of our sustainability roadmap. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to identify, 

assess, monitor, and manage the risks to materiality that can seriously jeopardize the performance of the company. It is also 

very important to recognize the opportunities the business can realize to bring value to the stakeholders.

Mahindra operates in a climate-sensitive industry. We have taken some major steps to 

identify and address the risks and-or opportunities arising from climate change. We 

consider the role of climate change as both - a risk and an opportunities multiplier. 

In an endeavour to promote transparency and trust in all our dealings, we have also been early adopters of several disclosure 

parameters. Starting this year, in addition to the Government of India's National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct 

(NGRBC), our sustainability report will also align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 

recommendations, WEF's Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics and United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

ALIGNMENT WITH TCFD 

Climate change presents a significant 

financial risk to the global economy. In 

fact, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) 

has estimated potential losses due to 

climate change to close to USD 5 

trillion. Created in 2017, the TCFD, or 

Task Force on Climate-related 

Financial Disclosures is a guidance 

framework that helps companies 

disclose climate-related financial risks 

to investors, lenders, and insurers. 

As one of the pioneering sustainability 

practitioners in India, Mahindra Group 

has had a strong focus on these four 

parameters since over a decade now.

M&M has a Board-level Risk Management (RM) Committee, which is Chaired by the MD 

and CEO and is authorised to monitor and review RM plan and risk certificate, and to 

review and recommend to the Board any modi?cations to the RM Policy.

Further, the Board has constituted a Corporate Risk Council, comprising Senior 

Executives of the Company, which reviews risks and RM Policy at periodic intervals.

The RM Policy, inter alia, includes identi?cation of risks, including Climate Change (CC) 

and related risks and also those which may threaten the existence of the Company.

The Board meets once every quarter to discuss various risks, including climate risks.

The business risk of climate change can affect us in multiple ways - regulatory impact 

on vehicle sale, physical changes which could affect the operating environment of the 

vehicles and others. Thus, as we operate in a climate-sensitive industry, we have taken 

major steps to identify and address the risks arising from climate change.

M&M considers 0 to 3 year as short-term, 3 to 6 years as medium-term and 6 to 15 

years as long-term risk horizon.

The most significant short-term climate change risks we have identified are: 

• Current regulations; policies in terms of environment, product etc., like BS VI norms 

have transformed the auto industry and its products. 

• Reduced demand for Diesel vehicles due to rising fuel cost.

The CSR committee is responsible for looking after sustainability at large at M&M. 

Additionally, we have a Chief Risk Officer (CRO), reporting to the Head of Strategy. The 

CRO is responsible for the Company's enterprise and operational risk management 

plan and processes, including identifying and assessing corporate and asset-level 

risks.

Our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) has the responsibility to identify the risks and 

opportunities in line with the global risks and upcoming opportunities in consultation 

with the CRO. 

The plant heads review the risks regularly and deliberate on the opportunities. They 

also appraise the CRO and CSO on further enhancing the risk and opportunity matrix.

Recommendations Key Points

• Low-availability of water at production facilities due to inadequate monsoon. 

• Reliability of supply chain and ability to operate under dynamic conditions.

Some of the medium-term risks are: 

• Worsening of climate conditions. 

• Sourcing of raw materials and energy. 

Product liability.

• Environmental risks and liabilities.

• Information Technology.

• Changes in existing and upcoming laws and regulations.

• Innovation and identification of major transforming technologies.

• Attraction and retention of talent on climate change expertise.

• Production process risks.

• Managing climate change risks.

The long-term risks are transitional risks such as: 

• Extended producer responsibility risk. 

• Transition to shared mobility.

• Risk of raw material procurement. 

• Physical risks such as increase in average temperature and its impact on production 

and supply chain.

• Brand reputation risk such as expectations to the climate commitments like Science 

based Targets and Carbon Neutrality.

M&M assesses potential Risks and Opportunities (R/O) based on Board-level Risk 

Committee's professional judgment, with respect to the relevant case laws & 

regulations, definitions and guidance from the experts and discussions with external 

auditors. This assessment is both quantitative and qualitative.

From a quantitative perspective, M&M considers the risk as a percentage of various 

financial statement amounts (e.g., assets, liabilities, revenues, earnings, etc.). 

From a qualitative perspective, M&M considers all of the relevant circumstances 

including whether the risk is strategically important to the Company's business plan, 

whether it will have an impact on future results of operations or financial condition, 

and whether it is important to an understanding of the company's business.

As a result, risks that we have identified as having a substantive impact will vary from 

risk to risk in terms of quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

How M&M will be impacted due to operational, financial or strategic effects that 

undermine the entire business or part of the business can arise due to any of the 

following combination or individually:

- the proportion of our business units' operations is affected.

- the size of the impact on those business units.

- the dependency on that unit.

If any Risk/Opportunity influenced by change in climate having 5% impact on the 

current or future revenue at company level is considered as substantive 

risk/opportunity

Describe the resilience of the 

organisation's strategy, taking into 

consideration different climate-

related scenarios, including a 2°C 

or lower scenario.

Recommendations Key Points

Scenario Analysis

To limit Global Warming to 2°C, the society will have to collectively and rigorously 

reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The timescale considered for the analysis is 2030 

and 2040. TCFD recommendations and approaches were used to assess the resilience 

of our activities, considering the climate scenarios.

Emission regulation and carbon taxation in terms deregulation of diesel and petrol 

price along with the commitments under the Paris Agreement may propel Government 

to impose National Emission Reduction Targets for the auto industry. Policy 

instruments may be imposed to incentivise renewable energy, promote energy 

efficiency, and discourage fossil fuel. The transition scenario assessed the impact on 

our Company (Auto & Farm Equipment Sectors) primarily for regulatory risk. 

The transition to a low-carbon economy presents several risks, but also opportunities 

for M&M over the short, medium & long-term - notably from changing consumer 

preferences and future policy and regulation. Our growth and profitability are 

determined by our product portfolio, geographical and segment presence, and how 

these evolve over time in response to consumer demand. Failure to pre-empt or 

respond to changing consumer preferences could impact our growth. 

A Cross Functional Team (CFT) comprising members from strategic risk, sustainability, 

R&D, business intelligence & public advocacy function followed a 3-step process 

(Explore Uncertainties, Define Success and Action Items for M&M) to assess four 

scenarios in a maximum 2°C warmer world. Internal GHG and revenue data and the 

data extracted from the International Energy Agency's AIM-CGE and RCP 8.5 were 

used to understand climate-related risks and opportunities.

Based on the risk identified, M&M has formulated a business strategy to manage the 

risks and, where possible, turn the risk into an opportunity. Following are some the 

strategic initiatives that M&M has taken towards risks and opportunities management: 

• First Indian Company to commit & declare a carbon price of USD10 per ton of 

carbon emissions.

• First Indian Company to sign the EP100 program.

• Aligned to well below 2-degree scenario with targets approved by Science-based 

Targets Initiatives (SBTi)

• Aspires to be Carbon Neutral by 2040.

• Plan to source 100% of the electrical energy from renewable sources.

• Plan to remain water-positive and divert more than 99% of the waste from landfill 

from all the operational sites.

• Committed to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 47% per equivalent product unit and 

Scope 3 emissions by 30% per sold product unit by 2033 from a 2018 base year.

To future-proof the business, M&M has several plans:

• The R&D centre in Chennai, Mahindra Research Valley (MRV), is ramping up its 

engineering team by recruiting about 900 engineers to build EV capabilities and 

design and develop new electric products.

• Set up a satellite engineering centre for electronics keeping in mind the important 

role software and electronics have in EVs and ICE vehicles

• By 2026-27, M&M plans to have a portfolio of 5 electric SUVs. Four of them will be 

ground-up electric vehicles, while the fifth one will be XUV4OO, the electrified and 

larger version of the XUV3OO. 

• A total of INR 10,000 crore is M&M's investment plan for the EV play between F22 

and F27.

Describe the resilience of the 

organisation's strategy, taking into 

consideration different climate-

related scenarios, including a 2°C 

or lower scenario.

Recommendations Key Points

M&M believes that sustainability needs to be integrated not only in its own operations 

but also across the value chain. Every year we undertake important sustainability 

initiatives like awareness, training, capacity building and assessment, to enhance the 

sustainability quotient pertaining to upstream and downstream supply chain activities 

of our value chain partners.

Disclose how the organisation identifies, assesses, 

and manages climate-related risks.

Pillar 3 - Risk Management

Describe the organisation's 

processes for identifying and 

assessing climate-related risks.

Recommendations Key Points

We have a rigorous risk management process and robust risk culture in place that 

enables individuals to proactively identify and report potential risks throughout 

individual businesses and the organisation to respective risk owners. 

Risk and Control Owners have been identified for each department/function. Unless 

the situation demands for immediate reporting, a quarterly update is given by all the 

Risk Owners which covers the changes to the risk exposure and mitigation steps 

planned vs. taken. Also, the Risk Owners are responsible for monitoring the lead and 

lag indicators and taking immediate steps to activate the mitigation action plan when 

needed to be based on early warning signals.

At the company-level, the R/Os identified in the Climate Change Matrix are prioritised 

based on direction (positive or adverse), magnitude (high, medium or low), frequency 

of occurrence, nature of severity, how quickly they may materialize, reversibility & 

Irreversibility and on their potential impact to and of the company in the present and 

in future.

The CFO annually reviews and updates the respective risk scales that are used with 

concerned stakeholders The Internal Auditor and Legal Counsel are part of the 

Corporate Risk Council of the company. 

A risk-based approach drives the Internal Audit, System and Technology Audit and 

Compliance Audit. The Council oversees the existence, adequacy, and effectiveness of 

the RM process and policy to the RM Committee appointed by the Board, periodically. 

Further, the Council reviews the Quarterly Risk Presentation & Quarterly Risk 

Certificate to be placed before the Board at every meeting.

CFOs and line managers responsible for implementing mitigation plans of identified 

R/O's have financial incentives linked to the successful implementation of the plan in 

their goal sheets, as these action plans are dovetailed into their KRAs which determine 

their performance bonus/ incentives and annual increments.

Describe the organisation's 

processes for managing climate-

related risks

At M&M, we have a Chief Risk Officer (CRO), reporting to Head Strategy. The CRO is 

responsible for M&M's enterprise and operational RM plan and processes including 

identifying and assessing corporate and asset level risks.

The CRO and the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) are engaged through a structured 

process to deliberation on possible Risk and Opportunities (R/O) from Technology-

Economic-Media-Political-Legal-Environmental-Social (TEMPLES) framework.

Describe the organisation's 

processes for managing climate-

related risks

Recommendations Key Points

The R/O matrix is discussed with all the Plant Heads and their feedback is sought to 

further strengthen the matrix. The Plant Heads discuss and deliberate on the risks & 

opportunities identified by the CRO/CSO and provide details of asset specific R/O 

related to climate change.

The deliberation at the organisation and asset level leads to a robust R/O identification 

process which provides tangible feedback to the organisational strategy for climate 

change.

Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-

related risks and opportunities where such information is material

Pillar 4 - Metrics & Targets

Disclose the metrics used by the 

organisation to assess climate-

related risks and opportunities in 

line with its strategy and risk 

management process.

Recommendations Key Points

We formulate a three-year roadmap as per the various commitment and targets. For 

Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions targets are based on the SBTi. 

We include several targets which relate to climate risks and opportunities across our 

value chain. Performance against key targets can be found in our Sustainability 

Roadmap in the Sustainability & Us section of this report. It also details the strategy 

and actions we are taking to achieve them.

We measure the performance of emission, water consumption, waste diversion and 

material use as per the GRI disclosure and reported the same in respective sections of 

the report.

We measure and report our greenhouse gas emissions, energy, and water consumption 

annually in our Integrated Report/Sustainability Report 

Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if 

appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse-

gas (GHG) emissions, and the 

related risks.

Describe the targets used by the 

organisation to manage climate-

related risks and opportunities and 

performance against targets.

Mahindra, as a Group, has committed to becoming Carbon Neutral by 2040, with a 

clear focus on energy efficiency and usage of renewable power to achieve the target.

Residual emissions will be addressed through carbon sinks. 

Carbon neutrality plans have been approved for 15 Group companies till date.

For more information about the GHG performance and mitigation initiatives, please refer to the 

Carbon Emission section of the report.

Please refer to the roadmaps given in the section 'Sustainability Integration' for the targets.

Describe how processes for 

identifying, assessing, and 

managing climate-related risks are 

integrated into the organisation's 

overall risk management.

We have Enterprise Risk Management processes which cover the climate change risks, 

their evaluation and prioritisation, etc.

We monitor risk and opportunities information through various sources such as sector 

associations, peer company benchmarking, media monitoring and reports like CDP, 

DJSI, WRI, and WBCSD etc.

KEY RISK MITIGATION INITIATIVES

Mobility

Mahindra has a strategy to enhance focus, synergise, and 

grow exponentially by bringing together different businesses.

• Mahindra has investments in Porter, Zoomcar and Meru - 

disruptors and game changers in the mobility segment.

• Mahindra Logistics, India's largest 3PL solutions provider 

specialising in supply chain management and enterprise 

mobility.

• Mahindra First Choice Wheels, India's leading organisation 

in the pre-owned auto business with the largest multi-

brand retailing network.

EV Technology solutions

Emerging Regulatory risks

Ÿ Mahindra is going beyond the EV vehicles and building 

technology solutions. Proof of its expertise in the EV 

space is the MESMA 48 V platform for electric three-

wheelers and small cars, as well as the indigenously built 

MESMA 350 V powertrain that is set to electrify global 

SUVs in Korea and Europe. 

Ÿ Mahindra Electric's Next Generation Mobility (NEMO) 

platform for connected mobility supports an entire EV 

ecosystem and helps fleet operations to plan their EV 

rides more efficiently, and individuals to remotely monitor 

their cars' parameters. The company's range of ME 

chargers are also proof of its developing EV charging 

ecosystem. 

Ÿ The government may change regulations related to 

vehicle sales. For example, BS-III to BS-IV and BS-IV to 

BS-VI, physical changes that could affect the operating 

environment of the vehicles and others. The possibility of 

a low emissions zone with stricter limits constitutes a risk. 

This may affect local demand for our vehicles and hurt on 

sales, margins and, possibly, the residual value of these 

vehicles.  

Ÿ Cost parity, infrastructure and technology will play a 

critical role in increasing the adoption of Electric Vehicles 

(EVs) in India. The government can play a key role in 

attaining cost parity. However, subsidising the cars may 

prove difficult, so it is imperative that we find technology 

solutions to achieve cost parity.

Ÿ Mahindra has signed a MoU with Israel-based REE 

Automotive to collaborate for the development and 

production of commercial EVs for the global market. Both 

the companies will expand the production of commercial 

EVs for additional supply to the global and Indian markets.

Electric Vehicles

Ÿ Mahindra is working on futuristic quadricycle to offer 

clean and connected mobility solution.

Ÿ Mahindra owned Pininfarina, the iconic Italian design firm, 

will partner with  Britishvolt to build the United Kingdom's 

first large-scale battery gigaplant. The project, situated in 

Bro Tathan, Wales, will help create UK's largest battery 

manufacturing facility, thereby advancing the evolution of 

e-mobility.

THE YEAR
UNDER REVIEW

Despite the geopolitical risks and 

continuing fear of coronavirus, 

Mahindra Subsidiaries performed 

better in F22. The businesses opened 

up, momentum picked up indicating 

demand and volumes being back to

favourable factors that expanded

Mahindra Holidays saw an increase in 

people going for vacations, reunions 

and business trips. Logistics emerged 

among the fastest growing sectors in 

India, especially propelled by the 

pandemic. The growth trajectory of 

Mahindra Logistics was supported by 

capacity expansion endeavours and 

elevated by a significant increase in

improvements taken up in the last two

growth comes from TechM and 

Mahindra Finance.

LOCAL SUPPLY

The external factors that affected M&M also created disruptions at the other group companies during the reporting period. The 

second wave of COVID-19 hit India in Q1 F22 disturbing business because of its intensity. The global supply chains were affected, 

impacting Logistics cost and lead time due to port congestions and container unavailability. This affected businesses in the first 

two quarter of F22. In the last quarter, another challenge emanated in the form of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which led to 

soaring commodity prices and impact on availability of material. Buying locally has been a standard practice at Mahindra Group 

companies. We encourage local purchase to reduce supply chain costs, and expedite turnaround times, leading to better control 

of supplies. We ensure that while we buy locally, the quality and performance are not compromised. This practice allows 

businesses to alleviate environmental performance by reducing distances, carbon footprint and spur socio-economic growth in 

the region ensuring social license to operate.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

Every act of creation is also an act of 

consumption. Every time we 

manufacture a product or render a 

service, we are consuming resources - 

natural, human, and capital. These 

resources are valuable because they 

are scarce. So while we ramp up 

production to cater to growing 

demands, we also keep a keen eye on 

using these resources and ecosystems 

in the most effective manner. This 

includes:

Ÿ Making the manufacturing and 

distribution process more eco-

efficient

Ÿ Using less water and energy 

wherever possible - includes the 

incorporation of worthy alternatives

Ÿ More efficient use of materials with 

the three Rs (Reduce-Recycle-

Reuse)

Here are some examples of how our 

subsidiary businesses reduced the 

environmental impacts during the 

reporting period:

Partnership with
Daimler India 

The scrappage of old, polluting 

vehicles from Indian roads is an 

important step toward reducing Indian 

roads' CO  footprint.2

To give customers the opportunity to 

replace their old fleet with new BSVI 

BharatBenz trucks, Daimler India 

Commercial Vehicles (DICV) partnered 

with Mahindra MSTC Recycling's CERO. 

Under this partnership, owners are 

able to swap their end-of-life (ELV) 

commercial vehicles with brand new 

BharatBenz trucks with robust support 

and hassle-free service.

Crafting Buildings
for Well-being

In November 2021, MLDL and The 

Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) 

published key findings from five years 

of research on resource-efficient 

buildings, materials and technologies 

tailored to Indian climates and 

conditions. Led by a team of experts 

at the Mahindra-TERI Center of 

Excellence (CoE), a first-of-its-kind 

joint research initiative, these 

findings comprise guidebooks and 

toolkits which focus on developing 

science-based solutions for India's 

construction industry.

With much of India's future building 

stock yet to take shape, the real 

estate industry can play a critical role 

in meeting our country's Net Zero 

goals and SDG commitments, while at 

the same time crafting buildings 

designed for superior user comfort 

and well-being.

MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS

Good marketing communication serves 

many purposes. It ensures that we and 

our customers are on the same 

expectation plane. It increases 

awareness about our offerings and 

provides detailed instructions on how 

best to use it. It helps our customers 

voice their concerns and give their 

feedback on the user experience. And 

most importantly, it differentiates us 

from the competition pool. 

We leverage both traditional as well as 

new age media to reach out to a wider 

cross-section of our audience to 

communicate the advantages and 

impacts of our products and services. 

This includes our extensive television 

and print media campaigns that 

adhere to the code of conduct defined 

by the Advertising Standards Council 

of India, as well as social media 

campaigns.

Extending
Electric Mobility to Nepal 

Mahindra Electric
Mobility Limited (MEML)

Mahindra Treo, India's largest selling 

Li-ion electric auto platform with sales 

of 10,000+ vehicles was launched in 

Nepal in F22. The Mahindra Treo Auto 

'Soft Top' variant has been introduced 

in the Completely Build Unit (CBU) form 

at the price of NPR 8,40,000, ex-

showroom. This is an incredible value 

proposition because with the Mahindra 

Treo, customers stand to save a 

significant NPR 200,000/year and 

lowest running cost of NPR 0.8/km 

(when compared to petrol autos).

These USPs are being extensively

customers to opt for EVs over 

conventional fossil fuel vehicles. 

Tapping the Pent up
Travel Demand 

Mahindra Holidays &
Resorts India Ltd.  (MHRIL)

After the pandemic, when travel 

reopened and restrictions eased, there 

was an increase in desire amongst 

people to start vacationing again. The 

high safety and hygiene standards of 

Club Mahindra resorts gave them the 

confidence to step out of their home. 

To encourage more people to travel 

safely with confidence, Club Mahindra 

launched the 'Jaana Kahaan Hai' video 

campaign featuring celebrities like 

Soha Ali Khan and Kunal Khemu. The 

video shows celebrities planning their 

next trip at their favourite Club 

Mahindra resort spread across India. 

Kunal and Soha finally mention how 

with so many destination and 2,000+ 

unique experiences, all that is needed 

to decide upon is 'Jaana Kahaan Hai.'

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

When the promise of quality meets the 

assurance of consistency, customer 

satisfaction is achieved. As our 

customers evolve, so do their 

expectations from us. Mahindra Group 

Companies are constantly redefining 

the value proposition of their products 

and services in order to remain in sync 

with customer's expectations. 

Making EVs More Accessible 

Mahindra Finance

The on-road price of electric vehicles 

(EV's) is currently higher than petrol 

and diesel vehicles, although the 

running cost is much lower. Quiklyz, 

the vehicle leasing and subscription 

business vertical of Mahindra Finance, 

offers the widest range of electric 

vehicles (EVs) to potential customers.

A new-age digital-born platform, it 

offers customers great convenience, 

flexibility, and choice across Indian 

cities. There is no requirement for a 

down payment, and monthly 

subscription charges for EV four-

wheelers (4W) and customers have the 

flexibility to upgrade their vehicle in 

two to three years.

Taking Electric
Three-wheelers
to the Villages 

Mahindra Electric
Mobility Limited (MEML)

In a move to enhance sustainable 

connectivity in the country, MEML has 

partnered with Common Service 

Centers (CSC). CSCs are physical 

facilities for delivering Government of 

India e-Services to rural and remote 

locations. It appoints Village Level 

Entrepreneurs (VLEs) to facilitate a 

smoother operation and form the 

connection between customers and 

the OEMs. Currently, the network of 

VLEs extends to more than 4.7 lakh 

individuals across the nation, while the 

number of CSCs is 4.5 lakh. Through 

this association with CSC, MEML will 

offer their range of electric vehicles 

like the Treo and Alfa to aspiring 

customers in the rural markets. The 

CSCs will also enable MEML to 

communicate the massive savings and 

value proposition of its electric three-

wheelers. 

Delivering delight
ahead of time 

Mahindra Logistics Ltd. (MLL)

MLL's Network team truly lived up to 

the company's purpose - Mahindra 

Logistics works with the purpose of 

'Accelerating Commerce and 

Empowering Communities to RISE'. 

The Network team of MLL truly lived up 

to this purpose in F22 while 

undertaking a massive project for 

Siemens, one of their major clients.

Siemens planned to shift all material 

from its existing warehouse to a new 

space in Thane district, Maharashtra. 

This exercise had to be planned well 

and executed carefully. Six vehicles - 

four 32-feet-long and two 20-feet-

long trucks - were needed to shift the 

material. The shift had to be made 

without disturbing the regular dispatch 

at both locations. Moreover, the 

material had to be shifted without 

being packed. Even though the activity 

had to be completed within 60 days, 

the Network team wrapped it up in just 

45 days without any hiccups.

Strengthening
Last-mile Mobility 

Mahindra Logistics Ltd. (MLL)

Last-mile delivery and fulfillment 

continues to see strong tailwinds with 

increased digital adoption, expanding 

delivery networks and the onset of 

quick commerce. To deliver more 

customer delight, MLL acquired a 

majority stake in ZipZap Logistics 

Private Limited, a last-mile logistics 

service provider operating under its 

brand 'Whizzard'. Hyderabad-based 

Whizzard operates an intra-city 

distribution network for digital 

commerce and last-mile delivery, and 

enables seamless handling of 60 

million packages per year across 

diverse segments. The acquisition will 

complement MLL's existing last-mile 

delivery business and eDeL, its Electric 

Vehicle- based delivery services.

Calculating Specific Consumption

What gets measured, gets managed and improved. Mahindra businesses measure 

their consumption to help them not only do more with less, but also improve their 

environmental and business performance. 

Mahindra businesses measure environmental performance on absolute as well as 

specific basis. The specific consumption is calculated by dividing absolute 

consumption by a denominator based on the nature of business. For e.g., in case of 

manufacturing business units, it is the number of units produced, whereas for 

services, it is the number of employees, or units of services offered, etc. 

*For details of the denominators, please refer to the tables in the Annexure section of Subsidiaries.

AIR �UALITY

Deteriorating air quality is a serious 

environmental issue that affects the 

health of people and businesses 

negatively. It leads to respiratory and 

cardiovascular diseases in humans, 

and impacts crop yields and 

ecosystems affecting economic 

growth. Mahindra businesses continue 

to monitor the quality of air and take 

actions to reduce the air pollution. 

Our Group companies monitor 

pollutants like Particulate Matter 

(PM10, PM2.5), Sulphur Oxides and 

Nitrogen Oxides in line with the 

National Ambient Air Quality 

Standards (NAAQS 2009).

Mahindra businesses 
proactively adhere to all 
the statutory norms and 
regulations in the state or 
the country where they 
are present.

GHG EMISSIONS

GHG emissions contribute to climate 

change by trapping heat, resulting in 

extreme weather, food supply 

disruptions, and increased wildfires. 

Mahindra Group companies focus on 

four main drivers to reduce GHG 

emissions in line with the Intended 

Nationally Determined Contributions 

(INDCs). All our companies are actively 

contributing to reduce emissions 

through:

ENERGY

Efficient energy use supports climate change mitigation, saves costs, and contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

Mahindra businesses have a two-pronged approach for energy - increasing energy productivity and using renewable energy. For 

increasing energy productivity, businesses take initiatives such as business process reengineering to reduce energy requirements; 

heat recovery projects to reuse waste heat; and energy-efficient lighting to reduce power use. The businesses contribute to cleaner 

energy by adopting solar and inspiring other companies to increase the use of renewables through various solutions.

All the Group companies are taking steps to make their processes energy-efficient with many initiatives designed to be in line 

with the Group commitments.

DECARBONISING
BUSINESSES

The carbon neutrality target 

committed by Mahindra Group can 

only be achieved through collective 

effort. Being a federation of 

companies, all the Group entities are 

accelerating decarbonisation efforts 

by focussing on energy efficiency, 

renewable energy, electric mobility, 

and offsetting. This year, our 

businesses took some key initiatives to 

become low carbon:

Initiatives

TAKING MEASURES TO
CONTROL ENERGY USE
MWC Jaipur 

Project office and utilities at MWC 

Jaipur were observing high energy 

consumption leading to increase in 

costs, risk to environmental 

commitments, increase in use of virgin 

materials and customer 

dissatisfaction. MWC Jaipur took 

several measures to keep the 

consumption under control.

Some of the key initiatives included:

Ÿ Lighting Circuit Modification - 

Change in light position

Ÿ Timers in streetlights

Ÿ Replaced conventional lights with LED

Ÿ Use of existing materials instead of 

virgin materials

COOLING DOWN THE POWER USE 
MHEL, Chakan

In MHEL, two cooling towers were used

in seven test beds for water cooling that 

consumed more power. To reduce energy 

use, the team took measures such as 

modifying the process to use one cooling 

tower at any time; controlling its variable 

frequency drive according to the 

temperature; and installing alarm circuit 

for individual test bed. This resulted in 

saving of power units, reduced 

emissions, and less water use.

Cost Savings

Sustainable business growth

Rewards and recognition

Opportunities for new business 

models (innovation)

Increased brand value (due to 

increased customer satisfaction)

These initiatives helped MWC Jaipur in:

USING SUN'S ENERGY TO POWER 
PATHWAY LIGHTS  
MHRIL, Coorg

Mahindra Holidays at Coorg 

commissioned a 15-kW battery backup 

solar unit with a daily power generation 

of 25 units. The team powered the 

pathway light through solar instead of 

grid power supply saving 2,160 

units/month of grid electricity.

*For GHG emissions data, please refer to the 

tables in the Annexure section of Subsidiaries.

WATER

Mahindra Group is water positive since 

2014 and the goal is to remain water 

positive. We is harness more water 

than we consume. All our businesses 

are aligned with this, and work to 

conserve and rejuvenate water 

sources. Mahindra businesses follow a 

comprehensive water approach that 

looks at multiple facets of conservation 

and rejuvenation. Following are some 

of the key initiatives taken up by our 

businesses in F22.

Initiatives

CONSERVING WATER
FOR A BETTER FUTURE
MWC Jaipur

Project office and utilities at MWC Jaipur 

were observing high water consumption 

leading to increase in costs and risk

to environmental commitments. MWC 

Jaipur took several measures to 

conserve the precious resource.

Ÿ Irrigated garden area with RO reject 

water from food court area

FINDING ALTERNATIVES TO 
WATER USE 
Mahindra Lifespaces -
Mahindra Kalyan

During construction activities, water is 

used in curing process which is 

essential for hydration of cement. 

Mahindra Lifespaces replaced water 

with a curing compound to conserve 

groundwater. The company also used 

wastewater for dust suppression in the 

area instead of groundwater to reduce 

depletion of the resource. These 

initiatives led to 

Ÿ 3,640,000 litres of water saved by 

using curing compound

Ÿ 80,000 litres of freshwater saved by 

using wastewater for dust 

suppression 

REJUVENATING WATER SOURCES
Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra continued to take up 

initiatives for water conservation and 

rejuvenation in FY22. 

Ÿ Ground recharge of more than

1 million litres of water through 

rainwater harvesting units

Ÿ Recycled and reused 203+ million 

litres of water through STPs making 

locations zero discharge

Ÿ Reduced 25% of water consumption 

by installing water restrictors and 

sensors

Ÿ Recycled 25% of our food wastage 

to manure through organic waste 

converters and vermicomposting 

units

MATERIALS

Sustainability at Mahindra starts right 

at the start of supply chain - by 

sourcing raw materials while keeping 

environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) aspects at the fore. Multiple

businesses at Mahindra require different

raw materials to make products. Unless 

the sourcing of materials is done 

sustainably, these products cannot be 

made in a truly sustainable way.  

All companies are aligned 
with our Group's philosophy 
of 'doing more with less'. 

Our businesses select the optimum 

material, and then minimise the usage 

of materials for operations and 

subsequent modifications to transform 

them into a finished good. The waste is 

also recycled to minimise the amount 

of material used.

WASTE

At Mahindra Group, we don't waste a 

single opportunity to create value out 

of waste. Our businesses identify, 

evaluate, and manage waste 

responsibly by reusing and recycling, 

and supporting other businesses and 

industries to do the same for a positive 

impact on the environment and the 

financial bottom line.

Initiatives

GENERATING VALUE
OUT OF WASTE
MWC Jaipur

Being a stage 2 - C40 CPDP certified 

company, managing construction 

waste is vital for MWC Jaipur to help 

mitigate climate change through 

emission reduction in an economically 

sustainable manner.

MWC Jaipur used

Ÿ dismantled village road debris in the 

truck parking area,

Ÿ rusted barbed wire scrap as 

temporary fencing,

Ÿ discarded MS Tubes as road safety 

and parking barricades, and

Ÿ the area around waterbody was 

developed using scrap and waste 

material.

This led to saving of the disposal cost 

of waste and company costs in virgin 

materials, leading to less disturbance 

on natural cycles.

GIVING NEW LIFE TO WASTE
Mahindra Holidays, Coorg

Mahindra Holidays Coorg initiated a 

project to recycle plastic waste 

collected at the resort during the 

lockdown. The team at Coorg upcycled 

the bottles by turning them into centre 

tables, chairs, plants holders, etc. These 

items were displayed at a dedicated 

space named 'the cave' at the resort.

To build resiliency and 
manage multiple risks, our 
businesses work to make 
supply chains stronger, 
greener and more 
responsible towards 
customers.

MLL through EDEL will 
enable Flipkart in its 
journey towards building a 
green supply chain by not 
only deploying a large fleet 
of EVs but also creating a 
conducive environment for 
EV deployment and 
operations across the 
country.

early concern regarding the pandemic and its possible business continuity risks. The 

team alerted corporate, sites and other stakeholders on the preparedness on COVID-

19 in very early stages, handholding them through the unprecedented chaos. The 

safety team visited the sites regularly, providing visible leadership and commitment 

during COVID-19 lockdown. They remained accessible to the workforce throughout 

the ordeal and motivated them to not migrate back to homes. 

Anticipating the second wave of COVID-19 we rolled out an early warning system and 

focussed on specific communication with the locations on areas of concern while 

sending out a revised SOP on safe working conditions during COVID. We coordinated 

with ICMR approved labs and made a central provision for ensuring RT-PCR testing is 

carried out seamlessly in Maharashtra.

Skill Development - Mahindra Logistics

Education and skill development in local communities are the 

cornerstone of a nation's development. The logistics sector is 

a large employer in the Indian economy. At Mahindra 

Logistics Ltd. (MLL), we focus on promoting education 

including special education and employment enhancing 

vocational skills especially among girls, youth children, 

women, elderly and the differently-abled and livelihood 

enhancement projects, skill development through Pradhan 

Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, and other government schemes 

and safety & defensive training. 

With the help of our NGO partners like TRRAIN (Trust for 

Retailers & Retail Associates of India), Sewa Bharat and I & S 

Foundation, we tried to uplift the underprivilege communities 

especially focussing on women and PwDs by providing them 

the trainings on garments, retails and agriculture field. 

During F22, MLL supported 1,087 individuals across the 

country through this project.

Project Udaan - Mahindra Holidays & Resorts

Skilling women in hospitality sector with the F&B Steward 

role, Project Udaan run in collaboration with our NGO partner 

Sambhav Foundation to enhance the livelihood opportunities 

for women by providing them with the right skills and training 

to augment their earning potentials. Through this project, 

Mahindra Holidays & Resorts India Ltd. (MHRIL) aims to train 

75 women candidates in hospitality and will also be imparting 

industry aligned 'core employability skills' which are domain 

agnostic and meet the job/entrepreneurship requirements in 

the post COVID-19 scenario.

Project Gyandeep -

ENVIRONMENT 

Environmental protection and biodiversity conservation are 

crucial to mitigate and manage climate change.  The 

Mahindra Group and its companies realise the urgency of 

reducing the destruction of ecosystems, and have 

implemented the multiple initiatives and projects such as: 

Project Hariyali 

The Mahindra Group contributes to increasing the tree cover 

through Project Hariyali. The main purpose of the project is to 

restore the diminishing green cover and build awareness on 

environment protection across communities. Some of the tree 

plantation and awareness efforts undertaken by various 

companies include:

Mahindra Susten

Planted 20,681 trees with M&M and are raising 38,148 tree 

saplings for next year's plantation drive. Plantation activities 

were taken up at various sites other than company premises, 

such as schools and police stations, and about 780 saplings 

planted. The focus is on ensuring large scale tree plantation 

with natural resource management and global organic 

farming protocols to support local community livelihoods and 

enrich the agricultural ecosystems to build functional forests. 

This will benefit 44,116 people from villages/districts in 

Rajasthan, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and 

Punjab. 

Sustainable Fuelwood Management -
Mahindra Holidays & Resorts

Mahindra Holidays & Resorts in collaboration with Sambhav 

Foundation implemented an initiative in Sustainable Fuelwood 

Management in Mussoorie (Uttarakhand) and Varca (Goa). 

The key objective of the project was to promote sustainable 

and cleaner form of cooking among the community. At 

present, the demand for modern fuels, renewable cooking 

alternatives, advanced biomass cookstoves (ACSs) and 

improved biomass cookstoves (ICSs) is still very low. The 

biggest challenge is the affordability of fuel and cookstove 

for end users, who often have very low awareness about the 

benefits of the alternatives. 

To sensitise the people about the importance of sustainable 

fuel management, we held an awareness camp and 

distributed cookstoves. Our NGO partner will keep a monthly 

track of the beneficiaries' cookstove usage. During F22, the 

project benefitted around 800 households. 

Conservation Initiatives - Mahindra Susten

Environment conservation initiatives in Rajasthan other than 

plantation drives included bird feeder installation, activities 

undertaken for animal welfare, conserving flora & fauna, and 

workshops on composting that benefitted 100 people.  

Water Rejuvenation Project -
Mahindra Holidays & Resorts

Himachal Pradesh faces frequent water shortages due to 

deficient snow and rain that has resulted in falling water 

levels. However, the demand for water keeps growing due to 

increasing population in the state. To ensure increased 

access to potable water for villagers in Prini village, Manali, a 

water tank is being constructed near a freshwater stream. 

This water tank, with a capacity of approx. 1.5 lakh litres will 

harvest and store the water collected from the stream. This 

will enable the supply of potable water all year round to local 

households in the region. Once the construction of the water 

tank is completed, it will be handed over to the local 

government authorities, who will be responsible for regulating 

the water supply to the village. The project will benefit more 

than 3,000 villagers.

Swachh Bharat -
Mahindra Holidays & Resorts

With the aim of spreading awareness on cleanliness and 

hygiene, we organised clean-up drives, distributed jute bags 

and  dustbins, and also installed garbage storage units, to 

promote cleanliness and good hygiene practices in the 

communities.

WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT Building Communities -
Mahindra Logistics

We believe that upliftment of rural 

communities is key to the country's 

economic growth and success. Hence, 

we undertake various community 

development activities in villages and 

urban slums, and address issues such 

as health & sanitation, safe drinking 

water supply, malnutrition, education, 

youth development, women's 

empowerment, support to the farmer 

community and infrastructure 

development. These programmes not 

only enhance capabilities but also 

addresses issues like human dignity 

and self-respect.

Our activities include providing 

scholarship and grants to school 

children, providing them opportunities 

in higher education, health and eye 

check-up, road safety trainings, yoga 

and meditation sessions, awareness 

campaign for the use of seat belt, 

reading road and highway signage and 

personal hygiene.

We also provide HIV/AIDS awareness 

including testing and treatment, family 

welfare and organising celebrations of 

various festivals together with the 

promotion of social messages across 

different locations, etc. Support for 

orphanages, destitute homes, senior 

citizens, and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan 

are some of the other interventions 

that are part of our community 

development initiatives. During F22, 

MLL supported 72,635 individuals 

across the country. 

Project Saksham - Mahindra Holidays & Resorts

The project aims to promote entrepreneurship amongst women from low-income 

communities and provide them with the impetus they need to start or grow their 

own business and generate a reliable source of income. While many women possess 

the skill, the lack of the necessary tools or resources prohibits them from starting 

their own ventures. 144 women from low-income communities in the Mumbai 

Metropolitan Region were identified and supported through the provision of material 

and equipment worth approximately INR 15,000 each. Each woman is expected to 

increase the average monthly income by INR 5,000. 

Project Farm Pond and Fisheries Cultivation -
Mahindra Holidays & Resorts

The project aims to create greater availability of water for irrigation to small scale 

farmers and provide opportunities for alternate income. Through this project, MHRIL 

facilitates construction of farm ponds – an effective water harvesting structure, 

that ensures sufficient supply of water for protective irrigation, and fish production 

even after monsoons, ensuring greater productivity of farm land.

Five women farmers, residing in Udaipur, Rajasthan, have been identified for this 

project. These farmers were also introduced to the practice of fisheries cultivation. 

They were provided with financial and knowledge support required to undertake 

their first batch of fisheries cultivation. Through these interventions, the farmers will 

be able to increase their income by 40 to 60% with the capacity to earn 1.5 lakh 

within a period of 4-6 months.

The project will positively impact around 25 small scale farmers from low-

income communities.

Skill Development for Women - Mahindra Logistics 

MLL launched a skill development programme under the CSR initiative 'Hunnar' to 

enable underprivileged women in Delhi and the NCR to build better futures for 

themselves and their families. We partnered with NGO partner I & S Foundation and 

went door-to-door to identify individuals, and engaged a total of 120 candidates 

between the ages of 18 and 35 with a low family income. The NGO provided sewing 

training for three months to 30 women from the target area and 15 volunteers from 

MLL invested 360 hours to help these 30 women.

The women received government-approved certification through our collaboration 

with external government agencies following the completion of their training. This 

will assist them in obtaining employment or starting their own business. 

Furthermore, the NGO, I & S Foundation, will stay in touch with all the participants 

for the following year to help them get established in economic activities.

A prosthetic device, or prosthesis plays an important role in rehabilitation of 

persons with disability often improving their mobility and the ability to manage 

daily activities. However, for the underprivileged purchasing these artificial limbs 

isn't an affordable alternative especially in the case of the elderly residing in small 

hamlets and slums. MLL along with NGO partner Navankur Bahuudeshiya Sewa
