How do we consider materiality and our material matters?
We apply the principle of materiality in assessing what information should be included in our 
integrated report. This report focuses particularly on those issues, opportunities and challenges 
that impact materially on our six capitals and the group’s ability to be a sustainable business that 
consistently creates, protects and minimises the erosion of value for all stakeholders.

Identifying our material matters is a groupwide responsibility and requires input from all business 
units and divisions, an assessment of the risks and opportunities in our operating environment and 
input and feedback from all our stakeholders. Our material matters, as described on pages 41 to 51, 
influence our group’s strategy, inform the evolution of our business model, our long-term business 
strategies as well as our short-, medium- and long-term targets. 

Our Group Exco and the Nedbank Group Board approve these material matters as part of our 
business planning. These material matters are assessed continuously to ensure that our strategy 
remains relevant in an evolving operating environment. The Covid-19 pandemic that emerged in  
SA during 2020 continues to impact all our material matters.

How do we think about  
value creation, 
preservation and 
erosion?
Value creation, preservation 
and erosion are the 
consequences of how we apply 
and leverage our capitals as 
part of our strategy execution 
and are evident in how these 
capitals change over time, our 
financial performance and 
the outputs and outcomes 
for all stakeholders. Our value 
creation and preservation 
processes are embedded in our 
purpose (page 16), described 
as part of our business model 
on pages 11 to 13, and are 
integrated into the way we 
think and make decisions. In 
our report, we use the icons 
below to denote value creation, 
preservation and erosion:

What process do we follow to complete our integrated report?
The 2021 Integrated Report is prepared from Group Exco and board discussions, minutes, 
decisions and approvals (reflecting the group’s integrated thinking) as well as internal and external 
reporting information as required by the International <IR> Framework (2021). A cross-functional 
team, led by the Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and representing various clusters and subject 
matter experts across the group, produces the content that appears in the integrated report with 
oversight from Group Exco and the board. The executive and boardmembers also contribute to the 
content. All members of Group Exco and the board are involved in the various approval processes, 
which are also supported by the oversight provided by independent assurance providers. The 
board provides final approval of the report – the Group Integrated Report Approval Committee 
(which has delegated authority from the board) provides final sign-off for publication.

Which reporting frameworks do we adhere to?
Our integrated reporting is guided by the principles and requirements of the International <IR> 
Framework (2021), IFRS and the King Code of Governance Principles for South Africa (King IV),  
and is in accordance with the ‘core’ option of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. As a 
South African bank and a company listed on the JSE, we align with the JSE Listings Requirements, 
the South African Companies Act, 71 of 2008, and the Banks Act, 94 of 1990. More recently, we 
have adopted the disclosure recommendations of the TCFD.

How do we ensure the integrity of our report?
The board ensures the integrity of the integrated report through our integrated reporting process, 
the various approvals and sign-offs by Group Exco and the board, and relies on our Coordinated 
Assurance Model, overseen by the Group Audit Committee, that assesses and assures various 
aspects of our business operations and reporting. These assurances are provided by management 
and the board through rigorous internal reporting governed by the group’s enterprisewide  
risk management framework (ERMF), internal audit and independent external sources and  
service providers. 

  Value creation

01 Our purpose 02 Integrated thinking 03 Integrated reporting process

Our integrated report is the outcome of a groupwide reporting process. The process is governed by the board, led by the Group Executive Committee (Group Exco), assured 
through our Coordinated Assurance Model and delivered through groupwide collaboration. Our integrated-thinking approach to decision-making, management and reporting 
enables us to create and preserve value as we fulfil our purpose to use our financial expertise to do good for individuals, families, businesses and society.

Our 2021
Integrated 
Report

Identify issues that have the potential to impact our 
sustainability and create, preserve or erode value for our 
stakeholders.

Prioritise those with the greatest relevance in our operating 
context as material matters.

Apply and validate the material matters to inform our strategy, 
our six capitals and targets.

Assess continually to ensure our strategy remains relevant.

Reporting period
This report covers the year 1 January to 31 December 2021. Any material events after this 
date and up to the board approval date of 19 April 2022 have also been included.

Operating businesses
We report on the primary activities of the group, our business clusters, key support areas 
and subsidiaries in our African and international operations.

Financial and non-financial reporting
In line with the concept of double materiality, our integrated report extends beyond financial 
reporting and includes non-financial performance, opportunities, risks and outcomes 
attributable to or associated with our key stakeholders, which have a significant influence 
on our ability to create and preserve value sustainably, while minimising value erosion.

Targets and strategy
We provide insight into the group’s future strategy and financial and non-financial targets 
for the short, medium (two to three years) and long term (five years or more).

Coordinated assurance
Our Coordinated Assurance Model integrates and aligns risk, audit and compliance 
functions and assurance activities. This enables an effective internal control environment 
across the group with assurance focused on critical risk exposures supporting the integrity 
of information used in internal decision-making and reporting to external stakeholders.

Our 2021 annual financial statements were assured by our joint external auditors, 
Ernst & Young Inc (EY) and Deloitte & Touche (Deloitte), limited assurance on selected 
sustainability information was provided by Deloitte, and Mosela Rating Agency provided 
limited assurance on our application of the Amended Financial Sector Code (FSC) and the 
group’s BBBEE status. We have indicated the level of assurance provided on pages 72, 73, 
91 and 92 and included the Independent Assurance Providers’ Limited Assurance Report 
on Selected Sustainability Information on pages 103 to 104.

Governance and risk management
We have integrated our governance and risk management principles, practices and 
outcomes throughout our integrated report. In addition, specific board committee reports 
are placed in the relevant sections given the integrated nature of governance. 

Targeted readers
This report is intended to address the information requirements of long-term investors (our 
equity shareholders, bondholders, debt providers and prospective investors), but we also 
present information relevant to how we create, preserve and minimise the erosion of value 
for other key stakeholders, including our employees, clients, regulators and society.

SDGs and ESG reporting
We report on the sustainable-development actions and investments we 
have made in support of purpose-led business and our contribution to 
the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

8Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



The large South African banks remained well 
capitalised and liquid through the Covid-19 crisis, 
with key ratios well above minimum regulatory 
levels, while profitability metrics improved 
substantially in 2021.
In 2021 South African bank earnings increased from the 2020 lows and, 
as a result, return on equity (ROE) metrics improved materially. Some 
SA banks have increased their ROE to above cost of equity (COE) of 
around 14% to 15%. While cost-to-income ratios are generally above 
50%, they are expected to trend lower from current levels over time as

As a financial services provider, we are 
deeply connected to the environment 
we operate in and the societies we 
serve. Our ability to create and protect 
value is dependent on our relationships, 
our activities and the contributions we 
make to our stakeholders. By providing 
for their needs and meeting their 
expectations, we create and protect 
value for our stakeholders and for 
Nedbank, while looking to minimise 
value erosion.

development and training, solid progress on transformation 
metrics and a low attrition level of 9,3%, while 70 employees

The quality of the relationship with the investment community was 
assessed in 2021 by taking into account, among other things, the 
benefits to shareholders of a significantly improved financial 
performance and a balance sheet that is stronger than before the 
Covid-19 pandemic, relative share price outperformance versus the 
South African Bank Index, resuming dividend payments, independent 
reporting and financial communication awards and top-tier ESG ratings. 

The quality of the relationship with our regulators was assessed 
in 2021 taking into account, among other things, our alignment 
with regulatory requirements and remedial action where required, 
offset by fines that were paid.

During 2021 we maintained strong relationships with the 
communities that we serve and key civil society organisations. 
The quality of our relationship is informed by, among other 
things, our contributions towards a thriving society and healthy 
environment, as well as independent metrics such as Salesforce 
Social Studio banking industry social-media sentiment, where 
Nedbank ranked as second in the industry.

Our success depends on the degree to which we deliver value to society and it is therefore important to understand our role in society and how society can be different and better because 
Nedbank is a part of it. Banks play a crucial role in facilitating economic activity and enabling sustainable growth and development by moving capital from where it is to where it is required. 
A deep understanding of one’s purpose guides strategy and decision-making in this regard and should result in an optimal balance between long-term value creation and short-term outcomes.

Delivering value by delivering on our purpose

Our employees are key to making 
Nedbank a great place to bank 
and work. Motivated and skilled 
employees, together with efficient, 
innovative and value-creating 
solutions, services and operations, 
offer value to our clients. Employees, 
as part of society, contribute 
materially to the communities in 
which they live and work.

Our clients are our largest source of 
deposits, which enable us to fund 
lending activities. Gaining more 
clients and deepening existing 
relationships result in greater 
revenue growth, while responsible 
banking practices and world-class 
risk management mitigate value 
destruction.

Employees

Clients

A strong and profitable business enables continued investment 
in our employees and operations, which in turn creates value for 
our clients, shareholders and society at large. Trust is core to our 
relationships and to creating and preserving value.

Nedbank Group

Value is created and preserved through … 
• employment opportunities in the countries in which 

we operate; 
• rewarding employees for the value they add; 
• embracing flexible working practices; 
• encouraging our employees to embrace technological 

changes, further their careers and improve our 
services and products; and 

• contributing to the transformation towards a more 
inclusive society through employment equity and 
gender equality.

Value is created and preserved through … 
• safeguarding deposits, investments and wealth, while 

growing returns; 
• providing credit in a responsible manner that enables 

wealth creation, sustainable development and job 
creation in line with the SDGs; 

• supporting clients through the Covid-19 pandemic; 
• facilitating transactions that are the backbone of 

economic value exchange; 
• enabling financial inclusion by offering unbanked 

clients access to affordable products; 
• providing financial education and advice; and 
• developing innovative solutions that meet our clients’ 

specific needs.

We embrace our role in society as 
an active contributor to building 
a thriving society and can do this 
only with engaged communities 
that have the same values.

Society Value is created and preserved through … 
• transforming economies, the environment and society 

positively through our lending and investment activities, which 
are aligned with the SDGs; 

• playing a meaningful role in the broader society as a procurer 
and consumer of goods and services; and 

• making a difference through our partnerships and corporate 
social investment (CSI) activities.

Regulation reduces systemic risk and 
promotes the healthy functioning of an 
economy in which all stakeholders prosper. 
Good governance and compliance support 
client and investor confidence in Nedbank. 
We have a responsibility to comply fully  
with the regulations of the countries in  
which we operate.

Regulators Value is created and preserved through … 
• embracing sustainable banking practices and regulatory 

compliance, which enable a safe and stable banking system 
and a thriving society; and 

• working closely with regulators during times of crisis.

The tax we pay and investments in 
government and public sector bonds are 
imperative for the economic and social 
development of the countries in which  
we operate.

Government Value is created and preserved through … 
• contributing meaningfully to government budgets through our 

own corporate taxes and employees paying personal taxes; and 
• investing in government and public sector bonds as required by 

prudential regulation, thereby partially supporting the funding 
needs of government.

The financial capital we source from 
our equity and debt investors and our 
retained earnings enable business 
continuity and growth, including 
strategic investments.

Shareholders Value is created and preserved through … 
• increasing NAV, returns, dividends and share price; 
• maintaining a strong balance sheet to protect against 

downside risk (as was evident during the Covid-19 pandemic); 
• investing in and growing our client franchises and our people 

sustainably;  
• following good ESG practices that ensure a sustainable 

business for the long term; and
• operating within our risk appetite.

Reflections from our Chairperson

Our long-term sustainability and success are contingent on the degree to 
which we deliver value to society. Through the considered development and 
delivery of products and services that satisfy societal needs, and through 
our own operations, we aim to play our part to enable a thriving society, 
create long-term value and maintain trust. This is particularly important in 
the current context of SA as well as the broader African continent.

Mpho Makwana, Chairperson

SA, its people and its companies, proved remarkably 
resilient, managing to move the economy back to 
close to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, 
despite absorbing multiple and repeated health, 
societal and economic shocks over the past two years. 
The economic recovery, 
which started in the second 
half of 2020 and continued 
throughout 2021, was 
underpinned by a strong 
global rebound driven by a 
surge in demand for goods, 
which fuelled a strong rally 
in international commodity prices. Although the 
positive external position and terms of trade provided 
a significant boost to the recovery, domestic demand 
also improved, albeit regularly disrupted by each 
successive wave of Covid-19 infections and related 
economic lockdowns. Consumer spending grew year 
on year, buoyed by low interest rates, but in stark 
contrast the unemployment rate continued to climb 
to an alarming height, reaching a record high of 34,9% 
in the third quarter and reminding us that the most 
vulnerable in society have been most impacted by  
the pandemic. 

Sub-Saharan African economies generally benefited from favourable 
commodity prices and firm global demand, while the relaxation of 
Covid-19 containment measures facilitated the recovery of activity. 
The global economy also demonstrated significant resilience through 
the pandemic, bouncing back faster than expected. Financial market 
conditions also improved in 2021 while equity markets rallied.

Although it may be too soon to tell what the impact of the recent 
Russian invasion of Ukraine would be, there will likely be lasting 
implications for geopolitics as well as commodities, energy policy and 
the energy transition into the future.

Economic stability
Sadly, July 2021 saw violent civil unrest in KwaZulu-Natal and parts 
of Gauteng in July, which had a devastating impact on South Africans 
and our economy as well as our attractiveness as an investment 
destination. Our primary focus during this time was to ensure 
the safety of our employees and clients. Gratefully, none of our 
employees were injured although we suffered some damage to our 
branch and ATM networks. Given the psychological and physical 
impact, as a responsible corporate citizen we increased our focus 
on providing counselling services to traumatised employees and 
families, and Nedbankers came together to source and deliver more 
than 106 tonnes of food parcels to our colleagues, their families and 
their communities in the affected areas. 

Over the past few years the 
world has experienced a level 
of disruption and business 
risk never seen before as the 
Covid-19 pandemic became 
central to everything we 
do. The pandemic forced 
a short-term focus on 
immediate operations and a 
focus (rightly so) on survival 
for both individuals and 
businesses. 
The pandemic also highlighted the 
vulnerabilities and interconnectedness of 
the current global system as well as the 
vulnerabilities of many parts of our society. 
At the same time, this has encouraged  
new ways of operating and opened new 
markets and opportunities to respond 
to these issues in a strategic and more 
responsible manner.

Record high unemployment levels and poverty in SA combined with 
political contestation increases the risks of new waves of riots and 
looting. Business cannot abandon its role of providing constructive 
activism. Our role is to be a partner, not a bystander, in the success of 
the countries where we operate. The accelerated implementation of 
structural economic reform remains key to SA’s longer-term prospects. 
Now, more than ever, individual South Africans, business and labour 
need to work together to help the government in overcoming the 
obstacles that lie ahead of us.

Focus on environmental, social and 
governance imperatives
While ESG principles have come to 
dominate the global investment arena 
in recent years, there still seems to be a 
widespread misperception that these are 
three separate imperatives. In reality, it is 
not possible to separate the impact that 
humankind’s actions are having on the 
environment from those felt by society, 
nor is it possible to practise good governance in isolation from the 
two other vital considerations.

Nedbank is often anecdotally known as SA’s ‘green bank’, thanks to 
our established reputation for demonstrating a strong, integrated 
environmental- and social-sustainability commitment over the 
years. This integrated sustainability philosophy, which underpins the 
fulfilment of our purpose of using our financial expertise to do good 
for individuals, families, businesses and society, has informed our 
business strategies and our societal-upliftment and development 
commitments for a number of decades. The ‘good’ in our purpose 
represents the group’s understanding of, and commitment to, the 
need for systemic solutions to the challenges facing society, with 
many of the most pressing of these challenges being created or 
exacerbated by climate change. 

In April 2021 we announced the adoption of a market-leading Energy 
Policy designed to guide our redirecting of investment towards 
cleaner energy alternatives and outline our commitment, over time, 
to aligning our business strategy, policies, mandates and incentives 
with the Paris Agreement. As outlined in our Energy Policy, we will 

scale up our market-leading commitment towards the fast-growing 
renewable-energy sector to support a just transition to cleaner energy. 

We continued to focus on advancing our transformation agenda 
towards a more inclusive society. For the fourth consecutive year 
Nedbank achieved a level 1 BBBEE contributor status for 2021 under 
the Amended FSC. Pleasingly, female representation at board level 
improved to 28%.

Notwithstanding ongoing and proactive 
engagement with shareholders in the 
context of the difficult and unusual Covid-19 
environment, we were disappointed with 
the 66% vote of support for the group’s 
remuneration policy at the May 2021 AGM, 
this slightly below the 75% JSE threshold, 
while the remuneration implementation 
vote was at 80%. The Remuneration Committee has considered the 
feedback and made suitable changes to the 2022 policy, in particular 
shifting back to having 100% of executive long-term incentive awards 
subject to performance conditions as we emerge from the Covid-19 
environment. With our increased focus on ESG, we have incorporated 
these factors into individual executive performance goal commitment 
contracts as well as introduced selected ‘ES’ deliverables into the 
performance conditions of the group’s long-term incentives, with the 
‘G’ covered by malus and clawback.

People-centred
Nedbank’s people-centred culture was highlighted in its response 
and support of the workforce during the unprecedented context of 
the pandemic. Ongoing group executive engagements, surveys and 
other interactive communication channels provided information to 
ensure a timeous response to various matters including mental health, 
grief and loss, as well as addressing Covid-19 and vaccination myths. 
Support was given with the implementation of enabling policies, while 
the resilience of our workforce was built through extensive well-being 
programmes and learning solutions. 

Investing in technology
There is no doubt that there is a significant transition taking place 
in global banking with regard to digitisation. At Nedbank, we have 

invested in developing key technological and operational capabilities 
that have enabled a sound platform for competitive advantage in the 
coming years. The technology investments that we have made drive 
improved client experiences as well as productivity improvements 
through digitised services and process efficiencies within our TOM 
programme and drive our SPT strategy for selected market share 
growth and easier cross-sell through digitised products and sales 
capabilities. The board is satisfied with the progress made on the  
2023 strategic and financial targets and the progress the 
technological investments have yielded in delivering market- 
leading client experiences and improved efficiency measures.

Zero tolerance for corruption
Kleptocracy is a global challenge. Given their role in the economy, 
banks and financial services institutions across the globe often find 
themselves entangled with offboarding clients and dealing with 
onerous reporting obligations as well as with past transactions that 
need to be reviewed, sometimes with regulatory and legal implications. 

The board has taken careful note of the Zondo Commission’s report 
and highlights that, based on our review of the report, no adverse 
findings have been made against Nedbank. Part 1 of the report 
recommended further investigation of certain transactions involving 
Nedbank where Regiments Capital acted as client advisors in the 
period 2009 to 2011. These investigations have been ongoing for 
some time and Nedbank has been cooperating fully with same. The 
Zondo Commission ran out of time before submitting Part 1 of the 
report to the Presidency, and as a result and as stated in the report 
itself, Nedbank has not yet had an opportunity to be heard on certain 
matters dealt with in the report. We remain firmly of the view that 
there has been no wrongdoing on the part of Nedbank. The board 
and management commissioned detailed legally privileged internal 
and independent external reviews of the transactions, which allowed 
the Nedbank Board to conclude that Nedbank acted as a reasonable 
banker and had at no time acted unlawfully. 

We will continue to cooperate fully with any investigations undertaken 
by the appropriate authorities. We reiterate that we have zero 
tolerance for kleptocracy and corruption, and we expect all our 
stakeholders, including our clients, service providers and employees, 
to conduct themselves ethically and with integrity.

A tribute to Vassi Naidoo
The life of Vassi Naidoo was a celebration of a uniquely South African  
success story. He was one of a kind and truly one of the very best.

Vassi rose from a challenging background in apartheid SA to qualify 
as a chartered accountant at Deloitte in 1979, before becoming the 
CEO of Deloitte Southern Africa in 1998, making him the first black 
CEO of a ‘big four’ accounting firm in SA. After serving for two terms, 
he became the deputy chair of Deloitte UK in London and retired in 
2014 after 37 years with the firm.

He was appointed to the Nedbank Group and Nedbank Limited Boards 
in May 2015 as non-executive chairperson, a position he held until his 
passing at the age of 66. He had been a past non-executive director of 
Old Mutual Plc, Old Mutual Group Holdings and Old Mutual Limited.

Vassi was a chartered director, and a member of the Institute of 
Directors in South Africa, the South African Institute of Chartered 
Accountants (Saica) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
in England and Wales. In 2011 he was awarded honorary life 
membership of Saica for his contribution to the development of the 
accounting profession in SA. He was also a professor of practice in 
the department of accountancy at the University of Johannesburg.

He was a trailblazer and a true patriot, passionate about SA and the 
role its business leaders should play in contributing to its success. In 
this context he played a key role in the creation of the CEO Initiative 
as a vehicle to contribute to changing the fortunes of our country for 
the better.

At Nedbank he led the board with integrity and passion, and loved our 
Nedbank brand and what it stood for. Vassi drove the formalisation 
of Nedbank’s purpose or ‘north star’ – that of using our financial 
expertise to do good for individuals, families, businesses and society. 
The YES initiative was close to his heart, and he always reminded 
recruits from a similar background of the importance of education, 
hard work and the opportunities that lay ahead.

His enduring legacy remains in all of us.

Appreciation
Raymond Albert Kroc built a globally successful business, 
McDonald’s, based on the mantra ‘None of us is as good as all of 
us’. Guided by our corporate purpose to use our financial expertise 
to do good for individuals, families, businesses and society, we 
have done well for the common good of our business and all our 
stakeholders. I am humbled and grateful for the 27 303 Nedbank 
employees who continue to serve our clients and do great things. 
Thank you to my fellow boardmembers and Chief Executive (CE), 
Mike Brown, for his leadership during this unprecedented time. 

In line with the board’s succession process, the search for a 
new chairperson will commence soon and we aim to conclude 
this process well in advance of my retirement from the board in 
May 2023. We welcome Phumzile Langeni to the boards and look 
forward to her valuable contribution, given her experience in the 
areas of commerce, financial services and mining and resources.

We continued to lose colleagues, loved ones and friends to 
Covid-19 in 2021. Our deepest sympathies to our employees, clients 
and stakeholders who lost loved ones in this period. Unfortunately, 
2021 also saw the death of our former Chairperson Vassi Naidoo 
after a long battle with cancer. Vassi loved his time at Nedbank and 
we continue to miss him dearly. I know the prayers of the entire 
Nedbank family are with his wife, Sheila, and his family. 

Kintsugi is the centuries-old Japanese art of fixing broken pottery 
with a special lacquer dusted with powdered gold, silver or platinum. 
Instead of discarding treasures when they become broken, they 
are repaired with jewel-like metal. While they may have once been 
broken or weakened by an event, they are now strengthened and 
more valuable because of their repair. This carries a message of 
resilience. History shows that in times of disruption, resilience 
depends on adaptability and decisiveness. The foundations of 
future growth are often laid as societies respond to the weaknesses 
that crises expose. As we turn our focus to an inclusive-growth 
agenda, I am confident that a resilient and growing Nedbank is well 
placed to lead as it adapts to this changing, uncertain future.

Governance at Nedbank

Compliance Board governance philosophy

Nedbank is under a statutory duty in terms 
of the Companies Act, Banks Act, King 
IV and the JSE Listings Requirements to 
comply with regulation, and proactively 
monitor and assess regulatory 
developments to determine their 
applicability and impact on the group.  

This proactive approach to regulatory 
developments demonstrates Nedbank’s 
commitment to implementing appropriate 
controls to ensure compliance with the 
ever-expanding regulatory landscape, 
thereby gaining stakeholder confidence, 
trust and satisfaction and also ensuring 
actions are taken to mitigate exposure to 
reputational, financial and other regulatory 
risks. Regulatory developments and the 
state of compliance are reported on and 
monitored by the DAC, being one of the 
board committees established in terms of 
the Banks Act.

Nedbank’s governance is established by the tone set at 
the top through purpose-driven leadership by the board 
and management, and the values and behaviours expected 
from all employees in the organisation. Our top leadership 
continues to drive and enable new leadership mindsets and 
capabilities required to manage and thrive in an agile, digital, 
and disruptive environment.

The board and group executive strive to create maximum 
shared value by delivering on our purpose of using our financial 
expertise to do good and through our strategic growth drivers. 
We ensure relevance and sustainability of our business model 
by monitoring the macro environment, the availability and 
quality of capital inputs, and stakeholder needs, all of which 
inform the strategy of the group.

   
We provide detailed disclosure on the application status of the 
King IV principles in our Governance Review available online as 
part of the 2021 Governance Report at nedbankgroup.co.za.

Nedbank is committed to the highest standards of governance, 
ethics and integrity. We embrace world-class banking practices 
and robust institutional governance and risk frameworks to ensure 
our banking services are secure and stable. We review these 
practices and frameworks on an ongoing basis, being mindful of 
the dynamic landscape in which we operate, which is influenced by, 
among other factors, health and economic changes (such as the 
impact of the Covid-19 pandemic), cultural shifts in the workplace, 
digital trends such as artificial intelligence, geopolitics, enhanced 
data safety and security requirements, and climate change risks, 
to ensure that we act in the best interest of all our stakeholders.

In particular, we acknowledge the interdependent relationship 
between Nedbank and its stakeholders, and we adopt a 
stakeholder-inclusive approach that balances the needs, interests 
and expectations of stakeholders in the best interests of the 
organisation over time.

Banks are expected to adapt to regulatory changes quickly, which 
means we have to entrench good governance practices while 
retaining the flexibility to respond proactively to the fast-changing 
regulatory environment. However, governance within the Nedbank 
Group entails far more than legislative compliance and best-
practice principles. We believe that good governance can contribute 
to living our values through enhanced accountability, strong risk  
and performance management, transparency and ethical and 
effective leadership.

The board’s governance oversight is guided by its commitment to 
its responsibilities and governance objectives achieved through the 
application of the principles and practices as articulated in King IV.

business risk, people and operational risk, 
liquidity risk, credit risk and capital risk (top 
five risks), the focus shifted in 2021 to reflect 
the management of residual Covid-19-related 
risks and new emerging risks in a new normal. 

In 2021, the board continued to receive 
updates on how clients and suppliers were 
managing through the pandemic, and 
monitored actions to ensure the health and 
safety of the group’s employees and other 
stakeholders as further waves of Covid-19 
emerged. Continued focus was placed on 
business risk (in particular the macroeconomic 
impact and recovery), credit risk (as clients 
managed their way through the ongoing 
impact of lockdowns) and capital risk. 
Strategic execution and cyberrisk moved back 

Key board focus areas

1  Our response to the Covid-19 pandemic – resilience and transition

In line with external developments in the operating environment and the board priorities that we identified and communicated in our 2020 
Integrated Report, the following five areas received heightened focus in 2021:

As the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in 2020, 
the board worked closely with management 
in pivoting the group’s strategy to ‘Resilience’ 
(the immediate focus as we managed the 
crisis) followed by ‘Transition’ (as we enabled 
recovery and reintegration) and ‘Reimagine’ 
(strategising for value creation in a new 
normal). During times of crisis, the role of the 
board is important as it provides appropriate 
guidance and oversight, ensuring support 
to stakeholders (protecting value and 
minimising value erosion) while remaining 
aligned with shifts and pivots that are 
required in strategy (creating value). 

After the board oversaw the group’s strategic 
pivot and responses relating to the Covid-19 
pandemic in 2020, including a focus on

into the group’s top five risks as digital usage 
and penetration accelerated.  

Resource allocation shifts, that were initiated 
in 2020, resulted in a reduction in liquidity, 
capital and credit risks. At the end of 2021, 
not only did all the group’s resilience metrics 
strengthen to levels higher than prior to the 
crisis (2019), today Nedbank is in a much 
stronger position to grow and expand off 
even stronger foundations. Shifts in capital 
allocation to technology and digital innovation 
continued. The focus for 2022 and beyond is 
on business, strategic execution, credit, cyber-
and people risks. 

 Read more about our top 10 risks on pages 52 to 55.

23Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



3 Succession planning
Succession planning for boardmembers is one of the most important 
responsibilities of the board as a whole, assisted by the Directors’ Affairs 
Committee (DAC). The DAC continuously monitors the split between executive, 
non-executive and independent directors as well as the skills, experience and 
tenure of boardmembers as shown on page 27. 

One of the focus areas of the DAC is to ensure that, when directors are reaching 
tenure and retirement age, board continuity is ensured through active succession 
planning that takes into account any changes to the skills needed on the board in 
terms of the group’s strategic focus areas.

The group’s then-Chairperson, Vassi Naidoo, was granted medical leave of 
absence in January 2021 and Mpho Makwana stepped in as Acting Chairperson. 
On 28 September 2021, shareholders were advised of the passing of Vassi Naidoo, 
and Mpho Makwana was appointed as Non-executive Chairperson of the board on 
2 December 2021. Although Mpho had been on the Nedbank Group Board for more 
than nine years, the board believed that continuity during this time was paramount 
and so his tenure was extended with his appointment as Non-executive Chairperson.

Good progress is being made on board succession planning, including for the role of 
Chairperson, with the aim to appoint a new Chairperson at the AGM in 2023. 

4 Reputational matters
Our ethics philosophy requires a relationship of trust with our internal and external 
stakeholders, in which we demonstrably act with integrity. We continue to have zero 
tolerance for corruption, and we expect all of our stakeholders, including our clients, 
service providers and employees, to conduct themselves ethically and with integrity. 

As indicated in our 2020 Integrated Report, we support, and will continue to support 
and cooperate with, the relevant authorities and commissions on reputational 
matters relating to our historic interactions with Regiments Capital. Deep dives and 
lessons-learnt exercises continue to be top of mind for the board.

The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption 
and Fraud in the Public Sector including Organs of State chaired by the 
then-Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo (Zondo Commission) was established in 
January 2018 by former President Jacob Zuma. Part 1 of the report was published 
on 4 January 2022. Part 2 was published on 1 February 2022. Part 3 was published 
on 1 March 2022. Subsequent to a further extension, granted by the High Court on 
23 February 2022, it is anticipated that the final part of the report will be published 
on 30 April 2022. The President consequently has four months from the end of 
April 2022 to report to Parliament on his implementation plan.

2 Our reimagine strategy – ensuring value creation in a new normal
Key approvals included resource allocation to technology 
initiatives and ongoing digital innovations (R2bn annual IT 
cash flow spend), ongoing expansion into beyond-banking 
activities such as Avo (which is a super app platform 
enabling clients to buy essential products and services 
online), optimisation of various capitals under TOM 2.0 as 
both the group’s real estate (branches and own offices 
– manufactured capital) and number of employees are 
reduced in a more digital world, and increase in market 
share of selected asset classes (as we aim to grow our 
transactional banking franchise and deposit base under 
SPT 2.0).

CASE  
IN POINT

Integrated thinking 
in action

Integrated thinking and decision-making at 
Nedbank is best illustrated in the trade-offs 
made between the group’s various capitals 
as discussed on pages 70 and 71. Nedbank 
management and the board consider the 
creation, preservation and erosion of value for 
all stakeholders over the short, medium and long 
term. Key examples of integrated thinking in 
action include the following:

• Short-term profitability versus balance 
sheet strength during the Covid-19 crisis.

• Digital versus traditional banking.

•  Transitioning towards the workforce of  
the future.

•  Portfolio tilt in line with our purpose and  
the SDGs.

In 2021 the board continued its regular strategic 
discussions at board and committee meetings, 
as well as during its annual board and Group Exco 
strategy engagement in May 2021. The board 
debated and provided input into the group’s 
reimagine strategy, before signing off the three-year 
business plan, financial targets and relevant risk 
appetites in November 2021, including decisions 
around resource allocation involving the group’s 
various capitals. 

The group’s new strategy, communicated to investors 
for the first time in the 2020 Integrated Report, 
incorporates three value drivers (growth, productivity, 
and risk and capital management) that aim to create 
value as we seek to meet our medium-term targets 
(2023). These targets are aimed at increases in diluted 
headline earnings per share (DHEPS), ROE, the cost-
to-income ratio and NPS as shown on page 16. Value 
creation is enabled by five strategic value unlocks: 
Delivering market-leading client solutions; disruptive 
market activities; focusing on areas that create value 
(SPT 2.0); driving efficient execution (TOM 2.0); and 
creating positive impacts. Read more about our 
strategy (value unlocks) on pages 56 and 67.

In 2021 the board specifically focused on:

• delivery of the group’s Managed Evolution 
(ME) technology strategy (including 
external benchmarking of the progress and 
achievements to date); 

• enterprise agility through our Target 
Operating Model (TOM) 2.0; 

• growing the transactional banking franchise 
through strategic portfolio tilt (SPT) 2.0; and

• shifts in the group’s Human Capital Strategy 
as we align with the more digital world and 
embrace flexible work practices.

Key board focus areas continued

24Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



Key board focus areas continued

Nedbank was mentioned in Part 1 and Part 2. 
Nedbank was not mentioned in Part 3.  The 
transactions covered in Part 1 [Airports Company 
South Africa (Acsa)] and Part 2 (Transnet) are known 
to Nedbank and have been the subject of detailed 
internal and independent external legally privileged 
reviews. Based on these legally privileged reviews, 
which covered Nedbank’s dealings with Regiments 
and its clients (the affected counterparties), the 
Nedbank Board concluded that Nedbank acted 
as a reasonable banker and had at no time acted 
unlawfully. At the time of these transactions 
Nedbank had no information indicating that the 
internal governance process of certain companies, 
or key role players had been compromised. This has 
subsequently become clear through investigative 
journalism and processes like the Zondo Commission. 

While Part 1 made no findings against Nedbank, it 
did recommend further investigation of Nedbank’s 
role in respect of certain Acsa transactions 
concluded in 2009–2011. Part 2 makes no such 
recommendations in respect of Nedbank. Notably, 
Part 1 states that the Zondo Commission had 
intended to hear evidence from Nedbank on the 
Acsa transactions but acknowledged that it ran out 
of time and therefore had not obtained evidence on 
Nedbank’s version on these transactions. In respect 
of the Transnet transactions mentioned in Part 2, 
Nedbank made detailed submissions under oath to 
the Zondo Commission. Nedbank would welcome 
the full public disclosure of its submissions (subject 
to the further direction of the Zondo Commission).

We note and take very seriously the reputational 
risk to Nedbank as a consequence of being 
mentioned in the various reports. Nedbank will 
continue to cooperate fully with any further 
investigations undertaken by the appropriate 
authorities pursuant to the release of the final 
Zondo Commission Report.

5 Strengthening our response to climate change 

Nedbank Group has an excellent track record and strong credentials in leading the change 
required to address climate change, and our leadership in this area has been endorsed by the 
board over the past 30 years. Our sustainability journey continues to grow and mature, from 
being the first African bank to sign the Equator Principles in 2005 and the first African bank to 
become carbon-neutral in 2010, to being the first commercial bank to launch a renewable-energy 
bond on the JSE in 2019 and the first bank in Africa to raise green AT1 funding in 2021. The board 
acknowledges that, in context of the Paris Agreement and the rising impact of climate change, 
more needs to be done.

In 2021 we established a Group Climate Resilience Committee (GCRC) – a board committee focused 
on climate change and providing independent oversight of the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the Climate Risk Management Framework and the Social and Environmental Risk Framework in 
line with the Enterprisewide Risk Management Framework (ERMF), which includes key risks, key 
performance indicators, branding, market positioning and opportunities and strategy in relation to 
social, environmental and climate-related risks and opportunities. We also established a Climate 
Risk Committee (as a subcommittee of Group Exco), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, and a 
groupwide multidisciplinary Climate Task Team. Other key activities in the year included establishing 
a Climate Risk function within our Group Risk Cluster and initiatives aimed at upskilling the board, 
management, employees and clients on climate change matters. Other key decisions taken by the 
board in 2021 include approving Nedbank’s Energy Policy and approving climate scenarios set out in 
the 2021 Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).

As part of our journey as a purpose-led business, we are committed to playing a leading role 
in addressing climate change, and the risks and opportunities that it presents, in ways that are 
sensitive to the local socioeconomic context and climate vulnerability. Banks play a central role in 
driving sustainable socioeconomic development for the benefit of all stakeholders, by providing 
capital where it is needed most. Banks’ financing choices can serve to enable the necessary 
transition to a low-carbon economy and contribute to building climate resilience through the 
financing of adaptation measures.

Focus areas of the board 
in 2022
Many of the key focus

Our board profile 

The majority of Nedbank’s boardmembers 
are independent directors, which complies 
with King IV and global best-practice 
governance. The size of the Nedbank Board, 
at 14 members, is influenced by the demands 
of a large and complex banking industry. The 
size gives the board adequate membership 
for its 9 board committees, of which four are 
statutory, while maintaining adequate levels of 
independence.

Diversity –  
being relevant in a transforming society

Knowledge, skills and experience  –  
a well-diversified board that adds value to all aspects of the Nedbank group

Board tenure and experience  –  
a blend of experience and new insight

In a fast-transforming society, board 
diversity is important to remain 
relevant and sustainable. Studies 
have shown that diversity matters, 
as companies that embrace gender, 
race and ethnic diversity achieve 
better financial performance. 
Nedbank is committed to promoting 
diversity at board level, with 
diversity and inclusion being key 
considerations in our board selection 
processes. 

We strive for a transformed 
board that closely reflects the 
demographics of SA. Our diversity 
targets for black boardmembers and 
black women boardmembers have 
been satisfied. Our diversity targets 
for black executive boardmembers 
and black women executive 
boardmembers have not been met 
yet. Increasing gender and race 
diversity remains a key focus area of 
the board’s succession plan.

Banks and financial services companies need a broad range of skills to ensure 
and create value in the interests of all stakeholders. The board determines the 
required composition of skills in response to the rapidly changing environment 
and shifts in Nedbank’s own long-term strategy. Having the appropriate mix of 
skills and experience ensures that the board as a collective is well equipped to 
guide and drive the bank’s strategy into the future and thereby create value.

Over the past four years we have expanded and strengthened our board skills 
and experience specifically in retail and investment banking; other financial 
services such as insurance; large corporates; accounting and auditing; corporate 
governance; human resources; marketing; strategic planning; macroeconomic and 
public policy; mining, resources and infrastructure; climate change; IT innovation, 
digital and cyberresilience; and doing business in emerging economies. 

During 2021 the directors received comprehensive updates and training on 
various topics, which included economic and political matters, climate change, 
disruption amplified, anti-money-laundering, combating the financing of terrorism 
and sanctions, Covid-19 and the future, ESG and its link to pay and performance, 
human-centred design, cognitive technologies, distributed ledger, internal financial 
controls – updates on market trends, related-party-disclosure requirements, key 
takeover regulation panel elements and Competition Commission considerations, 
update on Covid-19 and its impact on societal (social) and ethics issues for 
consideration by Nedbank, update on SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation, and 
carbon accounting methodology.

which aims to increase members with expertise in areas such as legal, retail banking 
and complex accounting, will also look to replace the skills that will be lost with these 
retirements, including digital and technology, climate risk, large corporate, and HR 
and marketing. Increasing gender and race diversity remains a key focus area of the 
board’s succession plan.

The board of directors provides leadership and strategic guidance 
to safeguard stakeholder value creation within a framework of 
prudent and effective controls. This makes it possible to assess 
and manage risk to ensure long-term sustainable development and 
growth. The board has ultimate accountability and responsibility 
for the performance and affairs of the company and ensures that 
the group adheres to high standards of ethical behaviour.

The board committees assist the board in the discharge of its duties 
and responsibilities. Each board committee has formal written terms 
of reference that are reviewed annually and effectively delegated 
in respect of certain of the board’s responsibilities. These terms of 
reference are available at nedbankgroup.co.za. The board monitors 
these responsibilities to ensure effective coverage of and control 
over the operations of the group. Detailed reports from the chairs of 
the board and board committees are available in the group’s 2021 
Governance Report and can be accessed at nedbankgroup.co.za.

Interdependency of board committees
Following the constitution of the Group Climate Resilience Committee, 
the Nedbank Group Board has 9 formal board committees. Board 
committees report in detail on key discussions and activities at each 
Nedbank Group Board meeting, and the minutes of board committee 
meetings are also subsequently made available to all boardmembers.  
The Group Audit Committee receives regular feedback from the 
Group Information Technology Committee regarding the monitoring 
of the adequacy and effectiveness of the group’s information 
technology (IT) controls as well as new/emerging IT risks associated 
with the bank’s digital transformation journey, and from the Group 
Credit Committee regarding its oversight of the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the credit monitoring processes and systems. The 
Chairperson of the Group Risk and Capital Management Committee 
and the Group Remuneration Committee also meet separately to 
consider remuneration risks, and there is a formal process between 
the Group Remuneration Committee and the Group Transformation, 
Social and Ethics Committee in respect of the consideration of the 
ethics of remuneration.

The Group Related-party Transactions Committee (GRPTC) oversight 
was largely related to Nedbank’s relationship with Old Mutual and 
ensuring that related-party transactions were fair and in Nedbank’s 
best interests. Following Old Mutual’s unbundling of the majority of its 
strategic shareholding in Nedbank in November 2021, the GRPTC’s 
mandate has been fulfilled and the GRPTC was discontinued.

30Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



Other key areas of responsibility and oversight 

 More details on our approach to human rights and ethics are disclosed in our supplementary 2021 Governance Report available at nedbankgroup.co.za.

Ethics and human rights 

As a purpose-led and values-driven 
organisation, we are committed to do 
business responsibly and ethically. Our ethics 
philosophy envisages a relationship of trust 
with our internal and external stakeholders, 
and the required trust and conduct that 
underpins our ethics philosophy is established 
by, among other things, having a collaborative 
approach to ethical leadership, a commonly 
accepted and lived set of values, effective 
governance, effective risk and compliance 
management, and transparent and timeous 
communication with all stakeholders, 
including regulators and investors.

Strong leadership commitment is essential 
in building and maintaining an ethical culture. 
The Nedbank Board and the Group Executive 
Committee sets the tone at the top and leads 
the group ethically, effectively and responsibly 
within acceptable risk parameters. This is 
aligned with the King IV principle that ‘the 
governing body should lead ethically and 
effectively’ and formally constitutes one of 
the ‘board corporate governance objectives’ 
against which the board is measured annually.

A continued enhancement of Nedbank’s 
ethical culture and respect for human rights 
remain top of mind for our board and executive 
management, especially against the backdrop 
of state capture, the various commissions of 
inquiry, the release of the first three Zondo 
reports and ongoing reports of corporate 
failures across the world. In addition, due 
to material matters such as the Covid-19 
pandemic expediting the move toward 
increasing digitisation and new ways of work, 
a challenging macroeconomic environment, 
social unrest, increasing emphasis on treating 
clients fairly, climate change and the fight 

against corruption, there is a heightened 
focus on the effective management and 
implementation of ethics and human rights 
within the group. Our Employee Code of 
Ethics and Conduct provides Nedbank 
employees with practical guidelines on our 
rules and behaviour we expect in line with our 
values that should drive all our decisions and 
actions. The code also serves as our public 
commitment that we, as Nedbankers, will 
uphold the highest ethical standards. 

The board assumes ultimate 
responsibility for the group’s ethics 
performance and adherence to 
human rights principles. Nedbank 
has implemented a comprehensive 
governance structure which, among 
other things, gives effect to the 
responsibilities of the board in relation 
to ethics. This responsibility is delegated 
to executive management, which uses 
various tools and processes to drive 
ethical behaviour as part of maintaining 
a culture of ethics. 

These include but are not limited to the 
following: 

• Board ethics and human rights-related 
statements, and ad hoc declarations.

• A dedicated Ethics Office.
• A remuneration policy to ensure fair 

and responsible remuneration.
• Ethics and human rights codes, policies 

and frameworks.
• Biannual declarations by group, cluster 

and subsidiary executives on corporate 
governance and internal processes.

• Social and environmental management 
assessments and due diligence for 
clients.

• Supplier due diligences and the 
participation of the Ethics Office in high-
risk/high-value tenders. 

• Employee and supplier training and 
awareness-raising activities.

• Anonymous (external) and confidential 
internal channels for reporting unethical 
behaviour.

• Mechanisms to review and manage 
client and supplier relationships when 
necessary. 

• Quarterly meetings between the Group 
Chief Compliance Officer and the 
Chairperson of the Board on the state of 
ethics and human rights.

Key actions and initiatives undertaken in 
2021 included, but were not limited to, the 
following: 

• Development and implementation of a 
comprehensive groupwide ethics strategy 
and management plan.

• Enhancements to our human rights portfolio, 
including several key improvements to 
human rights policies and processes, with a 
particular focus on enhancing due diligence.

• Ethics and human rights training to 5 416 
employees (2020: 3 018).

• Employee acknowledgement of the 
Employee Code of Ethics and Conduct – 
totalled 77% (revised code launched in  
November 2021).

• Ethics Office participation as an independent 
observer in 10 high-risk/high-value tenders. 

• Ethics, human rights and governance-related 
training provided to 108 suppliers. 

• Employees dismissed on disciplinary matters 
relating to dishonesty and unethical conduct 
totalled 67 (2020: 148).

• Suspicious transactions reported to the Financial 
Intelligence Centre (FIC) totalled 18 873 
(2020: 14 701).

• Number of clients offboarded due to reputational 
risk assessments totalled 112 (2020: 32).

In 2021 we participated in a human rights 
assessment conducted by BankTrack, which focuses 
on large banks in the African region and aims to 
measure the performance of banks against the UN 
Guiding Principles. Nedbank achieved the second-
highest score overall and, notwithstanding this 
achievement, several key enhancements, such as 
a revised human rights in business statement and 
improvements to our human rights due diligence 
process for both clients and suppliers, have since 
been implemented as a result of our ongoing work 
and evolution in relation to our Human Rights 
Implementation Plan.

Fair and responsible remuneration

The board strives to ensure that remuneration is fair and 
transparent, promoting positive outcomes aligned with 
legitimate expectations of all stakeholders. Remuneration 
of executives and employees is linked to sustainable-value- 
creation objectives in line with the group’s strategy and is 
based on clear performance targets that have adequate 
stretch and are aligned with market benchmarking, at the 
same time being mindful of the wealth gap in SA.

In 2021 and 2022:

• In 2021 management received increases of around 3% on 
average and bargaining-unit employees 4% on average. In 
2022, management received increases of around 4% on 
average, and bargaining-unit employees 5,2% on average.

• After the STI pool decreased by 23% in 2019 and by a 
further 29,5% in 2020, it increased by 70,2% in 2021, 
reflecting the group’s improved financial performance as 
discussed on page 94.  

• In 2021 only 15% of the long-term incentives to Group 
Exco members awarded in 2018 vested as a result of the 
corporate performance targets being set prior to the onset 
of Covid-19. Similarly, only 16% of the 2019 awards vested 
in 2022 and 0% of the 2020 awards are expected to vest  
in 2023.

• The Group Remco was satisfied that the Equal Pay for 
Work of Equal Value analysis shows no systemic unfair pay 
differentials on race and gender.

• In addition to the inclusion of ESG considerations in individual 
executive performance goal commitment contracts (GCCs), 
the group introduced selected ES deliverables into the 
performance conditions of the group’s long-term incentives. 

• Notwithstanding ongoing and proactive engagement with 
shareholders, the board was disappointed with the 66% 
votes of support for the group’s Remuneration Policy at the 
May 2021 AGM, this being below the 75% JSE threshold. 
The high-level outcomes for 2021 and changes to the 
group’s Remuneration Policy are shown on page 96, with 
more details in our Remuneration Policy as part of the  
2021 Governance Report available at nedbankgroup.co.za.

Values and culture

Governance is supported by the 
tone at the top, the example 
the board and management set 
and the values and behaviours 
embraced by all employees in the 
organisation. 

The board has regular 
conversations about the group’s 
culture and values, particularly 
in the context of our Reimagine 
strategy, the new ways of work 
and the digital transformation 
of financial services. Our top 
leadership is driving and enabling 
new leadership mindsets and 
capabilities required to manage and 
thrive in an agile, digital, fast-paced, 
client-centred and competitive 
environment. Our People Promise, 
as shown on page 68, shows 
that the Nedbank culture is fully 
endorsed by the board. Recent 
culture shifts are positive, as 
evident in outcomes of leadership 
in digital innovation, being resilient 
and agile, and ongoing improved 
levels of client satisfaction scores.

32Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



Relationship with  
stakeholders 

The board continuously monitors 
the group’s relationship with its 
stakeholders and also engages directly 
with employees, clients, regulators, 
shareholders and other stakeholders 
from time to time. In addition to oversight 
at the Nedbank Group Board, employee 
and societal matters are dealt with at the 
GTSEC, reputational matters across all 
stakeholders at the DAC and regulatory 
matters at GRCMC and GAC. 

In 2021 the focus on the needs and 
expectations of stakeholders remained 
elevated given the ongoing impact of 
Covid-19. The actions taken by the group 
in support of all its stakeholders generally 
led to an improvement in the quality of 
relationships as shown below. This was 
evident in support for and improved 
levels of employee and client satisfaction, 
improved financial performance and 
resultant increase in share price and value 
drivers, support for suppliers and society, 
and working effectively with regulators.   

We continually engage with shareholders on 
ESG and strategic matters, enabling our board 
to exercise constructive influence, as and 
when appropriate, receive valuable feedback 
and protect the interests of our minority 
shareholders.

Nedbank Group’s eighth ESG shareholder 
roadshow in Q2 2021 was hosted virtually by 
Mpho Makwana (Acting Chairperson at the 
time), Errol Kruger (Independent Director 
and chairperson of our two board risk 
committees) given the significantly heightened 
risk environment, Stanley Subramoney 
(Independent Director and chairperson of 
our GAC), as well as Hubert Brody (Lead 
Independent Director and chairperson of 
our Group Remco). As in prior years, the 
overall response from shareholders was that 
Nedbank Group is highly regarded for its 
ESG practices and disclosures, the proactive 
nature of engaging on ESG matters, and always 
considering shareholder input. In 2021 the 
following key topics were discussed, with a 
focus on governance matters, with climate 
change as well as transformation and diversity 
two key items covered under the environmental 
and social aspects of ESG respectively: 

• Succession planning and board and 
leadership profile – Discussed the 
robustness of succession planning both at 
board and group executive level. Board skills 
and diversity were covered as disclosed in 
our 2020 Integrated Report as well as on 
pages 27 and 28. Succession is regarded as 
well executed at Nedbank, with compliments 
given for the seamless transition of CFO, CIB 
and NAR executive appointments in 2020. 

ESG matters – a sustainable Nedbank contributing to a sustainable environment and society

• Remuneration – Shareholders expressed 
appreciation for our not changing inflight 
schemes as a result of the impact of 
Covid-19 on financial performance and 
targets (building on Nedbank’s good 
remuneration track record over time). 
However, there were divergent views on 
Nedbank’s 2020 policy during the Covid-19 
pandemic and the Group Remco addressed 
shareholder concerns in 2022 as discussed 
on page 95.

• Reputational matters – In Q1 2021 
management engaged with shareholders 
on reputational matters that emerged 
in an amaBhungane article, and in the 
ESG roadshow the board responded to 
specific shareholder questions. This gave 
shareholders comfort that Nedbank acted 
lawfully, although reputational risk remains. 

• Dividends and capital – Discussions 
around the board’s thoughts with regard 
to future dividends and what comfortable 
capital levels would be were a focus. The 
group’s capital and dividend guidance and 
policy are discussed on pages 77 and 78.  

• Auditing – Nedbank’s approach and 
commitment to MAFR plans were well 
received, with EY appointed in 2019 
(having replaced KPMG). In line with this 
plan, Deloitte’s rotation will be finalised 
for our 2024 financial year, with an 
announcement expected to be made 
during H2 2022. 

• Climate change – Nedbank’s Energy Policy 
and inaugural TCFD Report were well 
received, and regarded as market-leading.

• Covid-19 crisis and risks – No issues were 
raised regarding how Nedbank managed 
through the crisis and the board was 
complimented for sound risk management 
practices across the group’s top 12 risks and 
the support provided to all key stakeholders 
during a difficult period.

• Transformation – Shareholders continue 
to drive for ongoing progress on African 
management representation (at executive 
and senior management levels), as well 
as female representation (at board level 
specifically). This remains a key focus of the 
board, with ongoing positive trends reported 
to date.

33Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



In 2021 The Board Practice, an international 
consulting company that specialises in board 
effectiveness evaluation, concluded an 
independent board effectiveness programme 
and presented the results of the evaluation 
to the board on 2 February 2022. Key 
observations included the following:

• Nedbank Group has a professional board 
that functioned well in challenging 
circumstances.

• From a board composition and operation 
perspective, the board is described as 
effective, with independent behaviour, 
focused on the health and success of 
Nedbank. The board fully discharges 
its duties and has a strong focus on and 
adherence to proper governance and 
ethics. The board is well balanced in terms 
of gender, culture and demographics. The 
board has been stress-tested through a 
series of challenges, including the Covid-19 
pandemic, the medical leave of absence 
by the former Chairperson and the issues 
around state capture.

• From a board leadership and structure 
perspective, the new Chairperson stepped 
quickly into the role. He is highly respected 
and experienced and manages the board 
meetings well, displaying strong skills in 
extracting the necessary contributions 
from boardmembers. The Chairperson has 
brought the board together as a team , 
having achieved a highly collaborative  
board culture.

• The Chief Executive is viewed as a good 
listener, warm, modest and well respected. 
A strong relationship exists between the 

new Chairperson and the Chief Executive, 
and the relationship between the board and 
Group Exco is effective and appropriate. 
The Chief Executive has built a culture of 
transparency and displays good leadership 
in executing on the strategy as agreed with 
the board.

• The board is comfortable with the number 
of committees and composition of 
members appointed to these committees. 
The committees are all effective and 
members display strong commitment to 
their roles. The committee reporting is at a 
high level with the right attention to detail 
for the board.

• Although the board meeting packs are 
still voluminous, they have improved in 
analysis and presentation, with an open 
and transparent approach adopted. Further 
improvements will assist the board in 
their preparation and understanding. The 
committee packs are still evolving and 
continuously improving.

• The virtual meetings held have been 
effective due to the high level of trust 
among boardmembers. All critical issues 
were dealt with effectively during the 
first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic; 
although there was a strong preference for 
physical meetings, the board was able to 
fully discharge its duties during this period. 

• The board has a well-balanced set of 
leadership skills available to conduct its 
work. The board was clear that issues 
around succession, strategy shaping, and 
execution were top of mind.

A more supportive operating 
environment
In 2021 the South African economy performed better than 
most forecasters expected on the back of a more supportive 
operating environment both for Nedbank and our clients. Off 
the low base in 2020 the economy rebounded to grow by 4,9%, 
due mainly to higher commodity prices, lower levels of lockdown 
restrictions and some positive developments on key reforms 
in SA. Retail credit demand benefited from low interest rates 
as well as the easing of lockdown levels, while corporate credit 
demand remained muted and excess cash, particularly in the 
commodity sector, was used largely to repay debt.

We are pleased, but not surprised, that after a volatile and 
difficult year for the South African banking sector in 2020, in 
2021 South African banks continued to demonstrate strong 
levels of resilience, remaining well capitalised, liquid and 
profitable and, as a result,  are able to play a strong role in 
supporting clients and the economy. We expect conditions 
in the South African banking industry to continue to improve 
into 2022, as growth in loans to households and companies 
is forecast to increase further, supported by the anticipated 
lower levels of Covid-19 restrictions resulting in an ongoing 
normalisation in economic activity and increased levels of 
investment activity, particularly in the energy and telecoms 

As we continue to 
emerge from the very 
challenging 2020 
period, I am immensely 
proud to report on 
what Nedbankers have 
achieved throughout 
the Covid-19 pandemic 
and that we have 
bounced back faster 
than we expected to. 
Over the past two years 
we have demonstrated 
our resilience, and the 
foundations of Nedbank 
and the South African 
banking system proved 
to be strong.

In my Chief Executive reflections last year, in the context of the Covid-19-
induced challenges of 2020, I made an analogy between the resilience 
of the fynbos plant in its ability to withstand fire and grow back and 
Nedbank’s strong foundations and ability to withstand severe conditions 
and then flourish once the environment has improved.

Mike Brown, Chief Executive

sectors. The downstream impacts of higher commodity prices 
should also support economic growth. Recent developments in 
Ukraine and Russia pose downside risks to global growth, and 
we join many around the globe in denouncing the unnecessary 
violence and loss of life and in calling for a speedy resolution to 
the conflict.

A strong financial performance 
in 2021
We delivered a strong financial 
performance in 2021 reflecting a faster-
than-expected rebound off a low 2020 
base. Full-year HE increased by 115% 
to R11,7bn, a significant improvement 
on the decline of 57% in 2020 but 
still 7% below 2019 levels, and basic 
earnings were up 224%. HE for the 
year was driven by significantly lower impairments, a higher net 
interest margin, a recovery in non-interest revenue (NIR) growth, 
disciplined expense management and a stronger financial 
performance from our associate investment in ETI. Key drivers 
of shareholder value continued on an upward trajectory, with 
NAV per share increasing by 11% and the group’s ROE improving 
to 12,5% as compared with the 6,2% reported in 2020, and we 
resumed dividend payments at 2,02 times cover for the full year,

with the final dividend being declared at 1,75 times cover, which 
was at the bottom end of our cover range, signalling confidence 
in our strong capital and liquidity positions to support ongoing 
client growth as well as growing dividend payments.

In addition to the strong growth in earnings, I think it’s important 
to shine a spotlight on our key balance sheet metrics that have 
now strengthened to above pre-Covid-19 crisis levels as we 
concluded the Resilience phase of our post-Covid-19 strategy 
pivot. Capital and liquidity ratios increased as reflected in our 
tier 1 capital ratio of 14,3% (December 2020: 12,1%), common 
equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 12,8% (December 2020: 10,9%), LCR 
of 128% (December 2020: 126%) and NSFR of 116% (December 
2020: 113%).

Excellent strategic and 
operational delivery
As Chief Executive, I am hugely grateful for the hard work 
of all 27 000 Nedbankers as we made excellent strategic 
and operational progress during a year when so many of our 
employees were still working from home as a result of Covid-19 
rules. Central to our strategy has been the complete refresh 
of the Nedbank IT stack to build a modern, agile, modular 
and digital IT stack that is a vital underpinning of future 
competitiveness. Investors will know 
we refer to this as the Managed 
Evolution (ME) and in 2021 we reached 
85% completion. These large IT 
programmes in banks are difficult to 
execute and deliver on time, on scope 
and on budget, and in 2021 we had an 
external benchmarking done on our 
ME by two global consulting firms with 
very pleasing outcomes. This has given us confidence in our 
ability to compete and win in digital financial services and has 
enabled us to confirm that the IT software asset on our balance 
sheet has peaked at around R9bn and the completion risk in 
respect of the balance of ME has decreased materially.

The revenue benefits of ME are evident in most of our digital 
metrics showing double-digit growth and the cost and 
productivity benefits are evident in TOM 2.0 benefits of R967m 
being realised ahead of schedule as we progress towards our 

target of R2,5bn by the end of 2023. This is in addition to the 
TOM 1.0 benefits of R2bn already achieved in 2020 as we shifted 
our IT build methodology from waterfall to agile and rolled out 
our Digital Fast Lane innovation capability.

Building on the ME foundations, our Avo super app platform 
play has made excellent progress in scaling up the number of 
registered clients and surpassed the one million user mark at the 
end of February 2022, which is well ahead of the target we had 
set for end-2022. The Eclipse journey for onboarding new clients 
(individuals) is now materially complete and six retail products 
and over 170 services have been digitised. In 2021 we completed 
the build of juristic onboarding through the Nedbank Business 
Hub in our wholesale businesses, and client roll-out is well 
underway with good feedback.

Pleasingly during the year both 
our client satisfaction and NPS 
performance continued on an upward 
trajectory. In the independent 2021 
Consulta survey Nedbank achieved 
the #2 ranking among South African 
banks on client satisfaction metrics, 
with our NPS increasing further to 47. 
Progress on our SPT 2.0 was evident in market share gains in key 
product areas and main-banked client gains, as well as improved 
levels of cross-sell. Notably, Nedbank recorded the largest retail 
main-banked market share gain among the large South African 
banks in the Consulta survey, while our CIB gained 35 new 
primary clients. Our market share growth in retail transactional 
deposit accounts was disappointing and remains a key focus for 
the management team.

Looking forward, I strongly believe that our strategy remains 
appropriate, in particular our focus on technology as we finalise 
the last pieces of our ME journey, which is central to our future 
competitiveness in financial services. Client satisfaction metrics 
remain top of mind as we aim to be #1 among South African 
banks and I remain confident that the unlocking of benefits from 
TOM 2.0 should continue to accelerate. We will actively leverage 
our balance sheet to grow clients and transactional income 
and I am optimistic that through SPT 2.0 market share in retail 
transactional deposits should also improve, and we have seen 
some more positive trends in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Accelerated digital transformation
In a more digital world we are excited about the accelerated 
digital transformation of banks, spurred on by Covid-19, as client 
activity increasingly shifts from physical products, services and 
outlets to digital products, services and channels. At Nedbank, 
as client behaviour changes, we will continue to optimise our 
own physical channels, leveraging the increased shift to digital 
payments. Since 2019 there has been a surge in the use of 
Nedbank banking apps: a 96% increase in active app users, a 
159% increase in app volumes and a 
163% increase in app value transacted. 
In response to this we continue to 
optimise the shape of our physical 
infrastructure through TOM 2.0 and 
branch floor space has decreased by 
around 65 000 m2 from 2014 levels, and 
we see further improvements from here.

As client digital adoption increases, employee numbers are also 
declining, largely through natural attrition.

Through our strategy of consolidating, standardising and 
optimising our own buildings to support new ways of working, 
our number of campus sites (offices) has decreased from 31 to 
24 over the past four years, with a longer-term target of 19. In 
the next few years we will continue to optimise the portfolio by 
bedding down more dynamic ways of work as well as leveraging 
successful work-from-home (WFH) experiences as a result 
of Covid-19, while enabling further value creation and cost 
reduction opportunities as we strive to meet our 2023 cost-to-
income ratio target of 54%.

Creating positive impacts
Living our purpose of using our financial expertise to do good and 
creating positive impacts in the societies in which we operate are 
a core part of our Nedbank DNA and a key strategic imperative 
for unlocking value for all our stakeholders. This is demonstrated 
through our ongoing delivery against the UN SDGs and continued 
focus on leading in ESG matters. With the increasing focus on 
these issues, the progress that we have made continues to be 
reflected in our scores across all ESG ratings being towards the 
top end of our local and international peer group.

37Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



The release of our market-leading Energy Policy and inaugural 
TCFD Report was a key highlight for me in 2021, as was the 
successful launch of Africa’s first 
green AT1 instrument. At the end of 
2021 our renewable-energy financing 
portfolio linked to the Renewable 
Energy Independent Power Producer 
Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) 
was R29bn, and we remain well 
positioned to support government’s 
renewable-energy programme with an initial R50bn board limit 
in place to accommodate future client-lending support. I eagerly 
look forward to our participation in the upcoming round 6 of 
the programme and am encouraged by the strong embedded-
energy generation pipeline we have in place following client 
responses to the increase to 100 MW self-generation capacity. 
A stable and efficient supply of electricity is vital to higher levels 
of economic growth and job creation in SA and we aim to be a 
market leader in this area.

Looking ahead, we see a big opportunity to participate and lead 
in new financing opportunities aligned with the UN SDGs, while 
leveraging our sustainable-finance solutioning expertise, arranging 
innovative green funding instruments and channelling the funding 
towards the further development of the green economy.

Our focus on driving the transformation agenda continues to 
be a priority, and this is evident in our increasingly diverse and 
inclusive workforce profile. Black representation of our total 
workforce now exceeds 79%, of which 50% is represented by 
black females.

The need for higher levels of 
inclusive economic growth
The Covid-19 pandemic and the July civil unrest have once 
again laid bare SA’s socioeconomic challenges, specifically 
unacceptably high levels of unemployment, poverty and 
inequality. More inclusive economic growth is needed urgently 
to support job creation and address these challenges. Much 
work needs to be done; if we are going to realise higher levels 
of inclusive economic growth in our lifetime, we need urgent 
implementation of structural reforms. 

I firmly believe genuine structural reform in SA remains too 
slow and, while there are some green shoots emerging that we 
welcome, reform like an increase to 100 MW in self-generation 
capacity and the recent spectrum auctions should have 
happened many years ago. When this is combined with the lack 
of reliable electricity supply from Eskom, it means that after the 
bounce-back in GDP in 2021, GDP growth in the next few years 
is likely to remain below 2%. Investors look for higher levels of 
growth to balance the higher levels of risk inherent in emerging 
markets, and unless we have these higher levels of growth, 
unfortunately we have only the higher levels of inherent risk and 
much-needed investment capital will shift elsewhere.

As a purpose-led organisation, we continue to play our role 
in driving the socioeconomic development of our country, 
partnering with government, labour and civil society. In 2021 we 
reactivated our commitment to the YES initiative, through which 
corporate SA aims to provide internship opportunities for more 
than one million South Africans. To date we have placed more 
than 5 000 previously unemployed youth internally and through 
sponsored placements, and we continue to encourage other 
South African corporates to follow our example.

2023 targets on track, with DHEPS 
target expected to be met a 
year sooner
Looking ahead we expect higher levels of revenue growth 
and continue to focus on costs to support a solid financial 
performance for full-year 2022. We should continue on our 
positive trajectory underpinned by our ongoing strategic and 
operational delivery, as we make progress towards the medium-
term Covid-19 recovery targets we set for the end of 2023. 

We remain on track to meet these targets and, pleasingly, now 
expect to meet the DHEPS target (greater than the 2019 level 
of 2 565 cents per share) in 2022, a year ahead of our previous 
expectation. We continue to focus on achieving an ROE greater 
than the 2019 ROE level of 15%, reducing our cost-to-income 
ratio to below 54%, and ranking #1 on NPS among South African 
banks, all by the end of 2023, and these targets remain stretch 
targets. In the longer term we still aim to increase our ROE to 
above 18% (COE plus 3% to 4%) and cost-to-income ratio to 
below 50%.

The macroeconomic environment is expected to remain 
challenging over the next few years, and while interest rate 
increases are good for us from an endowment perspective 
as we earn approximately R1,6bn pre-tax for each 1% uplift in 
rates over 12 months, faster interest rate increases may start to 
impact client repayments and therefore bad debts. 

The situation in Ukraine and Russia is worrying and we 
strongly oppose the violence and loss of lives we are seeing. 
Economically, this is likely to have negative impacts on global 
economic growth, inflation and interest rates. Nedbank has 
no direct exposure to Ukraine and Russia and any indirect 
exposures are immaterial. The impact on SA is likely to be 
indirect and less negative than on many other emerging markets 
as higher oil and food prices will likely lead to inflation breaching 
the top end of the SARB band in H1 2022, but this will be partially 
offset by the benefits from higher gold and other metal prices, 
with these commodities accounting for 50% of SA’s exports.

Our people are at the centre of our business. The health and 
safety of our employees remain a priority for us as we learn to 
live with the pandemic, which has and will continue to impact 
how we work. As our hybrid work model approach gains 
momentum, we are working on bringing more employees back 
into the office in a Covid-19-safe manner as this is important 
for teamwork and our culture as well as innovation and growth. 
Our optimal workplace distribution mix is expected to settle at 
around 60% at Nedbank premises and 40% either following a 
hybrid model or permanently working from home.

As we look to 2022 and beyond, we will continue to focus on our 
Human Capital Strategy as a key enabler of delivering on the

Executive succession planning remains top of mind for me 
ahead of the retirements in 2023 of our Chief Risk Officer, 
Trevor Adams, and Chief Information Officer, Fred Swanepoel. 
Through our robust executive succession planning process, 
suitable successors will be appointed ahead of time to enable 
seamless transitions.

Appreciation
The past two years have been unprecedented and extraordinarily 
difficult for our clients and employees. Throughout the Covid-19 
crisis our dedicated 27 000 Nedbank employees have remained 

resilient and inspiring. We thank you for continuing to diligently 
support our clients and the economies in which we operate. 
Together we have emerged stronger and delivered on our 
purpose of using our financial expertise to do good. We 
extend our heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and 
communities of employees and clients who have lost their loved 
ones during this time.

Thank you to the Chairperson, the board and my executive team 
for their continued support as we navigated uncharted waters 
with this, culminating in a stronger-than-expected financial 
rebound and successful closing out of the Resilience phase of 
our strategic response to the pandemic in 2021.

The passing of our former Chairperson Vassi Naidoo was felt 
by all at Nedbank who knew him. Vassi made an indelible mark 
on Nedbank, and his wealth of experience and wisdom will be 
sorely missed. I would also like to thank our Chief Compliance 
Officer, Anna Isaac, who will be leaving Nedbank at the end 
of April 2022 to take on a new compliance job in the UAE, for 
making a significant contribution to Nedbank during her tenure. 
We have concluded our interview and succession process 
and will announce Anna’s replacement as soon as we obtain 
regulatory approval.

Our operating environment
The environment for Nedbank and our stakeholders 
remains volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous, 
although significantly better than during the peak of 
the Covid-19 crisis in 2020. 

While many things have changed in the past two 
years, the pandemic has reinforced the imperative 
of creating a more equitable and prosperous future 
for all, while operating within planetary boundaries. 
In this context we have identified and updated our 
material matters reflecting the issues that have the 
greatest likelihood of affecting our ability to create 
sustained value for our stakeholders, both internal and 
external. While these issues do change over time, as 
our stakeholders’ needs evolve and new trends and 
developments – like the pandemic – shape the macro 
environment, the broad themes remained consistent.

Our approach to the material matters follows the 
principle of materiality. This principle is essential in 
assessing what information should influence the 
group’s strategy and our integrated thinking as we 
make decisions around the six capitals and inform 
the evolution of our business model as well as the 
development of our short-, medium- and long-term 
targets as discussed on page 16.

The SA macroeconomic 
environment
In 2021 the SA economy bounced back from 
the depths of strict lockdown, supported 
by rapid adaptation by private companies, 
better targeted lockdown rules, substantial 
monetary stimulus and moderate fiscal 
support. Much of the lift came from 
rebounding consumer spending and strong 
export growth, supported by robust global 
demand for commodities. In contrast, 
fixed investment remained depressed and 
government spending was subdued. The 
recovery has also been uneven among 
sectors and income groups. The lockdowns 
hit low-income earners the hardest, with 
employment lagging far behind economic 
growth, exacerbating already high levels of 
unemployment, poverty and inequality.

High-frequency data from our own POS 
devices and card-related digital channels 
shows strong growth in total turnover into 
H2 2021. Overall turnover levels are back 
above pre-Covid-19 levels (March 2020), 
including in the telecoms, retail, restaurant, 
healthcare and entertainment sectors. 
However, sectors that were most impacted 
by the various levels of Covid-19-related 
lockdowns, such as hotels and airlines, 
recorded turnover levels that are still below 
2019 levels.

Banks are highly integrated into the economies where they operate – not only are our retail, small-and-medium-enterprise and corporate clients active participants in the 
economy, but as banks we facilitate lending and investments, deposit-taking and transactions.

Looking forward, SA’s economic recovery is expected to moderate off the 
higher base of 2021 in the years ahead and the economy is expected to 
recover to 2019 levels on a sustainable basis only in 2023. Encouragingly, 
consumer spending is likely to increase steadily, underpinned by firmer 
income growth and relatively favourable interest rates. Fragile consumer 
confidence, hurt by a weak job market, will still limit the upside. Households 
have been de-levering since the global financial crisis, and along with 
the benefits of a low-interest-rate environment, we continue to see solid 
demand for retail credit.

Real SA GDP
(Rtn)

Fixed investment spending is forecast to rise off a low base but faces 
ongoing headwinds. A sustainable rise in private sector capital outlays 
will only occur when government accelerates structural reforms and 
eradicates electricity shortages. We have seen positive developments 
on key SA reforms, including those announced as part of President 
Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation address. These include, among other 
things, a ‘red-tape reduction drive’, unbundling of Eskom transmission 
(by December 2022), increased private energy generation capacity to 
100 MW, the publication of an RFP for public-private sector partnership 
in SA ports, the auctioning of 5G spectrum and third-party access to 
SA freight rail network. The restocking of depleted inventories should 
support domestic demand. In contrast, government spending will likely 
remain weak. At the same time, softer global demand and commodity 
prices will weigh on exports, particularly in the context of geological 
uncertainty. Real GDP growth is forecast to grow by 1,7% in 2022 and 
remain muted in the years to come. Accelerated structural reforms, 
policy certainty and energy security remain key to unlocking faster 
economic growth over the medium-to-longer term.

The impact on our business model
To reduce the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our 
business, we continue to focus on strategic delivery (self-help) 
– that is, accelerated delivery of digital innovations (intellectual 
capital) and the drive for greater levels of digital sales and service to 
improve client satisfaction levels (social capital) through market-
leading client solutions, exploring new revenue streams beyond 
banking (ecosystems and disruptive CVPs), focusing on the areas 
that create value (SPT 2.0) and extracting operating efficiencies 
(TOM 2.0). The behavioural outcomes of the Covid-19 pandemic are 
evident in increased levels of digital adoption and the promotion of 
greater levels of flexible work practices by our employees (human 
capital). Expansion into Africa remains a longer-term opportunity, 
but we are increasingly looking to leverage our capabilities (human, 
intellectual and manufactured capital) in SA to improve the 
performance of our SADC operations.

42Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



Scenarios for  
the short and 
medium term
In an uncertain environment, 
we continue to assess the 
macroeconomic outlook by 
considering various scenarios. 
Our base case scenario 
(completed in February 2022) 
represents the underlying 
assumptions used in our 
three-year business planning 
(2022–2024), which informs 
our short- and medium-term 
financial targets (shown on 
page 79 respectively), stress 
testing and communication to 
the investment community.

To illustrate the improvement 
in macroeconomic 
conditions during 2021, we 
include our Nedbank Group 
Economic Unit’s forecasts at 
February 2021. GDP growth 
has recovered faster than 
expected, interest rates turned 
upward, credit growth slowed 
and inflation is marginally 
higher. We further present 
scenarios, illustrating both a 
better-than-expected potential 
outcome (‘positive scenario’) 
and two downside scenarios 
(‘high stress’ and ‘severely 
adverse stress’) to highlight 
that our capital levels are 
expected to remain sound, 
even in a severely adverse 
environment.

Base case – Normalising amid persistent uncertainty
Global economic growth continues but moderates as global monetary policies normalise 
and tighten. Commodity prices rise sharply and remain elevated throughout, initially driven 
up by tight supplies, worsened by geopolitical conflicts, and later supported by increased 
infrastructure spending and climate change mitigation in advanced countries. On the 
upside, the government makes some, albeit limited, progress with structural reforms. 
Electricity shortages ease but persist. SA GDP 
growth moderates to below 2%, constrained 
by fragile confidence and inadequate levels 
of fixed investment. Inflation initially rises but 
is eventually kept in check by considerable 
slack in the system. Interest rates increase in 
response to tighter global monetary policies 
and increasingly volatile capital flows. Credit 
stages a moderate recovery off a low base. 
The steady improvement in household loans 
continues, while corporate loans recover, 
supported by increased activity in renewable 
energy and communications.

High-stress scenario – Limping 
through the fog
Global growth loses momentum, hurt by 
persistent geopolitical tensions, moderate 
inflation pressures and tighter global 
monetary policies. Global oil prices surge, on 
the back of persistent geopolitical tensions 
and a messy transition to green energy. SA’s 
terms of trade weaken as global oil prices 
remain elevated, while metal prices decline. 
International monetary policies tighten, 
while fiscal policies are slow to compensate. 
Emerging markets experience significant 
capital flight, hurting currencies and other 
financial assets. In SA, structural reforms are limited, undermined by powerful vested 
interests. The budget deficit remains sticky at around 7% of GDP, while debt burden 
climbs, pushing long bond yields sharply higher. GDP growth fades, slipping back into 
recession. Unemployment rises further, household incomes decline, confidence collapses, 
and the slump in fixed investment deepens. Credit growth stagnates at a nominal 2,5% 
per annum, while bad debts escalate among households and companies.

Severe-stress scenario – 
Succumbing to stagflation
World growth evaporates, hurt by 
escalating and prolonged geopolitical 
conflicts as is seen in the Ukraine–Russia 
conflict, sharply higher global oil prices, 
persistently high global inflation and much 
tighter monetary policies. In emerging 
and developing countries, limited fiscal 
space and increasingly difficult financing 
conditions drive more countries into default 
as debt burdens escalate and economic 
performance deteriorates. In SA, structural 
reforms stall amid an increasingly fractured 

political landscape. Government spending becomes increasingly ineffective, with social 
welfare, debt service costs, and SOE bailouts forcing sharp cutbacks in capital expenditure. 
Infrastructure constraints persist, intensifying in some critical infrastructure. The economy 
enters a prolonged recession, with sharp contractions in consumer spending and private 
sector fixed investment. Inflation accelerates, pushing up already high imported inflation, 
amplified by rand weakness. Credit growth slows to a weak 1% per annum, while bad debts 
escalate among both households and companies.

Positive scenario – Rising to the challenge
The world economy manages to sustain above-trend growth as geopolitical tensions 
subside and the world learns to live with Covid-19 without imposing disruptive restrictions. 
The more synchronised global upswings help ease supply shortages and transport 
bottlenecks, bringing inflation under control faster. Global fiscal policies become more 
expansionary, with substantial investments in green energy and transport infrastructure, 

sustaining the commodity price upswing. 
Risk appetites improve, supporting capital 
flows to emerging markets. SA accelerates 
structural reforms and improves fiscal 
metrics by reducing wasteful spending, 
containing consumption expenditure while 
lifting infrastructure investment. GDP growth 
settles at around 3% per annum, supported 
by steady employment gains, higher fixed 
investment and strong exports. Inflation 
recedes to around the 4,5% midpoint of the 
SARB’s inflation targeting range, keeping 
interest rates relatively steady.

Long-term growth opportunities 
in the rest of Africa
The recovery in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will continue, 
but downside risks have risen. The region’s economy is 
projected to expand by 3,6% in 2022 and 3,8% in 2023 
from 3,5% in 2021. However, downside risks remain 
significant. The boost provided by higher commodity prices 
is likely to fade to some extent, as prices of non-energy 
commodities are expected to ease off last year’s peak and 
stabilise at lower levels. Given the region’s low vaccination 
rates, resurgent Covid-19 infections and associated 
lockdowns continue to pose downside risks.

GDP growth in SSA is expected 
to grow faster than SA.

Sources: World Bank, Statistics South Africa, forecasts from 2021, 
Nedbank forecasts for SA.

Considering that Africa accounts for just 2% of global 
trade, and only 17% of African exports are intra-continental 
as compared with 59% for Asia and 68% for Europe, the 
potential for transformation across Africa is significant.  
The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which 
came into operation on 1 January 2022, will create the 
largest free-trade area globally measured by the number of 
countries participating, connecting 1,3 billion people across 
55 countries with a combined GDP of about US$3,4tn.

The agreement aims to reduce trade costs and enable 
African economies to boost trade among themselves, 
integrating the continent further into global supply chains. 
Eliminating tariffs on 90% of goods and services will create 
a single market. The trade pact can be good for Africa only 
when much of the world turns away from cooperation and 
free trade.

Changing relationship between 
business, government, labour and 
civil society

Since the announcement of the South African Economic 
Reconstruction and Recovery Plan (ERRP) in October 2020 
– which aims to create more jobs, fight criminal activities and 
corruption, enhance the state’s capacity, and revitalise the 
state of economy – progress has been slow.

The success of the ERRP is dependent on the support of 
business, labour and other social partners, and partnering 
with government, to promote economic recovery. Nedbank 
continues to support government’s drive to forge a 
new economy and will continue to work together with 
government and other social partners to drive fundamental 
and everlasting change to enable SA to emerge from the 
current crisis with higher levels of inclusive growth and a 
more transformed economy.

Our opportunities
South African economic recovery – An improvement in 
socioeconomic conditions, under both ‘base case’ and 
‘positive’ scenarios, supports banks. Opportunities include 
improving sentiment and confidence driving higher levels of 
corporate and consumer spending and investment, growth 
in infrastructure and an increase in merger and acquisition 
activity. Given Nedbank’s wholesale banking strength and 
support of the South African infrastructure drive, we are well 
positioned in CIB to grow strongly when business confidence 
returns, while RBB will gain from improved consumer 
confidence. Better-than-expected macroeconomic conditions 
as described in our ‘positive’ scenario could provide more 
certainty in support of our reaching our financial targets, as 
shown on page 16.

Growth and expansion into Africa – The ongoing opportunity 
for us is to support our South African clients who continue 
to expand into faster-growing markets in Africa, leveraging 
SA’s position as the gateway to Africa and using the unique 
expertise in CIB and that of our partner Ecobank. On the back 
of ongoing investment, our NAR business will continue to 
strengthen its positioning in SADC markets.

Our key risks
South African economic recovery – For banks, an ongoing 
uncertain economic environment would have a negative 
impact on earnings growth potential under a ‘severely 
adverse’ scenario. Key risks include slower advances growth; 
particularly muted retail lending; corporates not investing; 
lower transactional volumes, which could impact revenue 
growth; and bad debts increasing as a result of quickly rising 
interest rates, job losses and corporate defaults. Optimising 
our cost base is an imperative, as we discuss on page 64.

As an African bank, we view the latest findings of the 2022 Global 
Risks Report of the World Economic Forum as cause for concern – 
as well as a call to action – with a litany of risks listed that threaten 
the livelihoods and futures of the continent’s population. These 
range from ongoing economic stagnation, rapidly increasing 
levels of unemployment, and a general lack, or failure, of vital 
infrastructure, to growing poverty, a breakdown in social cohesion, 
and the potential for a divergent post-pandemic recovery to 
create even larger equity and inclusion gaps.

But of all the risks listed in the report, none is more pressing than 
the need to be collaborative to mitigate climate change risks in a 
way that protects fragile economies that are then able to create 
equal opportunities for people – a Just Transition.

As a significant carbon emitter, SA finds itself at the forefront of 
this Just Transition commitment. Ahead of COP26, the country’s 
government revised its target emission range to align with the 
global goal of limiting temperature increases to 1,5 °C by the 
end of the century. Its largest carbon emitters also pledged to 
significantly reduce emissions and take bolder decarbonisation 
action. Large segments of corporate SA have also committed 
themselves to supporting government’s carbon mitigation efforts, 
having signed up to public commitments such as the Alliance to 
Climate Action, Business for Nature and the National Business 
Institute’s Just Transition initiatives.

Many of these public commitments call for ramped-up ambitions 
to protect the world’s biodiversity and essential ecosystems 
alongside climate change commitments. The World Wide Fund for 
Nature Living Planet Report 2020 highlights that biodiversity is 
being lost at an alarming rate. The population sizes of mammals, 
birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles have seen an average drop 
of 68% since 1970. The impact of this loss on the well-being of 
mankind is steadily mounting.

Countries across the globe are still struggling to recover from the immense social and economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, while at the same time trying to come 
to terms with the very urgent need to deal with exacerbated poverty and inequality levels and the looming climate crisis.

Failing to meet human development needs while overshooting ecological limits Material matter  2

The relationship between emissions pathways and changes in surface temperature 
(warming) versus preindustrial levels demonstrates that the extent of long-term 
climate change remains a choice, which is dependent on actions taken in the 
short term. However, in all plausible future scenarios, the global average surface 
temperature will continue to warm for the next 30 years at least, which means the 
physical impacts of climate change will continue to worsen for 30 years, irrespective 
of actions taken in the short and medium term. 

This graph shows various outcomes of global warming projections based on pledges 
and current global policies. In the risk time horizon (2020–2050) it is clear that action 
is required to reduce carbon emissions. The world is currently not on track to meet the 
target of 1,5 °C. 

The importance of the finance 
sector in supporting and driving a 
Just Transition has been steadily 
increasing given that their capital 
allocation decisions determine 
the shape of future economies. 
Fulfilling this role responsibly 
will see the sector reducing 
investment in harmful industries 
while speeding up the transition 
to a sustainable economy through 
vehicles such as green bonds 
and sustainability-linked bonds. 
Such approaches include radical 
acceleration in sustainable-
finance activity, deliberate and 
ordered divestment from fossil 
fuels, more aggressive decisions 
aligned with responsible 
investment and transparent 
disclosure and reporting aligned 
with TCFD. Recognising this 
imperative, many financial 
services institutions have 
committed to net-zero journeys 
and pledged to deliver much-
needed funding for not 
only climate mitigation and 
adaptation solutions, but also 
with sustainable-development 
imperatives as a whole.

Projection for different shared socioeconomic-pathway (SSP) scenarios

SSP5-8.5 (very high GHG emissions): CO2 emissions triple by 2075.

SSP3-7.0 (shade representing very likely range) (high GHG emissions): CO2 
emissions double by 2100.

SSP2-4.5 (intermediate GHG emissions): CO2 emissions around current 
levels until 2050, then falling but not reaching net zero by 2100.

SSP1-2.6 (shade representing very likely range) (low GHG 
emissions): CO2 emissions cut to net zero around 2075.

SSP1-1.9 (very low GHG emissions): CO2 emissions cut 
to net zero around 2050.

CASE 
IN POINT The business case for sustainable-development finance in SA

The annual investment gap into SDGs in developing countries is estimated at US$2,5tn. Closer to home, SDG-related opportunities on the African 
continent have been estimated at more than US$1,1 trillion. Specific sustainable financing opportunities in SA relating to water, renewable energy and 
agriculture have also been identified, as illustrated in the picture below. In line with this opportunity, Nedbank will undertake to support commercially 
viable investments, while simultaneously solving social and environmental challenges. As at 31 December 2021, we have provided and/or raised over 
R100bn in SDG-related financing and funding relating to SDGs 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15, and we will continue to expand on our ambition in our 
next round of annual reporting. In line with this we commit to increasing the percentage of our lending, investment and funding towards sustainable-
development finance in a manner commensurate with the needs of our clients, the size of the strategic opportunities offered and our desire to 
continue to leverage our competitive advantage in this area.

Our opportunities
We have positioned supporting the SDGs 
through sustainable-development finance 
at the heart of our purpose and strategy, 
using this to create an enduring competitive 
advantage. As we continue to build insights 
and capabilities, we will be able to manage 
climate-change-related risks proactively and 
develop new solutions to assist our clients to 
prepare for the future.

Our key risks
The impacts of climate change include more 
natural disasters and increased costs to rebuild 
(or retrofit) infrastructure, where required; 
increased energy costs; water shortages 
and quality issues; and increased food prices 
and shortages. Extreme weather events 
impact clients and ultimately insurers through 
higher claims. The imperative to protect 
essential ecosystem services provided by our 
environment, amid growing social and political 
pressure, leads to certain industries becoming 
less viable, resulting in potential job losses.

Click to watch:  
‘A bank that walks sustainability’

The impact on our business model
2021 saw a continued increase in the number of extreme weather events experienced globally, with floods, drought and other natural disasters impacting 
billions of people – a signal of the increasing impact of climate change on the planet. With the majority of Nedbank’s business generated on African shores, 
our geographic positioning makes us, and our clients, particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. As such, we are increasingly 
allocating financial capital and selectively tilting our financing decisions to support the delivery of the SDGs. In the long term we are committed to all our 
lending contributing to a net-zero economy by 2050, with our exiting from all fossil fuels by 2045. In the short and medium term we are planning for an 
orderly transition, very cognisant of the social impacts of our decisions. Our Climate Change Position Statement* and Energy Policy** set the principles 
that we will adopt to do this and set out initial plans to decarbonise our book.

Acceleration of digitisation
As we have noted in our prior integrated reports, the 
digitisation of financial services includes embracing and 
leveraging mobile technology, fintech partnerships, cloud 
computing, big data, advanced analytics, machine learning, 
blockchain technology, AI, robotics and biometrics in the 
optimisation of legacy IT infrastructure in the pursuit of new 
revenue channels and opportunities. Banks (which have both 
the scale and position of trust with clients) are increasingly 
partnering with fintechs (and broader market participants), 
enabling faster delivery of new innovations. In addition, 
various trends have accelerated how businesses operate, 
how people interact with technology and how work-from-
home enablement have played out. A few key trends include 
virtual video conferencing – the use of online platforms such 
as Zoom and MS Teams as well as digital workplace tools 
– and support for companies’ mobile workforce through 
collaboration tools and video meeting capabilities.

Accelerating adoption of digital channels, a trend 
seen across global regions

Digital adoption, 
by industry
(% of digital access)

Covid-19 has accelerated 
digital adoption and banks 
remain leaders in this space.

The world continues to become increasingly digitised. Financial institutions have been leading this change as various aspects of banking progressed quickly while 
creating new opportunities – from digitisation of financial services, enhanced client experiences and new products and channels, to evolving organisational structures 
and internal processes, as well as new human capital and skills requirements, while enabling people to work remotely. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated digital 
adoption to mitigate the impact of reduced mobility.

Disruptive technologies and digital adoption Material matter  3

Increasing threat of 
cyberrisk
The global technology revolution also has a dark 
side, evident in the dramatic increase in financial 
crime as well as an increase in the number, 
intensity and sophistication of high-profile 
cyberattacks. These attacks are usually aimed 
at accessing, changing or destroying sensitive 
information, extorting money from individuals or 
interrupting normal business processes. Banks, 
among others, have become attractive targets 
for cyberattacks because of their key role in 
payment and settlement systems, the volume 
of sensitive client information they hold and the 
potentially adverse impact of interfering with the 
smooth functioning of banking services.

Two specific industry trends stand out as we 
look towards the future:

• Remote workers will increasingly become a 
target for cybercriminals.

• As a result of increasing bandwidth brought 
about by 5G, connected devices will become 
more vulnerable to cyberattacks.

Consumer and employee behaviour is 
continuously evolving in a digital world with 
technology enabling access to multiple devices 
to ensure more seamless, convenient and secure 
connections. To respond to trends and evolving 
customer demand, we continue to invest in new 
products and capabilities that will further power 
an integrated model and deliver differentiated 
value, convenient banking and access to 
financial solutions.

Our opportunities
Revenue growth and cost optimisation – Opportunities for Nedbank include continuing 
to enhance our client experiences (social capital) through disruptive technologies and 
digital adoption, thereby meeting our goal of leading in NPS; gaining client transactional 
volumes and revenue (SPT 2.0); and improving efficiency through technology (lower 
cost to serve) as well as TOM 2.0. In 2022 we will continue to expand and scale our 
beyond banking client propositions and build on foundations put in place and learnings 
from our existing ecosystem plays such as Avo and the API_Marketplace.

Our key risks
Cyberrisk – Since 2016 cyberrisk has been identified as a top risk and it has become 
more important given the digitisation of products and services, ranking at number four  
of our current top 10 risks.

The impact on our business model
Digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way we do business, from client 
onboarding and product sales to servicing. We are moving away from paper-intensive, 
predominantly employee-assisted channels (manufactured capital) to more effective 
and cost-efficient digital solutions (intellectual capital) that also drive improved levels 
of client satisfaction (social capital). Internally, more than 62% of our campus-based 
employees have been enabled to work from home (human capital) and many of our  
new work practices will continue after the pandemic. Read more about this on page 68. 
A few examples of how our financial capital will be impacted include: Net interest income 
– digital channels allow Nedbank to acquire loans through new channels such as our 
API_Marketplace, which enables the externalising of services to third parties (resulting in 
a greater share of high-quality business written); non-interest revenue – enhanced ability 
to cross-sell, offer clients additional value-added services and provide services at a lower 
cost, but digital transactions come at a lower fee; and expenses – lower cost to serve and 
acquire clients, although higher costs in the short term as legacy systems are maintained 
until switched off.

47Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



The past few years saw the launch of value propositions by various new 
entrants in the South African banking system. SARB has granted banking 
licences to Discovery Bank, TymeBank, Postbank and Bank Zero. In addition, 
insurers and telecommunication (telecoms) providers are expanding into 
attractive banking profit pools. Some players focus primarily on transactional 
services and deposits and they are challenging existing banks with innovative 
digital solutions.

• Capitec – The roll-out of its revised business banking solution is 
expected soon, along with the rebranding of Mercantile Bank to Capitec 
towards the end of 2022.

• TymeBank – Has shown strong growth off a low base, reaching 4 million 
clients in 2021, although deposits market share remains very low. 
Customers can access self-service TymeBank kiosks at 14 000 tillpoints 
across the Pick n Pay and Boxer network and over 700 kiosks, as well 
as The Foschini Group (TFG) stores. The bank expects to break even 
in 2022.

• Discovery Bank – Continues to make steady progress as it targets the 
upper income segments, having gained over 400 000 clients and a 
deposit market share of 0,21%. The bank, which launched in 2019, is 
targeting break even by 2024.

• Bank Zero – After some delays the bank has had a cautious launch with 
a focus on free transactional banking. The bank plans to break even 
in 2022.

• Telecoms providers – The traditional telecoms operators such as 
MTN and Vodacom, as well as companies in other vertical sectors, are 
expanding their digital services.

While many fintech players have 
found it hard to scale and are 
increasingly partnering with 
traditional banks, big-tech disruptors 
such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, 
Apple, Microsoft, Alibaba and 
Tencent have the financial muscle, 
as well as the ability to scale, and are 
therefore arguably a greater threat 
to traditional banks, but regulators 
have become concerned around the 
potential dominance of these large 
platforms, and new laws, regulations 
and oversight are being implemented.

Disruptors usually start small, 
creating solutions that serve an 
unserved market or client need. 
However, while disruptors or 
challengers may be more innovative 
and agile, incumbents do have large 
advantages of their own. These 
include a history and a track record, 
existing scale benefits, established 
and strong brands, significant 
datasets, intellectual property 
and annuity cash flows to fund 
innovations at a scale that smaller 
fintechs do not have. Incumbents 
that do not respond fast enough get 
disrupted.

Competition in the banking sector remains fierce, and the landscape has evolved over time to include new entrants, fintechs and big-tech disruptors. These disruptors 
are revolutionising the banking experience for clients, although the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed the roll-out of new value propositions and in some cases new 
entrants have scaled back their ambitions. The large SA banks have all responded and competition for deposits, good-quality assets and transactional banking 
continues to remain elevated.

Increased competition and threat of new entrants Material matter  4

Our opportunities
Accelerating innovation in a client-centred manner – Competition 
continues to challenge us to respond through new innovative solutions 
and market-leading client experiences. Our response has been pleasing, 
as evident in client satisfaction metrics and main-banked market 
share statistics over the past few years as shown on pages 57 to 59. 
Investment in expansion opportunities for the commercialisation of  
data, adjacent markets and beyond-banking solutions such as Avo and 
API_Marketplace have accelerated. More on this on pages 60 and 61.

Our key risks
Pressure on revenues – A loss of market share of certain deposits and 
pressure on revenue pools, brought about by lower bank fees, are key 
risks should our CVPs not remain competitive or should digital banking 
solutions become a commodity. We are responding to these risks 
through our growth strategies (as shown on pages 62 and 63) as well 
as through executing our cost optimisation initiatives through TOM 2.0, 
discussed in more detail on page 64. While we have been able to price 
up for risk across most lending products, pressure on deposit pricing and 
the ability to pass on inflation-related fee increases have been reduced.

The impact on our business model
Our expansion beyond banking into areas such as ecosystems is a 
fundamental departure from the traditional banking model and is 
emerging as an attractive additional channel for selling existing Nedbank 
products. Although new, it does build on the strong foundations that 
are already in place, including technology and payments infrastructure, 
Nedbank’s client base and intellectual capital and innovations.

The evolving world of work Material matter  5

The impact on our business model
As more of our clients transact with Nedbank through digital 
channels, the nature of work and roles continue to evolve. A hybrid 
work model has also been adopted and we continue to review our 
people and organisational practices to support the evolving world 
of work and enhance engagement and productivity.

49Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



Workforce and workplace forces are shaping the transformation of the human 
capital agenda
The fundamental shift in how people have been working for the past two years has heightened the focus on the physical and mental 
well-being and safety of the workforce. Ongoing uncertainty and instability during unprecedented times continue to influence the human 
capital agenda of organisations, particularly within financial services. Global trends are shaping workplace and workforce demands and 
practices as we reimagine the future world of work.

Our opportunities
Nedbank embraces the challenges of the evolving 
world of work and has made progress with the 
following opportunities:

• The launch of a digital learning platform and 
learning offerings to grow and mobilise talent 
internally, while ensuring a steady supply 
of scarce and critical skills when needed.

• Expansion of our well-being value proposition 
to cater for employee needs more holistically as 
well as an improved support experience.

• A refreshed leadership development approach 
to empower leaders to lead a more virtual, 
dispersed workforce with new leadership 
capabilities.

• Repurposing of our real estate towards the 
workplace of the future, together with a world-
class digital workplace experience and offering 
of flexible working options for where and when 
work is performed.

Our key risks
• The demand for scarce and critical skills 

continues to escalate as digital transformation 
continues to transform talent and skills required 
for the future.

• Assumptions around a ‘post-pandemic’ 
workplace are largely untested and practices will 
evolve to guide our investment decisions while 
improving employee experiences, irrespective 
of where and when work is performed.

• The pace of change in the workplace, coupled 
with social and economic distress in our society 
brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, impacts 
employee well-being and safety. This poses a risk 
to employee engagement and productivity. Read 
more on how we supported our employees during 
these challenging times on page 82.

Regulators are also adopting a 
more collaborative and consultative 
approach to regulation, by the 
establishment of intragovernmental 
working groups, coordinated 
information sharing sessions and 
engagement with industry bodies 
and stakeholders, in and outside 
the financial sector, to develop the 
regulatory landscape at the pace 
required by digital change.

• Digital Transformation and Technological 
Innovation – The Fourth Industrial 
Revolution, accelerated by Covid-19, has led 
to increased automation and AI compliance 
processes as businesses try to look for 
faster, more-efficient and less-resource-
heavy processes. There is an increased 
focus on the National Data and Cloud Policy 
with the resultant effect of an increased 
focus on data protection, cybersecurity  
and cybercrime.

• Data, cybersecurity, cybercrime – The 
Protection of Personal Information Act 
(POPIA) 4 of 2013; General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR); and working from 
home will mean increased regulation and 
regulatory scrutiny around data management 
processes. There is a convergence of data 
management, data privacy, and data ethics 
standards for consumer protection.

• Climate change and ESG – ESG regulations 
will continue to evolve, as further focus on 
ESG factors emerges from the pandemic 
and the resultant economic strain. The 
economic recovery from the impact of 
the pandemic presents governments and 
regulators with an opportunity to reshape 
policies and frameworks, through integrating 
ESG factors.

• Payments – There will be increased 
focus on faster and more cost-effective 
payment mechanisms both domestically 
and internationally, which calls for the 
modernisation of payments, increased 
competition and regulation of broader 
participation (other than banks) to 
participate in the National Payment System. 
Such participation and, among other things,  
the rendering of payment services, clearing 
and settlement will be subject to regulation  
or enhanced regulation in future.

• Resolution regime – The Financial Sector 
Laws Amendment Bill, promulgated on 
28 January 2022, designates SARB as the 
Resolution Authority with the mandate 
to implement South Africa’s Resolution 
Framework. Encapsulated under the 
promulgation of the Financial Sector Laws 
Amendment Bill is the creation of the 
Deposit Insurance Scheme (DIS), which will 
collect deposit insurance levies and deposit 
insurance premiums. The costs associated 
with DIS may be incurred from as early as 
Q2 2022. In addition, first loss after capital 
(Flac) bail-inable debt instruments will be 
introduced, with minimum Flac requirements 
being implemented in a phased approach 
over a four-year period, with additional add-
ons to be implemented after this period.

The scale of the Covid-19 pandemic meant that the regulatory environment was thrown into an unprecedented and unpredictable storm as regulators and governments 
across the world looked to introduce emergency regulations and policies to manage the impact of the pandemic on lives and livelihoods. With the crisis mostly behind 
us, the focus is shifting to regulatory matters aligned with the new normal, including digital transformation and cybersecurity, climate change, payments, diversity and 
inclusion, and financial-sector-related regulation.

Demands on governance, regulation and risk management Material matter  6

• Basel III reforms – Basel III reforms 
announced in December 2017, have a key 
objective of reducing excessive variability 
in RWA and restoring credibility in the 
calculation of RWA by enhancing robustness 
and risk sensitivity of the standardised 
approaches for credit and operational risk; 
constraining the use of internally modelled 
approaches; and complementing the 
risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalised 
leverage ratio and robust capital floor. 
The new capital floors’ effective date is 
January 2023, but Nedbank will see the full 
impact only in 2026.

• Transformation: Diversity and inclusion –  
A growing number of laws and requirements 
are being enacted to support greater 
diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 
What to look out for: fostering authenticity 
and employee well-being programmes, 
enabling diverse work paths and embedding 
diversity and inclusion through initiatives like 
flexible work practices.

Managing risk strategically

The risk landscape for financial 
services continues to shift 
radically and rapidly. However, 
one thing that has not changed 
is that the business of banking 
remains fundamentally about the 
management of risk. 
Despite the challenging risk landscape, 
Nedbank’s approach to risk management has 
demonstrated great agility in managing the 
quickly evolving risks. Risks are becoming 
increasingly interconnected and emerging 
risks are cutting across and impacting multiple 
risk categories, including the traditional 
banking risks such as capital, credit and 
liquidity, calling for increased ‘integration’ 
of risks and risk management. 

We are committed to creating sustainable 
value through a thorough understanding of the 
needs of all our stakeholders, understanding 
and managing material risks to which the 
group is exposed, as well as maximising value-
adding opportunities that can be pursued 
while managing downside risk.

Our top 10 risks

• Managing risk as a threat to ensure 
responsible growth and sustainability.

• Managing risk as volatility during highly 
uncertain times.

• Managing risk as an opportunity to take 
advantage of opportunities presented by 
upside risk to create or enable value for 
all our stakeholders.

• Managing risk as velocity to manoeuvre 
the speed of change in an agile and safe 
manner without degrading value already 
created.

• Managing risk as predictor using 
predictive and advanced analytics.

• Managing risk as organisational 
resilience to ensure sustainability. 

For 2022, our top 10 risks are selected as top-of-mind risks rather than business-as-usual principal 
risks. Six core objectives underpin our risk management as we aim to remain at the forefront of 
best practice:

Our top risks have evolved, considering the internal and external environment in which we operate. In arriving at the current top 10, 
we have considered the following key developments:

• People risk is now a stand-alone risk as we have noted heightened levels of this risk across the group. The impact of the pandemic, 
coupled with a weak economy, adds to the fear and anxiety for employees in a fast-evolving world of work.

• IT, digital and data risk is also a stand-alone risk due to the pace of change and adaptation to the Fourth Industrial Revolution while 
taking advantage of opportunities it presents and effectively managing the risks. 

• A new risk type has been introduced, namely ESG risks (especially climate risk) as these risks have become materially relevant for 
sustainability.

#1  Business (including country/sovereign and geopolitical) risk

In 2021 we remained in a global and local economic, health and social crisis as a result 
of the Great Lockdown Crisis (GLC) or Covid-19 pandemic, which struck hard in 2020 
and continued into 2021, although health conditions are improving as vaccinations are 
rolled out and many countries are now experiencing strong economic recovery. 

While the economic and financial outlook is much improved, uncertainty remains high 
in SA within a climate of political and social unrest, slow rate of vaccination and low 
levels of GDP growth.

#2 Strategic-execution risk

Execution against the group’s strategy is taking place in the context of an 
extraordinarily complex and challenging operating environment, profoundly impacted 
by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

#3 Credit risk

Credit has become a top risk in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis and a challenging 
macroeconomic environment.

Credit governance and processes across the bank remained efficiently and effectively 
managed. Nedbank Group’s impairment charge decreased by 50% to R6,5bn. The 
group’s CLR decreased from 161 bps at year-end 2020 to 83 bps at year-end 2021, 
back within the TTC risk appetite target range of 60–100 bps. ECL coverage remains 
high at 3,32%.

Nedbank’s wholesale business continued to experience subdued credit demand due 
to ongoing uncertainty and slow economic growth while retail experienced growth 
enabled by the low-interest-rate environment. 

Our response

• Application of our risk management plan in line with our 2022–2024 
business plan to ensure favourable risk outcomes.

• Monitoring the risk landscape and exploring emerging risks and their 
interconnectedness with both emerging and traditional risks.

• Creating value through targeted market share growth, cross-sell (SPT 2.0) 
and increased productivity (TOM 2.0) unlocked by our employees and 
digital transformation.

• Managing TOM 2.0 to ensure continued effectiveness of risk management 
across the organisation, which will lead to efficiency of operations. 

• Ongoing GIA reviews, especially on strategic programmes and programme 
management.

• Monitoring and tracking SPT 2.0 performance against approved targets in 
line with our business plan.

• Ensuring ongoing monitoring of the credit portfolio and reporting through 
the various credit risk governance structures.

• Managing the credit portfolio as well as monitoring the implementation of 
SPT 2.0.

• Ongoing review and enhancements to credit risk models across the bank, 
including stress and scenario testing.

#4  Cyberrisk

An increase in ransomware risk globally and locally has been noted. BitSight research 
indicates that based on the Nedbank score (800), specifically for certain risk vectors, 
there is a reduced likelihood to fall victim to a ransomware incident.

With the commencement of POPIA on 1 July 2021, focus on risks related to privacy of 
data has intensified. Third-party risk management (TPRM) and data loss prevention 
(DLP) remain key focus areas to mature with steady progress made.

Overall, cyberrisk management remains at a mature level and cyberdefences are 
operating effectively.

• Bolstering cyberresilience in the Fourth Industrial Revolution to respond 
with agility to cyberattacks.

• Embedding our Privacy Risk Management Framework as a tool for 
improving privacy through enterprise risk management.

• Continuing with the focus on third parties and suppliers and DLP to 
continue to identify key vulnerabilities and build cost-effective and 
efficient data protection strategies.

53Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



Risk link to six capitals#5 People risk

The group is facing heightened levels of human capital risk, as are most organisations. 
Health and well-being risks are increasing. These risks are attributed to the impact of 
Covid-19, the increased pace and volume of change and the adverse macroeconomic 
environment.

Employee well-being remains a key focus area as our Human Capital Strategy responds 
to the updated context and supports organisational performance. 

Our response

• Supporting (including phased employee reintegration) a hybrid 
physical/digital workplace while focusing on the mental, financial and 
physical well-being of our employees.

• Human-centred leadership and culture that unlocks value.
• Continuous education and awareness to encourage employees to 

vaccinate.

Intellectual

#6 Operational risk/Organisational resilience

Our exposure to operational risk is elevated and is increasing across the group, 
considering the South African external environment. Geopolitical risk includes unrest, 
intermittent electricity supply interruptions, low economic growth, record high levels of 
unemployment, and low investment coupled with the lingering macroeconomic impact 
of Covid-19 on business operations. 

Nedbank’s WFH strategy has been successful in reducing the spread of Covid-19, 
ensuring resilience of operations as well as supporting our clients to transact digitally.

• Ensuring effective operational resilience actions to adjust to future shocks 
and stresses.

• Managing TOM 2.0 to ensure continued effectiveness of risk management 
across the organisation, which will lead to efficiency of operations.

• Continuing to build a strong risk culture across the group while monitoring 
risk appetite at respective governance processes.

#7  Information technology, digital and data risks 

Our IT systems remained stable and resilient.

Risk oversight regarding robotics process automation (RPA), as well as cloud computing, 
is managed through existing frameworks and policies of the bank. There were assurance 
reviews done by GIA and external audit with no adverse findings noted.

There is adequate governance and approval in place relating to the adoption of emerging or 
new technologies and the management of digital risks.

#8  Environmental, social and governance risks (especially climate risk)

ESG risks include environmental, social and governance risks and the potential impact on 
the bank’s reputational and financial performance.

ESG risks and opportunities are key matters for financial institutions to consider ensuring 
sustainability and value creation.

As a purpose-led bank, Nedbank remains committed to playing a leading role in 
addressing climate change in ways that are sensitive to the local socioeconomic context 
and climate vulnerability. 

• Evolving risk management while ensuring agile but responsible, 
accountable, and effective risk management.

• Performing continuous internal control environment assessment and 
refresh.

• Establishing and embedding our ESG Risk Management Framework 
across the group to manage the impact of ESG risks on financial and 
non-financial risks. 

• Considered the implications of outcomes from COP26 in relation to our 
Energy Policy to phase down funding for coal power generation.

• Continuously monitoring our Climate Risk Plan through the various 
governance structures to ensure delivery of deliverables.

Risk link to six capitals#9  Funding risk 

Banks remain essential 
in providing financial 
services to individuals, 
governments and business 
entities. The inability of a 
bank to maintain the right 
balance of liquid assets 
for effective and efficient 
operations threatens its 
financial performance.

Nedbank continues to 
remain compliant with all 
key liquidity ratios and 
liquidity risk remains in 
good shape.

#10 Capital risk

Over the past 18 months 
resilience has become a 
defining characteristic of 
sustainability and success 
for banks globally. Financial 
and operational resilience 
was intensely tested; 
however, banks’ long-term 
efforts to build greater 
and higher quality capital 
and liquidity put banks in a 
strong position going into 
the pandemic and ensured 
resilience.

Our response

• Monitoring and measuring 
the group’s liquidity position 
on an ongoing basis to 
ensure alignment with 
the 2022 internal liquidity 
adequacy assessment 
process (ILAAP).

• Monitoring the execution 
of the SPT 2.0 strategy as 
approved by the board to 
ensure it translates into 
targeted and responsible 
market share growth 
in selected assets and 
transactional deposits 
while uplifting transactional 
banking generally. 

• During 2021, CET1 capital 
levels strengthened to 
12,8% (2020: 10,9%) and 
are above board targets of 
11–12%.

• Managing the group’s 
capital structure in line 
with various stakeholder 
requirements through 
the 2022 internal capital 
adequacy assessment 
process (ICAAP).

• RWA optimisation and 
forecasting to facilitate 
strong capital planning and

unprecedented level of change, and 
reintegration of employees back into the 
workplace, on people risk and ensuring Nedbank

55Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



The impact of the Covid-19 
pandemic in 2020 resulted in 
a pivot in our strategy. Initially, 
our focus was on ‘Resilience’, 
as we managed the group 
through the most restrictive 
phases of the lockdown and the 
extreme volatility experienced in 
financial markets. We switched 
to ‘Transition’ as the strict level 
4 and 5 lockdown levels eased, 
and we reintegrated our full suite 
of financial services. As part of 
business planning in the latter 
part of 2020, our focus shifted 
to ‘Reimagine’ as we strategised 
to emerge stronger in a post-
Covid-19 world, create value 
for stakeholders and set revised 
medium-term targets.

Our vision, values and purpose, 
described on page 16, remain 
central to who we are and what we 
do to remain relevant. Our long-
term targets remain in place, but 
the time frame for reaching them 
has shifted out given the impact 
of the pandemic. These targets 
include growing DHEPS at or above 
nominal GDP plus 5%, achieving an 
ROE above 18% (COE + 3% to 4%) 
and reducing our cost-to-income 
ratio to below 50%.

Our strategy gives us a clear view 
on where we want to focus as a 
purpose-led organisation and what 
we strive to achieve.

Long-term targets Strategic value drivers
Through our strategy we seek to create value by growing revenue 
faster and increasing the levels of productivity, both strongly 
enabled by technology, while maintaining world-class risk and 
capital management metrics. To grow, we are entrenching and 
building on our strengths, while investing in areas that are critical 
to win. We are focusing on growing our share of transactional 
relationships and related deposits across all our businesses, and 
ensuring we deliver market-leading client experiences that will 
help us to attract new clients and to deepen our share of wallet 
among existing clients. To boost our productivity and improve 
operational efficiency, we are building on and accelerating 
existing efforts in optimising our operating model in a more digital 
world, by leveraging the technology platforms we have put in 
place. Our world-class risk management capabilities ensure that 
we balance risk/reward trade-offs.

2023 targets
At the start of 2021 we knew that we had to be realistic and 
understand that the financial targets we set previously were not 
achievable in the Covid-19 environment – in which the economy 
was expected to have its biggest contraction since World War II 
– and we withdrew our previous guidance and medium-to-long-
term financial targets in April 2020. Setting revised targets in 
an environment with such variability was complex, but it was 
something we needed to do, so we know what success looks like 
and to inform our shareholders of the value creation potential, if 
we deliver on them.

In this context, we were one of the first banks to set ourselves 
revised medium-term targets, and by end of 2023 we aimed to 
achieve DHEPS greater than the 2019 level (2 565 cents); ROE 
greater than the 2019 level (2019: 15,0%); a cost-to-income 
ratio lower than 54% (2019: 56,5%); and to be rated first in NPS 
(2019: third), having improved to the number-two position among 
all South African banks in the Consulta survey of 2020.

One year later, on the back of strong financial performance in 2021, 
we now expect to achieve our DHEPS target one year earlier, in 
2022. Our ROE and cost-to-income targets remain adequately 
stretched, but we believe achievable and value-creating for 
shareholders. We maintained our number two NPS ranking, 
improving our score to 47% and came a step closer to our aim of 
ranking first on client satisfaction by the end of 2023.

Strategic value unlocks
Our strategy is delivered through five strategic value unlocks: delivering innovative 
market-leading client solutions; ongoing disruptive market activities (underpinned by 
digital leadership); focusing on areas that create value (SPT 2.0); driving efficient execution 
(including TOM 2.0); and creating positive impacts, including delivering on our purpose of 
using our financial expertise to do good.

Digital sales – On the back of 
Eclipse and the introduction 
of new digital channels, digital 
sales in RBB increased to 49% 
of all sales (from 21% in 2019), 
with a target of more than 75% 
for the medium term. Excluding 
MobiMoney, digital sales increased 
to 33% (from 12% in 2019).

Digital activity – Our clients’ access 
to banking improved, as digitally 
active retail users increased by 11% 
yoy to 2,3 million. This equated to 
35% of total clients (from 24% in 
2019, with a medium-to-long-term 
target of 70%) and 64% of digitally 
active main-banked clients (from 
49% in 2019) respectively. Digitally 
active clients in our NAR businesses 
increased by 7%.

To increase digital adoption, we 
will continue to enhance client 
experiences on our digital products 
and educate clients on the use and 
benefits of digital banking.

Digital servicing – Additional 
self-service options for functions 
that were previously available only 
in branches or through employee-
assisted channels were released 
on our digital channels, taking the 
total digital self-service functions 
to 171 (compared with 114 in 
2019). This digitisation of services 
in the retail business, along with 
the impact of the lockdown, has 
enabled us to increase digital 
service volumes by 28%. These 
include self-service options such 
as balance enquiries, transfers 
between accounts, beneficiary 
management, limit changes and 
card freezes.

Our aspiration is to achieve 75% of our new

products and services (enhancing our intellectual 
and manufactured capitals). These aspirations 
are informed by global benchmarks, derived from 
financial services providers that are regarded as 
leaders in digital transformation, such as DBS 
and ING.
• Eclipse – Our simplified digital client onboarding platform for 

individual clients continued to mature and expand, allowing 
individual clients to open FICA-compliant accounts remotely 
through our employee-assisted and self-service digital channels, 
by providing a seamless omnichannel experience. All new client 
onboarding and product sales is in place across six of our top 10 
products (transactional products, personal loans, investments, 
card issuing, overdrafts and home loans). Foreign exchange, the roll-
out of student loans and selective Nedbank Insurance products, 
including MyCover Funeral and MyCover Life, will be available on 
the Eclipse platform during 2022.

• Nedbank Business Hub – The Nedbank Business Hub is a single, 
secure digital interface that enables CIB and RBB business clients 
to apply for, maintain and transact on their accounts in a self-
service manner, leveraging our new digital tokenless security 
and enabling a step change in client experience for businesses. 
The hub provides a convenient platform for clients from which 
they have a single view of relevant digital offerings and are able 
to transact and apply for products (transacting, lending and 
borrowing) or services, to name a few functionalities. While 
migration to this modernised platform remains a key priority, the 
convergence of the various juristic digital channels has gained 
momentum, with a first release targeting July 2022. From a digital-
servicing perspective, an additional 100+ juristic services are 
intended to be digitised by end-2023.

Independent review –  
of our ME technology strategy

In 2021, the ME programme was benchmarked by two global 
consulting firms against a globally recognised peer group of 
14 local and international banks across five key dimensions 
(business case; digital readiness; architecture; governance, 
people and adoption; and regulation and risk) to give insights 
into Nedbank’s relative positioning to the peer group. The 
benchmarking exercise confirmed that the ME philosophy and 
approach of a stepwise technology modernisation was in line with 
that of successful international peers. The findings concluded that 
ME has delivered value on an ongoing basis and that Nedbank is 
one of few enterprises in the benchmarking peer group that has 
achieved revenue uplift from its IT transformation programme. 
Similarly, the assessment concurs with Nedbank’s focus of creating 
distinctive client experiences in support of digital penetration and 
sustainable client retention through increased cross-sell.

85% complete by December 2021.

In underpinning our digital successes lies the significant progress we have made on our technology strategy: ME (manufactured and intellectual capital).

Our ambition is to become a more client-
focused, digital, competitive and agile bank, 
and our ME strategy, which encompasses 
the modernisation of our core banking 
environment, is providing an enhanced 
digital platform to enable delivery of our 
digital products and services and faster 
product development. Modernisation of 
core banking systems has been central to 
delivering innovative, market-leading client 
experiences, while ensuring we remain at the 
forefront of cyberresilience. We have studied 
many banks across the world and concluded 
that our ME approach, as opposed to a big-
bang or opportunistic patching, is the most 
cost-effective and efficient approach to core 
systems replacement.

Our ME strategy and technology 
transformation programme has reached 
85% completion. Most foundational IT 
programmes are either complete or nearing 
completion, and the group’s intangible 
software assets are expected to have peaked 
in 2021 at R8,9bn, in line with reducing levels 
of IT cash flow spend. The rationalisation, 
standardisation and simplification of our core 
banking systems, from 250 now down to 78 
(target of 65 to 75), are enabling reduced 
infrastructure, support and maintenance 
costs; less complexity; and increased agility 
in adopting new innovations. The benefits of 
ME are evident in the digital progress we have 
made, as well as the realisation of benefits 
through TOM 1.0 and TOM 2.0.

Avo is a one-stop super app enabling clients to buy 
essential products and services online and have them 
delivered to their home, with seamless payments and 
credit enabled by the Avo digital wallet and Nedbank 
lending. Since its launch in June 2020 to December 2021, 
Avo has signed up more than 675 000 customers 
(4,7 times growth yoy), along with over 20 250 businesses 
(3 times growth yoy) offering their products and services 
on this e-commerce platform. Product orders continue

merchandise value (GMV) achieved. We continue to enjoy 
favourable ratings across the Google and Apple app 
stores, with ratings of 3,9 and 4,3 achieved respectively. 
The launch of Avo Auto and the Avo B2B marketplace is 
expected to strongly support further scaling efforts of 
the platform. Our focus is to get the platform to scale, and 
the progress continues to exceed our expectations as our 
initial target of more than one million users in 2022 was 
achieved at the end of February 2022.

• APIs – After having been the first bank in Africa to 
launch an API platform (API_Marketplace) that is 
aligned with the Open Banking Standard (PSD2), we 
made good progress in scaling the platform by allowing 
approved partners to leverage the bank’s financial 
capabilities, by integrating into our standard, secure 
and scalable APIs. The number of third parties active 
on the API_Marketplace has increased to 45 (2020: 17). 
Third-party interest in the API_Marketplace continues 
to grow. The number of active APIs used increased 
from eight (December 2020) to nine. An example 
of a successful implementation is the enablement 
of personal-loans disbursals, which increased by 
360% yoy, supporting our market share increase in 
this product. Our focus on expanding these channels 
continues into 2022 and beyond.

• Karri app – The Karri payments app made a strong 
recovery as schools reopened in 2021. Notwithstanding 
the material impact of Covid-19 on traditional event 
and sport tour collections (the main driver of usage 
and value of collections pre-Covid-19), we managed 
to increase active users back to pre-Covid-19 levels 
by adding new functionality and increasing the value 
offered to schools, enabling the highest active usage 
from March to May 2021. Karri now has well over 800 
organisations that are using the app, with a database of 
parents and children in excess of 1,2 million. The Karri 
app is now more relevant than ever with a database 
of well over one million potential users and one of the 
highest app store ratings (currently 4,5). As schools 
return to normality, we are expecting a return to 
exponential growth.

As traditional revenue streams come under pressure, banks are increasingly looking for revenue growth 
opportunities beyond banking or finding value-adding solutions to accompany existing solutions. Over the 
past few years we have introduced beyond-banking initiatives such Avo, our super app, APIs and value-
added services on our digital channels (eg buying electricity, data, airtime and lottery tickets). In addition, 
the Karri app and various other digital solutions and platforms create delightful client experiences.

Ongoing disruptive 
market activities

Our disruptive market activities place us in a strong position to 
compete with new entrants and existing banks in the market. We 
continue to invest in data-related activities and platform-related 
activities as we evolve our business model continually to underpin 
future growth.

• New innovations – In 2021, in addition to 
various app enhancements, we launched 
several new innovations, including the 
following: 

 » A new broad range of financial wellness 
tools, including credit score ratings with 
helpful tips for clients and enhanced 
MoneyTracker functionality tools, allowing 
for spend categorisation and management.

 » RBB and Nedbank Private Wealth launched 
Apple Pay, which enables clients to make 
cashless, contactless payments using an 
Apple device. Since its launch in March 
2021 (as one of only three banks in SA), we 
have seen excellent uptake in client usage 
and payments continue to grow every 
month. This mobile payment capability 
follows our scan-to-pay capability as well as 
Samsung, Garmin and Fitbit Pay solutions 
launched in prior periods.

 » We launched Money Message, an innovative 
invoice and payment solution that enables 
small businesses to create and send 
invoices, and receive payments easily 
and securely on WhatsApp, which is the 
dominant messaging platform in SA. It also 
complements Nedbank’s tap-on-phone 
solution, which enables businesses to 
accept payments by simply using an Android 
smartphone for contactless card payments.

 » In NAR, we continued to release new 
features, including digital wallets, self-
enrolment and value-added services. 
The implementation of automated 
credit scoring enhanced our credit 
decision-making capability and provides 
integrated insights on managing credit 
risk and understanding our clients.

 » In Nedbank Insurance, we extended our

Over the past 12 months we increased market share in key 
advances categories as per the SARB BA 900 returns, including 
personal loans (12,2% market share, up by 1,0%) and household 
overdrafts (9,9% market share, up by 1,9%). We also increased 
our share in vehicle finance (36,9% market share, up by 0,4%), 
leveraging our market-leading position and unique business 
model that is skewed to financing used and lower-value vehicles. 
These gains were supported by increased levels of client take-up 
rates, enabled by digital channels, notwithstanding tightening of 
credit criteria. In home loans our market share of 14,2% declined 
marginally by 0,2%. In wholesale lending we were selective in 
granting loans as we continued to manage risk and focused 
on increasing net interest margins, resulting in a decline in 

We have increased our focus on areas that create value, particularly through strategic portfolio tilt 
(SPT 2.0), which is a groupwide strategy focused on right-sizing certain advances market shares, 
growing our transactional banking franchise and cross-selling into transactional deposits through 
integrated client value propositions.

After realising cumulative TOM 1.0 savings of R2,0bn in 
2020 relating to the benefits from building a modernised 
technology platform (ME) and agile innovation methodologies, 
we launched TOM 2.0 in 2021. This strategic enabler is aimed 
at using the ME platform to deliver a more efficient operating 
model to drive down the group’s cost-to-income ratio and 
mitigate risks of unanticipated economic headwinds. TOM 2.0 
is focused on optimising the shape of our infrastructure 
(branches and corporate real estate), shifting our RBB 
structure so that it is more client-centred and optimising our 
shared-services functions across the group as a direct result 
of the digital benefits from ME. In 2021 we recorded savings 
of R967m on the way to our target to unlock cumulative 
revenue uplift and costs savings of R2,5bn by the end of 
2023 (of which approximately 90% relates to cost savings). 
The business case of our technology investments, including 
ME, evident in the value unlocks through TOM 1.0 and 
TOM 2.0, remains intact as the group’s annual amortisation 
charge (R1,7bn in 2021) remains below the cumulative benefit 
of these initiatives. In addition, annual IT cash flow spend has 
declined, after having peaked in 2017.

Transform technology
More uptime, with more partners 
integrated and greater use of data. 
In addition, more innovation for 
less spend, accelerated innovation 
delivery and a technology 
platform that allows Nedbank to 
offer solutions across multiple 
ecosystems.

Reset third-party spending
Optimising our supply chain and 
enhanced digitised procurement.

Technological developments not only enhance client experiences and enable new streams of revenue 
growth, but also provide opportunities for improving efficiency by bringing new digital offerings to the 
market more quickly, lowering the cost to serve and optimising the overall cost base through the reduction 
of branch sizes and ancillary costs. Central to us achieving our medium-term cost-to-income-ratio target of 
less than 54% and long-term target of less than 50%, is optimising the efficiency of our operations.

Together, the SDGs (as forward-looking strategic levers) and ESG (as a backward-looking measure of financing activities), keep us 
on track to fulfil our purpose. Through our sustainable-development finance commitments, we aim to become a model that other 
finance institutions emulate to address the world’s environmental, social and governance challenges. We know that a relentless 
focus on sustainable-development finance rather than philanthropy is the most impactful lever we, and all other banks, have at our 
disposal to drive progress towards the achievement of these SDGs.

We acknowledge that we, alongside 
our stakeholders, operate in a nested, 
interdependent system. This means 
that for our business to succeed, we 
need a thriving economy, a well-
functioning  society and a healthy 
environment. We also recognise that 
sustainability issues such as climate 
change, inequality, social justice 
and, most recently, pandemics are 
playing an increasingly material role 
in shaping this system. Our purpose 
guides our strategy, behaviours 
and actions towards the delivery 
of long-term system value for us 
and our stakeholders. We use the 
Nedbank Sustainable Development 
Framework to focus our efforts 
and identify business opportunities 
and risks as well as cost savings. 
While the exact size of these 
opportunities and savings may differ 
across geographies at a global level, 
they are substantial. The Business 
and Sustainable Development 
Commission estimates them to be 
over US$12tn annually by 2030.

We prioritised nine of the 17 SDGs 
where we believe we have the 
greatest ability to deliver meaningful 
impact through innovation in our 
banking products, lending and 
investment practices. These nine 
goals are being championed by nine 

Banks play a central role in driving sustainable socioeconomic development for the benefit of all stakeholders 
and helping to create the desired future by providing capital for investment in the real economy. Banks’ 
financing choices must help to enable the necessary transition to a net-zero economy.

Creating 
positive impacts

group executives who are mandated 
to ensure that the percentage of 
our lending and investment towards 
sustainable-development finance 
grows in a manner commensurate 
with the needs of our clients, the 
size of the strategic opportunities 
offered and our desire to capture a 
competitive advantage in this area.

The increasing attention to, and 
prioritisation of, ESG factors by 
organisations and their investors is 
adding impetus to the realisation 
of the SDGs as economic activity 
starts to ‘normalise’ following 
two harrowing Covid-19 years. At 
Nedbank, we recognise that there 
can be no authentic response to ESG 
matters without genuine ambition 
to be an effective catalytic agent of 
positive change. Being effective is 
possible only with a clearly defined 
purpose that acts as an organisation’s 
north star. For Nedbank that means 
using our financial expertise to do 
good for our stakeholders, using the 
SDGs as the guide for investing in 
new markets and meeting unmet 
client needs.

Renewable-energy (REIPPPP) financing
(Exposures, Rbn)

Nedbank Sustainable Development 
Framework: Sustainable-
development finance focus

Key progress in 2021 on creating positive impacts include 
the following:
• We released our Energy Policy, which seeks to guide the transition away from 

fossil fuels, while accelerating efforts to finance non-fossil-energy solutions 
needed to support socioeconomic development and build resilience to climate 
change. The Energy Policy will ensure that Nedbank has zero exposure to 
fossil-fuel-related activities (thermal coal, upstream oil and gas, and power 
generation) by 2045, with 100% of lending and investment activity supporting 
a net-zero carbon economy by 2050, while accelerating funding to key sectors 
such as renewable and embedded energy.

• To date we have provided renewable-energy lending limits of R36,5bn and 
significant growth opportunities from embedded energy in the years to come.  

• As at 31 December 2021, we have provided and/or raised over R100bn in 
SDG-related financing and funding relating to SDGs 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15.

• On the funding side we were the first bank in Africa’s to bring a green AT1 
instrument to market, raising R910m, with the equivalent amount to be 
directed to supporting the financing of new green infrastructure projects 
in SA. In addition, we structured and arranged a R1,1bn Green Residential 
Development Bond for Nedbank Limited, issued under its domestic medium-
term note programme and listed on the Sustainability Segment of the JSE 
in December 2021. In total, R9,8bn of sustainable-development funding has 
been raised to date, a 3,6 times increase since 2019.

• Across both funding and financing we expect continued strong growth into 
the future as we embrace our purpose and embed the strategic enabler of 
creating positive impacts across more SDGs.

Our Human Capital Strategy

Our Human Capital 
Strategy leverages 
the evolving world 
of work and is a 
key enabler of the 
group’s strategy. 
At its core is our 
people vision 
of positioning 
Nedbank as an 
employer of choice 
that develops, 
attracts, and 
retains critical 
talent and skills.

Our People Promise is delivered through four key strategic choices:

The performance of our workforce 
can be sustained only through 
a focus on their holistic well-
being and a range of competitive 
benefits that offers greater choice.

Digital transformation that is 
supported by a changed operating 
model, organisation design and 
workforce composition with the 
aim to drive efficiency, agility and 
competitiveness.

A culture shift that enables the 
evolving Nedbank operating model, 
leveraging human-centred leadership 
and inspiring our workforce. Our 
People Promise guides our employee 
experiences and is measured  
through regular pulse surveys.

A highly skilled, diverse and 
transformed workforce, appropriately  
representative of society, is key to 
remaining competitive. We continue 
to focus on reskilling our workforce 
for a new reality and creating a sense 
of belonging for all.

Our human-centred leadership 
approach, introduced in January 
2021, is the outcome of a 
collaborative exercise with our 
leaders and resulted in a future-fit 
leadership framework.  

One example of its initial success 
is increasing levels of pride that 
employees have in our banking 
products and services, seen in our 
pulse survey NPS scores. 

Transformation initiatives such as 
LGBTQIA+, and our women’s and 
disability forums are adding value to 
employees through various channels 
and activities. 

In addition, we spent R1,1bn on 
learning and development in 2021. 

We continue to make progress 
on our diversity profile and this 
supported the achievement of our 
level 1 BBBEE status.

We continue to offer employees 
attractive salaries and benefits, 
including on average a 3,5% salary 
increase in 2021 and 4,0% in 2022.

Our bankwide virtual campaigns 
on mental well-being saw more 
than 4 000 employees book 
sessions on topics such as mental, 
physical and financial well-being

employee value proposition from those of our competitors.

Growth comes from striving to be a 
better version of ourselves each day.

We never stop developing ourselves, 
bringing our potential to life by making 
the most of every learning opportunity 
and facing challenges with courage. 
With our finger on the pulse and our 
eyes on tomorrow, we seize every 
opportunity to make an impact, with 
an unshakeable shared passion.

We strive to create a culture of 
inclusion and belonging.

Celebrating diversity, we welcome 
everyone and anyone who shares our 
passion for our purpose. We treat 
each colleague, stakeholder and 
client with care, respect and integrity 
– because that is who we are. When 
things go wrong, we communicate 
openly to learn from mistakes, 
reminding ourselves to be the 
difference that impacts our world.

Our purpose is clear: To use our 
financial expertise to do good.

This is what drives us to be the 
difference that impacts our world 
every day. Integrity, good ethics and 
values-based behaviour are our way 
of life. We act with purpose in every 
step, spreading the Nedbank magic to 
bring about positive change, because 
managing money with purpose makes 
a real difference in people’s lives and 
in our world.

It’s in our nature to look at the world 
differently. Our purpose fuels us to 
make an impact and this drives us 
to perform better, work smarter and 
reach higher.

This strong results orientation is 
supported by our developmental 
approach to performance 
management. When we are good at 
what we do, our clients see money 
differently and live better lives as a 
result. That is the impact we are after.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

I love that I can make 
a difference, contribute 
towards excellent 
client service and that 
Nedbank values me as 
an employee.

I love the diversity and 
the respect everyone 
has for each one’s 
cultures, values and 
differences in opinions.

Because I learn every day, 
I also see a lot of potential 
for growth. The opportunity 
to learn and grow is 
priceless.

The reason I love Nedbank 
is because it has given me 
meaning in what I do, a place 
to call home, as well as the 
opportunity to positively 
impact the world.

I like serving people 
and solving problems 
while adhering to targets 
and objectives.

Our Human Capital Strategy continued

69Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



Making strategic trade-offs is key to ensuring we are well positioned for the future. As part of our integrated thinking, the board and group 
executive continuously assess the availability and quality of capital inputs, balance the short and long term and make tough decisions to create 
long-term value. Below are four key trade-offs we made and the rationale behind our decisions.

Making strategic trade-offs and assessing the impact on our capitals 

From a financial capital 
perspective, our focus at 
the height of the Covid-19 
pandemic was on managing 
liquidity, capital, market, 
operational and credit risk, 
with less focus on profitability 
other than as an initial buffer 
against capital erosion 
(trade-off between long-term 
sustainability versus short-
term profitability). In 2021 we 
delivered on the trade-off 
we made in 2020 as headline 
earnings increased by 115% 
(declined by 57% in 2020) 
and ROE improved to 12,5% 
(both still below 2019 levels), 
while capital and liquidity 
metrics are now stronger than 
they were ahead of the crisis 
(2019), well above regulatory 
minima and above internal 
board targets.

As financial products and services 
(manufactured capital) are 
increasingly digitised, there is a 
trade-off between employees 
(human capital), physical outlets 
(manufactured capital) and 
digital products and services 
(manufactured and intellectual 
capital). Through automation and 
increased client adoption of digital 
solutions that drive improved client 
experiences (social and relationship 
capital), the need for direct human 
interaction is reduced.

From a capital allocation 
perspective, a reduction in overall 
headcount and headcount-
dependent activities (such as in-
branch teller services) and outlets 
(branch numbers and size), results in 
cost savings. These cost savings are 
partially offset by the impact of IT 
investments (financial capital).

strength during a crisis

The trade-off of digital versus traditional banking

Key business model shift
Our strategy supports delivery of our long- and medium-term 
targets and aims to improve profitability over the next few 
years. We have a strong balance sheet to support growth 
and at the same time protect us against any unexpected 
downside risks.

70Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



The number of employees 
(human capital) required for 
traditional and administrative 
roles is reducing as client 
behaviour changes and 
we digitise and automate 
processes, embrace digital 
innovations (manufactured 
and intellectual capital) and 
invest in skills required (human 
and intellectual capital) in the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
Covid-19 has fast-tracked the 
adoption of working-from-
home practices, underpinned 
by appropriate IT support 
to make this happen, as 
well as the way we operate 
through TOM 2.0, evident 
in new branch formats and 
an ongoing reduction in our 
own commercial real estate. 
We consider the implications 
of reduced headcount on 
employees and focus on 
primarily using natural attrition 
to reduce headcount and 
redeploy and reskill affected 
employees.

In the context of scarce 
capital and liquidity (financial 
capital), there is an ongoing 
and conscious trade-off 
between business and product 
opportunities that are highly 
capital- and liquidity-consuming 
with low economic profit, and 
those that are less consumptive 
with more economic profit.

However, we are also tilting our 
portfolio to areas that create 
positive impact. For example, we 
are supporting the diversification 
of SA’s electricity supply (natural 
capital) and reducing our impact 
on the environment (natural 
capital).

Over the long term this will be 
financially beneficial (financial 
capital) for all our stakeholders 
(social capital).

Trade-offs as we transition towards the workforce of the future Portfolio tilt in line with our purpose and the SDGs

Key business model shift
Within the context of the evolving world of work, 
we seek to develop innovative people practices, 
driving engagement and productivity, as more of 
our employees are enabled to work remotely.

In 2021 the South African economy bounced back faster than most 
forecasters expected from the low base of 2020 caused by the strict 
lockdowns. The local economy has subsequently benefited from a 
surge in global commodity prices and stronger global demand. 
Mike Davis, Chief Financial Officer

A reflection on the operating environment
unrest in parts of the country and 
frequent power outages resulted in a 
sharp contraction in economic activity. 
Trading conditions improved in Q4, 
enabled by government’s decision to 
leave the country at the most lenient 
lockdown level 1 despite the onset of 
the fourth Covid-19 wave triggered 
by the Omicron variant. We saw less 
negative impact from lockdowns in  
Q4, and this was beneficial to us and 
our clients. 

Client turnover data from our point-
of-sale devices and digital channels, 
shown on page 11, illustrates how 
retail activity had a strong recovery in 
H2 2020 and into 2021.

From a corporate banking perspective, 
activity remained constrained and 
business confidence levels were 
below 50. Fixed investment activity 

has generally remained depressed, 
undermined by uncertain growth 
prospects, continued policy 
uncertainties and frequent power 
outages. Towards the end of 2021, 
growth in fixed investment started 
to gradually recover off a low base 
and, pleasingly, there are some green 
shoots emerging.

From a retail or household perspective, 
the operating environment continued 
to be supportive. Household debt 
moderated to 67% of disposable 
income and, along with a lower interest 
rate environment, was evident in 
solid demand for prime-linked credit 
products and also beneficial to clients 
as debt-servicing costs reduced. 
This improvement in cash flows for 
those who have remained employed, 
is evident in lower credit loss ratios 
across all our businesses.

Reflections from our Chief Financial Officer

After a volatile and difficult year for 
the South African banking sector in 
2020, 2021 saw client transactional 
activity rebound and market volatility 
return to more normalised levels, 
although corporate deal flow across 
various sectors remained weak. 
Impairments declined significantly, 
underpinned by the improving 
operating environment for clients, 
including the impact of lower interest 
rates and due to the normalisation 
of forward-looking IFRS 9 portfolio 
impairments. The banking sector 
continues to demonstrate strong 
levels of resilience, remaining well 
capitalised, liquid and profitable. 

Multiple shocks disrupted SA’s 
economic recovery in the third 
quarter of the year. A prolonged third 
wave of Covid-19 infections, tighter 
lockdown restrictions, the July civil

Strong financial performance off a low base and key 
resilience metrics above pre-crisis levels 

During 2021 our balance sheet strengthened 
further while we closed the resilience phase 
of our strategic response to the Covid-19 
pandemic.

• CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios of 12,8% and 
14,3% improved on 2020 and are now 
also well above the pre-Covid-19 levels of 
11,5% and 12,8% respectively. These ratios 
are also well above the SARB minimum 
requirements and the group’s board-
approved target ranges.

• The average LCR for Q4 2021 of 128% 
was well above the regulatory minimum 
level of 80% under the PA’s Directive 
1/2020 (revised in 2020 from 100%) and 
an NSFR of 116% was well above the 100% 
regulatory minimum.

Drivers of shareholder 
value creation
I was particularly pleased with progress on 
the key drivers of shareholder value creation, 
including the following:

• NAV per share increased strongly by 11% to 
20 493 cents.

• ROE for the period increased to 12,5%, well 
above 6,2% in 2020, although still below the 
2019 level of 15%.

• The group resumed dividend payments 
in 2021 (payout ratio of 57%), with a total 
dividend of 1  191 cents at 2,02 times cover 
within the group’s board-approved dividend 
target range of 1,75 times to 2,25 times.

The underlying financial performance is 
discussed in more detail on the following 
pages.

Headline earnings increased by 115% to R11,7bn 
and is only 7% below 2019 pre-crisis levels of 
R12,5bn. Headline earnings was impacted by a 
significant decline in the impairment charge and 
strong revenue growth.

• Preprovisioning operating profit increased by 
9%, driven primarily by the following:

 » Net interest income (NII) increased by 8%, 
driven largely by a 37 bps increase in the net 
interest margin.

 » Non-interest revenue (NIR) increased by 
4% given a recovery in commission and 
fee income, as well as insurance and equity 
revaluations, partially offset by the impact 
of a high 2020 trading base and fair-value 
unwinds.

 » Associate income of R686m, relating to 
the group’s 21% shareholding in Ecobank 
Transnational Incorporated for the period 
has been recognised (up more than 100% 
when compared to a loss of R178m in 2020).

 » Expenses remained well managed and grew 
6% due to higher variable-pay incentives 
that are aligned to the improved profitability 
metrics and ongoing investment in 
technology.

• The 50% decline in the impairment charge 
with CLR down to 83 bps was driven by a 
significantly better collections experience as 
clients benefited from the rate cuts in 2020, 
macroeconomic benefits coming through in 
the IFRS 9 models as GDP growth forecasts 
improved during the period and the decline in 
Directive 7/2015 restructured loans.

AIEBA declined by 3%, negatively impacted by the H1 reduction in CIB loans and 
advances as clients used excess liquidity to repay committed facilities and muted 
demand for new wholesale credit, offset by ongoing growth momentum in higher-
yielding RBB loans. NIM increased by 37 bps to 3,73%. This increase was driven 
by higher levels of capital (endowment benefit), improved asset pricing and asset 
mix changes (retail advances grew faster than wholesale advances), an improved 
liability mix and active balance sheet management. Nedbank is positioned 
positively for a rise in interest rates, gaining an additional R1,6bn NII (pre-tax) for 
each 100 bps increase in interest rates over a 12-month period. 

NII growth to be around upper single digits. This 
growth will be driven by ongoing momentum 
in RBB lending, some recovery in CIB lending, 
the benefit from 125 bps expected increases in 
interest rates and as a result of a higher NIM.

Impairments charge on loans and advances
Key drivers: Impairments decreased by 50%, driven by benefits of an improved 
macroeconomic environment, better-than-expected collection outcomes in a low-
interest-rate environment, a reduction in stage 3 loans as clients cured, including the 
decline in Directive 7/2015 (restructured) loans and a release of some of the overlays 
that were raised during the crisis as risks did not emerge or are now captured in the 
new IFRS 9 models. The group’s CLR decreased from 161 bps in December 2020 
to 83 bps in December 2021, an outcome that is now back within the group’s TTC 
target range of 60 bps to 100 bps. Judgemental and macroeconomic overlays 
reduced to R1,5bn from R3,9bn in 2020, as they remain either released into models, 
released through the income statement or remained in place.

CLR to be in the top half of our TTC target range 
of 60 bps to 100 bps, that is 80 bps to 100 bps.

Non-interest revenue
Key drivers: The 4% increase in NIR was driven by increased levels of client-
related transactional activity, a normalisation of equity revaluations off the 2020 
base and higher levels of insurance income. This growth was offset partially by the 
unwind of a significant proportion of the group’s fair-value gains recorded in 2020 
and the impact of a high trading revenue base in the prior period. 

NIR to be around high single digits as 
transactional activity continues to recover, 
strategic initiatives, including main-banked 
client gains, cross-sell and new revenue streams 
contribute to growth and the volatility relating to 
the group’s fair-value hedge accounting solution 
is reduced and not expected to recur.

Total operating expenses
Key drivers: Expenses increased by 6%, reflecting the impacts of higher variable-
pay incentives off a low 2020 base and ongoing investment in technology and 
digital solutions, offset partially by ongoing optimisation benefits. Computer 
processing costs increased by 9% and, importantly, the rate of growth in the 
amortisation charge is slowing as our ME technology journey matures. Excluding 
variable-pay incentive costs, expenses increased by 2% as a result of good cost 
management, a focus on efficiencies and discretionary spend.

Expenses growth to be above mid-single digits, 
reflecting the impact of ongoing investment in 
our technology platform and digital solutions, 
the return of some discretionary spend such as 
sponsorships, and new regulatory costs such  
as deposit insurance and Twin Peaks, offset 
partially by cost-saving initiatives that support  
our achieving the 2023 cost-to-income target.

Dividends
Key drivers: On the back of our solid capital and liquidity position, the group 
paid a total dividend of 1 191 cents per share at 2,02 times cover. We believe the 
return to paying dividends and an attractive dividend yield should be attractive to 
shareholders.

Dividend payments, supported by the group’s 
robust balance sheet, are expected to be aligned 
with the group’s board-approved dividend policy 
and target range of between 1,75 times to 2,25 
times.

1 During the year, the group reviewed its statement of comprehensive income presentation. 
As a result of the review, certain line descriptions have been updated, subtotals have been 
removed and the ‘Non-interest revenue and income’ line item has been disaggregated. 
These changes represent reclassifications to the statement of comprehensive income 
presentation. It is the group’s view that these changes provide more relevant disclosures 
on its financial performance. To provide comparability, the prior-year balances have been 
restated accordingly. These reclassifications had no impact on the group’s statement of 
financial position, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows.

RBB gross banking advances
(Rbn)

CIB gross banking advances
(Rbn)

An indication of the strength of our 
balance sheet based on our own capital.

2022 outlook
(at 9 March 2022)

Banking loans and advances
Key drivers: Gross banking loans and advances increased by 1%, driven by 
ongoing momentum in RBB advances growth and turnaround growth in CIB 
banking advances in H2 2021 from a sharp decline in H1 2021 as our corporate 
clients used excess cash to reduce their facilities. 

Loan growth should be positive in 2022, 
supported by continued economic recovery 
and our SPT 2.0 Strategy. This growth will be 
driven by ongoing momentum in RBB lending 
with some recovery in CIB lending.

Amounts owed to depositors
Key drivers: Deposits grew by 2% with current and savings accounts, along with 
cash management deposits, increasing by 6%, driven by some clients holding 
cash short for short-term operational requirements and potential rate hikes in 
2022. Call and term deposits increased by 8% and fixed deposits decreased by 
5% as retail and commercial clients opted to keep their cash short or in notice 
deposits due to forecasted rate hikes. NCDs decreased by 18% as surplus cash 
was used to pay down expensive marginal deposits. 

In line with our SPT 2.0 Strategy we expect 
deposit growth to remain ahead of loan 
growth, and market share gains in household 
and commercial transactional deposits over 
time, by ensuring we deliver market-leading 
client experiences that will help us attract new 
clients and a deepened share of wallet among 
existing clients.

CET1 ratio
Key drivers: The group remains strongly capitalised. Our CET1 is above the top 
end of the group’s board-approved target range, which was revised from 11% 
to 12% from 1 January 2022 and is well above pre-crisis levels of 11,5% and 
the SARB minimum requirement of 8,5%. The improvement in the CET1 ratio 
was driven by strong organic earnings growth and lower risk-weighted assets, 
including the benefits of deliberate optimisation initiatives, offset partially by the 
payment of our interim dividend.

Our CET1 capital ratio is expected to remain 
above the board-approved target range of 
11% to 12%, with adequate buffers in place to 
support our clients and the economy.

78Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



Significant accounting matters
As a consequence of the adverse macroeconomic environment and 
the decrease in Covid-19- and macro-related judgemental post-model 
adjustments (overlays), the assessment of impairments continues 
to be a significant accounting matter. Overlays decreased to R1,5bn 
(December 2020: R3,9bn) as risks were now either accounted for in the 
refined IFRS 9 models (R1 698m – impairment neutral), released through 
the income statement (R675m – credit to impairments as these risks 
did not emerge) or retained (R1 518m – impairment neutral) and remain 
relevant for elevated risk in specific portfolios or new risks identified. 
Overall coverage increased from 3,25% of total loans and advances at 
31 December 2020 to 3,32% at 31 December 2021, reflecting prudent 
credit risk management.

Fair-value adjustments related to the valuation of group treasury and 
trading instruments, including funding valuation adjustments, were 
assessed as being a significant accounting matter. The accounting 
volatility in the group’s macro fair-value hedge accounting solution 
remained well within the accounting effectiveness thresholds, but model 
methodology enhancements, including a change in percentage of risk 
designated within the group’s fixed-rate government bond portfolio that 
are expected to reduce accounting volatility going forward during periods 
of extreme market movements, were implemented during H2 2021.

Auditor independence
Following a comprehensive tender process, Ernst & Young was appointed 
as a new joint external auditor of Nedbank and Nedbank Group in 2019, 
alongside Deloitte. Deloitte’s rotation will be finalised for our 2024 financial 
year with an announcement expected to be made during H2 2022. This 
is in line with the rule on mandatory audit firm rotation (MAFR) of the 
Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors, effective from 1 April 2023, 
requiring that if a firm has served as an appointed auditor for 10 or more 
consecutive financial years before the financial year commencing on or 
after 1 April 2023, the audit firm may not accept reappointment as auditor. 
Some shareholders early-adopt MAFR principles in their proxy voting. We 
continue to reiterate our commitment to implement MAFR fully. However, 
we are limited in the short term by regulatory requirements and the 
complexity and practicality of changing both auditors in a short period.

Financial outlook over the short, medium and long term

Medium term
We are on track to meet our 
medium-term targets set for 
the end of 2023. Pleasingly, we 
now expect to meet the DHEPS 
target (greater than 2 565 cents 
per share) in 2022 a year ahead 
of our previous expectation. We 
continue to focus on achieving 
an ROE greater than the 2019 
ROE level of 15% and reducing 
our cost-to-income ratio to 
below 54%. Meeting these 
targets will be supported by our 
strategy that seeks to create 
value by growing revenue and 
increasing levels of productivity, 
both enabled strongly by 
technology, while maintaining 
world-class risk and capital 
management metrics.

Long term (5+ years)
In the longer term, we aim to 
increase our ROE to greater 
than 18% (or COE plus 3% to 
4%) and reduce our cost-to-
income ratio to below 50%. 
To achieve this, in the external 
environment, we would need 
SA GDP growth to be higher 
than the 1% to 2% forecast for 
the next few years, interest rates 
to be at least 200 bps higher 
from current levels (increasing 
gradually not to put clients under 
increased stress) and a stronger 
infrastructure investment drive 
that will be beneficial for our 
strong business and corporate 
banking franchises. Internally, 
we need to execute on our 
strategy by delivering on our 
SPT 2.0 and TOM 2.0 objectives, 
in part through leveraging our 
investments in technology and 
retaining our CLR within our TTC 
target range.  

2022
Our guidance on financial 
performance for the full year 
2022, in a global and domestic 
macroeconomic environment 
with high forecast risk and 
uncertainty and based on our 
current economic forecasts, 
is that we will see a continued 
recovery in both NII and NIR, 
leading to positive revenue 
growth, a CLR that is expected 
to be within the top half of our 
TTC target range of 60 bps 
to 100 bps and expenses 
growth above mid-single 
digits. DHEPS is expected to 
exceed 2 565 cents per share. 
Dividends, subject to board 
deliberations, are likely to be 
declared within our target 
range of 1,75 to 2,25 times 
cover. 

Shareholders are advised that all guidance is based on organic earnings and our latest macroeconomic outlook and has not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s 
joint auditors.

CE and CFO internal financial control responsibility
Nedbank continues to maintain a strong risk culture and has implemented adequate and effective 
internal financial controls (IFCs) to confirm the integrity and reliability of the financial statements. 
These IFCs safeguard, verify and maintain accountability of our assets, are based on established 
policies and procedures and implemented by trained and skilled employees whose duties are duly 
segregated. As a consequence, Mike Brown (CE) and I (Mike Davis) as CFO, were able to make the 
attestation required by the JSE. 

Appreciation
To my colleagues on the board and the group executive team, thank you for your support 
and ongoing counsel during another challenging year. Thank you to the dedicated and hard-
working finance, risk and balance sheet management teams across the group, who finalised our 
reporting while largely working from home, and for ensuring that we maintain our high standards 
and professionalism, which is evident in the various reporting awards that Nedbank received 
in 2021. I also thank all our shareholders and the broader investment community, both locally 
and internationally, for your continued investment and interest in Nedbank Group. I look forward 
to further engagements over the coming years.

Nedbank continues to play an 
important role in society and in 
the economy, and this has been 
elevated during the Covid-19 
crisis. We remain committed 
to delivering on our purpose of 
using our financial expertise to 
do good and to contribute to the 
well-being and growth of the 
societies in which we operate by 
creating value to our employees, 
clients, shareholders, regulators 
and society.
We delivered a strong financial performance 
in 2021, which reflects a faster-than-expected 
rebound off a low 2020 base enabled by 
a more supportive environment, ongoing 
strategic delivery and good operational 
performance. This improved financial 
performance supported value creation for 
employees (eg remuneration to employees), 
clients (eg investments in the Nedbank 
franchise to enhance client experiences), 
shareholders (eg dividends), regulators (eg 
tax) and society (eg socioeconomic spend).

¹ Includes non-interest income, impairments charge on non-

CASE 
IN POINT Nedbank partnership with UJ

In 2018, Nedbank and the University of Johannesburg (UJ) established  
a strategic partnership with the emphasis on introducing practical 
solutions that align the strategy and strengths of both organisations.  
The partnership has now been extended to develop AI-related 
competencies for our existing workforce, while developing a pipeline of 
talented students from this dynamic university. Through this collaboration, 
research, skills, technologies, data analytic sciences, financial algorithms, 
cybersecurity, and a host of other development opportunities are made 
available to our workforce.

The relationship is built on regular engagements between UJ and Nedbank 
employees on an ongoing basis. This ensures that the offerings and 
opportunities remain relevant and contributes to Nedbank’s purpose of doing 
good for individuals, families, businesses and society. Nedbank and UJ co-
create new content aimed at reskilling and upskilling individuals on science, 
technology, engineering, arts and mathematic (STEAM) skills, to benefit both 
organisations.

Masterclasses and webinars by UJ speakers create awareness among 
Nedbankers on a variety of topics, eg data analytics, machine learning, 
unsecured lending and risk management.

As we continue to optimise business operations, it is not always possible 
for us to absorb all employees who are impacted by restructures into 
alternative internal roles through redeployment. The UJ partnership offers an 
opportunity for some Nedbankers who choose to pursue their passions and 
proactively reinvent themselves in alternative careers outside of Nedbank, 
with the opportunity to do so while remaining economically active. Examples 
of available programmes include carpentry, boiler-making, household 
electrical installation and repairs, fitting and turning and solar installation.

The symbiotic partnership between Nedbank and UJ continues to evolve, 
serving not only our common strategic needs, but contributing to the  
greater society.

Value creation, preservation and erosion in 2021
 Despite the difficult operating environment, employee 

engagement levels remained high and our ‘great place to 
work’ NPS improved to 19 (from 17 in 2020 and 7 in 2019).

 We paid our 26 861  employees’ salaries and benefits of 
R18,0bn (2020: R16,8bn). We concluded annual salary 
increases with our bargaining-unit employees at 4%, 
ahead of non-bargaining-unit employees’ increases of 
no more than 3% and the blended average employee 
salaries increasing by 3,5%. 

 Training spend increased to R1,1bn (2020: R924m). Our 
digital learning platform was launched in February 2021, 
with more than 18 000 learners completing more than 
982 000 digital learning courses. The total number 
of learning hours (including compliance training) 
increased to 49 hours per person (2020: 31 per person) 
with 24 746 learning beneficiaries (2020: 24 391).

 We enabled 62% of employees to work from home 
(excluding branch employees) as business continuity 
plans were invoked on the back of Covid-19-related 
lockdown levels and during the July civil unrest that 
broke out in parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.  
Looking forward, we have implemented a ‘hybrid 
work model’ approach, which will see a portion of our 
workforce continue to work from a Nedbank office or 
branch, while a blended approach will be followed with 
employees working onsite or remotely. 

 We reactivated our commitment to the Youth 
Employment Service (YES), through which corporate SA 
aims to provide internship opportunities for more than 
one million South Africans. From our 2019 participation 
we have onboarded 239 YES participants into permanent 
Nedbank jobs and another 1 390 at Nedbank partners. 
We have placed more than 1 900 previously unemployed 
youth internally and through sponsored placements, 
and we continue to encourage other South African 
corporates to follow our example.

 We increased our focus on the physical, mental and 
financial well-being of our employees through various 
interventions, including a bankwide virtual campaign on 
mental well-being, together with a variety of webinars, 
which were attended by more than 22 400 employees 
during the year.

 No Nedbank employees were injured during the July 
unrest in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. A total of 5 000 
donated food parcels were delivered to our employees 
and communities in impacted areas. Two days’ social 
responsibility leave were given to all Nedbank employees 
who volunteered in initiatives to make an impact in 
communities.

 Employee attrition increased to 9,3% from 7,1% in 2020 
and remained below the industry benchmark of 11% to 
13%, although total employees reduced by 1 021. As our 
operating model evolves in a digital world (TOM 2.0), we 
expect to see further reductions over the next few years. 
We have not retrenched any employees as a direct result 
of Covid-19.

 We continued to focus on diversity as a key imperative 
to ensuring Nedbank remains relevant in a transforming 
society. Black (ACI) representation is more than 79,9% 
(2020: 78,9%) and female representation 61,4% 
(2020: 61,2%).

 While our Agility Centre successfully redeployed 242 
employees into alternative roles within Nedbank, 
70 employees were regrettably retrenched as a result  
of changes in operational requirements.

2021 in Brand Finance’s Most Valuable Brands in 
SA report. Brand Finance estimates Nedbank’s 
brand value at around R15bn.

 Client access to banking improved, as digitally 
active retail users increased by 11% to 2,3 million. 
This was supported by system uptime at high levels 
of 99,3%.

 We continued with the roll-out of our end-to-
end digital onboarding, and sales and servicing 
capabilities as part of our ME technology journey, 
which have proven to be beneficial for our clients, 
evident in digital sales increasing to 33% of total 
sales (from 12% in 2019).

 In recognition of the value-add to our clients and 
our leadership position in key industries, segments 
and products, Nedbank won various awards, 

including Global Finance’s 2021 Best Investment 
Bank in SA, Global Banking & Finance’s 2021 
Best Corporate Bank in SA, African Banker’s 2021 
Infrastructure Deal of the Year, Global Business 
Review Magazine 2021 Best Retail Bank and City of 
London’s 2021 Best Private Bank. 

 Our asset management business, Nedgroup 
Investments, increased client AUM by 13% to 
R424bn, supporting clients to grow and protect 
their wealth.

 We made R228bn, up 9%, in new loan payouts to 
enable clients to finance their homes, vehicles and 
education, as well as to grow their businesses and 
help them manage through a difficult period in 
2020.

 We ensured the health and safety of our clients by 
maintaining high standards of hygiene and social-
distancing practices, and increased usage of our 
digital solutions.

 We safeguarded R972bn of deposits at competitive 
rates.

 The payment relief (payment holidays) we provided 
to clients under the PA’s Directive 3/2020 has 
matured after assisting more than 400 000  
clients on R121bn of loans since the Covid-19  
crisis emerged.

 We received 3,9% more complaints in 2021 at 
82 255 (2020: 79 135). Just 1% of our total client 
base submitted complaints during 2021, with 91% 
resolved within service-level-agreement timelines, 
and only 1,5% was escalated to the Ombudsman.

IN POINT

Looking forward, the convergence 
of all juristic channels to create an 
omnichannel, multiproduct platform 
offers market differentiation and an 
industry competitive client experience 
(CX). Enhancements to the CX, by 
shifting from product-specific journeys 
to client journeys will furthermore

convergence efforts. These efforts will 
lead to new domestic and cross-border 
payment digital journeys for clients. 
Features include the following:

• Single sign-on to the NBH, with 
access to primary products and 
services (transactional, onboarding, 
servicing and maintenance, value-
added services, and information and 
advice).

• Digitised legal processes and 
documentation for all Nedbank 
products and services.

• Simplified processes using generic 
terms and conditions (T&Cs) for all 
products, with T&Cs for specific 
products being applied for and 
authorised online.

• Online application and fulfilment 
for current accounts, investment 
accounts, as well as call and term 
accounts, with preapproved overdraft 
and revolving credit lines and vehicle 
asset finance (for Business Banking), 
card acquiring, corporate card issuing 
and cash online.

• Digital work queues for client self-
service, end-to-end tracking and 
automated notifications.

• Self-service and employee-assisted 
automated capabilities for proof of 
account, IT3Bs, cross-border 
letters, amortisation schedules and

 The Nedbank share price increased by 35% in 2021 
compared to the JSE South African banks index 
that increased by 29%, notwithstanding the risk of 
an overhang in shares as a result of the Old Mutual 
unbundling of 12,2% of their shareholding to their 
shareholders in November 2021. To create value 
for shareholders, from 1 April 2022, Nedbank will 
be trading on the A2X stock exchange, providing 
investors with options and the ability to trade the 
Nedbank share on a low-cost platform.

 Our financial performance reflects a strong recovery 
off a low 2020 base as headline earnings increased by 
115% to R11,7bn and an improvement across all KPIs 
that drive shareholder value creation (net asset value 
per share, ROE and sustainable earnings growth).

 We resumed dividend payments after having declared 
no dividends relating to 2020 earnings.

 We continue to focus on delivering on our 
strategy and enhanced disclosures to respond 
to key issues that investors raise. We are 
focused on ensuring we can return our 
financial performance to pre-Covid-19 levels, 
as illustrated in our medium- and long-term 
targets shown on page 16.

 We ensured transparent, relevant and timeous 
reporting as evidenced in various reporting 
awards and positive shareholder feedback. 
In 2021 Nedbank’s IR activities were rated 
within the top 25 companies across all of 
EMEA in the Institutional Investor survey as 
voted for by buy- and sell-side analysts.

 The group’s ESG ratings remain in the 
top tier of our peer group, both locally 
and internationally (see page 66 for more 
information).

 We remained resilient through the crisis and 
strengthened our balance sheet further to 
protect us against downside risk, as evident 
in capital and liquidity ratios that were above 
board-approved ranges and well above 
regulatory minima (see page 70).

 We were disappointed in the remuneration 
voting outcomes at our 54th AGM and have 
addressed the key issues investors had on 
page 85, as well as the remuneration section of 
our 2021 Governance Report.

Key shareholding changes
The unbundling by Old Mutual of a further 12,2% of their shareholding, among other 
things, resulted in a key shift in the make-up of the Nedbank Group shareholder 
register, with the PIC becoming Nedbank’s largest shareholder, index funds 
increasing substantially as the group’s free float improved further and, as a result, 
foreign shareholding also increasing to above 30% for the first time.

Key issues we engage on with the investment community

Main topics of discussion

Shift from downside risk 
to upside potential

The year 2021 saw a material shift in the nature of discussions with our investor base, moving from a focus on downside risk for 
Nedbank (such as capital levels, adequacy of provisioning and exposure to commercial property) to a focus on an upside potential, 
including lowering the group’s dividend cover, the release of some of the R3,9bn judgemental overlays, as well as timing of the 
group getting its financial performance back to 2019 levels on DHEPS, ROE and cost-to-income ratios. 

Being one of the first banks to provide revised short- and medium-term guidance in March 2020, we always knew there were risks 
to our forecasts, mainly from the external economic environment. We now believe we can achieve our DHEPS target a year earlier 
(in 2022), while progress on SPT 2.0 and TOM 2.0 will support us achieving our stretch ROE and cost-to-income ratio targets of 
15% and 54%, respectively by 2023. Consensus 2023 analyst forecasts are currently at 14,3% for ROE and 55,3% for cost-to-
income ratio.

Digital progress and the 
move to beyond banking

The focus on technology readiness and digital adoption increased in 2021, driving both revenue growth as well as expenses 
optimisation. We enhanced our disclosures on digital metrics in our results presentations and shared our view on ‘Ecosystems for 
a digital world’ at the 24th UBS Annual Financial Services conference, which was voted best presentation on the day. 

Increased competition 
and market share

Increased levels of competition remain an ongoing topic of interest as new entrants gain traction in the roll-out of products and 
gaining clients. We believe that our market-leading technology strategy, as well as strategic enablers position us well to be highly 
competitive, particularly as we continue to see an ongoing improvement in client satisfaction ratings (see page 57 for more detail).

Remuneration Remuneration was a key focus across most corporates in 2021, and while we proactively engaged with shareholders, we were 
disappointed that voting at our 54th AGM saw our remuneration policy receiving less than 75% votes of support at 65,9%.  
This is discussed in more detail on page 96. 

Increased focus on  
ESG-related matters

The focus on ESG-related matters continues to become a topic that is high on the agenda during investor engagements. 
We enhanced our ESG disclosures through the release of three focused ESG reports, concluded our eighth annual ESG board 
roadshow with the key topics highlighted on page 33, and participated at ESG-focused panels such as the Goldman Sachs’ 
Financials Symposium (September 2021). In recognition of these efforts, we retained top rankings on most of the major ESG 
ratings (see page 66), were named the winner of Best Sustainability Reporting in Financials (Banking) and the overall winner, as 
well as Best Climate-related Reporting in ESG Investing’s 2021 ESG Reporting Awards and in the Institutional Investor IR ratings, 
and placed third among EMEA financial services companies for ESG as ranked by fund managers.     

Nedbank Limited 
preference share buy-back

In Q4 2021 we received 100% votes of approval from shareholders to buy back our Nedbank Limited preference shares at a 30% 
premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average prices, creating significant value for preference shareholders. 

Reputational matters In February and March 2021 Nedbank engaged with various shareholders on reputational matters in the media in respect of our 
historic relationship with Regiments. Ongoing developments in this regard are discussed on pages 24 and 25. 

We proactively communicate our 
financial performance, strategy 
and progress on ESG matters to 
shareholders through an active 
and highly rated investor relations 
programme. To this end, Nedbank’s 
IR activities were rated among the 
top three in Financial Services in 
EMEA in the 2021 Global Institutional 
Investor survey. Our management 
meets regularly with the investment 
community while our board, through 
our Chairperson, Lead Independent 
Director and other boardmembers, 
engages on ESG-related matters. 
The following were the key topics 
discussed during our more than 
290 virtual engagements in 2021:

Value creation, preservation and erosion in 2021
In 2020 Nedbank demonstrated resilience and agility 
through proactive engagements to assess and mitigate 
regulatory risk. Through a formalised Regulatory 
Affairs process, regulatory developments are analysed 
to determine the applicability to and impact on the 
business. This process ensures that Nedbank proactively 
addresses any impact and effectively participates in the 
regulatory consultation processes, either through industry 
associations or directly with government, regulators and 
policymakers. In 2021, we did the following: 

 We continued to work closely with the government, 
regulators and BASA to mitigate the risks of Covid-19 
and the associated lockdowns to the economy 
and ensure the safety and soundness of the South 
African banking system.

 We paid R11,2bn in direct, indirect and employee 
taxes to support the governments and societies 
where we operate. This represents an increase of 
29% on 2020.

 We achieved a strong capital position, with a group 
tier 1 capital ratio of 14,3% and CET1 ratio of 12,8% 
respectively, well above SARB regulatory minima and 
in line with our board-approved targets of greater than 
11,25% and 10% to 12% respectively. Our forecast 
capital ratios are projected to operate well above 
regulatory minima in line with the board-approved 
targets (SARB).

 We continued to maintain a strong liquidity position, 
with Nedbank Group achieving an LCR of 128% in 
December 2021 (above the minimum regulatory LCR 
requirement of 90%, effective from 1 January 2022, 
which will be increased to 100%, effective from 
1 April 2002, in line with SARB PA Directive 8 of 2021). 
The structural liquidity position of Nedbank remains 
resilient, with the group attaining an NSFR of 116%.

 We retained our level 1 BBBEE contributor status for the 
fourth year in a row.

 We received fines to the value of less than R6m 
(2020: < R7m). These related to regulatory non-
compliance in Nedbank Africa Regions (Eswatini, Lesotho 
and Namibia). Remedial actions are in place as we 
continue to enhance our control environment to manage 
our compliance risk and minimise regulatory fines.

Nedbank continues to work closely with the government, 
regulators, policy-makers, BASA and other associations 
by, among other things, ensuring active participation in 
regulatory consultation processes in relation to regulatory 
developments and mitigating risk posed to the economy 
by ensuring the safety and soundness of the South African 
banking system, which includes the combating of money 
laundering and terrorist financing. In this regard, banks, 
regulators and supervisory authorities are making inroads 
in targeting and disrupting financial crime through a 
partnership, called SAMLIT (South African Anti-money-
laundering Integrated Task Force) by enhancing the effective, 
efficient and timeous sharing of information with a view to 
generating actionable reported information, such as ensuring 
that knowledge on the modus operandi of financial criminals 
is shared, that institutions increase their understanding on 
financial crime types and that the work of SAMLIT assists 
law enforcement authorities in taking necessary action. 
SAMLIT is comprised of 22 national and international banks, 
the Financial Intelligence Centre, the South African Reserve 
Bank’s Prudential Authority and Financial Surveillance 
Department, as well as banking association representatives 
SABRIC (South African Banking Risk Information Centre) 
and BASA.

Tax is a key mechanism by which organisations contribute to the economies 
and communities of the countries in which they operate, with businesses 
expected to address concerns from all stakeholders on tax. Tax reporting is 
a voluntary compliance system founded on the basis of trust, and the total 
amount of tax that companies pay is increasingly seen as a proxy for trust. 

In the PwC’s latest annual transparency assessment of the top 100 
companies listed on the JSE, conducted in conjunction with the University 
of Pretoria, the Nedbank 2020 Tax Report was ranked #1 in the financial 
service industry and #3 overall across all industries in the JSE top 100. 
Nedbank is commended for being consistent with its performance in tax 
reporting and it is mentioned that Nedbank continues its efforts to provide 
more disclosure in an easy-to-find, understandable and well-rounded report, 
demonstrating its commitment to stakeholder engagement and contribution 
to the development of effective and efficient tax systems, and succeeding in 
providing a clear link between tax and value creation. 

In support of value creation, in 2021 cash taxes paid relating to direct, 
indirect, employee and other taxes increased by 29%, totalling R11,2bn.

Value creation, preservation and 
erosion in 2021
We are aware that we, alongside our 
stakeholders, operate in a nested, interdependent 
system. This means that for our business to 
succeed, we need a thriving economy, a well-
functioning society and a healthy environment. 
We also recognise that sustainability issues such 
as climate change, inequality, social injustice 
and, most recently, pandemics, are playing an 
increasingly material role in shaping this system. 

Within this context, our purpose guides our 
strategy, behaviours and actions towards the 
delivery of long-term systems value. We use 
our Sustainable Development Framework to 
focus our efforts and identify strategic areas 
with business opportunities and risks as well as 
cost savings.

Making an impact through sustainable-development finance
Sustainable-development finance and the role that financial institutions play in addressing the world’s ESG challenges are critically important. 
A dedicated focus on sustainable-development finance is the most impactful lever for driving positive societal impact and progress towards 
on the SDGs. We have prioritised nine SDGs where we believe we can make the most impact through our lending. Our activity in this regard for 
2021 is outlined below:

  SDG 4
• Over the past five years we have provided around 5 977 students 

with student loans worth R364m. A total of R36m was disbursed to 
support 575 students in 2021.

• Our exposure to this sector amounts to approximately R6bn and 
has facilitated the delivery of 42 758 student beds since 2015. In 
2021 we invested R169m, which delivered an additional 573 beds.

  SDG 6
• Through our CIB and RBB businesses we offer financial solutions 

to the public sector as well as participants in the mining, commercial, 
industrial and agricultural sectors. These solutions enable clients 
and society to access safe and affordable potable water and 
adequate sanitation, and to enhance water use efficiency through 
water recycling, treatment, harvesting and reuse. 

•  During the 2021 financial year funding transactions totalling 
R800m were completed. The majority of these transactions saw 
Nedbank funding used by a range of municipalities to optimise 
water and sanitation delivery to their citizens as well as to the 
agricultural sector, where recipients used the money to replace 
ageing and inefficient irrigation systems with improved technology. 
There has also been a notable increase in interest in the funding 
solutions from commercial and industrial businesses that are 
becoming increasingly aware of the risks of water scarcity to 
their sustainability, and the importance of water recycling and 
purifying as well as rainwater harvesting. Given the possibility that 
these loans can be repaid from the often-significant savings on 
water utility bills, the offering minimises the impact on business 
cash flows.

  SDG 7
• Nedbank is a leading funder of renewable energy in SA. Through 

the REIPPPP we have arranged 42 renewable-energy transactions, 
underwriting a total of R35,3bn and exposures of R28,7bn to date. 
With an initial target of R2,0bn in embedded-energy financing 
by the end of 2022, this is a rapidly growing area of commitment 
for the bank. Deal flow in 2021 saw our CIB Investment Banking 
division completing three material transactions totalling over 
R420m, and our Business Banking division completed 40 
transactions totalling R191m, with a healthy pipeline of future  
deals in place. 

• Our embedded-energy business is also growing outside of SA, 
with clients increasingly looking for renewable-energy solutions. 
In 2021 we facilitated a range of investments across Namibia, 
Mozambique and Eswatini. 

  SDG 8
• MobiMoney enables easy access to banking services without the 

need for a formal bank account. Between 2019 and 2021 a total of 
1,4 million MobiMoney wallets were opened.

• Advanced R4bn in finance to small-business clients.

  SDG 9
Nedbank contributes towards the achievement of SDG 9 through 
funding infrastructure – including mass transit, roads and rail 
corridors, renewable energy, water treatment plants, and information 
and communication technologies – as well as affordable housing, 
schools and hospitals. In addition, Nedbank has developed a formal 
digital strategy to unlock resources and capacity to support and 
fund projects that have the potential to help eliminate Africa’s digital 
divide by delivering equitable and inclusive digital access for all. 

Examples of technology-related deals funded in 2021 include  
the following:

• Rain Holdings – We participated in a R700m senior secured 
revolving credit facility valued at R2,5bn for Rain Holdings. 
The facility will be used to fund capital expenditure as Rain 
continues to roll out its 5G network footprint across SA. 

• Seacom Limited – We completed a US$65m senior 
secured term loan facility to Seacom Limited, acting as the 
mandated lead arranger and sole funder. The facility will be 
used to fund capital expenditure as Seacom embarks on 
its business strategy to upgrade and expand its network 
footprint across the African continent.

  SDG 10
• In 2021 we reached over 15,2 million people across SA 

through various initiatives and channels, including radio 
stations, personal workshops, digital platforms, and social 
and mass media. During the same period 18 179 clients 
were trained through our personal consumer financial 
literacy workshops, which focused on empowering people 
to make better, informed financial decisions.

  SDG 11
We focus on investing in green and sustainable buildings that 
improve the quality of life for occupants and reduce carbon 
emissions and other negative impacts on the environment. 

• We currently have R25bn of exposure linked to green-
certified properties and those containing sustainable 
features. However, this number should increase as we 
get more sophisticated in how we track these kinds of 
investments, particularly within properties that are already 
on our books. In 2021 we also financed 17 EDGE-certified 
residential developments (1 755 units) worth a total of 
R1,5bn with an exposure of R520m.

  SDG 12
We offer an innovative sustainable agriculture funding 
solution for farmers aimed at mitigating the risks and 
challenges associated with rising temperatures and 
lower rainfall. The intention is to support farmers directly 
or through a financing arrangement with their local 
cooperative, with sustainable farm interventions ranging 
from water storage maximisation solutions and soil health 
to cutting-edge irrigation equipment and shade netting to 
reduce evaporation.

  SDG 15
The banking sector has a significant impact on biodiversity 
and natural capital through the financial support it provides 
to high-impact sectors such as forestry, mining, oil and 
gas, fisheries, water delivery and infrastructure, or sectors 
that are using genetic resources such as biotechnology, 
pharmaceuticals, agriculture or cosmetics. The bank can 
play an important role in protecting the natural-capital 
sector by selecting our clients and the projects that we 
finance critically and by creating mechanisms to encourage 
best practice and sustainable practices. 

Through our Social and Environmental Management System 
(SEMS) we encourage our clients to identify, measure and 
value the biodiversity dependencies and impacts of their 
operations to establish biodiversity action plans, disclose 
their risks and performance and have a monitoring system 
in place. In addition to working with our clients, we partner 
with key stakeholders such as the WWF.

Making an impact through corporate 
social investment 
One of the biggest challenges for CSI in SA is the fact 
that demand for financial support of worthy causes 
and upliftment projects continues to outstrip supply 
massively. Responding appropriately and effectively 
to the growing need for social support led to a review 
of the Nedbank Foundation Strategy, with the green 
economy identified as a sustainable and meaningful 
anchor around which the group’s entire CSI strategy 
has been redesigned. 

In 2021 the total value of CSI support and investment 
delivered across our group was R121m.

Carbon footprint reduction
In absolute terms our overall reported GHG emissions 
decreased by 3,41% from 2020 to 2021. Year on year, the 
carbon emissions per FTE remained stable at 4,71 tCO2e, 
and emissions per square metre of office space also 
remained stable at 0,22 tCO2e per square metre. 

CASE 
IN POINT

Innovative lending for 
rural community upliftment 

The formalisation of rural agriculture ecosystems through innovative rural 
development models is key to creating sustainable jobs and livelihoods, 
thereby addressing the stubbornly prevalent issues of poverty and inequality 
experienced in many rural areas. Nedbank is financing a number of different 
rural development models in collaboration with partners like WIPHOLD, 
Brimstone, WWF and key clients in the agricultural sector. 

These innovative models use a combination of strong technical and business 
support and ensure access to market and, from a finance perspective, a unique 
stance on risk profiling and mitigation as well as favourable repayment periods 
and project-specific interest rates.  

One such example is KwaDrabo Trust. Over 60% of SA’s cattle stocks are in 
rural landscapes, with famers having to travel long distances to markets where 
they can sell them at competitive rates. As a result, the inherent wealth in the 
cattle is either not realised and cattle are left on the land to over-graze and 
cause environmental damage, like soil erosion, or it is under-realised as farmers 
are forced to sell to ‘bakkie-traders’ at below-market rates. To address this, 
the trust has constructed a Cattle Holding Station (CHS) near Butterworth in 
the Eastern Cape. The CHS purchases, processes and conditions cattle bought 
from the local small-scale cattle farmers at market-related prices using a 
R10m rural livestock borrowing facility provided by Nedbank and Brimstone 
through the Nedbank BBP Legacy Programme. The animals are then sold to 
Beefmaster, a Nedbank client. 

It is estimated that up to 10 000 small-scale farmers will ultimately benefit 
from the initiative, with between R30m to R50m in funds flowing into the local 
community through the sale of these cattle annually. In addition, the participating 
farmers will receive training on animal husbandry and other business matters. 
The model is highly replicable and scalable, and we aim to work with other 
commercial abattoirs and rural communities across the country to encourage 
the adoption of similar models based on the success of this investment.

In 2021 our overall operational investment into 
environmental sustainability initiatives amounted to 
R69,9m (2020: R59,1m). 

We also invested R9,6m (2020: R9,6m) in the purchase 
of carbon credits and related instruments to meet 
our operational carbon-neutral commitment. A total 
of 135 000 tCO2e was retired for the 2021 period 
(2020: 145 000 tCO2e).

Responsible finance
One of the 17 risk categories actively managed by 
Nedbank is social and environmental risk, which includes 
climate change. Our primary exposure to such risks 
results from our lending and investment activities. We 
actively manage these risks using the SEMS and by 
ensuring that we are aligned with industry best practice 
and environmental, social and human rights benchmarks. 
We also take a partnership approach to all sensitive 
investments, working closely with our clients and relevant 
authorities to maximise benefits and minimise the 
negative impacts of these activities. In 2021 the most 
significant application of the SEMS within our specific 
business units was as follows: 

In our Investment Banking and Client Coverage divisions 
all new applications and credit risk reviews of high-risk 
transactions were included in the SEMS assessment 
process and externally assured.

• In 2021 a total of 703 (2020: 764) deals were 
assessed in CIB and 1 223 (2020: 1 043) deals in 
Property Finance.

• The SEMS process is used in Nedbank’s RBB and 
Wealth clusters. Due to the number of clients in 
RBB, a risk-based approach is taken. This requires 
clients to disclose any negative environmental 
or social impact their activities might have in the 
necessary client documentation. Any disclosures 
are then assessed through the SEMS process and, 
if necessary, mitigating actions are taken.

• In our Business Banking operations, we have 
identified and defined high-impact industries.  
In 2021, 930 clients (2020: 948) involved in these 
sectors were assessed.

• In the Wealth cluster most of our exposure to 
social and environmental risk results from clients’ 
acquisition of industrial and commercial properties 
that could present asbestos or land contamination 
concerns. The total number of clients assessed in 
2021 was 188 (2020: 100).

• Our SEMS process has been adopted across other 
regions in Africa where we operate.

Ensuring and protecting value in 2021
• Launched the Group CSI green economy strategy, 

with the focus on water, waste, energy and agriculture.

• Oversaw the development and implementation of our 
ethics management plan in response to the outcomes 
of the ethics risk assessment (ERA) conducted in 
2019/2020.

• Monitored talent practices, including the retention of

• Oversaw measurement against the amended FSC 
for the industry. Nedbank retained level 1 BBBEE 
contributor status.

• Oversaw well-being initiatives.

• Monitored feedback on workforce surveys and 
mitigating actions to enable the continued culture 
shift.

• Oversaw the ongoing enhancement of our 
sustainable-finance offering as the key lever for 
enabling fulfilment of our purpose.

Our approach to responsible 
investment (RI)
Most of our group’s investments and asset 
management activities take place through 
Nedgroup Investments and Nedbank Private 
Wealth. Nedgroup Investments acknowledges 
the far-reaching implications of how we invest. 
As such, environmental, social and governance 
factors are assessed across our range of 
investment products, with 100% of our assets 
subject to positive and negative environmental or 
social screening. 

Nedgroup Investments believes that generating a 
perspective on sustainability provides important 
insight into existing or emerging ESG risks 
and opportunities. Consequently, we have an 
increased focus on climate in our investment 
process. The Nedgroup Investments RI Guidelines 
draw on the key elements of the UN-backed 
Principles of Responsible Investment (UN PRI); 
the requirements of Regulation 28 of the Pension 
Funds Act (Reg 28); the King Code; the Code for 
Responsible Investing in South Africa (Crisa); and 
the UK Stewardship code.

5,2% for bargaining-unit 
employees (4,0%: 2021).
Minimum GP increased by 
5,6% from R180 000 to 
R190 000.

The Group Remco’s top priorities in the year included ensuring variable remuneration is fit for purpose and linked to strategic and stretching value 
creating objectives, addressing shareholder feedback on our prior year remuneration policy, balancing shareholder and employee outcomes, and 
introducing ESG metrics into remuneration outcomes. 

The past two years have been unprecedented and 
extraordinarily difficult for our clients and employees. 
We have been fortunate in pursuing our strategic, 
operational and financial priorities with committed and 
resilient people, who have worked diligently to follow 
the Covid-19 health protocols and support our clients 
and the economy.

Fair and responsible remuneration
Each year, remuneration differentials are thoroughly 
tested using a model that considers a wide range of 
admissible factors. Variances are identified for remedial 
action. Based on this exercise, the Group Remco is 
satisfied that overall, pay differentials are warrented.

Executive GP increases are set by reference to, among 
other things, the increases of the broader workforce, 
which is represented by Sasbo, the finance union in SA. 
Employees have a right to freedom of association and 
unions representing their interests. On 31 December 
2021 a total of 63% of our employees were covered 
under the collective bargaining agreement with Sasbo.

We accordingly continue to remunerate our employees 
in the bargaining unit appropriately relative to the 
industry and continue to seek measures to reduce any 
unjustified pay differentials.

In addition to monetary reward, Nedbank provides 
lower-income employees and their dependants 
additional benefits to improve their skills and 
capacity, which should in time translate to a higher-
remuneration opportunity.

Nedbank Group’s financial performance for 2021 reflects a strong 
rebound off a low 2020 base. HE in 2021 increased by 115% to R11,7bn, 
but remain 7% below 2019 levels. Key drivers of shareholder value were 
also more positive, with net asset value (NAV) per share increasing by 11%, 
the group’s return on equity (ROE) improving to 12,5% (2020: 6,2%) and 
a full-year dividend of 1 191 cents per share at 2,02 times cover declared. 
The group share price increased by 35% during 2021.

The financial performance was accompanied by ongoing 
strategic delivery. Our ME technology journey to create a 
modern, modular and digital IT stack is 85% complete.  
The benefits of this are evident in most of our digital metrics 
showing double-digit growth, as well as Target Operating 
Model 2.0 (TOM 2.0) benefits of R967m being realised, as 
we move forward towards our target of R2,5bn by the end 
of 2023. In the 2021 Consulta survey Nedbank achieved 
the number two ranking among the South African banks 
on client satisfaction metrics, with Net Promoter Score 
(NPS) increasing to 47. Progress on strategic portfolio tilt 
2.0 (strategy) (SPT 2.0) was evident in market share gains in 
certain key product areas and main-banked clients, while it  
has proved difficult to gain ground in all key deposit and 
advances segments in a highly competitive environment.  
In the annual Consulta survey Nedbank recorded the largest 
retail main-banked market share gain among the large South 
African banks, while CIB gained 35 new primary clients. We 
continued to create positive impacts by delivering against the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 
increasing our focus on environmental, social and governance  
(ESG) matters. In 2021 we released our Energy Policy and 
inaugural Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) Report and successfully concluded Africa’s first green 
additional tier 1 capital instrument, while maintaining ESG 
ratings at the top-end of the local and international peer group.

Liquidity and capital levels have improved and are above 
regulatory minima and within or above board-approved target 
ranges. Credit and collections were managed effectively. IT 
system stability remained outstanding, allowing for continuity 
in client banking operations and for our employees to continue 
to work effectively from home.

The context for remuneration in 2021

93Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



Short-term incentives
A formulaic determination of the STI pool for the 2021 financial year based on actual performance 
as compared to targets for HE and EP would have created a pool of R2 969m. However, consistent 
with our Remuneration Policy, the final determination of the STI pool is not driven by a formula 
only, but is also subject to a qualitative approach where the Group Remco may make discretionary 
adjustments. The Group Remco consequently applied discretion, which was supported by 
management, to make a downward adjustment to the STI pool of R534m, equivalent to the upward 
discretionary adjustment that was applied in the previous year. This adjustment was driven mainly 
by a macro-environment being more favourable than expected and to achieve a fair balance 
between shareholder and employee outcomes.  

The final STI pool of R2 435m is 70,2% above the 2020 pool of R1 435m, against an increase in HE 
of 115%. The 2020 pool of R1,435m was 29,5% lower than the 2019 pool of R2,028m, which in turn 
was 23% lower than the 2018 pool of R2 625m.

The 2021 STI pool represents 12,7% of HE (pre-bonus and pre-tax) as compared with 16,0% in 
2020 and 10,2% in 2019. This pool of R2 435m also includes an upward realignment of R40m in CIB 
(R60m in 2020) to address base issues in the competitiveness of remuneration and retention risks, 
particularly in the Global Markets and Infrastructure divisions.

Consistent with our Remuneration Policy, 50% of any STI over R1m is deferred in shares over three 
years, and is subject to malus and clawback provisions.

Guaranteed package
Increases in 2021
Following negotiations with Sasbo, the total GP of employees in the bargaining unit was increased 
by 4% with effect from April 2021, compared with 3% for the non-bargaining-unit employees and  
3% for executives at cluster and group level.

The minimum GP for permanent, full-time employees in SA was increased to R180 000 per annum 
in 2021, up from R170 000 in 2020 and is significantly higher than the minimum wage in SA.

Increases in 2022
Employees at Group Exco level and non-bargaining-unit employees will receive an increase in 
their total GP averaging 4%. This compares with 5,2% for the bargaining unit. The minimum GP 
for permanent, full-time employees in SA was increased to R190 000 per annum in 2022, up from 
R180 000 in 2021, and remains significantly higher than the minimum wage in SA.

As shown in the graph, the GP increases of senior management remain lower than those of the 
bargaining unit. This has been a deliberate approach in an endeavour to reduce income inequality. 
This has the added effect of increasing the STI awards of the bargaining-unit members as variable 
pay is determined as a percentage of GP.

Rewarding for value creation – remuneration outcomes continued

Rewarding for value creation – remuneration outcomes continued

The long-term incentive scheme
Vesting of 2019 awards in 2022
Only 18% of the 2019 LTI awards to Group Exco members will 
vest in 2022. The impact of this is evident in the single-figure 
remuneration outcomes of EDs and POs. Furthermore, based 
on current forecasts, 0% of the 2020 awards to Group Exco 
members are estimated to vest in 2023, while an estimated 
130% of the 2021 awards, subject to certain Group Remco 
discretion, will vest in 2024.

Changes affecting the 2022 awards
Consistent with the feedback from our shareholders and 
following the unique Covid-19 circumstances of 2020 and 
2021, the 2022 LTI and MSS awards to Group Exco members 
will revert to being 100% subject to CPTs. In addition, the Group 
Remco increased the percentage of LTI and MSS awards to 
cluster exco members that is subject to CPTs from 60% to 75%. 

The individual CPTs and their weightings for the 2022 awards 
were also reviewed. The efficiency ratio (cost to income) has 
been reintroduced alongside the ROE and DHEPS targets,  
which will be the three financial performance measures for  
the 2022 awards:
• Vesting against the ROE CPT will be tested in the final year  

of the three-year vesting period, 2024. Given the medium-
term ROE target to end-2023 of a recovery to 2019 ROE 
levels of 15%, the 2024 target for 100% vesting of this 
measure of ROE = COE + 1,75% aligns with the trajectory 
towards our long-term goal of ROE + 3 to 4% (circa 18%).  
This also returns to the usual approach of setting an ROE 
target relative to COE. 

• The DHEPS CPT will revert to a compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR) target over the three-year vesting period, similar to 
2020 and 2019. The CAGR target for 100% vesting is CPI + 
gross domestic product (GDP) + 7%. 

• The cost-to-income CPT will be calculated in the final year  
of vesting, 2024. The target for 100% vesting of 53% is  
more stretching than our medium-term targets of 54% for 
end-2023.

Important environmental and social commitments are 
introduced as CPTs. These prioritise our Energy Policy 
commitments, sustainable-development-financing targets, 
employee and client NPS rankings and our competitive 
broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) status. 
Governance-related matters are appropriately covered through 
the existing malus and clawback provisions.

The Group Remco also felt it important to attach strategic 
CPTs to the 2022 LTI awards. In this regard, our ME technology 
strategy enables Nedbank to lead in digital innovation, deliver 
market-leading client solutions, drive faster revenue growth 
through SPT 2.0 and deliver a more efficient operating model 
through TOM 2.0.  

Delivery on these environmental, social and strategic enablers 
will support Nedbank’s continued focus on value creation 
for shareholders by delivering sustainable earnings growth, 
continued increase in ROE (long term greater than about 18% 
or COE + 3% to 4%) and a lower cost-to-income ratio (long term 
below 50%).  

The following CPT weightings will apply for the 2022 LTI awards, 
which will be reviewed again in 2023 for future awards:

• The Group Remco believes these CPTs and weightings will 
promote shareholder value creation and have the desired 
effect of motivating and retaining executives and employees.

• The Group Exco members are compliant with minimum 
shareholding requirements.

Addressing shareholder concerns  
From the inception of the shareholder advisory vote on 
remuneration in SA (on the policy in 2015 and on both the 
Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report in 2018), 
Nedbank has enjoyed high voting support in favour of our 
remuneration, consistently in the upper-90% range each year. 
However, the vote on our 2020 Remuneration Policy did not 
meet the 75% threshold at the 2021 AGM, in which we received 
a 65,9% vote in favour (2020: 97,7%). The Implementation 
Report was supported with an 80,0% vote in favour  
(2020: 98,4%). 

We held constructive engagements with our shareholders 
before finalising our 2021 remuneration proposals. These 
engagements highlighted that there were differing views among 
shareholders on appropriate remuneration outcomes during 
a period of significant volatility as a result of the Covid-19 
pandemic and its impact on Nedbank’s strategic focus and 
performance. It was nevertheless clear that there was a level 
of dissatisfaction among some shareholders, in particular with 
respect to the corporate performance targets (CPTs) relating 
to the awards under the long-term incentive (LTI) scheme, 
including the Matched-share Scheme (MSS) (part of the 
Restricted-share Scheme), for 2021.

The date and nature of the shareholder engagements, the key 
feedback received, and the consequent remuneration changes 
we have now implemented (or our responses, where no change 
was warranted) are set out on page 96.

95Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2021



  Shareholder meetings 
Remuneration issues were discussed as part of our ESG Roadshow with shareholders in May 2021  
and post our AGM in June 2021.

Feedback received Group Remco:   Observation    Change/response

There was criticism 
of the reintroduction 
of time-based 
vesting awards for 
Group Exco, at 20% 
weighting, without 
performance 
conditions.

This measure, combined with the once-off additional LTI awards, partially 
addressed the materially increased retention risk resulting from the significant 
loss of value in the in-flight LTI awards. Group Exco LTI awards made in 2020 are 
currently expected to have 0% vesting. 

We have reverted to 100% performance conditions on the 2022 LTI awards to 
Group Exco members. 

Certain CPTs on 
the 2021 LTI award 
were regarded as 
‘soft’, namely the 
capital and liquidity 
recovery metrics.

The 2021 LTI awards contained four ‘business recovery’ metrics to emphasise the 
strategic importance of maintaining balance sheet resilience during the impact of 
Covid-19 and of navigating a recovery towards achievement of our targets over the 
medium term. 

The capital and liquidity metrics are strategically important and make up only two 
of the four metrics in this basket of CPTs, with a weighting of 10% for Group Exco 
and cluster exco members and maximum vesting on these metrics deliberately 
limited to 100%. The Group Remco will also need to be satisfied that there is 
‘substantial progress’ over the three years on these board-approved metrics, after 
having received input from the relevant board committees, for the full vesting to 
be achieved. The SPT 2.0 and TOM 2.0 CPTs have been retained in the 2022 LTI 
awards.
Feedback will be provided in the Remuneration Report in each year until vesting to 
enhance transparency on progress toward the achievement of these qualitative 
CPTs.

Explicit ESG 
conditions should 
be linked to 
remuneration. 

Individual remuneration awards are informed by, among other things, individual 
performance outcomes in terms of goal commitment contract (GCCs). The individual 
GCCs do consider performance against specific ESG commitments, which is disclosed 
in detail in the Remuneration Report for the executive directors (EDs) and prescribed 
officers (POs).

The March 2022 LTI awards now include environmental and social CPTs – an 
explicit approach. The governance component is addressed with the existing malus 
and clawback provisions set out in our Remuneration Policy. 
This is our first but important step to explicitly tying remuneration outcomes to the 
achievement of such targets. 

  Shareholder meetings 
Remuneration issues were discussed as part of our ESG Roadshow with shareholders in May 2021  
and post our AGM in June 2021.

Feedback received Group Remco:   Observation    Change/response

The Group 
Remco may use 
its discretion to 
amend the vesting 
outcome for the ROE 
and diluted headline 
earnings per share 
(DHEPS) CPTs on the 
2021 LTI awards. 

Completely rigid projections of targets could not be responsibly set when economic 
- forecasting risk was so high in the short to medium term during volatile Covid-19 
conditions. In such an environment, fixed targets have the risk of being materially 
over- or underachieved, resulting in unjustified windfall incentive gains or losses. 
A number of our larger shareholders actively supported the inclusion of the Group 
Remco’s discretion, provided it was responsibly and transparently applied with clear 
objectives.

The 2022 LTI CPTs do not carry such Group Remco discretion. 

The reintroduction 
of time vesting in the 
MSS for Group Exco, 
at a 50% weighting, 
without performance 
conditions was 
questioned. 

The reversion to 50% of the MSS award contingent on a performance condition 
applied to 13 employees only (Group Exco) and would have a limited impact of a 
maximum of 13,75% on the individual’s short-term incentive (STI). 

This was a temporary change to partially manage the material retention and 
motivation risk during Covid-19 conditions. 
We have reverted to 100% performance-based MSS vesting for Group Exco 
members. For cluster exco members, we have also increased the percentage of the 
MSS award subject to a matching condition ranging from 60% to 75%.

The discretionary 
adjustment to the 
group STI pool 
for 2020 was 
questioned.

Consistent with our Remuneration Policy, after careful consideration the Group 
Remco may make qualitative adjustments to the STI pool. The group’s STI pool is 
deliberately not tied to a fixed formulaic approach as this can result in unintended 
outcomes. An overlay of the Group Remco’s discretion is considered necessary to 
ensure appropriate adjustment is made for corrections and non-quantifiable and 
non-financial factors that contribute to shareholder value.

For 2021 the Group Remco has applied downward discretion on the formulaically 
determined 2021 STI pool in an environment when the formulaic targets set 
in early 2021 were materially exceeded. This discretionary adjustment returns 
to shareholders the full 2020 upward discretion of R534m and was deemed 
appropriate given that the macroeconomic performance of the country was better 
than expected and  the Nedbank earnings recovery was faster than expected. The 
Group Remco and management consider this a fair and responsible outcome for 
management and shareholders.

GP for 2020 from 1 April when 
appointed as a prescibed officer.

*  The negative CPT performance on the 2019 award is lower than the negative CPT 
performance on the 2018 award, resulting in a net positive CPT performance of 
R40 000. This can be attributed to: the overall vesting outcome on the 2019 award, 
at 58%, being higher than the overall vesting outcome on the 2018 award, at 55%, 
noting that both awards were made as a cluster exco member when only 60% of the 
award was subject to CPTs. Taking this into account, and that the face value of the 
2018 award was only 5% higher than the 2019 award, the value of the negative CPT 
performance of the 2019 award was below the 2018 award.

 Independent Assurance Providers’ Limited Assurance Report
Independent Limited Assurance Report to the directors of Nedbank Limited
We have performed our limited assurance 
engagement in respect of the key 
performance indicators (denoted with 
“LA” per the Integrated Report and/
or TCFD Report) for the year ended 
31 December 2021.

The subject matter comprises the 
sustainability key performance 
indicators disclosed in accordance with 
management’s basis of preparation, the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 
and the alignment with AA1000APS 
(2018) principles (inclusivity, materiality 
and responsiveness), as prepared by the 
responsible party, during the year ended 
31 December 2021.

The terms of management’s basis of

which Nedbank Limited’s compliance

Directors’ responsibility
The directors being the responsible party, and where 
appropriate, those charged with governance are responsible for 
the key performance indicator information, in accordance with 
management’s basis of preparation.

The responsible party is responsible for:

• Ensuring that the key performance indicator information 
is properly prepared and presented in accordance with 
management’s basis of preparation;

• Confirming the measurement or evaluation of the underlying 
key performance indicators against the applicable criteria, 
including that all relevant matters are reflected in the key 
performance indicator information; and

• Designing, establishing and maintaining internal controls 
to ensure that the key performance indicator information 
is properly prepared and presented in accordance with 
management’s basis of preparation.

Assurance practitioner’s 
responsibility
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance 
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than 
Audits or Reviews of Historic Financial Information. This 
standard requires us to comply with ethical requirements 
and to plan and perform our limited assurance engagement 
with the aim of obtaining limited assurance regarding the key 
performance indicators of the engagement.

We shall not be responsible for reporting on any key 
performance indicator events and transactions beyond the 
period covered by our limited assurance engagement.

Our independence and quality 
control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical 
requirements of the Independent Regulatory Board for 
Auditors’ Code of Professional Conduct for Registered Auditors 
(IRBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of 

 Independent Assurance Providers’ Limited Assurance Report continued

integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, 
confidentiality and professional behaviour. The IRBA Code is 
consistent with the corresponding sections of the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International 
Independence Standards).

Deloitte applies the International Standard on Quality Control 1 
and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control, including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Summary of work performed
We have performed our procedures on the key performance 
indicator transactions of Nedbank Limited, as prepared by 
management in accordance with management’s basis of 
preparation for the year ended 31 December 2021.

Our evaluation included performing such procedures as we 
considered necessary which included:

• interviewing management and senior executives to obtain 
an understanding of the internal control environment, risk 
assessment process and information systems relevant to 
the sustainability reporting process for the selected key 
performance indicators;

• assessing the systems and processes to generate, collate, 
aggregate, validate and monitor the source data used 
to prepare the selected key performance indicators for 
disclosure in the reports;

• inspecting supporting documentation and performing 
analytical review procedures; and

• evaluating whether the selected key performance indicator 
disclosures are consistent with our overall knowledge and 
experience of sustainability and non-financial processes.

Our assurance engagement does not constitute an audit 
or review of any of the underlying information conducted 
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
or International Standards on Review Engagements and 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or review 
conclusion.

We believe that our evidence obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance 
conclusion.

In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed 
vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, 
a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level 
of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the assurance that would have 
been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance 
engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable 
assurance opinion about whether the key performance indicator 
information has been properly prepared and presented, in all 
material respects, in accordance with management’s basis  
of preparation.

Conclusion
Based on our work described in this report, nothing has come to 
our attention that causes us to believe that the key performance 
indicators are not prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with management’s basis of preparation.

Other matters
Our report includes the provision of limited assurance on the 
“Thermal coal funding”, “Oil and gas funding”, “Non-renewable 
funding” and “Renewable funding” for the year ended  
31 December 2021. We were previously not required to  
provide assurance on these indicators.
