Cover story 
Jess Costello and Jess Lees managers 
of Lismore’s Woolworths and BIG W 
stores, worked tirelessly to bring 
three teams together at a single store 
 – Goonellabah – to provide essential 
supplies to devastated communities

It was an incredible task and we’re 
immensely proud of our team and 
community who pulled together 
to support one another.

Facing the flood together 
In the aftermath of the east coast 
floods, we’ve worked to support 
our team and their families. 
Over 100 team members had flood 
affected homes, in Lismore alone.

CEO and Chair Message

We are driven 
and united by 
our purpose

Guiding 
principles

We act like a leader 
and speak up on 

issues that matter

We care for, and 
unlock the potential 

of, our people

We have a 
positive impact 

on the planet

We apply 
circular thinking in 
everything we do

We embrace 
the power of 

partnerships to 
create change

It is energising to be writing this message under the banner 
of our new Group brand that was launched this year. This launch 
is in recognition of the evolution of our business and provides a 
symbol of what we stand for as a Group today and how we will aspire 
to operate in the future. It brings our long-standing commitment to 
sustainability front and centre, providing a symbol of the purpose that 
unites us and the positive impact that we are working hard to have.

Amidst yet another disruptive year, where our teams have again 
worked hard to manage the impacts of the pandemic and multiple 
natural disasters, we are pleased to have made progress across 
all aspects of our sustainability agenda. This has only been made 
possible by engaging our whole team on our journey of creating 
better experiences together for a better tomorrow. 

One area where we have seen important progress this year is in 
our approach to reconciliation. Our genuine desire to listen and learn, 
and to redefine the relationship between Woolworths Group and 
Indigenous Australia has seen us activate our inaugural reconciliation 
strategy, addressing the learnings from the Independent Panel 
Review, and creating our First Nations Advisory Board. The Advisory 
Board is made up of Indigenous team members, external Indigenous 
advisors and senior executives. Its role is to guide our engagement 
with Indigenous team members, customers and communities, 
inform where our business plans intersect with Indigenous interests 
and to help us make a meaningful contribution towards Closing the 
Gap and reconciliation more broadly.

We have long recognised the importance of collaboration, and that 
the nature of the sustainability challenges we face requires collective 
action extending across organisation and industry boundaries. We are 
pleased to have this year taken our first material steps towards better 
understanding and managing the greenhouse gas emissions that exist 
in our extended supply chain. We will work in partnership with our 
suppliers on solutions to reduce scope 3 emissions.

In our Sustainability Plan 2025, we have set ourselves ambitious goals 
that require fundamental change supported by guiding principles 
that provide long-term direction for our actions. We are making good 
progress to embrace diversity, reduce our emissions, food waste and 
plastic waste (removing single use plastic bags in Western Australia 
ahead of legislative requirements), increase recycling and provide 
healthier, more sustainable product choices for our customers.

The scale of our business enables us to make a meaningful 
contribution and this responsibility, as well as the rapid pace of change 
in sustainability meant that during the year we felt it important to 
review our Sustainability Plan 2025. We need to continue to challenge 
ourselves on our progress, our level of ambition, and the need for 
aspirational thinking to really drive the sustainable change we all 
want and need to see. We will have more to say on our updated plan 
in the coming months. 

On behalf of the Woolworths Group team, we are pleased to share 
with you our 2022 Sustainability Report.

Together we work towards creating 
a better tomorrow by making 
positive change for our people and 
the planet through our products.

Sustainability for us at Woolworths Group 
means constantly improving the ways we work 
to have a positive impact on our team, our planet, 
our customers and the communities we serve 
– and in doing so create long-term value and 
sustainable growth for our business.

In another year of disruption, I am enormously 
thankful for the resilience and agility of our teams 
who have worked collaboratively with our suppliers 
and partners to show care for our customers and 
the communities we serve while continuing to 
deliver on our sustainability agenda. 

Since launching our Sustainability Plan 2025, 
we have worked to set ourselves up and in F22, 
created a Group-wide sustainability program 
to build momentum towards our sustainability 
goals. We have grown our team, invested in our 
data and analytics capabilities and strengthened 
our governance to influence overarching 
business priorities. 

The activation of our program has brought the 
Group together to collectively drive progress across 
the People, Planet and Product pillars of our strategy. 
While we’re pleased with this progress, we recognise 
there is more to do to transform, learn and develop 
solutions to make a positive impact. 

Our teams are the primary drivers of change 
and are key to building a culture that embraces 
sustainability. Caring deeply is part of our culture, 
and we strive to create a workplace that is truly 
inclusive and considerate of intersectionality. 
We refined our strategy to view inclusion more 
holistically and activated our reconciliation 
strategy to drive meaningful action towards the 
empowerment of Indigenous Australia. Our care 
for people extends to our communities and our 
value chain and during the floods we donated 
time, resources and essential goods to help those 
in need. Our efforts to build a rights-respecting 
culture in our value chain is detailed in our 
Modern Slavery Statement.

We continue to adapt our business to manage the 
impacts of climate change. This year, we deepened 
our scenario analysis work to understand the climate 

risks and opportunities that impact our customers, 
suppliers and operations. We also established 
a program of work to partner with our suppliers 
to drive emissions reductions in our value chain. 
Our investment in the renewable electricity sector 
saw two contracts established to deliver 100% green 
electricity to South Australia by July this year and 
to Western Australia by 2025.

Addressing the impacts of our products remains 
critical. This year, we developed our nurturing 
nature strategy, formalising our approach to the 
responsible stewardship of natural resources and 
sourcing of sustainable protein. We will see the 
power of partnerships come to life as our newly 
created Woolworths Supermarkets Supplier 
Sustainability Council works to help improve 
the health of products and the sustainability 
and recyclability of packaging across our stores.

While we are proud of our progress so far, we know 
there is much more to do. Sustainability is one of the 
deepest transformational programs that has taken 
place at Woolworths Group over recent years, and 
that’s incredibly exciting – knowing that together, 
we’re creating a positive legacy that is not only 
good for our people and the planet, it is central to 
creating long-term value. Pleasingly, our efforts have 
been recognised by The Australian Financial Review 
as the 2022 Sustainability Leader for impact.

I invite you to join us in creating better experiences 
together for a better tomorrow.

The case and appetite for sustainable 
change is accelerating. Our Sustainability 
Plan 2025’s guiding principles, goals and 
commitments are reviewed and adjusted as 
part of our annual planning cycle to maintain 
relevance in a changing world. 

We listen to our team, customers and other 
stakeholders to understand what is most 
important to them. We also assess emerging 
trends and how we benchmark against peers. 
This helps us assess material environmental, 
social and governance issues impacting our 
business and informs the refinement of our 
Plan (see page 10). 

As we approached the halfway point in our 
2025 Plan, we found that the majority of our 
commitments remain relevant, with the 
following updated to better reflect our 
operating environment:

• strengthening our focus on making 
healthier easier for our customers with 
the aim to grow the proportion of sales 
from healthier products (page 46)

• formalising our approach to responsible 
stewardship of natural resources and the 
future of protein (pages 42 and 54)

• supporting better health outcomes in 
remote Indigenous communities, and 
investing in Indigenous businesses (page 20)

• adjusting the scope of our responsible 
retailing commitment to include tobacco 
(page 58).

We are finalising our strategy refinement 
process, including reviewing our climate 
change commitments in line with Science 
Based Target initiative (SBTi) guidance. 
We will release more detail in the 
near future. 

Annual 
refinement of  
our 2025 plan 

Our goals are 
intrinsically 
linked 

Transitioning towards 
sustainable and resilient 
societies requires an 
integrated approach 
in which our goals 
work together to build 
a better tomorrow. 

We care for people in our 
operations and value chain, 
and aim to create social equity 
and opportunity through 
inclusion and respect. This helps 
us support a community that is 
working together in partnership 
to achieve our commitments.

We work to repair and protect 
our planet by minimising our 
use of finite natural resources 
while facilitating its regeneration 
through renewables and farming 
practices. This will reduce our 
impact on climate change and 
improve the resiliency of our 
communities and the food 
systems they rely on.

We embrace circular thinking 
and aim to manage all waste 
as a resource. We also aim to 
provide access to products that are

Sustainability 
Plan 2025

The case and appetite for sustainable 
change is accelerating. Our Sustainability 
Plan 2025’s guiding principles, goals and 
commitments are reviewed and adjusted as 
part of our annual planning cycle to maintain 
relevance in a changing world. 

We listen to our team, customers and other 
stakeholders to understand what is most 
important to them. We also assess emerging 
trends and how we benchmark against peers. 
This helps us assess material environmental, 
social and governance issues impacting our 
business and informs the refinement of our 
Plan (see page 10). 

As we approached the halfway point in our 
2025 Plan, we found that the majority of our 
commitments remain relevant, with the 
following updated to better reflect our 
operating environment:

• strengthening our focus on making 
healthier easier for our customers with 
the aim to grow the proportion of sales 
from healthier products (page 46)

• formalising our approach to responsible 
stewardship of natural resources and the 
future of protein (pages 42 and 54)

• supporting better health outcomes in 
remote Indigenous communities, and 
investing in Indigenous businesses (page 20)

• adjusting the scope of our responsible 
retailing commitment to include tobacco 
(page 58).

We are finalising our strategy refinement 
process, including reviewing our climate 
change commitments in line with Science 
Based Target initiative (SBTi) guidance. 
We will release more detail in the 
near future. 

Annual 
refinement of  
our 2025 plan 

Our goals are 
intrinsically 
linked 

Transitioning towards 
sustainable and resilient 
societies requires an 
integrated approach 
in which our goals 
work together to build 
a better tomorrow. 

We care for people in our 
operations and value chain, 
and aim to create social equity 
and opportunity through 
inclusion and respect. This helps 
us support a community that is 
working together in partnership 
to achieve our commitments.

We work to repair and protect 
our planet by minimising our 
use of finite natural resources 
while facilitating its regeneration 
through renewables and farming 
practices. This will reduce our 
impact on climate change and 
improve the resiliency of our 
communities and the food 
systems they rely on.

We embrace circular thinking 
and aim to manage all waste 
as a resource. We also aim to 
provide access to products that are 
healthier, sustainably sourced and 
responsibly sourced and packaged. 
Our products are a tangible way 
in which we, together with our 
customers, can have a positive 
impact on the planet and the 
people who call it home.

MATERIAL TOPIC, WHAT THIS MEANS AND WHY IT IS MATERIAL TOPIC RAISED BY RELEVANT SDGS

Climate change

Net zero by 2050 is a common target across corporate Australia, 
focus is shifting to ‘how’ over ‘what’ to reduce emissions and scrutiny 
from stakeholders is increasing. Physical, community and business 
impacts of climate change are more frequent and consequential, 
and the expectation on climate disclosures are growing.

• Customers

• Investors and shareholders

• Government/Regulators/
NGOs/Industry Associations

• Community

  

Supply chain sustainability

Sustainability across the supply chain incorporates farming 
practices and animal welfare concerns across meat, dairy and grain. 
Water stewardship in Australia and dryer trends could impact food 
security. There is an expectation for Woolworths Group to partner and 
create positive social and environmental outcomes locally and globally.

• Suppliers and partners

• Community   

Engagement with consumers on sustainability

Customers want and expect to be engaged in sustainability, 
bringing informed choice to their shopping decisions through 
education and product labelling of certifications and environmental 
footprint. This should apply across the board and not create price 
barriers to behavioural changes.

• Customers

  

Natural resource use, waste and the circular economy

The circular economy is considered important to manage finite 
natural resources. Topics such as packaging and plastic are 
among top concerns raised with the balance to product shelf life 
acknowledged, to avoid food waste. Building sustainable production 
and consumption is the desired end state.

• Customers

• Suppliers and partners

• Government/Regulators/
NGOs/Industry Associations

 

Human rights

Awareness of human rights issues and impacts in supply chains have 
increased. Reporting and transparency on issues and the actions 
taken to address these are important to stakeholders. Respect for 
people and in particular Indigenous communities are considered very 
important to reputation.

• Suppliers and partners

  

Woolworths Group regularly reviews the most material environmental, social and governance 
issues affecting our business. This is done in collaboration with our customers, team and other 
stakeholders by listening to their concerns and issues. Through understanding what matters 
to them, and what is most important to our business, we identify opportunities where we can 
aspire to have the greatest impact. Our Sustainability Plan brings to life commitments that 
aim to address these issues and is refined annually based on the results of our materiality 
assessment. This process is also a key consideration in how we evolve our sustainability 
ambitions over time.

Focusing on  
issues that matter

MATERIAL TOPIC, WHAT THIS MEANS AND WHY IT IS MATERIAL TOPIC RAISED BY RELEVANT SDGS

Access to healthy, affordable food

Food security is seen as a long term issue driven by 
population growth, climate change and supply chain volatility. 
Experiences through COVID were commonly discussed. 
The challenges of supply and demand against quality, price 
and choice for essential products and healthy/affordable food 
are common concerns.

• Customers

• Government/Regulators/
NGOs/Industry Associations

  

Community impact

Mental health and community wellbeing especially during COVID 
was a major concern. Woolworths Group is expected to play 
a positive role for the team and the broader community. Programs of 
community investment, preferential procurement and donations are 
expected from good corporate citizens.

• Community

• Customers

• Team members

  

Regenerative agriculture

Controversy around industrial farming practices were noted as a 
concern by the general public. Sustainable regenerative agricultural 
practices will require a proactive and deliberate partnership between 
Woolworths Group, suppliers and industry to develop and grow further.

• Suppliers and partners

• Government/Regulators/
NGOs/Industry Associations

  

 

Team member wellbeing

Health and safety remain important, with focus now including mental 
health and wellbeing of team members. Inclusion is creating a working 
environment that connects purpose and allows our team to bring 
their whole selves to work. As is representation across minority and 
disadvantaged groups to reflect the community we serve. 

• Team members

• Investors and shareholders   

Nature and biodiversity

Loss of biodiversity and risk of deforestation are seen as both a risk 
and opportunity. With increasing regulation and disclosure trends 
this is seen as an area requiring increased focus in the short term.

• Investors and shareholders

• Government/Regulators/
NGOs/Industry Associations

  

Future of work and workforce transition

Concerns include preparing the current and future workforce 
with skills required for digital transformations. Also addressing the 
impacts of trends towards contract labour and casualisation of the 
workforce. These are significant issues that Woolworths Group will 
need to consider and respond to in the near term.

• Team members

• Investors and shareholders  

Organisational resilience

Experience of the last two years through COVID and natural 
disasters has highlighted the need for essential services 
businesses to be resilient and increase preparedness for the next 
major event. This extends beyond business and into community 
support and responses.

• Investors and shareholders

• Suppliers and partners

• Team members

• Government/Regulators/
NGOs/Industry Associations

• Customers

 

Corporate conduct, ethics, integrity and transparency

This year, concerns over underpayments were noted as were 
recurring topics of privacy and monetisation of data. Stakeholders 
are expecting Woolworths Group to maintain integrity and ‘do what 
it says it will do’. Expectations are also growing for Woolworths Group 
to use its scale and voice to influence public policy.

• Investors and shareholders

• Suppliers and partners

• Communities

• Government/Regulators/
NGOs/Industry Associations

Responsible service of alcohol and tobacco

Stakeholders expect Woolworths Group to encourage and promote 
responsible retailing of products and services including alcohol, 
tobacco and gaming. The demerger of the Endeavour Group has not 
altered expectations in these areas.

• Customers

• Investors and shareholders

We recognise that individual identities of our teams are multi-faceted 
and many advocate for specific needs. Over the last year, we made good 
progress in improving gender equality, celebrating diversity, building 
organisational capability and promoting career pathways for diverse talent. 

Despite our best intentions, we don’t always get it right and have been 
publicly held to account. A big focus for us in 2022 was to refine our inclusion 
strategy, looking at Woolworths Group in the new era and inclusion more 
holistically. We want to openly value difference and bring an inclusive mindset 
to decision making. We will continue to build a culture where our team 
members feel like they belong, they mirror the diversity of our communities 
and we contribute to a more inclusive society by doing the right thing.

We listen to our team and act on their 
feedback through Voice of Team Advocacy 
(VOT). Reflective of the ongoing challenging 
global environment, our VOT score was 15, 
the same as F21.

Recent societal events, such as Black Lives Matter, 
have shed light on people’s lived experience. 
We recognise the value diversity brings to our 
business, our customers and our community. 
We believe in creating a workplace that is safe 
and inclusive so every team member feels like 
they belong and can be their best self.

Be a truly inclusive 
workplace

Gender equity

Gender equity at Woolworths Group is about enabling all team 
members to access and enjoy equal rewards, resources and 
opportunities regardless of gender. As F22 concluded, our senior 
leadership was 39% women, a 2% increase on F21, trending towards 
our 40:40:20 gender ambition. We are committed to pay parity and 
maintain less than 1% difference in gender pay in like-for-like roles.

Building opportunities 
for refugees

Our Refugee Employment Program is delivered 
in partnership with Community Corporate, 
a diversity and inclusion social enterprise with 
proven experience in activating programs that 
make a profound economic and social impact. 
Since F18, this program has provided employment 
to over 200 refugees in Woolworths Supermarkets, 
Metro Food Stores and Customer Fulfilment 
Centres across NSW, VIC, QLD, SA and WA. 

In April 2022, we launched the Refugee Digital and 
Technology Cadetship in Group IT, WooliesX and 
wiq (our bespoke analytics business). This program 
focuses on refugees with overseas qualifications 
and experiences, for career opportunities within 
our digital and technology business areas. 
Our target is to provide employment to 30 
refugees by December 2023. Eight commenced 
their cadetship by the end of June 2022.

In New Zealand, Countdown partners with Bread 
Collective to support bakery skills development 
for Aotearoa’s refugee community.

 LGBTQ+ aiming for platinum

In 2021, we achieved Gold Tier status in the Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI) for the fourth 
year, becoming a Platinum Qualifying business. Our AWEI Platinum Project, ‘Painting Parramatta 
with Pride’, delivered 2021 to 2022, is inspired by the research and recommendations of the report on 
Advancing LGBTQ+ Safety and Inclusion in Greater Western Sydney from Western Sydney University and ACON. 
Our hope is that our learnings from this project will enable us to implement similar initiatives in other locations, 
particularly those that struggle with safe spaces for LGBTQ+ people.

Countdown once again achieved the Rainbow Tick accreditation, and continues their partnership with 
RainbowYOUTH, making a $25,000(NZD) donation and raising funds through customers’ giving to support 
Aotearoa’s queer, gender diverse, takatāpui (Māori term for LGBTQ+) and intersex youth.

Improving our accessibility

Woolworths Group recognises the societal barriers 
historically faced by people living with a disability and 
we are committed to playing our part to remove these 
barriers. We have been challenged on our progress 
by the Disability Royal Commission and acknowledge 
we have more to do. As a critical first step, in early F23 
we will create a Group disability team network aiming 
to drive positive change by co-creating our approach 
towards developing our Accessibility Action Plan.

This year, our supply chain arm, Primary Connect, partnered 
with the Australian Network on Disability and others to 
enable warehousing roles for D/deaf 1 and hard of hearing 
candidates through safer and more inclusive workplaces.

1 Upper case Deaf used indicate deaf from birth and lower case deaf indicates loss of hearing later in life.

Mini Woolies 

The Mini Woolies program provides hands-on learning 
experiences for students and job candidates living with 
disability. Since its launch in 2018, over 1,000 people have 
participated in the program. Woolworths Supermarkets, 
partnering with Fujitsu, extended the program to 
encompass 14 sites this year, including schools, adult 
learning and inclusive recruitment centres. A further 25 
Mini Woolies will be rolled out across Australia by June 
2023 as it grows to be an important piece of our talent 
acquisition pipeline for people with disability. 

Our Māori and Pasifika team 

In New Zealand to support our work to increase the 
number of Māori and Pasifika team in leadership roles, 
we have established a Māori and Pasifika Talanoa 
(Committee). The Talanoa provides support in helping 
our team identify and remove any career barriers they 
may be facing and help Countdown build a more 
diverse leadership pipeline.

Committed to reconciliation

Reconciliation is an important aspect of our Group purpose, to create better experiences together for a better tomorrow. 
We have been on a journey of reconciliation for over 10 years, with the launch of our first Reconciliation Action Plan 
(RAP) in 2011. Last year marked a step change in our approach informed by the 2021 Independent Panel Review (IPR) 
into a proposed Dan Murphy’s store development in Darwin. While we have demerged from Endeavour Group, the IPR 
highlighted gaps in Woolworths Group’s engagement with Indigenous communities, and has enabled us to listen and 
improve our approach to make a positive impact. 

Following the IPR, we developed our reconciliation strategy, endorsed by the Woolworths Group Board. This strategy 
will enable the Group to leverage our strengths to drive meaningful actions towards reconciliation. It will complement the 
development of our second Innovate level RAP, our ongoing support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and guide 
the next chapter of our journey. Our strategy is centred around three strategic pillars:

Focus area: Procurement 

Woolworths Group is committed to investing in 
the growth and sustainability of the Indigenous 
business sector. We will provide support and 
mentoring to Indigenous businesses seeking 
opportunities across Woolworths Group. In F22 
we updated our Procurement Policy with special 
conditions to increase Indigenous engagement and 
launched our internal Indigenous Business Directory. 
We participated in Supply Nation’s ‘Connect’ event 
as an exhibitor, meeting Indigenous businesses 
and industry leaders, building our connections 
and relationships.

Our 2025 target, from F23, is 3% of our non-trade 
influenceable spend with Indigenous suppliers.

Foundations for reconciliation

F22 has seen us establish many foundational elements 
to embed and sustain this strategy across our business. 
This encompasses the establishment of our First 
Nations Advisory Board and the creation of dedicated 
roles to bring expertise to our new Indigenous Affairs 
team, including Adam Bray, a proud Iman man, into the 
new role of General Manager Indigenous Strategy and 
Affairs. We have also enhanced the ways we listen 
to and amplify the voice of Indigenous customers, 
communities and team members. Our leaders and 
teams have spent time listening to and building 
relationships with Indigenous communities 
and organisations across the Northern Territory, 
far north Queensland, and other parts of Australia. 

Next year, we will continue our efforts to better 
understand the challenges facing remote Indigenous 
communities in relation to food security, affordability 
and nutrition. Importantly, in playing our part to improve 
these outcomes, we will work alongside government, 
industry, Indigenous organisations and communities. 

With almost 5,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
team members, and our footprint across Australia, 
Woolworths Group remains committed to making 
meaningful and sustainable contributions towards 
enhanced social, cultural, political and economic 
empowerment of Indigenous Australia.

The retail industry continues to be transformed by technological advances in 
automation, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and cloud computing. 
These changes are helping us better meet the needs of our customers, while 
at the same time fundamentally changing the nature of day-to-day work across 
Woolworths Group. 

In February 2021, we launched the Woolworths Future of Work Fund to upskill, 
reskill and redeploy team members impacted by industry disruption and 
technological change. The fund commits $50 million over three years to help 
equip our team with new skills and capabilities.

From launch through to the end of F22 we have invested $9 million in Future 
of Work programs, covering multi-skilling store teams and investing in digital 
capabilities, including:

• the launch of the Refugee Digital Cadetship delivered in partnership with 
Community Corporate (see page 19)

• investment in three reskilling pilot programs for high demand digital roles, 
including user experience and user interface design, product management 
and software engineering

• implementation of multi-skilling programs in all stores, including an 
eCommerce program completed by 5,500 team members. This is 
complemented by enhanced rostering, resource planning and store 
planning rhythms that increase certainty of work for our store teams.

To set our team up for success in the increasingly fast-paced retail environment, 
we have delivered learning programs and modules, and also embed Agile ways 
of working across our store and support teams. We continue to invest in the 
Data4All program to build capabilities for our teams in data analytics. 

Our team is critical to our success. In F23, we will continue to equip our frontline 
and support teams with the right skills for meaningful careers and enhance 
employability for both today and into the future.

Create meaningful 
retail careers for 
today and tomorrow

Technological innovation is spearheading 
the future of retail, and our customers are 
embracing different avenues to access products 
and information. As we too evolve in this context, 
we want to empower our team members with 
opportunities to help them feel comfortable with 
change and equip them with new skills to excel.

automation, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and cloud computing. 
These changes are helping us better meet the needs of our customers, while 
at the same time fundamentally changing the nature of day-to-day work across 
Woolworths Group. 

In February 2021, we launched the Woolworths Future of Work Fund to upskill, 
reskill and redeploy team members impacted by industry disruption and 
technological change. The fund commits $50 million over three years to help 
equip our team with new skills and capabilities.

From launch through to the end of F22 we have invested $9 million in Future 
of Work programs, covering multi-skilling store teams and investing in digital 
capabilities, including:

• the launch of the Refugee Digital Cadetship delivered in partnership with 
Community Corporate (see page 19)

• investment in three reskilling pilot programs for high demand digital roles, 
including user experience and user interface design, product management 
and software engineering

• implementation of multi-skilling programs in all stores, including an 
eCommerce program completed by 5,500 team members. This is 
complemented by enhanced rostering, resource planning and store 
planning rhythms that increase certainty of work for our store teams.

To set our team up for success in the increasingly fast-paced retail environment, 
we have delivered learning programs and modules, and also embed Agile ways 
of working across our store and support teams. We continue to invest in the 
Data4All program to build capabilities for our teams in data analytics. 

Our team is critical to our success. In F23, we will continue to equip our frontline 
and support teams with the right skills for meaningful careers and enhance 
employability for both today and into the future.

Create meaningful 
retail careers for 
today and tomorrow

Technological innovation is spearheading 
the future of retail, and our customers are 
embracing different avenues to access products 
and information. As we too evolve in this context, 
we want to empower our team members with 
opportunities to help them feel comfortable with 
change and equip them with new skills to excel.

Caring for our team with Sonder

In 2019, we partnered with Sonder, connecting our team and their families 
to a comprehensive range of 24/7 care. Instead of asking team members to 
navigate individual, disconnected support services across safety, medical and 
mental health, Sonder is an all-in-one care network in the palm of their hand.

Last year, we further expanded our use of Sonder, using a more holistic 
approach considering all aspects of a team member’s life. We found that:

• over 50% of the time, our team members received help for issues 
connected to, but beyond, what’s first presented

• 56% of our team who sought help reported they wouldn’t have sought 
support at all without Sonder.

Over 31,000 team members have downloaded Sonder since launch, with 
11,000 team members helped and 21,000 support cases raised. We will 
continue to raise ongoing awareness of support across the Group.

In a year filled with disruptions, the safety of our 
team and our communities has never been more

team and strive to create a culture where we support 
each other and it’s okay to ask for help. 

People:  
Goal 222

Living with COVID

In F22, we continued to support our teams 
and customers during COVID, informed by our 
Chief Medical Officer Dr Rob McCartney. 

We assisted 68,908 team members to manage 
their own illness or care for others with access to 
special paid COVID leave. As part of our support 
of the national vaccine rollouts, our COVID 
Vaccination Leave Policy also provided team 
members with up to four hours of paid leave, 
per vaccination. 16,633 team members accessed 
this leave option in F22. In addition, for our 
casual and salaried team, we offered shift swaps 
or flexible working arrangements to enable 
attendance at vaccination appointments.

Aiming to keep our team members safe, we set up 
our own pop-up vaccination hubs, administered 
12,342 vaccinations to team members and 
conducted 1.2 million rapid antigen tests at pop-up 
testing centres.

To provide team members with the safest possible 
work environment, and continue to supply the 
food and essential needs of our communities, 
Woolworths Group made the decision to 
implement a COVID Vaccination Policy, requiring 
all team members to be vaccinated or apply for an 
exemption. Currently, 99% of team members across 
the Group are double vaccinated.

In 2022, we have transitioned to ‘living with COVID’, 
continuing to follow government health advice and 
remaining vigilant to any changes as we continue 
to prioritise the health and safety of our team 
and customers.

Holistic wellbeing 

The holistic wellbeing of our team is a primary focus 
for Woolworths Group. We are continually striving to 
provide best-in-class responses on team wellbeing, 
informed by experts on our Wellbeing Advisory Council. 

In F22 we:

• provided 14,000 team members with mental 
health training to recognise and support mental 
health issues

• partnered with Mindstar (our wellbeing partner), 
to conduct over 137 group resilience sessions and 
wellbeing check-ins for 306 team members

• assisted 869 team members through Good 
Shepherd (our financial wellbeing partner) 
providing no fee, interest free loans, grants, gift 
cards and financial counselling to those in need.

Our F22 Total Recordable Injury 
Frequency Rate was 11.13, an 
improvement of 9%. We introduced 
Severity Rate, a holistic measure 
including all injuries for team and 
customers, and incidents with 
high potential for serious injury. 
Our F22 Severity Rate was 1.74, 
an improvement of 10%.

F22 Voice of Team was 15, see page 18.

Support in times of floods

During the devastating floods across the east coast 
we assisted our team by: 

• covering rosters and wages for those from 
stores that closed; and providing transfers to 
nearby stores

• paying natural disaster leave to over 3,500 of 
our team who were unable to attend work

• providing temporary accommodation, gift cards 
and care packages of essential items

• giving financial assistance to over 230 team 
members whose homes were damaged, 
plus interest free loans from our partners 
at Good Shepherd 

• delivering health, safety and wellbeing support 
through our partners Sonder and Mindstar.

Our Human Rights Program has been in place for five years and underpins 
the work we do with our suppliers to build a rights-respecting culture. 
It is our approach to managing human rights risks to people across 
Woolworths Group’s supply chain and covers a range of labour rights 
issues. Our Program is informed by the United Nations Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights, our Group Risk Management Framework 
and the Board approved Group Risk Appetite Statement, which identifies 
human rights as a level one risk, meaning we work ‘towards zero’ and 
aspire to eliminate these risks.

The Program covers four key elements:

Responsible Sourcing Program — focused on safeguarding the 
rights of workers in our supply chain through risk-based supplier 
segmentation and due diligence

Bespoke and targeted risk-based workstream — strategic workstream 
designed to target specific modern slavery risks, focused on industry and 
country specific due diligence and targeted mitigation plans, including 
supplier capability building, advocacy and industry memberships 

Partnering across our ecosystem — framework to inform our due 
diligence approach with controlled entities and commercial partnerships

Grievance and investigations — principles and procedures for 
responding to grievances in a timely manner and prioritising efficient 
and effective remediation where applicable

Activate ethical and mutually 
beneficial partnerships 
through the whole value chain

Partnering for human rights

We believe in the power of partnerships to enhance our approach and 
contribute to industry-wide change. In F22 we:

• formalised a partnership with the Retail Supply Chain Alliance 
to collaborate and safeguard the welfare of workers in our 
horticulture supply chain. This includes forums and workshops to 
enhance awareness of challenges and promote positive outcomes 
for all workers

• joined the Consumer Goods Forum Human Rights Coalition. 
One of the key projects of the Coalition is responsible recruitment 
in Malaysia, providing an opportunity to partner with other retailers 
to scale industry-wide change and manage risk in this area.

Woolworths Food 
Company was ranked 
the No.2 retailer on

Our progress in F22

This year, we progressed or completed: 

• a roadmap and pilot on labour costing in the BIG W apparel supply 
chain as part of our work with ACT on responsible purchasing practices

• our Sustainable Cotton Policy which was developed and published 

• supply chain traceability in a number of extreme risk commodity 
areas, including cotton

• a review of our Responsible Sourcing Policy and Standards to 
continually improve the effectiveness of our program. This process 
incorporated the publication of two new Addendums to address 
three indicators of modern slavery – withholding of passports, 
payment of recruitment fees, and child labour. The Responsible 
Recruitment Addendum and Child Labour Addendum deliver clear 
implementation guidance for our suppliers on our expectations and 
commitments for the protection of human rights in our supply chain. 

Through our influence, and with our oversight, suppliers have delivered 
tangible outcomes for workers in our supply chain, which includes: 

• monitoring supplier repayments of $184,000 to 722 workers in our 
cleaning and trolley supply chains across Australian and New Zealand 

• approximately $805,000 has been, or is in the process of being, 
returned to at least 285 migrant workers in Malaysia who had paid 
recruitment fees in source countries.

Looking ahead

This year, our Human Rights 
Program was shortlisted 
for the Thomson Reuters 
Stop Slavery Award in 
recognition of our continuous 
improvements. Whilst we are 
proud of the progress we have 
made, we recognise there is 
much more to do. Our F23 
priorities include:

• continued focus on 
improving supply chain 
transparency and 
traceability with our 
cotton suppliers 

• undertaking our second 
forced labour risk 
assessment so that our 
program of work continues 
to identify and focus on 
high priority areas

• a dedicated stream of work 
focused on developing 
our strategic approach to 
move beyond audit and 
embedding worker voice 
into our program.

Standing with  
our communities 

Woolworths Group’s Supporting Through Australian Natural Disasters (S.T.A.N.D) 
program aims to help our communities, particularly in times of natural disasters. 
Through financial support, proceeds from our S.T.A.N.D Spring Water, our 
customers’ generosity and our partners, The Salvation Army, Rural Aid, Foodbank 
and Lifeline, communities are also supported with disaster preparedness, 
response, recovery and resilience.

Funds raised through our S.T.A.N.D program this past year, including our annual 
donation of $500,000, are essential to help The Salvation Army respond when 
natural disaster strikes. 

During east coast floods in March 2022, it was demonstrated once again the 
power partnerships have in positively impacting our communities. At this time, 
the Salvation Army served over 40,000 meals and refreshments to evacuees and 
first responders in 25 evacuation centres. In addition, the $784,000 donated by 
our generous customers to The Salvation Army’s Flood Appeal assisted in helping 
over 28,000 households and providing over 25,000 recovery grants.

Rounding up 
for good

In F22, Woolworths Supermarkets 
continued to offer customers 
a solution to give back to their 
communities and donate to charity 
organisations by rounding up their 
payments. We thank our customers 
for donating those extra cents which 
added up to over $6.3 million, making 
a real difference to our charity 
partners such as OzHarvest, Variety –  
the Children’s Charity and Good 360. 

Partnering to share the dignity

Since 2019, Woolworths Supermarkets has partnered 
with Share the Dignity to help address period poverty. 
Dignity Drives, held each March and August, aim to 
raise awareness and encourage customers to support this 
unseen plight.

For every period care product sold during our Dignity Drives, 
we donate 5c to Share the Dignity. The over $2 million raised 
since our partnership commenced has funded the installation 
of over 100 Dignity Vending Machines, providing period 
products to those in need, discreetly and free of charge.

In F22, more than 178,500 new period care products were 
collected from customers in store. Since 2019, a total of 
576,351 products have been donated to local community 
services helping women and girls in need.

Eco-champions of the future

In June 2022, Woolworths Junior Landcare Grants 
were awarded to 1,054 Primary Schools and 
Early Learning Centres to help grow our future 
environmental champions. These grants (up to $1,000 
each) fund hands-on projects focused on sustainable 
food production, improving waste management 
and enhancing native habitats. The F22 program is 
set to engage more than 100,000 children all around 
the country. The program has now funded more 
than 3,800 projects, worth more than $4 million, 
since the program started in 2018. In May 2022, 
we also supported the development of 10 First 
Nations activities for the online Junior Landcare 
Learning Centre, designed to help bring First Nations 
perspectives into the home and classroom.

Fostering sustainable farming

In F22, the Woolworths Organic Growth Fund delivered 
$1,140,000 in grants and interest-free loans to organic growers, 
including Gurra Downs Date Company in South Australia. 
Our support for the family-owned organic date farm will boost 
production capacity through new machinery, aiming to increase 
the availability of Australian-grown dates. This Fund, together 
with the Woolworths Dairy Innovation Fund, supports sustainable 
farming projects across the country.

response, recovery and resilience.

Funds raised through our S.T.A.N.D program this past year, including our annual 
donation of $500,000, are essential to help The Salvation Army respond when 
natural disaster strikes. 

During east coast floods in March 2022, it was demonstrated once again the 
power partnerships have in positively impacting our communities. At this time, 
the Salvation Army served over 40,000 meals and refreshments to evacuees and 
first responders in 25 evacuation centres. In addition, the $784,000 donated by 
our generous customers to The Salvation Army’s Flood Appeal assisted in helping 
over 28,000 households and providing over 25,000 recovery grants.

Rounding up 
for good

In F22, Woolworths Supermarkets 
continued to offer customers 
a solution to give back to their 
communities and donate to charity 
organisations by rounding up their 
payments. We thank our customers 
for donating those extra cents which 
added up to over $6.3 million, making 
a real difference to our charity 
partners such as OzHarvest, Variety –  
the Children’s Charity and Good 360. 

Partnering to share the dignity

Since 2019, Woolworths Supermarkets has partnered 
with Share the Dignity to help address period poverty. 
Dignity Drives, held each March and August, aim to 
raise awareness and encourage customers to support this 
unseen plight.

For every period care product sold during our Dignity Drives, 
we donate 5c to Share the Dignity. The over $2 million raised 
since our partnership commenced has funded the installation 
of over 100 Dignity Vending Machines, providing period 
products to those in need, discreetly and free of charge.

In F22, more than 178,500 new period care products were 
collected from customers in store. Since 2019, a total of 
576,351 products have been donated to local community 
services helping women and girls in need.

Eco-champions of the future

In June 2022, Woolworths Junior Landcare Grants 
were awarded to 1,054 Primary Schools and 
Early Learning Centres to help grow our future 
environmental champions. These grants (up to $1,000 
each) fund hands-on projects focused on sustainable 
food production, improving waste management 
and enhancing native habitats. The F22 program is 
set to engage more than 100,000 children all around 
the country. The program has now funded more 
than 3,800 projects, worth more than $4 million, 
since the program started in 2018. In May 2022, 
we also supported the development of 10 First 
Nations activities for the online Junior Landcare 
Learning Centre, designed to help bring First Nations 
perspectives into the home and classroom.

Fostering sustainable farming

In F22, the Woolworths Organic Growth Fund delivered 
$1,140,000 in grants and interest-free loans to organic growers, 
including Gurra Downs Date Company in South Australia. 
Our support for the family-owned organic date farm will boost 
production capacity through new machinery, aiming to increase 
the availability of Australian-grown dates. This Fund, together 
with the Woolworths Dairy Innovation Fund, supports sustainable 
farming projects across the country.

We are committed to reducing our emissions footprint in line 
with our Sustainability Plan 2025, improving our operational 
resilience and adapting to the predicted effects of a changing 
climate. Our climate change strategy determines our approach, 
and is approved by the Woolworths Group Board. 

Our strategy focuses on delivering our commitments and effectively managing climate risk. The strategy’s 
end‑to‑end approach, centred on five pillars (outlined on page 33), considers the implications across our value 
chain and impacts on our external stakeholders.

Climate‑related risks and opportunities are identified through the Woolworths Group risk management process 
in line with our Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Risk Committee has oversight of the RMF and the 
Group risk profile. Governance is supported by the Woolworths Group Executive Committee and relevant 
committees and forums across the Woolworths Group.

Specific oversight of climate risk is managed by the Board Sustainability Committee. The Sustainability 
Committee monitors progress against the strategy, and is responsible for reviewing and endorsing our targets 
to manage actual or potential climate‐related impacts to the Group. 

See the 2022 Annual Report for our update on Task Force on Climate‑Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Climate change 
strategy

Building our resilience

It is now clear that climate impacts are being felt, 
with the 2019–2020 summer bushfires exacerbated 
by extreme heat and underlying drought conditions. 1 
We have already made progress adapting to the 
current effects of climate change. 

Climate risk assessments and store-level engineering 
reviews have identified more than a dozen potential 
impacts and risk mitigation measures such as:

• designing stores in the monsoonal north to 
withstand cyclone risk

• adding backup generation to high risk stores

• increasing stormwater capacity

• harvesting rainwater in high stress water areas

• ventilating plantrooms to assist cooling 
equipment during heatwaves

• avoiding low-level plantrooms to mitigate 
against flooding

• installing flood barriers in stores in flood 
prone areas.

Within our supply chain, our Townsville distribution 
centre (DC) was commissioned in consideration 
of the risk of this region becoming isolated due to 
extreme weather.

During the autumn flooding in Queensland this year 
the DC was able to keep local supermarkets stocked 
while supply routes were interrupted.

Our focus for the next 12 months will be on the 
commencement of climate change resilience plans 
for our logistics networks and continuation of physical 
resilience in our stores.

32

Reduce and green our power use

• Implementing energy efficiency improvements across our network of stores and offices, 
and optimising new design and construction across our distribution centres to reduce 
electricity consumption

• Sourcing 100% green electricity across the Group by 2025. Our green electricity progress 
is covered in Planet Goal 1 on page 38

Introduce low-carbon tech and practices

• Continually upgrading our store network to low global warming potential (GWP) 
refrigeration systems

• Testing zero emissions transport solutions across parts of our fleet covering trucking 
refrigeration, home delivery, store vehicles and charging, and trolley collection. See pages 35 
and 37 for selected case studies

Increase resilience in our value chain

• Assessing climate risks and opportunities associated with physical, transition and food security risk, 
and how these impact our customers, suppliers and operations. See the Understanding Climate 
Risk section of the 2022 Annual Report

• Adopting resilience measures to address acute and chronic physical risks, see page 32

• Working with our suppliers to increase food production resilience, in conjunction with our 
nurturing nature strategy. See Planet Goal 4 on page 42

Support industry, customer and team carbon neutrality

• Enabling our customers and team to reduce their emissions: Green Delivery Windows allows 
customers to choose a time when deliveries are scheduled in their neighbourhood, reducing 
fuel and emissions. Our customers also have further opportunities through our Origin Everyday 
Rewards Plan, which provides 25% Green Power for electricity customers and 100% of gas 
emissions offset through Climate Active

• Supporting suppliers in their own decarbonisation efforts. Our value chain emissions pilot is 
our first formal step toward addressing scope 3 supplier emissions, see pages 36 to 37

Support community climate change resilience

• Providing direct support for natural disaster affected communities through our Woolworths 
Group S.T.A.N.D program. See People Goal 5 on page 26

• Mitigating the impact of store closures and maintaining stock where needed through physical 
store and network resilience

Operational emissions reductions
Scope 1 and 2 emissions are those directly within our operational control. 
Our material scope 1 emissions sources include fugitive synthetic refrigerants, 
transport fuel for our fleet cars and home delivery trucks, and natural gas. 
Our scope 2 emissions are those associated with electricity use across all stores, 
distribution centres and offices. Scope 2 electricity emissions make up the 
largest part of our operational footprint.

Woolworths Group is currently committed to achieving a 63% reduction in 
emissions from our operations by 2030. This target was ratified by the Science 
Based Target initiative (SBTi) in 2020, and is currently under review. SBTi is an 
independent global body formed by the United Nations Global Compact, CDP, 
the World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature. The SBTi 
assesses and approves companies’ targets through a scientific lens, ensuring 
alignment with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting climate change to an 
increase of 1.5 degrees above pre‑industrial levels.

Our annual emissions this year reflect the updated operational boundaries 
of Woolworths Group, including the demerger of Endeavour Group and the 
acquisitions of PFD Foods and Quantium, and are recalculated for earlier 
years. We have also included a revision of emissions sources in line with the 
National Greenhouse and Energy Report Act, and revisions to refrigerant 
GWPs as reported in the 2021 AR6 report. Accounting for the above changes, 
our absolute emissions year‑on‑year have increased marginally by <1%. 
This is due to one‑off increases in the factors used to calculate emissions 
from refrigerants 1, and the inclusion of additional minor emission sources for 
the first time, primarily related to scope 1 fuel usage (eg LPG used in materials 
handling equipment). Conversely, year‑on‑year change in scope 2 electricity 
use shows a continued decrease, with Australian supermarkets and BIG W 
both continuing to reduce emissions through energy efficiency initiatives.

Acknowledging our significant footprint across Australia and New Zealand, 
we are taking an end‑to‑end approach to decarbonisation, which informs 
our management of climate risks and opportunities to mitigate.

Addressing the impact of climate change 
is critical both locally and globally. We know 
we can do more, so we aspire to become a 
net positive business, partnering to take more 
carbon out of the atmosphere than we produce.

Emissions reductions in store

Our energy efficiency initiatives 
continue to deliver year‑on‑year 
reductions on store energy use. 
These initiatives include refrigeration 
upgrades, more efficient equipment, 
LED lighting, and store retrofits such 
as fridge doors. In F22, over 1,000 
energy initiatives were implemented 
across the Group. We also monitored 
energy consumption through 
our Energy Management Centre, 
enabling real‑time tracking to 
pinpoint peaks and patterns to 
support reduction interventions. 

Refrigeration is our top priority 
as it plays a critical role in food 
quality, and refrigerant gas leakages 
represents our second largest source 
of emissions following electricity. 
Over F22, we continued to install 
new transcritical CO2 systems, 
now covering 73 stores, up by 21 
this year, through replacements, 
upgrades and new store installation. 
Transcritical systems are considered 
a better, lower‑emissions option for 
refrigeration systems, estimated 
to save each store 100 tonnes of 
CO2e annually. We also worked on 
our management of leaks through 
early detection.

Green Star design

Green Star buildings are built for 
high resource efficiency and better 
productivity. Woolworths Group 
has committed to all new property 
developments achieving a 4 Star 
Green Star. By 2025, we aim to have a 
5 Star Green Star minimum standard.

Our Heathwood DC, opened 
in Queensland, is targeting a 5 
Star Green Star certification for 
sustainable buildings. If successful, 
it will be the Group’s first 5 Star 
Green Star DC in the state. The build 
features 2.5MW of solar (the largest 
installed by the Group to date), 
a stormwater detention tank to 
capture up to three million litres of 
rainwater, and provision for electric 
cars and trucks. To support the 
local ecosystem, together with 
long‑term development partner 
LOGOS, we are installing native 
bee colonies on‑site which borders 
neighbouring bushland. F22 also 
saw us open our first 5 Star Green 
Star supermarket in New Zealand, 
Countdown Waiata Shores, together 
with two 4 Star Green Star DCs.

The SBTi requires that organisations regularly review their progress 
and baselines. As our ecosystem evolves, we will review any changes 
and determine if emissions baseline changes are material and require 
recertification of our targets.

Our pathway to net positive (scope 1 and 2) includes a number of 
key initiatives: energy efficiency, renewable energy sourcing and 
generation, refrigeration upgrades and transport decarbonisation. 
These, discussed on page 37, contribute directly to reductions in 
energy use and emissions as outlined in the chart below. 

Our remaining operational emissions consist of refrigerants that are 
difficult to replace, and fuel consumption related to backup generation. 
As new opportunities are identified, we will integrate these into our 
plan. Where direct reductions remain impractical, use of carbon offsets 
will be considered. Any use of offsets will be in line with SBTi guidelines 
and subject to an internal due diligence process to ensure adequate 
environmental, social, cultural and economic co‑benefits are achieved.

Operational emissions reductions
Scope 1 and 2 emissions are those directly within our operational control. 
Our material scope 1 emissions sources include fugitive synthetic refrigerants, 
transport fuel for our fleet cars and home delivery trucks, and natural gas. 
Our scope 2 emissions are those associated with electricity use across all stores, 
distribution centres and offices. Scope 2 electricity emissions make up the 
largest part of our operational footprint.

Woolworths Group is currently committed to achieving a 63% reduction in 
emissions from our operations by 2030. This target was ratified by the Science 
Based Target initiative (SBTi) in 2020, and is currently under review. SBTi is an 
independent global body formed by the United Nations Global Compact, CDP, 
the World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature. The SBTi 
assesses and approves companies’ targets through a scientific lens, ensuring 
alignment with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting climate change to an 
increase of 1.5 degrees above pre‑industrial levels.

Our annual emissions this year reflect the updated operational boundaries 
of Woolworths Group, including the demerger of Endeavour Group and the 
acquisitions of PFD Foods and Quantium, and are recalculated for earlier 
years. We have also included a revision of emissions sources in line with the 
National Greenhouse and Energy Report Act, and revisions to refrigerant 
GWPs as reported in the 2021 AR6 report. Accounting for the above changes, 
our absolute emissions year‑on‑year have increased marginally by <1%. 
This is due to one‑off increases in the factors used to calculate emissions 
from refrigerants 1, and the inclusion of additional minor emission sources for 
the first time, primarily related to scope 1 fuel usage (eg LPG used in materials 
handling equipment). Conversely, year‑on‑year change in scope 2 electricity 
use shows a continued decrease, with Australian supermarkets and BIG W 
both continuing to reduce emissions through energy efficiency initiatives.

Acknowledging our significant footprint across Australia and New Zealand, 
we are taking an end‑to‑end approach to decarbonisation, which informs 
our management of climate risks and opportunities to mitigate.

Addressing the impact of climate change 
is critical both locally and globally. We know

Understanding the emissions in our value chain

The majority of Woolworths Group’s emissions are generated within our value chain – from agriculture, the production of 
raw materials, manufacturing of products, and transporting finished products to our DCs and stores. These scope 3 value 
chain emissions are calculated to be approximately 14 times greater than both our scope 1 and 2 emissions combined. 
We acknowledge the scale of this challenge, and this year have improved our measurement of emissions across our entire value.

Hear how we’re reducing 
emissions across our business

Value chain emissions program
We are currently committed to achieving a 19% reduction in value chain 
emissions by 2030. This target was ratified by SBTi in 2020 and we are 
in the process of submitting an updated target for re‑validation. We are 
approaching how we achieve this target systematically – first seeking 
to understand the areas in which our scope 3 footprint is concentrated. 
Splitting this by product category enables us to prioritise our work 
in areas where we believe there is the greatest potential for material 
emissions reduction.

Many of Woolworths Group’s suppliers have already set their own 
independent targets to reduce emissions. In June 2022, we invited 55 
suppliers (across Australia and New Zealand) to trial a new program 
providing them with insights to prioritise their own emissions work 
and giving us visibility to determine key focus areas. These suppliers 
are from the six priority categories that represent 80% of food product 
emissions. We are partnering on this program with The Sustainability 
Consortium (TSC), a global non‑profit organisation, to collaboratively 
use a science‑based decision tool, THESIS, to capture the emissions data. 
Following a review of the trial, we plan to progressively expand the reach 
of the program, giving all suppliers the opportunity to join an annual 
cycle of measurement and improvement.

In partnership with our suppliers, industry and government, we intend 
to identify short‑term opportunities for reduction across the value chain, 
and those requiring additional support and innovative solutions over the 
longer term. This understanding will form the basis of our value chain 
emissions reduction strategy, that we will detail in future reports.

We have made material improvements in our data coverage this year and 
will report holistically on progress against our scope 3 target from F23.

Decarbonising transport opportunities
We recognise the need to decarbonise our transport and logistics 
operations, which represent a small but visible part of our direct emissions 
with customers increasingly taking advantage of home deliveries. 
Across our supply chain operations, trucking and other freight emissions 
also represent a material part of our supply chain footprint. We are trialling 
lower emissions options:

• Primary Connect has deployed a truck trailer designed to reduce 
emissions and provide quieter trucking. The e‑axle trailer uses kinetic 
energy produced by the trailer’s turning wheels and axle, harnessing 
it to feed electricity into the on‑board battery. This battery then 
powers the trailer’s refrigeration system, reducing the truck’s overall 
emissions. A single trailer is estimated to save over 5,000 litres of fuel 
or 14 tonnes of CO2‑e annually

• two electric vehicles – BEV and TREV – are delivering 
groceries to Woolworths Supermarket online customers 
in Sydney and Melbourne.

Within our value chain we are exploring zero emissions transport 
opportunities with our carriers. In September, our logistics arm Primary 
Connect in partnership with Linfox launched what is the only Volvo FL 
electric vehicle in Australia fitted with refrigeration, operating out of our 
Melbourne Fresh DC.

Solar

To support our transition to 100% renewable electricity, Woolworths Group 
is continuing its solar panel rollout. By installing solar onto our store and DC 
rooftops, we generate renewable power that can be used to offset our grid 
requirements. Our Heathwood DC, opened in April, includes our largest 
installed rooftop system to date with 2.5MW of solar. In May, our Conder store 
in the ACT became the 150th Woolworths supermarket generating electricity 
from solar across Australia. Our Townsville DC, upgraded in 2019, included an 
oversized solar system which we now utilise to supply nearby Woolworths 
supermarket and BIG W stores with excess power through a peer‑to‑peer 
energy trading arrangement. This is a glimpse into the future of distributed 
energy generation in Australia and allows us to supply stores that don’t have 
access to allow rooftop solar.

Our total rooftop capacity now exceeds 33MW – that’s more than 90,000 
solar panels.

100% green 
electricity by 2025

We are one of the largest users of electricity across 
Australia and New Zealand, and our electricity use 
represents the majority of our operational emissions 
footprint. Our goal to be 100% powered by green 
electricity will make a significant positive change 
to Australia’s energy mix, and includes utilising our 
own rooftops where possible, and investing in new 
large-scale renewable energy projects.

Investing in the renewable 
energy sector
Our primary approach to investing in renewables prioritises investment in new renewable energy generation 
to grow the availability of green electricity for businesses and the community, and provide new jobs in a sector 
that requires significant growth to meet growing demand for clean energy. 

This year saw our first major renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) energised in Bango NSW, supplying 
about 30% of our electricity needs in the state. The new wind farm generated over 100 jobs in its construction 
and operation, and provides rent back to local landholders hosting wind turbines.

In May 2022 we signed an agreement with Iberdrola Australia to supply 100% renewable electricity to provide

Solar

To support our transition to 100% renewable electricity, Woolworths Group 
is continuing its solar panel rollout. By installing solar onto our store and DC 
rooftops, we generate renewable power that can be used to offset our grid 
requirements. Our Heathwood DC, opened in April, includes our largest 
installed rooftop system to date with 2.5MW of solar. In May, our Conder store 
in the ACT became the 150th Woolworths supermarket generating electricity 
from solar across Australia. Our Townsville DC, upgraded in 2019, included an 
oversized solar system which we now utilise to supply nearby Woolworths 
supermarket and BIG W stores with excess power through a peer‑to‑peer 
energy trading arrangement. This is a glimpse into the future of distributed 
energy generation in Australia and allows us to supply stores that don’t have 
access to allow rooftop solar.

Our total rooftop capacity now exceeds 33MW – that’s more than 90,000 
solar panels.

100% green 
electricity by 2025

We are one of the largest users of electricity across 
Australia and New Zealand, and our electricity use 
represents the majority of our operational emissions 
footprint. Our goal to be 100% powered by green 
electricity will make a significant positive change 
to Australia’s energy mix, and includes utilising our 
own rooftops where possible, and investing in new 
large-scale renewable energy projects.

Investing in the renewable 
energy sector
Our primary approach to investing in renewables prioritises investment in new renewable energy generation 
to grow the availability of green electricity for businesses and the community, and provide new jobs in a sector 
that requires significant growth to meet growing demand for clean energy. 

This year saw our first major renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) energised in Bango NSW, supplying 
about 30% of our electricity needs in the state. The new wind farm generated over 100 jobs in its construction 
and operation, and provides rent back to local landholders hosting wind turbines.

In May 2022 we signed an agreement with Iberdrola Australia to supply 100% renewable electricity to provide 
all of our energy needs in South Australia, covering 70 Woolworths supermarkets, 17 BIG W stores and our 
Adelaide Regional DC. The Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park hosts 50 wind turbines and 250,000 solar 
panels working in tandem to supply round the clock energy.

We apply an end‑to‑end approach to how we responsibly manage food waste. 
We support our farmers upstream to reduce food waste to landfill through 
initiatives such as the Odd Bunch, in our own operations through rescue 
and diversion, and downstream by educating and inspiring our customers. 
This year, in our Australian supermarkets, we have re‑imagined how we educate 
and support our teams on food waste, centred on our Food Waste Diversion 
Pyramid. This pyramid applies a hierarchy to our approach based on positive 
impact, first supporting people in need through food rescue, followed by our 
farmer and wildlife partnerships, and finally food waste recycling. We have 
more to do to embed these changes and identify our next step in our food 
waste reduction journey.

Supporting wildlife and farmers 

Thanks to our partnership with WIRES, we are now the largest pro bono 
provider of food for wildlife in Australia. Our partnership, born during the 
2019/2020 Black Summer bushfires, has grown to over 200 stores now 
donating surplus food to local wildlife rescue carers across all states and 
territories. Woolworths Supermarkets’ annual WIRES fundraising in F22 
supported $300,000 in food grants to over 150 Australian wildlife rescue 
agencies, as well as the allocation of $100,000 for emergency rescue and 
recovery resources and equipment during the east coast floods. ‘The 
Odd Bunch’ has saved over 250,000 tonnes of fruit and vegetables from 
being wasted since 2015. It helps farmers sell more of their crop and our 
customers enjoy more affordable fresh produce. 

Data & reporting

We have been working with 
teams in store to enhance 
our processes for food waste 
which will see data and 
reporting improvements in 
F23. These changes make it 
easier for the team to select 
which diversion pathway food 
waste follows.

Using Food 
for Good 

As part of its Using Food for 
Good project, Countdown is 
working to deliver its first zero 
food waste stores, Countdown 
Manukau Mall and Countdown 
St Johns. The project and store 
teams work together to test 
food waste initiatives and work 
towards zero food waste to 
landfill. This includes working 
with suppliers to manage stock 
when nearing best before or 
use‑by dates, improving the 
management of food waste 
data, repurposing rescued 
food to create new products, 
and empowering food waste 
champions in store.Recycling food waste

When food is no longer suitable for human or animal consumption, 
we aim to recycle rather than send it to landfill. Currently, around 
70% of Woolworths Supermarkets have a food waste recycling 
solution in place, such as commercial composting to nourish plants. 
We have more to do to extend this across our network. The food 
waste recycling industry in Australia and New Zealand is in its infancy, 
therefore it is critical to continue working with existing partners, 
industry and government to explore solutions and innovation. 
One such innovation is Goterra’s black soldier fly larvae technology, 
which turns food waste into sustainable livestock feed. Following 
a successful pilot, this partnership now forms part of our Australian 
Capital Territories stores’ business as usual approach and stores 
enabled with this service perform consistently higher in rates 
of food waste diversion.

Record year  
for food rescue 
partnership 

2022 has been a year of 
significant milestones for our 
food rescue partnerships. Our 
contribution is helping alleviate 
food insecurity, experienced by 
one in six Australians. In F22, 
we provided 30 million meals to 
Australians and New Zealanders 
in need.  Since 2014,  together 
with OzHarvest, we have 
provided >50 million meals. 
Moreover, we celebrated 20 years 
of collaboration with Foodbank 
as their largest food donor and 
pro bono freight provider.

Responsible stewardship of natural resources supports the resilience of food 
and fibre production systems, helps to mitigate the impact of natural disasters 
and contributes to the reduction of our scope 3 emissions. 

In 2022, we developed our nurturing nature strategy, formalising our approach 
to the responsible stewardship of natural resources and sustainable protein in 
our supply chain. Nurturing nature prioritises specific actions across Woolworths 
Group by building on the significant work already underway within our business, 
suppliers and the agriculture industry. The strategy consists of three pillars:

• Leading the future of protein – providing affordable and sustainable 
proteins across traditional, plant and alternative sources. At the same time 
meeting the highest standards of animal welfare

• Partnering with our suppliers – supporting our growers and farmers to 
improve farming practices, collaborating with our supply chain to identify 
barriers to practice change and pursue mutually beneficial outcomes

• Having a positive impact on nature – working within our supply chain 
to improve soil health, water stewardship and biodiversity 

As we continue to understand the impact farming practices have on climate 
change, and what’s required to improve the resilience of farming systems, 
we will evolve our approach in collaboration with our partners. We will also 
encourage our suppliers to continue to adopt and increase the application 
of the following principles across their supply chains:

• manage landscapes to improve soil health 

• optimise the use of chemical inputs 

• improve water use efficiency and reduce impact on waterways 

• reduce emissions

• improve animal husbandry practices

• care for people involved in, and impacted by, their operations.

In the coming year we will commence the implementation of our strategy, 
seeking to simplify the assessment of sustainable and regenerative practices 
for customer and suppliers; and improve our understanding of nature based 
risk in our supply chains

Practise responsible 
stewardship of 
natural resources

Natural resources are depleting faster than they 
can be replenished, and biodiversity is declining. 
Agriculture is the backbone of our business and 
we are committed to working with our partners 
to encourage sustainable and regenerative 
practices for future generations to come.

Key initiatives informing our approach to the responsible stewardship of natural resources include:

• Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum membership – supporting the 
consideration of nature-related risks in our supply chain, the connection to climate change and the 
preservation of biodiversity

• Science Based Targets Network Corporate Engagement Program – testing their methodology to inform 
the development of science-based targets that promote positive outcomes for nature and climate.

Water efficiency

In 2021, we commissioned an updated water use report across Group operations examining our consumption, 
measurement and opportunities to improve water efficiency. Our supermarkets (Woolworths and Countdown) 
and BIG W stores account for the most water used at 87%, with fresh food departments the most influential 
factor. The remaining 13% is used by DCs, warehouses and offices. The water use of supermarkets highlights 
the importance of our ongoing smart water meters installation program. By the end of F22, smart water meters 
were installed in 380 stores, connected to our Energy Management Centre, allowing for near real‑time visibility 
of water use.

From F23, we will report against a new water metric which aims to reduce our Group water use by 10% by 2025 
(2020 baseline).

Beyond store water usage, our water stewardship approach looks at the broader catchment to help identify 
opportunities to collaborate on shared water targets and challenges. One such example is W360’s partnership 
with Water Stewardship Asia Pacific in Renmark, South Australia.

Partnering on 
regenerative agriculture

In New Zealand, Countdown has launched a $1 million 
(NZD), three‑year project to research the benefits 
of regenerative farming practices in vegetable 
production. The project, part‑funded by the Ministry 
for Primary Industries’ Sustainable Food and Fibre 
Futures Fund, is being run in collaboration with one 
of Countdown’s key suppliers ‑ LeaderBrand Produce. 

The project will trial regenerative principles and 
practices designed to mirror nature. The focus 
will be on the use of compost and cover crops as 
tools to improve soil health, the role of perennial 
plantings in facilitating ecosystem restoration, 
and community engagement. 

In F23, as the project progresses we will facilitate 
opportunities for our supplier community to learn 
more about regenerative agriculture. Sharing their 
own learnings and supporting a wider understanding 
of how to incorporate regenerative principles and 
practices into farming and growing.

This year, we established our baseline to understand what customers are 
buying in our supermarkets. 3 To do this, we used the Government’s Health Star 
Rating (HSR) system to assign a star rating to eligible products. Our ambition is 
to grow the proportion of sales from healthier products by 50 basis points (bps) 
annually. To measure our progress, we define healthier products as those with 
a HSR of 3.5 stars and above. We will also understand movements across the 
full spectrum of HSRs to evaluate the impact of our initiatives. 

We recognise a healthy balanced diet consists of a variety of nutritious foods 
in alignment with the Dietary Guidelines. In light of this, we will also better 
understand the balance of our customers’ baskets through the healthylife Food 
Tracker, which provides insight into core and discretionary foods purchased.

To drive our health ambitions further, this year we formed our Woolworths 
Supermarkets Supplier Sustainability Council – Healthier Choices, a forum to 
engage with our suppliers to support the achievement of our 2025 commitments.

Encouraging 
Australian kids 
to be healthier

We aim to inspire and empower the 
next generation through healthier 
products, engaging activities and 
ideas to help make healthier eating 
easier for families.

This year, we became the foundation 
partner of Life Education Australia’s 
Thrive Children’s Fund, helping 8,000 
regional and remote kids access 
nutrition education.

Our Fresh Food Kids Discovery Tour 
program was re-imagined digitally 
to make it more accessible for kids 
to learn about where fresh food 
comes from. Over 50,000 kids have 
enjoyed the new program since 
launch. The Free Fruit for Kids in-store 
initiative gave away over 19 million 
pieces of fruit this year. 

We continue to support the 
Woolworths Centre for Childhood 
Nutrition Research, a $5 million 
research centre in partnership with 
the Children’s Hospital Foundation.

Healthier own brands

We are committed to making healthier easier for our customers 
through a number of initiatives, including making healthier choices 
more accessible and reformulating our own brand products. We are 
making progress: 

• 76% of eligible Woolworths own brand products meet the Australian 
Government’s Healthy Food Partnership targets for salt, sugar and 
saturated fat 

• 65% of Countdown own brand products meet the New Zealand 
Heart Foundation’s HeartSAFE targets

• launching 34 new Macro Wholefoods Market branded products and 
winning the Healthy Food Guide Awards Best Allergy-Friendly Snack

• increasing our range of plant-based alternatives, including 
Woolworths Plantitude burgers (each 4 HSR) and chilled ready meals 
(each high in protein plus a serve of vegetables or source of fibre).

In December 2021, for the third year in a row, Woolworths own brand range 
was ranked the healthiest of the four major Australian retailers by 
The George Institute for Global Health based on mean HSR. 2

We display the HSR on all relevant own brand products to help 
customers make informed choices, and continue to be free from 
artificial colours, flavours and added MSG.

This year, we established our baseline to understand what customers are 
buying in our supermarkets. 3 To do this, we used the Government’s Health Star 
Rating (HSR) system to assign a star rating to eligible products. Our ambition is 
to grow the proportion of sales from healthier products by 50 basis points (bps) 
annually. To measure our progress, we define healthier products as those with 
a HSR of 3.5 stars and above. We will also understand movements across the 
full spectrum of HSRs to evaluate the impact of our initiatives. 

We recognise a healthy balanced diet consists of a variety of nutritious foods 
in alignment with the Dietary Guidelines. In light of this, we will also better 
understand the balance of our customers’ baskets through the healthylife Food 
Tracker, which provides insight into core and discretionary foods purchased.

To drive our health ambitions further, this year we formed our Woolworths 
Supermarkets Supplier Sustainability Council – Healthier Choices, a forum to 
engage with our suppliers to support the achievement of our 2025 commitments.

Making healthier easier

Our 2022 Woolworths Supermarkets Making Healthier Easier campaign 
featured Prices Dropped on hundreds of healthier products, our ranking 
as Australia’s Healthiest Supermarket Own Brands 1 and our collection 
of hundreds of healthier recipes.

Our Making Healthier Easier online hub allows customers in Australia to 
explore healthier products and inspiration, and our healthier recipe page 
has over 450 recipes. Healthier Options is now available on the Woolworths 
app to help customers discover healthier alternatives as they shop.

Countdown has a range of healthier recipes online, with the intention 
of growing this collection further to inspire Kiwis to cook healthier meals.

Supporting Australian kids to be active

Keeping active is not only fun for kids but helps establish healthier 
habits. Woolworths Supermarkets continued its Pick Fresh Play 
Fresh Netball Grants, totalling over $1.2 million to more than 300 local 
Australian netball communities over the last five years. On top of other 
key initiatives, we donated $30,000 in grants and equipment to Lismore 
District Netball Association, a community severely impacted by floods. 
We also hosted a clinic with former Australian captain and Woolworths 
NetSetGO ambassador Cath Cox.

At Woolworths Group we are working hard to make our packaging as 
sustainable as possible by phasing out problematic packaging ahead 
of the Australian Government’s 2025 National Packaging Targets timeline. 

This year, we enhanced our data capabilities and worked to build our 
product level master data for own brand packaging by engaging an 
external expert, MSAC Solutions. We also partnered internally with our 
advanced analytics and packaging teams to deeply understand our 
packaging data. This has given us the ability to better estimate our historical 
plastic usage across the Group and re-create a 2018 baseline which is used 
to compare our progress to target against and calculate the impact of all 
targeted packaging changes implemented. This data enhancement has 
provided greater visibility of our performance against our commitments, 
which we intend to commence reporting on in F23.

In F22, our teams completed 15 packaging redesign projects which will 
convert non-recyclable materials to recyclable, and reduce virgin plastic 
in packaging by 4,262 tonnes, achieving over 10,000 tonnes reduction, through 
targeted initiatives, from our baseline. The examples on page 51 give an insight 
into the scope and impact of four of these projects.

Fresh fruit and vegetables and bakery continue to be our most challenging 
categories for packaging improvement as we balance factors, including food 
safety, quality, product integrity and reducing food waste. Our team continues 
to drive innovation in this space, some of which hit shelves in F22, for example 
our plastic free Woolworths Fresh Food Kids fruit packaging pilot. 

Our plastic reduction efforts go beyond packaging. The 2021 festive season 
saw BIG W reduce the number of own brand Christmas products with glitter 
by 48%. This year, we’ll see this expand to a glitter-free Christmas across our 
own brand seasonal and apparel ranges available in BIG W, Woolworths 
Supermarkets and Countdown.

100% of own brand

Packaging is important for product integrity and 
there is a growing need for sustainable alternatives. 
By embracing circular thinking and the power

Partnering to reduce our impact

Given the Group’s scale, we recognise our role in driving 
more sustainable packaging solutions by collaborating 
across the value chain. Our Woolworths Group Packaging 
Preferred Materials List and Format Guidelines was updated 
this year to reflect our position to phase out oxo-degradable 
plastics in any product or packaging. This aims to support 
all suppliers with their packaging plans and drive reductions 
in problematic packaging. 

To drive our sustainable packaging ambitions further, 
this year we formed our Woolworths Supermarkets Supplier 
Sustainability Council - Packaging & Recycling, a forum to 
engage with our suppliers to support the achievement of 
our 2025 commitments.

Woolworths Group is also pursuing innovative packaging 
solutions to influence industry-wide change. We have 
partnered with Samsara, an Australian plastic recycling 
startup that uses enzyme technology to break down plastic 
so it can be recycled time and time again, reducing the 
need for new plastic and supporting circularity. We have 
committed to turn the first 5,000 tonnes of recycled 
Samsara plastic into packaging for our own brand products. 

We continue to offer our customers access to in-store 
recycling initiatives. In F22 REDcycle recycled 4,608 tonnes 
of plastic through Woolworths Supermarkets across 
Australia, a 58% growth on previous year. 

ARL update 

The Australasian Recycling Label (ARL) is displayed 
on 72% of products where packaging is within the 
control of Woolworths Group in Australia, making it 
easier for customers to recycle and contribute to the 
circular economy. This year, the ARL was added on our 
in-store bread bags, encouraging customers to return 
soft plastics for recycling via REDcycle collection. 
In F22, BIG W commenced applying the ARL to over 
400 products which are due to land in store in early 
F23. The ARL will continue to be expanded to existing 
and new products in F23.

Reduce
Reducing virgin plastic in our meat trays

3,681 tonnes of virgin plastic was reduced with the change 
to at least 60% recycled plastic across Woolworths 
Supermarkets’ 170 million red meat trays annually. Countdown 
removed 40 million (120 tonnes) single use meat soaker pads.

Delivering beyond our commitments

In June 2022, Woolworths Supermarkets and BIG W committed to stop selling 15-cent and online plastic bags 
by the end of June 2023, resulting in 9,450 tonnes of plastic removed from circulation annually. F22 also saw the 
implementation of two significant plastic bag initiatives:

• in May, our Western Australia stores phased out 15-cent and online plastic shopping bags, ahead of new 
state legislation

• we introduced home compostable fruit and vegetable bags across all 67 stores in South Australia, diverting up 
to 70 tonnes of plastic waste from landfill annually. This is supported by high household access to composting 
in South Australia through council-provided food organics and garden organics (FOGO) kerbside collection.

Recycle
Recycled content in our sauce bottles 

Partnering with Wellman Packaging, we launched 
Squeezepak™ squeezy sauce bottles for Woolworths 
tomato and BBQ sauces that are made from 100% 
recycled content, resulting in a reduction of 67 tonnes 
of virgin plastic annually and recognised as a winner 
of the Worldstar Global Packaging Awards.

Reuse
Reusing BIG W coat hangers 

BIG W reuses 80% of hangers, saving approximately 
1,175 tonnes of waste diverted from landfill annually. 
The hangers are made from recycled plastic and we 
aim to further increase future recovery rates.

Remove

We have removed single-use plastic picnicware from 
Woolworths Supermarkets, Countdown and BIG W, 
eliminating more than 2,900 tonnes of plastic annually.

This year, the cost and availability of high-impact commodities has been 
affected by a range of local and global factors. Floods have impacted the 
production of Australian crops such as sugar and soy, and palm oil accessibility 
has reduced due to the conflict in the Ukraine. We are working to improve 
our preparedness in this area in this volatile landscape, by working with 
our suppliers to assess alternative arrangements and updating ingredient 
specifications. We remain committed to supporting our supply chain to 
deliver improved social and environmental outcomes. We maintained 100% 
sustainably sourced single product own brand tea, coffee, cocoa and sugar, and 
aim to increase to 100% the use of certified and/or verified coffee, tea and cocoa 
as ingredients in our own brand products by 2025. We also focused on cotton, 
one of the most commonly used fibres across our own brand products and 
our top non-food risk of modern slavery. Moving forward, we will look beyond 
our first tier suppliers to incentivise best practice in areas such as sustainable 
soy in livestock feed, through the operationalisation of shared learnings as part 
of the global Retail Soy Group. 

Our approach to sustainable sourcing includes a combination of physically 
certified (or independently verified) commodities, and the purchase of 
offsets to support the sustainable production of a commodity if 100% physical 
certification cannot be achieved. Our sourcing policies should be referred 
to for commodity-specific details.

100% of own brand 
sourcing is sustainable 

Sourcing resource intensive raw materials impacts 
on the planet’s natural ecosystems. We are working 
to make it easier for customers to make sustainable 
choices by sourcing high-impact commodities 
through suppliers that have low risk of negative 
social and environmental impacts.

Soy

100% of soy in our own brand products supports 
the responsible production of soy. To achieve 
this, we have sourced certified Roundtable 
on Responsible Soy (RTRS) credits to offset 
non-certified volumes of direct soy in our own 
brand food supply chain. Credits purchased 
through RTRS support the growth of sustainable 
soy for future procurement. 

In F22, we also baselined indirect soy in our 
animal protein supply chain, which has allowed 
us to prioritise products and categories towards 
achieving our 2025 goal.

Paper, pulp and timber

We have maintained the 100% sustainable 
sourcing levels of own brand paper, pulp and 
timber products such as toilet paper, kitchen 
towels, and stationary meeting our net-zero 
deforestation commitment.

Cotton

We are committed to using cotton that has 
been produced sustainably and responsibly, 
and encouraging the use of recycled and reclaimed 
cotton wherever possible. The majority of cotton 
across Woolworths Group is used in BIG W’s own 
brand apparel.

Over the course of F22 we:

• developed and published our Sustainable 
Cotton Policy

• established a Group-wide working group 
to share learnings and create consistent 
governance approaches to managing this high 
impact commodity

• commenced, and subsequently expanded, 
BIG W’s cotton traceability pilot to achieve visibility 
of our supply chain beyond our direct suppliers

• engaged with suppliers of vendor branded apparel 
to listen and share opportunities and challenges in 
this area

• enhanced the organic cotton content in BIG W 
own brand apparel range. 

Our full program of work is reported in the 2022 Modern 
Slavery Statement. 

Palm Oil

Food: 100% of palm (kernel) oil in Woolworths own 
brand food products supports the production of 
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified 
sustainable palm (kernel) oil. 

Non-Food: This year we built action plans and sought 
tenders to increase our supply of sustainable palm oil 
from 14% to 85% of volume by the end of F23 .

This year, the cost and availability of high-impact commodities has been 
affected by a range of local and global factors. Floods have impacted the 
production of Australian crops such as sugar and soy, and palm oil accessibility 
has reduced due to the conflict in the Ukraine. We are working to improve 
our preparedness in this area in this volatile landscape, by working with 
our suppliers to assess alternative arrangements and updating ingredient 
specifications. We remain committed to supporting our supply chain to 
deliver improved social and environmental outcomes. We maintained 100% 
sustainably sourced single product own brand tea, coffee, cocoa and sugar, and 
aim to increase to 100% the use of certified and/or verified coffee, tea and cocoa 
as ingredients in our own brand products by 2025. We also focused on cotton, 
one of the most commonly used fibres across our own brand products and 
our top non-food risk of modern slavery. Moving forward, we will look beyond 
our first tier suppliers to incentivise best practice in areas such as sustainable 
soy in livestock feed, through the operationalisation of shared learnings as part 
of the global Retail Soy Group. 

Our approach to sustainable sourcing includes a combination of physically 
certified (or independently verified) commodities, and the purchase of 
offsets to support the sustainable production of a commodity if 100% physical 
certification cannot be achieved. Our sourcing policies should be referred 
to for commodity-specific details.

100% of own brand 
sourcing is sustainable 

Sourcing resource intensive raw materials impacts 
on the planet’s natural ecosystems. We are working 
to make it easier for customers to make sustainable 
choices by sourcing high-impact commodities 
through suppliers that have low risk of negative 
social and environmental impacts.

One of the three pillars of our new nurturing nature strategy (outlined on 
page 42) is leading the future of protein – providing affordable and sustainable 
proteins across traditional, plant and alternative sources, at the same time 
meeting the highest standards of animal welfare. By 2025, we will:

• Source our animal, plant and alternative protein in a sustainable manner 
through minimising our impact on the environment

• Grow our share of protein products in our customers’ baskets that are both 
healthier and better for the environment

Our strategic approach across Woolworths Group will focus on:

• Understanding emissions in relation to protein – collaborating to 
reduce our scope 3 emissions and identifying opportunities for increased 
farming efficiencies

• Delivering the highest standards of animal welfare and sustainable 
seafood – using the Five Domains of Animal Welfare (see page 55) to 
define our requirements whilst improving our approach to antimicrobial 
stewardship and sourcing ecologically responsible seafood

• Enabling customer choice of sustainable and healthier proteins at 
affordable prices – continue to develop our understanding of nutritional 
and environmental benefits of plant and alternative proteins.

Our approach to animal welfare 

Animal welfare is important to us, our partners, and our customers who trust us to do the right thing. We also know 
that good animal welfare results in high quality products. Woolworths Group continues to work with our farmers 
and partners to promote good animal welfare. This year we launched our first two Woolworths own brand RSPCA 
Approved salmon products; and our High Gate pet food brand sources RSPCA Approved chicken ingredient for its 
range of pet supplement food.

We are committed to achieving Tier 1 in the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare (BBFAW) by 2025. 
The 2021 BBFAW’s methodology and scoring changes saw 36 companies, including Woolworths Group, drop a tier, 
seeing us move from Tier 2 to Tier 3. We are dedicated to collaborating with our suppliers to improve our score and 
continue our progress to influence animal welfare best practice within our supply chain.

Supporting sustainable 
seafood and animal welfare 
improvements

We have launched the second round of funding 
for our Woolworths Ocean Pool and Woolworths 
Animal Horizons Funds. The purpose of these funds 
is to support the environmental performance of the 
Australian seafood industry and improvements in the 
lives of animals within our supply chain.

We have supported seafood projects which focus 
on increasing our sustainable seafood standards, 
product shelf life extension, fish welfare, and reducing 
the impacts on our marine environment. Our grants 
in the animal welfare space have assisted a range of 
initiatives, such as enhancing welfare for pigs and 
improving on-farm welfare solutions in beef cattle.

Responsibly sourced seafood 

This year, we launched our new Woolworths Group 
Seafood Sourcing Policy which helps define our 
human rights, animal welfare and sustainable seafood 
sourcing requirements. In the last year, we completed 
our transition of all Woolworths own brand behind the 
counter, fresh packaged, frozen and canned seafood to 
come from ecologically responsible sources as defined in 
our Seafood Sourcing Policy. As part of our Sustainability 
Plan 2025 we’ll continue on this journey to transition 
seafood as an ingredient to be ecologically responsible 
by 2025.

In response to concerns among some Tasmanian 
community and environmental groups, we have 
conducted our own due diligence and review 
on regulatory standards and practices in the 
salmon industry. We have met with and encouraged 
our suppliers to increase transparency and disclosure 
on sustainability related issues. We are also participating 
in the Tasmanian Government’s consultations on the 
10-Year Salmon Plan, and support its aims. We will 
continue to work with government, industry and 
community stakeholders constructively to help 
implement actions that underpin a sustainable 
salmon industry.

We were awarded the Marine Stewardship Council’s 
Sustainable Seafood Community Champion in 
the Sustainable Seafood Awards Australia 2022, 
recognising our efforts to support certified 
sustainable seafood and our work in communicating 
our progress to our customers.

Sustainable dairy 

Alltech-E-CO2, Woolworths Group, and Farmers’ Own are collaborating 
to deliver high animal welfare, sustainable, and low-carbon farming. 
In 2022, we commissioned Alltech-E-CO2 to conduct assessments 
across our 19 Farmers’ Own dairy farms. The study will calculate 
the physical and environmental efficiency of the group, including 
carbon footprinting, and provide bespoke recommendations to 
individual farms. The information collected will inform our strategy 
implementation to deliver our goals by 2025.

Plant and novel protein 

Plant and alternative proteins are becoming increasingly important 
to our customers, increasing demand for sustainably produced proteins 
across our portfolio. In addition to expanding our alternative protein 
offering, W23 has invested in alternative protein innovations over the 
last 12 months, including All G Foods and Harvest B. Both companies 
are focusing on using leading technologies in plant-based protein 
development and precision fermentation to deliver innovative, 
affordable, and sustainable locally produced proteins.

Sustainable beef 

Red meat is the most 
important grocery category 
for our customers regarding 
sustainability. We partner with 
Greenstock, our stand-alone 
business focused on the red 
meat supply chain, to improve 
animal welfare and reduce our 
impact on the environment. 
All our cattle, lambs and pigs 
are sourced by Greenstock, 
experts in livestock production 
and trained in animal welfare. 
We recently joined the Global 
Roundtable for Sustainable 
Beef to gain insights from 
leaders globally as we continue 
to work toward areas such as 
zero deforestation in our beef 
supply chain by 2025. We want 
to lead and we are involved 
in a range of initiatives to cut 
emissions in beef production, 
including cattle feedlot trials 
using seaweed which has 
the potential to drastically 
cut methane emissions. 
We are currently working 
on a voluntary trial with some 
beef suppliers, offering them 
access to THESIS software 
(see page 37) to understand 
opportunities to develop 
consistent baselines and 
tracking for livestock supply 
chain emissions.

Lead the responsible 
retailing and consumption 
of alcohol and tobacco

In 2021, Woolworths Group and Endeavour Group demerged, with our 
relationship moving from ownership to partnership, diluting our association 
with gambling. Woolworths Group will continue to sell alcohol in our 
New Zealand operations through Countdown and in Australia through 
our partnership with BWS and Dan Murphy’s.

Responsible retailing of alcohol 

We aim to be an industry leader in the 
responsible retailing of alcohol products. 
We have a range of policies complying 
with legislative requirements, 
including verifying age in-store 
and online. We are also committed 
to providing clear information to 
customers through on-pack labels, 
detailing calorie content, portion 
guidelines, and health warnings.

To encourage responsible drinking, 
we stock low and zero alcohol 
beverages, which are seeing strong 
market growth in Australia and New 
Zealand. Countdown aims to be a 
market leader in this space, providing 
customers 91 zero alcohol options, 
a 10% year-on-year increase, and 
promoting zero alcohol options more 
prominently in store. 

Training our team

In F22, we rolled out Responsible 
Service of Alcohol training to 4,238 
of our Countdown team who perform 
roles where they are required to 
approve alcohol sales. 

Responsible retailing  
of tobacco
Woolworths Group supports initiatives 
aimed at reducing the take-up rate 
of smoking and the sale of tobacco 
products is strictly regulated across 
all retail outlets. We recognise we have 
an important role to play and from F23 
will expand our responsible retailing 
goal to include tobacco.

We are tracking our historical tobacco 
volume and consumer purchase 
behaviour and have seen a decline of 
33% based on units sold since F19.

We have worked with governments 
across Australia and New Zealand 
to implement tobacco control 
and preventative health policies. 
This includes displaying restrictions 
across our stores with the aim of 
decreasing impulse purchases, 
take-up by young smokers and to raise 
awareness of quit smoking programs. 

We recognise some products we sell can be 
unhealthy if misused or consumed often. 
We take the responsibility of selling these seriously, 
and remain focused on leading in the highest 
standards of retailing for alcohol and tobacco.

Creating a better 
tomorrow, today

There are many environmental and social challenges we face 
in our purpose to create a better tomorrow for our customers, 

team, communities and planet. That is why we are embracing new 
technologies, new innovations and new ways of thinking to help 
us achieve it. We know we can, and have more to do, to drive the 

transformative change needed to have a positive impact.

Over the next year, we are working to shape our impact in key areas, 
including climate change, sustainable packaging, reducing food waste, 

inclusion and making healthier easier for our customers.

We will continue to collaborate with our partners, communities, value 
chain and industry to influence the positive impact we aspire to have. 
When we work together, we can learn from – and inspire – each other 

to find the best solutions to overcome the challenges we face.

We call it the power of ‘We’

Thank you for joining us as we create 
better experiences together for 

a better tomorrow.

and online. We are also committed 
to providing clear information to 
customers through on-pack labels, 
detailing calorie content, portion 
guidelines, and health warnings.

To encourage responsible drinking, 
we stock low and zero alcohol 
beverages, which are seeing strong 
market growth in Australia and New 
Zealand. Countdown aims to be a 
market leader in this space, providing 
customers 91 zero alcohol options, 
a 10% year-on-year increase, and 
promoting zero alcohol options more 
prominently in store. 

Training our team

In F22, we rolled out Responsible 
Service of Alcohol training to 4,238 
of our Countdown team who perform 
roles where they are required to 
approve alcohol sales. 

Responsible retailing  
of tobacco
Woolworths Group supports initiatives 
aimed at reducing the take-up rate 
of smoking and the sale of tobacco 
products is strictly regulated across 
all retail outlets. We recognise we have 
an important role to play and from F23 
will expand our responsible retailing 
goal to include tobacco.

We are tracking our historical tobacco 
volume and consumer purchase 
behaviour and have seen a decline of 
33% based on units sold since F19.

We have worked with governments 
across Australia and New Zealand 
to implement tobacco control 
and preventative health policies. 
This includes displaying restrictions 
across our stores with the aim of 
decreasing impulse purchases, 
take-up by young smokers and to raise 
awareness of quit smoking programs. 

We recognise some products we sell can be 
unhealthy if misused or consumed often. 
We take the responsibility of selling these seriously, 
and remain focused on leading in the highest 
standards of retailing for alcohol and tobacco.

Creating a better 
tomorrow, today

There are many environmental and social challenges we face 
in our purpose to create a better tomorrow for our customers, 

team, communities and planet. That is why we are embracing new 
technologies, new innovations and new ways of thinking to help 
us achieve it. We know we can, and have more to do, to drive the 

transformative change needed to have a positive impact.

Over the next year, we are working to shape our impact in key areas, 
including climate change, sustainable packaging, reducing food waste, 

inclusion and making healthier easier for our customers.

We will continue to collaborate with our partners, communities, value 
chain and industry to influence the positive impact we aspire to have. 
When we work together, we can learn from – and inspire – each other 

to find the best solutions to overcome the challenges we face.

We call it the power of ‘We’

Thank you for joining us as we create 
better experiences together for 

a better tomorrow.

Basis of reporting 
Unless otherwise stated, our reporting suite covers Woolworths Group wholly owned 
businesses in Australia and New Zealand for the 2022 financial year  
– 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 (F22). 

Certain comparative amounts and baselines have been restated to conform 
with the current period’s presentation. This includes but is not limited to: 

• in 2022, the Board approved the establishment of a new operating segment, 
Australian B2B. The Group has restated the amounts presented in the prior period 
to reflect the newly reportable segment as a separate segment 

• in 2021, the Group separated from Endeavour Group, as a result the Endeavour Group 
historical results were removed from these reports

• majority owned businesses of PFD and Quantium have been included for emissions 
reporting and excluded from other metrics.

Sustainability metrics are expected to be refined over time as definitions, 
methodologies and data are enhanced.

Only workforce data (excluding safety) is included for our global sourcing offices 
in China, Bangladesh and Thailand.

All amounts are expressed in Australian dollars unless another currency is indicated.

Our 2022 Sustainability Report, Sustainability Report Appendix and Modern Slavery 
Statements contain forward looking statements, including, but not limited to statements 
regarding: trends in consumer preferences; commodity prices; goals, targets, plans, 
strategies and objectives of Woolworths Group; assumed near and long-term scenarios 
and transition pathways; potential global responses to climate change; regulatory and 
policy developments; the development and uptake of certain technologies; and the 
potential effect of possible future events on the value of Woolworths Group.

Forward looking statements can generally be identified by words such as, ‘intend’, ‘aim’, 
‘project’, ‘anticipate’, ‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘plan’, ‘objective’, ‘believe’, ‘expect’, ‘commit’, ‘may’, 
‘will’, ‘should’, ‘would’, ‘continue’, ‘forecast’, ‘guidance’, ‘trend’, or similar expressions. 

The forward looking statements in this report are based on management’s good faith, 
current expectations and reflect judgements, assumptions and estimates and other 
information available as at the date of this report. The forward looking statements 
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other important 
factors, many of which are beyond the reasonable control of Woolworths Group, that 
could cause actual results, performances or achievements to be materially different 
from the relevant statements. 

Woolworths Group cannot and does not give any assurances that the results, 
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
contained in these reports will actually occur and readers are cautioned not to place 
undue reliance on these forward looking statements. Except as required by applicable 
regulations or by law, Woolworths Group does not undertake any obligation to publicly 
update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information 
or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance. 

Acknowledgment of Country
Woolworths Group acknowledges the Traditional Custodians 
of Country throughout Australia and recognises their continuing 
connection to land, waters and community. We pay our respects 
to them and their cultures; and to Elders both past and present.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that 
this report may contain the names and images of deceased persons.

1 Calculated scope 1 emissions have increased in F22 vs F21 due to incorporation of F22 transport refrigerants (with equivalent data not 
available in F21) coupled with use of revised IPCC, Climate Change 2021: Sixth Assessment Report AR6 refrigerant emissions factors 
in F22. This has collectively increased calculated emissions by 64 ktCO2e for F22 vs F21, and contributed to total calculated scope 1 
and 2 emissions being approximately flat vs F21. For context, if instead calculated on a like-for-like basis (using a common refrigerant 
emissions factor and excluding transport refrigerants), F22 scope 1 and 2 emissions would have declined by 3% vs F21.

1 To align with RE100 and CDP reporting requirements electricity is only considered as being renewable when either (1) renewable energy 
certificates are surrendered, or (2) when delivered renewable supply from the grid is supported by renewable certificates, such as the 
Renewable Energy Target (RET) in Australia, or (3) when the default renewable electricity supply from the grid exceeds 95%. In Australia, 
reported renewables for F22 is predominately as a result of grid supply delivered from the RET. In New Zealand, despite high levels of 
default renewable electricity supply, it does not meet these reporting criteria and the vast majority of NZ electricity supply is reported as 
non-renewable.

definitions from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, with descriptions 
tailored to reflect Woolworths Group’s specific value chain. In order to align with the latest available (F21) emissions factors based 
on Australian economic input / output tables, the calculation methodology for category 1 uses F21 consumer purchase prices for the 
products and services we sold in F22. Category 1 includes a moderate degree of overlap with Woolworths Group scope 1 emissions 
as food retail emissions are included within scope 3 emission factors. Purchased items by Woolworths Group and not for resale 
to consumers are excluded from category 1 calculated value, these are expected to be small but meaningful proportion of overall 
category 1 scope 3 emissions, and will be investigated further in future years.

bakery products, in addition to in-store packaging such as produce bags. Where historical packaging data is not available, we have 
estimated packaging specifications based on similar products in the category. A packaging data enhancement project is currently 
underway and will allow our packaging measures and baseline to be further refined. While not included in our packaging figures, 
the removal of single use plastic bags resulted in the elimination of over 13,000 tonnes of plastic (over 9,000 tonnes of virgin plastic) 
from F18 to F19. Cumulative reduction calculated based on equivalent percentage of baseline year virgin plastic packaging with 
a target of 50% by 2024.

Where HSR data is not provided, we estimate HSR based on available nutrition information and similar products in the category. 
As HSR data improves, our HSR measure and baseline will be refined. Calculations are based on sales, with the intention of moving 
to a volume-based metric in future years.

Glossary

TERM MEANING

Carbon dioxide 
equivalent (CO2e)

A standard measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based 
on their global warming potential. For example, one tonne of methane emissions is equivalent 
to 28 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over a 100 year period.

Green electricity To align with RE100 and CDP reporting requirements our renewable electricity is only counted 
as green electricity when renewable energy certificates are surrendered, or when the default 
renewable electricity supply from the grid exceeds 95%. 

Health Star Rating The Health Star Rating is a voluntary front-of-pack labelling system in Australia and New 
Zealand that rates the overall nutritional profile of food and beverages from 0.5 star to 5 stars. 
It provides a quick and easy way for consumers to compare similar foods and make informed 
choices. The more stars, the healthier the choice.

Lost Time Injury (LTI) 
and Lost Time Injury 
Frequency Rate (LTIFR)

A Lost Time Injury (LTI) is an injury or illness that results in an employee being unable to work 
a full scheduled shift (other than the shift during which the injury occurred). LTIFR refers to Lost 
Time Injury Frequency Rate, the number of lost time injuries occurring in a workplace per one 
million hours worked.

MWh Megawatt hours is a unit of measurement for electricity use.

National Greenhouse 
and Energy Reporting 
Act 2007 (NGER)

NGER established a national framework for Australian corporations to report greenhouse 
gas emissions, reductions, removals and offsets, and energy consumption and production. 
Refer to climatechange.gov.au/reporting/publications.

Scope 1 emissions Direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company, such as 
combustion facilities (e.g. generators), calculated emissions from refrigerant gas leakages and 
combustion of fuels in company-owned or company-controlled transport (e.g. cars and trucks).

Scope 2 emissions Indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, heat, cooling 
or steam. Purchased electricity is defined as electricity that is bought or otherwise brought 
into the organisational boundary of the entity.

Scope 3 emissions Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions that are a consequence of a company’s activities, 
but that arise from sources that other entities own or control. Scope 3, like scope 2, is a category 
of indirect emissions and covers all other indirect emissions from sources that are not owned or 
controlled by a company, but that occur as a result of its activities. Examples include emissions 
generated in the production of the products we sell and from waste disposal to landfill.

Severity Rate Includes all team and customer injuries or illnesses (first aid through to lost time injuries, 
both physical and psychological) and events with potential for high severity.

Sustainable 
Development Goals 
(SDG)

17 global goals set by the United Nations in 2015 to define global sustainable development 
priorities and aspirations for the planet.

Sustainable Sourcing Includes a combination of physically certified (or independently verified) commodities; 
and the purchase of offsets to support the sustainable production of a commodity if 
physical certification cannot be achieved. Our sourcing policies should be referred to for 
commodity-specific details.

Total Recordable 
Injury (TRI) and Total 
Recordable Injury 
Frequency Rate (TRIFR)

A Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is the sum of the total number of employee 
fatalities, lost time injuries, restricted work injuries or medical treatment injuries per million 
hours worked.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSION 
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Australian Standard on Assurance 
Engagements ASAE 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information (“ASAE 3000”), issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. 

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. 

WOOLWORTHS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The management of Woolworths are responsible for:

• ensuring that the Subject Matter Information is prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;

• confirming the measurement or evaluation of the underlying subject matter against the applicable criteria, 
including that all relevant matters are reflected in the Subject Matter Information;

• designing, establishing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over its operations including, 
without limitation, systems designed to ensure achievement of its control objectives and its compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations;

• selecting and applying measurement methodologies in accordance with the Report Criteria, and making 
estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; and

• for referring to or describing in its Subject Matter Information the applicable criteria it has used and, when 
it is not readily apparent from the engagement circumstances, who developed them.

OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
We have complied with the independence and other relevant ethical requirements relating to assurance 
engagements, and applied Auditing Standard ASQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews 
of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, Other Assurance Engagements and Related Services 
Engagements in undertaking this assurance engagement.

ASSURANCE PRACTITIONER’S RESPONSIBILITIES
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Subject Matter Information as evaluated 
against the Reporting Criteria based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. 
ASAE 3000 requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain limited assurance about whether, 
anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter Information is not properly 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Reporting Criteria. 

A limited assurance engagement in accordance with ASAE 3000 involves identifying areas where a material 
misstatement of the Subject Matter Information is likely to arise, addressing the areas identified and considering 
the process used to prepare the Subject Matter Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially 
less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, 
including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in 
extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited 
assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable 
assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about 
whether the Subject Matter Information has been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with 
the Reporting Criteria.

Assurance report

Our procedures included: 

• Review of Woolworths’ processes relating to stakeholder identification, engagement and responsiveness, 
including an assessment of stakeholder engagement outcomes and how this process and the outcomes 
have been presented in the 2022 Sustainability Report;

• Review of Woolworths’ process to identify and determine material issues to be included in the 2022 
Sustainability Report with examination of underlying assessments and evidence on a sample basis;

• Inquiry with a selection of Woolworths executives and senior management, including Woolworths’ 
sustainability management team concerning the overall governance structure, corporate sustainability 
strategy and policies used for managing and reporting sustainability performance across the business; and

• In respect of the Subject Matter Information; 

 – inquiry with a selection of Woolworths management responsible for selected FY22 GRI Universal Standards, 
GRI Topic Standards, and Sustainability Targets to understand the compilation and review processes;

 – applying analytical and other review procedures including assessing relationships between the reported 
information and other financial and non-financial data;

 – examination of evidence for a small number of transactions or events;

 – analysing and inspecting on a sample basis, the key systems, processes and procedures and controls 
relating to the collation, validation, presentation and approval process of the information included in the 
2022 Sustainability Report; and

 – review underlying evidence on a sample basis to corroborate that the information is prepared and reported 
in line with the relevant reporting criteria.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS
Because of the inherent limitations of an assurance engagement, together with the inherent limitations of any 
system of internal control there is an unavoidable risk that it is possible that fraud, error, or non-compliance with 
laws and regulations, where there has been concealment through collusion, forgery and other illegal acts may 
occur and not be detected, even though the engagement is properly planned and performed in accordance with 
Standards on Assurance Engagements. 

Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given both its 
nature and the methods used for determining, calculating and sampling or estimating such data.

RESTRICTED USE
This report has been prepared for use by the management of Woolworths for the purpose of assisting directors and 
management in their reporting of the Subject Matter Information. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for 
any reliance on this report to any person other than the management of Woolworths or for any purpose other than 
that for which it was prepared.

GOVERNANCE, THE BOARD AND DIRECTORS
Corporate governance is at the core of Woolworths Group and the Board’s approach to the enhancement of shareholder 
value and the protection of shareholder funds. Integral to shareholder value is protecting and enhancing our reputation, 
which is why the Board oversees the Group’s approach to corporate responsibility and sustainability. 

The Woolworths Group Board is responsible for reviewing, appraising and approving our Sustainability Plan 2025, 
its targets and material investments to manage actual or potential impacts to the Group. The Board does so on 
recommendation from its Sustainability Committee (SusCo). SusCo reviews and monitors performance against our 
strategy and targets. The CEO and Executive Committee, including the Chief Sustainability Officer, have accountability 
for the implementation of our strategy, and report progress to SusCo quarterly. SusCo also reviews performance on issues 
of safety and health, sustainability and community investment. The Group sustainability chapter orchestrates the work 
across the Group and supports the business ownership of change delivery required to achieve agreed goals. 

Information on our Board of Directors and the Board Charter is at: https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/about-us/

Information on our Sustainability Committee and its charter is at: https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/about-us/

More information is in our corporate governance statement: https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/about-us/our-
approach/corporate-governance/

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK 
The continued growth and success of Woolworths Group depends on the ability of our company to understand and 
respond to the challenges of an uncertain and changing world. As a large, dispersed and complex organisation, this 
uncertainty generates risk, with the potential to be a source of both opportunities and threats. By understanding and 
managing risk, the Group provides greater certainty and confidence for all its stakeholders. More information about our 
approach to risk management is in our risk management policy.  
See: http://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/icms_docs/184824_Risk_Management_Policy.pdf 

SENIOR MANAGEMENT 
The Woolworths Group Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, provides management oversight 
of the effectiveness of the Group’s implementation of the safety and health vision, principles, policy, standards, strategy 
and initiatives, risk processes, resources, information, compliance and assurance.

DOING THE RIGHT THING 
All of our team members commit to Woolworths Group Code of Conduct to maintain the highest legal, moral and ethical 
standards in our dealings with customers, suppliers, team members and local communities. This code outlines how 
employees can meet the highest standards through their everyday behaviours and choices. 

We are committed to continuous improvement, transparency and accountability. We don’t tolerate workplace 
misconduct under any circumstances and we need our trade partners to work with us to stamp out any and every 
instance. We have clear, long-standing and accepted procedures for trade partners to report any issues. However, 
we recognise there is always opportunity to strengthen our systems. Our Speak Up service is available for trade partners 
to use when normal escalation methods have been exhausted or are inappropriate.

POLITICAL DONATIONS 
Woolworths Group participates in policy development and advocacy in a manner that is open, transparent, and 
compliant with all relevant laws. We do so in a non-partisan manner. Woolworths Group does not make political 
donations except through attendance at events, functions and forums organised by parliamentarians and political 
parties. This is overseen by the Chief Executive Officer and the Head of Government Relations and Industry Affairs 
in accordance with the Woolworths Group Political Donations Policy and applicable electoral laws.

TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING 
Woolworths Group uses the globally recognised reporting framework developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). 
The GRI reporting framework sets out the principles and indicators that organisations can use to measure and report 
their economic, environmental, and social performance. The 2022 Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance 
with the GRI Universal Standards. More information can be found in the GRI Index starting on page 16 of the 2022 
Sustainability Report Appendix. 

We continue to report to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), an investor-driven disclosure initiative enabling companies 
to report on risk identification and mitigation processes related to climate change. 

We are a signatory to the United National Global Compact (UNGC). The 2022 Sustainability Report Appendix page 15 
details our approach to the UNGC core values.

INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIPS
Principles for engagement
• Industry associations are an important component of Woolworths Group’s overall public policy advocacy effort. 

Our broad set of memberships – from core economy-wide memberships such as the Business Council of Australia 
and Ai Group (see below) to sector specific memberships such as the Green Building Council of Australia, the 
Australian Logistics Council and the Australian Retailers Association – reflect the breadth of policy issues relevant 
to the Group

• Our overriding ambition is that memberships help promote sustainable growth and productivity enhancing 
economic reforms that deliver broad societal benefit

• We seek broad alignment with the policy positions of our industry associations, but recognise that may not always 
be possible. Membership does not preclude Woolworths Group from holding different policy positions, especially 
where this better reflects expectations of our customers, shareholders, team and the community

• We seek to participate as a constructive partner on the priority policy making forums of each industry association, 
including through the relevant committee and working group structures. Support can extend to technical advice 
and to public campaigns designed to better inform public debate

• Each membership has an internal relationship owner, the responsibility of which includes ensuring any major policy 
misalignments are identified and referred to our Group Government Relations and Industry Affairs team for review. 
Where any divergence persists, and is of a material misalignment with our own view, Woolworths Group will review 
our membership, evaluating that misalignment with the wider benefits of membership of that industry association

• On an annual basis (at the time of membership renewal) Woolworths Group reviews its key industry association 
memberships to ensure alignment with our key areas of policy interest. This includes a focus on advocacy activities 
related to climate change and our Woolworths Group Sustainability Plan 2025 goals and commitments.
