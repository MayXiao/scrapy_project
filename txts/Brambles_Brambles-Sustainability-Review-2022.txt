Sustainability Review 20225 Business PositiveIntroduction Planet Positive Communities Positive

I am pleased to share Brambles’ 15th Sustainability Review. 
The contrast in global context from our initial sustainability 
communication in 2007 to the present day could not be 
more apparent. 

Regeneration
Each year, our vision to pioneer regenerative supply chains 
becomes more prescient. The path to regeneration requires 
integrated thinking, resilience, ambition and demonstration 
of positive value creation. These themes are evident in our 
progress over the last year and the stories we share in this 
review illustrate the reinforcing nature of sustainability and 
business value creation.

The social contract with communities and broader society has 
taken on new meaning in the current uncertain environment. 
It has tested - and strengthened - our belief that businesses 
can provide leadership and model standards to address the 
degenerative pathways that reduce value and create negative 
impact. In this way, a regenerative ambition seeks a positive but 
practical direction.

We have seen sustainability leaders worldwide, including some 
of Brambles’ key customers, adopt regenerative strategies, 
validating our vision, strategy and direction of travel. This trend 
is aligned with increasing awareness of the need for more 
sustainable, climate-conscious, ethical supply chains. It also 
offers insight as to why Brambles’ leadership on sustainability 
truly sets us apart. This year, we invite our readers to Step 
into the Positive with us and define their part in creating a 
regenerative future.

Integration and resilience
It is apparent that the pace of change is accelerating and global 
challenges have amplified. However, I remain encouraged by the 
collective commitment of our people to integrate sustainability 
further into our business.    

The supply chain disruptions of COVID-19-related labour 
shortages and existing inflationary pressures have deepened 
from the conflict in Ukraine, testing our systems and processes 
in acquiring certified sustainable materials. 

However, Brambles’ FY22 performance emphasises the value 
of integrating sustainability controls into core decision-making 
processes. A clear example emerges through the current 
materials sourcing environment, where shortages were 
mitigated by our close relationship with our supplier base, 
developed through years of collaboration on our certification 
programme. Moreover, higher costs have been balanced by value 
chain efficiencies implemented through the Shaping Our Future 
transformation programme.

Agility in our materials sourcing actions, acceleration of our 
asset efficiency programme and our approach to developing 
our people and systems for digital supply chains further 
demonstrate the reciprocity of sustainability and business 
value creation.

We have also seen our workforce embracing the digital future 
and uncovering new value for Brambles and our customers. In 
this review, we show how our platform innovations and digital 
capabilities combine to enhance circularity while designing 
solutions for tomorrow’s supply chain challenges. 

Responding to the physical impacts of climate change is an 
increasingly critical element of our business, with various 
weather events in FY22 testing our operational processes. 
Brambles’ network advantage and agile asset relocation actions 
ensured our people were safe, our operations continued and our 
customer contingency measures were robust.   

We have increasingly seen capital markets reorient their 
investment mandates to integrate environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) elements in response to regulatory change, 
societal expectations and the financial opportunities sustainable 
business models offer. Brambles’ leading position across the 
most credible ESG ranking platforms demonstrates our ability to 
deliver financial returns from a sustainable business model

Ambition on climate
The release of our new ambitious Climate Positive agenda 
in June set a benchmark in climate leadership because 
it builds upon the environmental advantages of our core 
circular model. Our pragmatic approach to decarbonisation 
exemplifies Brambles’ Step into the Positive campaign by 
reaching beyond our business boundaries to accelerate action 
through practical initiatives, supply chain collaborations and 
industry partnerships. 

Introduction from the CEO

The importance of sustainability for our customers has 
reached new levels, seen in the pronounced shift in consumer 
preferences for low or zero-waste and carbon consumption 
models. Brambles effectively support customers by managing 
supply chain risks, highlighting the low-carbon, no-waste 
advantages of a circular model, and offering innovative, 
value-creating partnerships that deliver against customers’ 
sustainability goals. 

Our people 
Our people have delivered outstanding results for Brambles’ 
business and, by extension, the world’s supply chains. Most 
importantly, despite the volatility this year, our teams are more 
engaged than ever. Brambles’ service centre employees are the 
firmly established ‘stewards of circularity’, keeping our assets 
in circulation for as long as possible and delivering enhanced 
levels of safety in the workplace. 

Our people want to make positive change through their 
work for the world, which fuels their enthusiasm to strive for 
better results. This is why Brambles thrives in the emerging 
regenerative paradigm. We trust our circular model and 
regenerative approach can be a template for other organisations 
to Step into the Positive and walk this path together.

Chief Executive Officer

ESG Recognition
Environment, Social and Governance

Brambles’ circular business, resilient operations, 
climate ambition and 2025 targets set a benchmark 
that is reflected in its leading positions in credible 
ESG rankings.
Investors recognise the importance of driving progress towards a more circular 
economy as a path that addresses decarbonisation and climate risks, increases 
resilience and protects their long‑term financial interests. This is why Brambles’ 
value proposition resonates with capital providers seeking financial returns while 
growing their sustainable investment portfolio.

Brambles’ ESG engagement strategy continued throughout the year, which saw 
an increase in face-to-face engagements and ESG-themed events. Investors 
raised issues, including climate change reporting and disclosure, product 
materials, modern slavery, workforce diversity and inclusion, and the emerging 
themes of nature and biodiversity. 

Feedback continues to be positive, and the market welcomed the release 
of Brambles’ Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-validated targets and 
ambitious net-zero by 2040 target. 

Brambles received several new ESG recognitions, including being an inaugural 
member of the Terra Carta in November 2021 and receiving ‘Best ESG Reporting 
Award’ from the Australasian Investor Relation Awards in May 2022.  

During investor engagements, we emphasise Brambles’ low-carbon, circular 
business model and our leading results in independent and credible ESG indexes. 
A sample of these results are provided on the right. 

Brambles uses the investor engagements to educate investors about the circular 
economy and its connection to addressing climate change and emerging 
concerns around nature and biodiversity. We hope this advocacy will result 
in a better understanding of and investment in circular businesses and help 
build a more resilient, nature‑positive financial system.

Brambles generates financial returns 
from its circular business model and 
sustainability programme.

Brambles’ 2025 Sustainability Targets
Linear consumption and production 
patterns are central to the triple 
planetary crisis of climate change, 
biodiversity loss and pollution.  

SDG 12 aims to ensure sustainable 
production and consumption systems 
by 2030. Broader adoption of circular 
models creates value by accelerating 
decarbonisation, preserving nature, and 
designing out waste. 

Brambles’ Business Positive commitments provide 
a template for the practical application of circular 
principles. They also drive collaboration throughout 
the value chain and a safer workplace that thrives on 
diversity, equality and inclusion.



Sustainability Review 202210 Business PositiveIntroduction Planet Positive Communities Positive

Brambles’ Supply Chain Positive commitments aim to replace 
linear supply chains by growing its circular model. Communicating 
the benefits of circular models by leveraging measurement tools,

1 Design out waste and pollution 
80% of a product’s environmental 
impact can be determined during 
the design stage. By viewing 
waste as a design flaw, it can 
be avoided in the first place. 

Designed to be shared and reused, 
our pallets, crates and containers 
exemplify circularity, eliminate 
waste and help customers initiate 
their own circular journeys. See 
page 14 for more information.

2 Keep products and 
materials in use 
Build an economy that keeps 
things in use, rather than simply 
using them up.

Brambles' products are durable 
and kept at their highest value 
through recovery, repair and 
reuse, retaining their worth over 
their entire life cycle. 

3 Regenerate our natural systems
Not only protect, but actively 
improve the environment, 
ultimately creating 
regenerative systems.

Made from nature: based on 
renewable, reusable, recyclable 
or biodegradable materials, 
Brambles' platforms form the 
basis of a circular system of 
exchange with nature. 

These five circular operational models¹ are central to Brambles’ business. Adopting 
any one will accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, circular economy. 
• Circular material supply using, renewable or recovered materials 
• Resource recovery developing digital technology to recover and increase reuse
• Product life extension extending the life cycle of assets through design for repair and durability 
• Sharing platforms sharing assets, through the network to amplify their benefits  
• Product to service leasing products and gaining the benefit, instead of ownership/disposal

Sustainability Review 202211 Business PositiveIntroduction Planet Positive Communities Positive

Step into the Positive campaign invites  
customers to join the Regenerative journey
The CHEP businesses launched a customer-focused 
sustainability campaign to advance our vision to pioneer 
regenerative supply chains by inviting them to join CHEP 
and ‘Step into the Positive’. The purpose is to share 
our sustainability experience and encourage a greater 
understanding of how regenerative strategies, like creating 
value from waste or restoring natural resources, will lead to net 
positive outcomes. 

Stage one of the campaign has focused on CHEP employees 
to build an understanding of the concepts and messaging. 
Stage two, planned for September 2022, will concentrate 
externally and leverage CHEP’s sustainability brand and 
leadership position. As the campaign progresses, it will 
build partnerships and engage customers to uncover new 
opportunities to reduce the impact from their business.

Recognition from major Australian 
retailer, Coles  
CHEP Australia was recognised as a finalist in the 
‘Sustainability Partner of the Year’ category for the 2022 
Coles Group Supplier Partner Awards for supplier excellence. 
This showcases CHEPs partnership with Coles and 
demonstrates how CHEP sustainable platforms are helping 
Coles’ontheir Together to Zero & Better Together strategy. 

Walmart Giga-Guru status awarded to 
CHEP North America and North LATAM 
CHEP has participated in Walmart Inc.’s Project Gigaton™, 
which aims “to reduce or avoid one gigaton of carbon 
emissions from global value chains by 2030.” Brambles’ 
climate leadership, validated by its commitment to a 
1.5‑degree climate future, verified science‑based targets, 
net zero by 2040 roadmap and ongoing operational 
collaboration for greater supply chain efficiencies, led 
Walmart to feature CHEP as a ‘Giga‑Guru’ among all 
its suppliers. This recognition from the world’s largest 
retailer demonstrates the value of leading from the front 
on climate and sustainability.

Cultiva, an Italian leader in fresh produce, 
partners with CHEP on sustainable 
supply chains 
Cultiva aims to be carbon neutral in five years, and its 
revised sustainability strategy placed respect for the 
land and the planet as a central theme. CHEP will move 
Cultiva’s products and minimise the environmental 
impact of its supply chain, from the first to the last 
mile. Leveraging CHEP’s Sustainability Calculator, an 
expansion of product flows estimates Cultivas’ impact 
will save approximately 40 tonnes of carbon emissions, 
five tonnes of solid waste and prevent harvesting more 
than 40 trees annually. The value of the alignment 
between Cultivas’ and CHEP’s sustainability programme 
is so substantial that the customer aims to communicate 
CHEP’s impact externally to demonstrate their 
commitment to sustainable supply chains.

Countdown Supermarkets – Sustainability 
collaboration builds a positive relationship 
with a key account in CHEP New Zealand
Leveraging our ‘Share & Reuse’ model, the New Zealand 
(NZ) Fresh team delivered a strategic commercial 
engagement with the country’s largest retailer, Countdown 
Supermarkets. The project involved a Life Cycle Analysis 
(LCA) of Reusable Plastic Crates (RPCs) compared to single-
use alternatives in the NZ fresh supply chain. The superior 
environmental results of the RPCs were so compelling that 
a joint case study was produced with NZs peak industry 
sustainability body, the Sustainable Business Council (SBC). 

Countdown and its grower’s environmental savings: 
• 10,100 tonnes of CO2-e, 

the equivalent of planting 
over 5,050 trees annually

• Over 1,700 tonnes of 
waste, equivalent to more 
than 43,600 wheelie 
bins (240L)

The markets in which Brambles operates 
indicate an increasing preference for more 
sustainable, climate-conscious solutions. 
Brambles’ direct sustainability messaging 
to customers capitalises on this trend with 
a 74% increase in Sustainability Certificates 
issued in FY22. 
Brambles’ innovative use of Sustainability Certificates 
has created a credential for our customers. The 
certificates quantify the environmental advantages of 
Brambles’ circular model for customers by calculating 
the carbon emissions, waste and material savings 
over typical single-use or one-way alternatives. 
The Sustainability Certificates are independently 
verified to ISO 14040 LCA standard. They are being 
used by customers for internal and externally facing 
communications to demonstrate their sustainable 
actions in their own supply chains.

Brambles’ Sustainability Certificates have become a credential for our customers

 Our 2025 targets

A blueprint for collaboration
The number of customers engaged 
has increased Brambles’ Positive 
Collaboration progress this year. This 
included the Eliminating Waste and 
Eradicating Empty Transport Lanes 
components of the ZWW programme 
for the first time. 

Overall, transport-related activity 
including total distance, decreased 
due to lower asset collections 
and movements in FY22. 
Positive Collaboration is a highly 
valued offering for customers and is 
unique to Brambles. It is executed 
through our ZWW and logistics teams 
and is an enabler for Brambles’ 2025 
sustainability targets. The collaboration 
culture this programme fosters serves 
to build relationships and create 
shared value on common sustainability 
issues. This will be an advantage for 
Brambles as long-term coalitions 
become common practice to achieve 
decarbonisation targets. 

How Brambles drives Transport Collaboration 
By leveraging our extensive networks, logistics knowledge and data, Brambles can fill empty lanes, taking carbon out of an industry 
highly challenged in its dependency on fossil fuels.

We optimise transport in four different ways:
1   Plant Network Optimisation – positions service centres 

in optimal locations to capitalise on routes with the highest 
volume of platform exchange

2   Transport Collaboration (CHEP and customer) – 
creates collaborative partnerships by being a trusted 
non-competitive player

3   Transport Orchestration – facilitates optimisation of empty 
transport journeys between two or more customers

4   Multi-modal – utilises multiple transport modes such as rail 
and sea for the greatest cost and carbon efficiencies.

Refill Revolution:  
CHEP joins the world’s biggest 
multi‑retailer refill trial
CHEP Europe has joined the ‘Refill 
Coalition’, a group of UK retailers 
committed to developing the world’s 
biggest multi‑retailer refill solution and 
reducing supermarket packaging waste. 
The solution could play a key role in 
reducing the 56 billion units of single-
use plastic packaging sold annually in 
the UK. The Refill Coalition’s solution 
will reimagine how key food staples 
(e.g. pasta and grains) and household 
products (e.g. home and personal 
care products) are supplied. Part of 
the system, being developed through 
the coalition, is a bulk home delivery 
refill solution – an industry first. 

Zero Waste World Summit
The ZWW Summit, hosted twice annually 
by CHEP North America, boasts industry 
innovators who are solving complex 
problems to build a regenerative future. 

In FY22, two virtual ZWW events took 
place with participation from 200+ 
attendees from the sustainability 
industry. The events featured speakers 
from Aspire Bakeries, LOCOAL, 
Neste, Trane Technologies, Trenton 
Renewables and Trex, addressing how 
their organisations are driving changes 
to reduce and even eliminate empty 
transport miles, packaging waste 
and supply chain inefficiencies.

Brambles’ products are the physical enabler of our global 
circular network that drives our regenerative vision. We 
place sustainability at the core of every step of an iterative 
innovation process.

Designing out waste and pollution is one of the key principles from the 
EMF’s design for circularity principles. Brambles' Product innovation 
process leverages iterative user-centric feedback. Our product 
innovation teams transform these insights into circular solutions that 
support customers’supply chain and sustainability requirements and 
Brambles' regenerative vision.

Here, we provide insight into our product innovation process 
demonstrating the processes behind the world’s most circular products.

Sustainability is inherent from solution concept to material choice, to 
how it’s used and reused in the supply chain as well as best practice 
end-of-life (EOL) considerations.

Asset Efficiency 
Brambles circular business is driven by the number of times 
our assets are shared and reused. Improving asset efficiency 
delivers financial and environmental value, setting the 
standard for circular models.
Accelerating our asset efficiency initiatives in FY22, saved approximately 
four million pallets through recovery and salvage programmes.
Improved collection ability enabled the recovery of more pallets and 
was supported by insights from data analytics and leveraging new 
technology capabilities. For example, our teams deployed small 
truck fleets across North America (NA) and Europe to increase 
collection frequency and cycle time. In the US, we continued our 
focus on engaging with distributors in higher risk of loss channels 
and engaged our recyclers more effectively. We also installed new 
pallet remanufacturing at 20 US service centres to increase pallet life 
and reuse. Maximising circularity is supported by asset efficiency 
and demonstrates the reinforcing nature of sustainability and 
business value creation.

Accelerating initiatives to overcome pallet supply constraints and improve the environmental 
outcomes of our circular business model, delivers business and sustainability value

Top Employer
As part of Brambles’ Amazing Place to Work 
strategy, we sought external best practice 
validation and benchmarking to help improve 
our employee experience through ‘Top 
Employer’ accreditation. We participated in 
accreditation with the Top Employer Institute, a globally 
recognised best practice organisation, to help do this. 

In FY22, Brambles received further accreditation with the 
addition of five more countries (US, Mexico, Italy, Australia 
and Brazil). Twenty-one countries are now accredited, 
representing 91% of our employees. We also have the 
additional regional seal of LATAM to add to the European 
and African seals. We are very proud that we have improved 
our scores. In FY23, we have our goal of achieving 
global accreditation.

Pulse
In FY22, Brambles undertook two employee surveys 
to monitor our employees’ engagement and track our 
progress as a business against our Amazing Place to Work 
strategy. Our Year-End Engagement survey closed with a 
participation rate of 83%, eight points above the benchmark, 
and with improved participation from both our Plant and 
non-Plant-based employees. Engagement results at Group 
level remain steady at 78 points, close to the high-performing 
benchmark of 79 points and are trending positively for our 
non-plant-based employees at 81 points. 

These results align with the broader market trends where 
employee engagement and happiness at work have been 
levelling since September 2021. However, in our latest survey, 
almost 60% of Pulse metrics have improved, with only 13% 
decreasing. Our employee sentiment particularly improved 
about growth opportunities, the recognition they get and 
their empowerment to make decisions regarding their 
work. Further opportunities include improving ‘barriers to

Health, Safety 
and Wellbeing

Our new Safety First roadmap is based on three key 
phases, each designed to help navigate Brambles 
towards a vision of Zero Harm. 
The first phase includes the development of a series of six goals 
which are due for implementation in FY23: 

1. Safety First Management System – ISO 45001 aligned 
and standardised

2. Laser focus on key risks – Hunting for incident pre-cursors 
3. Brambles’ Welfare Standards – Setting minimum standards 

in our workplaces 
4. Safety Differently – Embedding the methodology across 

the globe
5. Leading Indicators – Proactive safety measurements
6. Process Automation – Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) 

supporting engineering projects from concept to completion

Brambles’ wellbeing programme – Feel Good
Brambles recognises that safety begins with 
a healthy mindset, which is why we initiated 
the Feel Good programme. After surveying our 
people, we identified four key themes to guide 
our activities: supporting healthy habits, mental 
health and resilience, sleep, and nutrition.

The following resources will also support our people:
• A new global strategy for wellbeing
• Feel Good calendar, promoting external events and 

campaigns;
• A global Feel Good space on the Employee Hub for all 

wellbeing resources and materials
• Learning resources on Brambles’ Academy are grouped under 

the four pillars of financial, mental, physical and social health

Safety First in a global pandemic 
The protection of our people is our highest concern. 
As the pandemic continues to impact the 
globe, Brambles remains vigilant in all of 
its operations. COVID-19 protocols and 
arrangements follow relevant Government 
advice. Brambles C19 Steerco maintains a 
control tower approach to ensure visibility 
of infection rates and to enable appropriate 
support if issues arise. 

Brambles’ World Safety Week 2022
Brambles actively ensures employees are given the opportunity 
to participate in the annual World Safety Week celebrations. 

In FY22, the central theme was Safety Differently, which included 
a range of live webinar events held by 
Brambles staff across the globe to reinforce 
its adoption and application benefits. 

Safety Differently is a contemporary 
development in the safety field that 
recognises and promotes the synergy 
between Human and Organisational 
(HOP) performance.

Sustainability Review 202218 Business PositiveIntroduction Planet Positive Communities Positive

At Brambles, we value the unique contribution 
that every one of our people makes to 
our business. We are committed to equal 
opportunity for all. The power of a diverse 
and inclusive workplace fosters productive 
connections with our people, suppliers and 
customers. It also inspires innovation and 
growth, driving world-class results.

Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion

Breaking down barriers to ensure equity
Brambles is constantly seeking to evolve and improve our 
approach to creating an inclusive environment where diversity can 
flourish in all its forms.

Brambles is using Equity-inspired Design to place equity at the 
heart of everything we do. This ensures equal opportunities for 
success and advancement, enabling everyone to be the best 
version of themselves every day. The approach leverages the 
power of diverse experiences and perspectives. It also includes 
identifying and eliminating barriers that prevent full participation 
and ongoing reviews of process and policy to ensure equitable 
outcomes for all. 

For example, to help progress our gender diversity ambitions, we 
have tailored our recruitment experience, work environments and 
communications approach to appeal to more talented women. 

Supporting accessibility
CHEP Sub-Saharan Africa launched an accessibility 
programme focused on creating a workplace where all our 
people, including those with disabilities, can thrive. Using the 
Equity-inspired Design approach, the programme seeks to 
identify and implement enhancements to our ways of working, 
workplace design, policy and process, with a particular focus 
on recruitment and professional development. The scheme is 
supported by a training and awareness programme, ensuring 
that our people understand the importance of disability 
inclusion and are equipped with the necessary skills to help 
everyone succeed.

Making sure every voice is heard
Core to our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is 
the belief that every voice has the right to be heard. Initiated in 
our North American region, we now have numerous Employee 
Resource Groups (ERGs) and forums across our global business 
to support this. These groups provide a safe space for individuals 
to freely express their thoughts and feelings. They also offer 
insights and feedback to our business and help shape more 
inclusive policy, strategy and process design. Among our efforts 
in this area, we have forums representing: Women; Black, 
African American and Caribbean colleagues; Hispanic and Latin 
American individuals; LGBTQ+ employees; Veterans and their 
families and People with Disabilities.

Data and digital supporting  
gender balance and neurodiversity 
Our global Data and Digital team support Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion in every aspect of our work. Despite the traditionally 
male-dominated sector, one-third of Digital leadership positions 
in Brambles are held by women. Building on this success, the 
team launched a programme of work designed to attract and 
develop neurodivergent talent. To leverage the full potential of 
our digital future, we will need to think, work and collaborate 
differently. Focusing on this aspect of diversity will further 
enhance our inclusive culture, where differences help drive 
innovative solutions for our customers and address the 
challenges of a rapidly changing marketplace.

Ethics and Compliance Training  
In FY22, Brambles launched our annual refresher Code of Conduct 
Course to all employees and launched a pilot of online Code of 
Conduct training in eight service centres across four regions. We 
also delivered the following training to employees globally:  

• Induction
• Conflicts of Interest 
• Speak Up and 

Whistleblower hotline 

• Anti-bribery
• Privacy and Security 
• Ethics in the Workplace

Brambles’ New Supplier  
Due Diligence Programme 
Our third-party due diligence programme is the cornerstone of 
Brambles’ Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption Programme and is 
embedded in our Vendor Onboarding Tool. The new supplier 
risk profile is consistent with our expectations with geography 
largely determining risk profile. LATAM and APAC (Asia) have 
more medium and high-risk suppliers, mainly due to their 
country risk profiles. Most of Brambles’ high‑risk suppliers are 
new lumber suppliers, labour suppliers or third-party service 
centre operators. All medium and high-risk suppliers are asked 
to provide copies of their anti-bribery and human rights policies. 
All suppliers who successfully complete due diligence are asked 
to complete a Supplier Acknowledgment Form, acknowledging 
the principles set out in Brambles’ Supplier Policy. In FY22, 
there was an increase in the return of Supplier Acknowledgment 
Forms globally, reflecting the work the local teams placed on 
following up with suppliers.

Risks of modern slavery practices  
in Brambles’ operations and supply chains
Our Human Rights Working Group (HRWG) assesses Brambles’ 
potential to cause, contribute to or be directly linked to modern 
slavery through its operations or its supply chains. The 
business faces a wide range of business and compliance risks, 
including those associated with corruption and modern slavery.

Modern Slavery Risk Assessment: Brambles’ operations
Brambles’ personnel are employed directly by a Group company. 
This, along with our policies, compliance training and internal 
hiring procedures consistent with our policies, lowers the risk 
of modern slavery in our operations.

View our Modern Slavery Act at
brambles.com/modern-slavery-act

Our Modern Slavery Risk Assessment is focused on the following 
arrangements examining the inherent risks, considering:

• Nature of the work: job requirements and corresponding skillset
• Geography: country reports on human rights practices and 

country condition reports
• Recruiting processes: labour recruitment policies and practices, 

and transparency.

Brambles’ regions are responding to ethical 
supply chain customer surveys

CHEP Canada and CHEP Europe have received Platinum 
recognition in their 2021 EcoVadis assessments, scoring 
80/100 and 76/100 respectively. This positions these 
businesses in the top 1% of responding companies. 
Brambles’ strong governance and approach to business 
ethics contributed to the result.

Brambles’ integrated approach to sustainable sourcing, asset productivity and network efficiency continues to manage the challenges.

 Our 2025 targets

FY22 achievements

Forest 
Positive

  Enable the sustainable growth of two trees 
for every tree we use

 Maintain 100% sustainable sourcing

  Grow the CoC programme throughout the world’s 
forestry supply chains

FY22 Material Sourcing 
Brambles’ longer-term procurement strategy combined with 
short-term targeted actions was instrumental in navigating 
wood sourcing supply challenges during the year. Despite 
these difficulties, all Brambles’ regions maintained certified 
sustainable sourcing for 100% of timber materials and 
increased the quantity of CoC certified materials to 72%. 

Brambles’ procurement teams focused on increasing 
collaboration between regions, accelerating efficiency projects 
to address challenges in one region with opportunities from 
another. Importantly, Brambles leveraged its position as a global 
customer for the diverse supplier network to ensure the security 
of sustainably certified raw material supply and security 
continuity. This experience has scenario tested the potential 
climate‑related risks identified during our climate change 
analysis and reinforced our mitigations. 

• Improve asset utilisation
• Reduce equipment loss
• Lower damage rates 

through closer collaboration 
with customers 
and partners.

• Maximising material 
yields in sawmills and 
the asset repair process, 
including rolling out more 
automation lines and 
standardising processes.

• The efficiency and resilience 
of Brambles’ operations, 
allows the Group to transfer 
best practices rapidly from 
one market to another. 

• Anticipating and responding 
to volatile customer 
demand profiles during 
the pandemic has required 
more agility in these 
difficult circumstances.

Brambles timber strategy 
Brambles’ timber strategy aims to increase the company’s 
access to sustainably certified timber at competitive prices. 
Our experience from the North American Sawmilling and global 
Sustainable Forest Certification Programme has provided 
unique insights into global forestry supply chains. Brambles 
has developed strong relationships with suppliers to ensure 
a competitive price in exchange for consistent and reliable 
demand for certified materials. This advantage will help unlock 
more value by aggregating Brambles material demand across 
the entire value chain. As part of the Shaping Our Future work, 
our optimisation initiatives have helped manage supply risks 
and inflation while growing the supplier base for certified forest 
products in new markets. These efforts are helping transform 
the global forest product market toward higher standards for 
employees, communities and the forest ecology. 

Brambles’ regenerative vision is to contribute 
to global efforts to restore forests to near 
pre-industrial age levels. Our Forest Positive 
strategy is a simple equation, two trees for one. 
This means we will help grow two trees for every 
one we use for our pallets – adding millions of 
new trees by 2030. In this way, we will help grow 
one for our business and one for our planet.

Foundations 
of a nature-
positive, 
Regenerative 
model 
CHEP Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) 
has 18 pine-timber farms in South 
Africa covering over 13,500ha. 
This pioneering, sustainable and 
regenerative approach is putting more 
resources and value into the world 
than is taken out. 
The vertical integration strategy in South 
Africa was initiatied because of ongoing 
shortages of industrial-grade timber. The 
strategy was to secure sustainable timber 
plantations for supply to sawmills. CHEP is 
cultivating regenerative, sustainably managed 
forests certified by the most credible global 
forestry certification standards. Forestry 
certification promotes the following 
landscape practices: 

• Absorb carbon and produce oxygen
• Mitigate severe weather events, reduce wind 

speed and prevent soil erosion and reduce 
climate-change-related risks

• Contribute to holistic biodiversity outcomes, 
e.g. filtering water and holding moisture, 
providing base inflows for wetlands 
and waterways

• Offer employment and sustainable 
livelihoods for communities 

• Increase productivity of farmland 
through agroforestry

How forest management certification 
improves biodiversity
Forest management certification confirms that the forest is 
being managed in a way that preserves biological diversity 
and benefits local people and workers’ lives while ensuring 
it sustains economic viability.

Forest Management includes requirements for the 
promotion of afforestation and reforestation through native 
or non-native species, where these are well adapted and 
non-harmful to site conditions and contribute to ecological 
connectivity. Harvesting activity needs to include actions 
preventing negative impacts on ecosystem functions, 
among the most important: carbon sequestration, protection 
of water courses and soil resources and conservation 
of biological diversity.

CHEP has recently 
acquired biodiverse 
mountain wetlands, 
containing headsprings 
that filter water and hold 
moisture for base inflows 
into local wetlands 
and waterways.

Free cattle grazing land, 
firewood and hay bales are 
provided to the Brooklands 
farm community. Braecroft 
foresters educate children 
on sustainability topics, 
such as poaching and 
fire prevention.

CHEP SSA invests in 
external and internal 
fire break burning, as 
well as general fire 
prevention measures.

Wattled cranes feed in 
the Braecroft forests.

CHEP is 
undertaking 
remediation 
works to 
protect 
waterways 
and enhace 
ecological 
function. 

The sawmill produces 
90% of CHEP SSA’s 
annual pallet purchases, 
and 40% of the repair 
material, with timber 
supplied to exact CHEP 
dimensions, maximising 
timber yield.

Poisons are banned, 
so habitat for raptors 
and owls is created for 
pest control.

 Our 2025 targets

FY22 achievements

Climate 
Positive

  Brambles commits to a 1.5°C degree climate future aligning with 
the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement 

  Science-based Targets (SBT) to 2030 covering our Scope 1, 2 and 
3 emissions 

 100% of electricity for our operations will be renewable by 2025

 All our operations will be carbon neutral by 2025

 Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040

Brambles has taken immediate action in our Climate Positive programme, 
increasing usage of renewable electricity to 100%. We will decrease the 
contribution of verified carbon offsets (VCO) to zero through our Climate 
Positive strategy. 
The FY22 make up of renewable energy is provided below.

Addressing climate change through our 
circular business model
Brambles’ circular business model, validated 
SBT, net-zero by 2040 target and vision to 
pioneer regenerative supply chains, places 
the business at the forefront of climate 
ambition. During the year, our service centres 
have increased the proportion of renewable 
electricity powering our business to 88%. 
The remaining 12% is covered by VCOs from 
certified renewable energy projects. VCOs 
will be scaled down as the contributions from 
renewable electricity increase. Since FY21, 
Brambles has been carbon neutral, covering 
100% of our scope 1 and remaining scope 
2 operational emissions. Our carbon offset 
strategy invests in forestry regeneration 
projects supporting our Forest Positive 
and Community Positive programmes. 
This synergy demonstrates the integration 
of Brambles’ sustainability strategy and 
highlights our determination to leverage 
natural climate solutions (NCS) in our pathway 
to a net-zero position. 

New horizons: Brambles’ Science-based 
Targets and commitment to net-zero 
emissions by 2040
FY22 has seen rapid progress in our 
decarbonisation roadmap and ambitious 
Climate Positive programme. We received 
verification of our SBTs, which cover over 90% of 
material emissions sources in our value chain. 
Brambles’ SBT performance and the emissions 
breakdown of our total GHG emissions for FY22 
are provided separately on page 25.

Brambles’ has strengthened its regenerative 
vision by committing to net-zero emissions 
covering our full value chain by 2040. The 
company’s pledge to align with the 2015 Paris 
Climate Agreement and participate in global 
efforts to limit average global temperatures to 
1.5°C was a driving force behind the process. 
Brambles was already committed to achieving 
net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 
2050 however, this new target responds to 
the urgency of climate change bringing the 
deadline forward by ten years.

This milestone raises the benchmark for 
climate leadership in the private sector and 
demonstrates that business is a critical force 
for positive change. The infographic on page 
26 illustrates the trajectory for our net-zero 
target and outlines key actions already 
underway to deliver ongoing progress.

During the year, our core circular model helped 
customers avoid over 2.5 million tonnes of 
GHG emissions and preserve 3.1 million trees 
while moving life’s essentials.

Brambles’ decarbonisation roadmap
Brambles has created a dedicated decarbonisation 
team integrated within the supply chain function 
and a governance structure to manage the 
challenge effectively. Working with internal and 
external stakeholders across many initiatives, the 
team has created an actionable roadmap to ensure 
this corporate, strategic vision becomes a reality 
across five continents and 60 countries.

Brambles’ decarbonisation plans will pursue 
emissions reductions in our operations 
and subcontracted sites, with logistics 
suppliers and through strategic procurement 
engagements and controls. The key levers for 
decarbonisation include: 

• Asset efficiency: maximising the recovery and 
reuse of our platforms, enhancing the company’s 
circular model and reducing expenditure 
on new assets

• Renewable electricity: in our own and 
subcontracted locations 

• Network productivity: plant and logistics 
optimisation, reducing empty transport lanes 
and maximising truck loads

• Enabling the testing of alternative fuels: 
zero emissions transport technologies (such 
as electric and hydrogen trucks) and alternative 
fuels for heating

• Reducing the volume of waste: diverting it from 
landfill to low or zero emissions processes.

Brambles will progressively embed 
decarbonisation targets into our strategic and 
financial decision‑making processes. This 
includes integrating carbon considerations into 
capital allocation, policies, product design and 
procurement processes. We will also seek to 
collaborate with our suppliers, customers, and 
the broader industry. Governments also have 
an essential role in developing an enabling 
policy environment, supporting research and 
development for transport transition technologies, 
and supporting infrastructure.

Addressing climate change 
through the circular economy

brambles.com/tcfd

Task Force on  
Climate-related 
Financial 
Disclosures 
(TCFD)
Brambles’ circular business model and 
resilient network combined with its 1.5-degree 
climate-aligned targets and net-zero by 2040 
commitment define a leading climate transition 
plan that generates financial returns from 
a sustainable business model.

Addressing climate change is part of Brambles’ Regenerative 
vision, which aims to replenish the resources we need while 
creating more positive outcomes for society and the planet.
Advancing the circular economy is an enabling strategy to 
address climate change and biodiversity loss while allowing 
businesses to grow and thrive within the decarbonising 
economic transition. 

The agility and scale of Brambles’ 
network and extensive asset pools 
create an inherent resilience to 
supply chain shock, enabling 
greater responsiveness to 
customers before and after severe 
climate-related weather events.
FY22 presented many opportunities 
for Brambles to test and demonstrate 
the resilience of our network. In 
addition to ongoing heightened 
demand from customers for its pool 
of assets, incidences of climate-
related weather events impacted 
both its plants and critical pieces of 
transport infrastructure.

Longer-term, climate-related risks 
relating to materials, specifically 
timber for pallets, are considered 
in Brambles’ strategic planning 
processes. This includes extensive 
mitigations already underway as 
part of procurement, supply chain 
and asset efficiency programmes.
In a year of continued disruption, 
including ongoing materials 
shortages, Brambles remained 
steadfast in our commitment to 
100% sustainable sourcing of wood 
and expanded the supply base for 
CoC forest certification. Delivering on 
these outcomes required extensive 
collaborations to rapidly onboard 
certified suppliers in new markets 
and bring its customers along the 
sustainability materials journey. 
This is in addition to the significant 
contributions of value chain 
efficiencies, specifically, the Shaping 
Our Future transformation initiatives 
that improve asset efficiency and 
network productivities. These 
experiences have provided real-world 
stress-testing for Brambles’ systems 
and processes, confirming the 
resilience in the face of future 
climate-related impacts.

Brambles’ core circular business 
model and 2025 sustainability 
targets define a leading climate 
strategy. The immediate and 
ongoing opportunities related to 
Brambles’ low-carbon, circular 
business model outweigh 
short-term, climate-related risks 
in the decarbonising 1.5°C and 2°C 
climate scenarios.
The markets in which Brambles 
operates indicate an increasing 
preference for more sustainable, 
climate-conscious solutions, 
especially for key accounts, such 
as retailers and manufacturers, 
with a direct interface with 
activated consumers. 

Brambles support our customers 
by managing supply chain risks 
and highlighting our circular 
model’s low-carbon, no-waste 
advantages through the provision 
of Sustainability Certificates 
page 12. We also offer innovative, 
value-creating partnerships that 
deliver against its customers’ 
sustainability goals, such as 
our Positive Collaboration and 
ZWW programme.

Brambles’ new Climate Positive commitments have 
responded to the metrics and targets recommendation 
from the TCFD and align with the climate-related 
opportunity associated with our low-carbon circular 
business model. Accelerating Brambles’ transition to 
a net-zero business will help our customers advance 
their decarbonisation goals. These ambitious targets

 Our 2025 targets

FY22 achievements

Waste 
Positive

  Zero product materials sent to landfill for all Brambles 
and subcontracted locations 

  Innovate closed-loop products: aspire to use 30% recycled 
or upcycled plastic waste by 2025 and 100% by 2030 

  100% of Brambles’ locations, including offices and service centres, 
will be zero waste

  Water positive: optimise all water use, including reclaiming, recycling, 
replenishment and treatment

Percentage of product waste diverted from landfill

Zero waste to landfill –  
Progress on targets 
Brambles and its third-party plants have 
delivered another solid year of progress in 
the Waste Positive programme. In FY22, the 
measurement scope was expanded to account 
for more non-Brambles locations that interact 
with our products, such as TPMs1, resulting in 
better coverage and higher ambition. 

In total, 624 sites have confirmed they 
have not sent any Brambles’ product waste 
(wood or plastic) to landfill. Of these, 105 
are managed directly by CHEP businesses 
and 519 are classified as third‑party. This 
coverage accounts for more than 95% of 
Brambles’ product issue volumes. 74% of 
Brambles’ service centres and 55% of our 
third-party suppliers’ diverted product waste 
from landfill. This demonstrates that 58% 
of locations have diverted product waste 
from landfills, representing a 31‑percentage 
point improvement on FY21. Brambles’ 
recently validated SBT and decarbonisation 
engagement process provided the platform to 
drive these positive results.

Zero Waste critical 
for decarbonisation and circularity 
During FY22, Brambles’ regional 
decarbonisation teams developed roadmaps 
of specific initiatives to reduce emissions and 
waste. Brambles’ Waste Positive target: to 
achieve zero product waste sent to landfills by 
2025 for our own operations and third-party 
service centres, has been incorporated into 
this decarbonisation programme. In FY21, 
we estimated that waste emissions from our 
products sent to landfill comprise 2.8% of 
our Scope 3 emissions. In FY22, emissions 
reduced by 3.7% due to improved asset 
productivity measures. Including zero waste 
initiatives in the decarbonisation roadmap 
creates efficiencies for both Climate and 
Waste Positive programmes and helps improve 
our circular model.

Microsoft Co-Project on SWAP 
CHEP joins forces with nine EMF members 
in the Stretch Wrap Alternative Project to 
reimagine pallet wrap. The SWAP is a cross-
industry effort promoted by the EMF and is 
made up of ten organisations, including CHEP, 
Microsoft, Anthesis Group, BASF, Berry Global, 
Inc., Cisco, The Estee Lauder Companies INC, 
Flex Mainetti, SCG and WSP, collaborating 
to explore circular alternatives to stretch 
wrap packaging, focusing on reuse, recycling 
and composting.

Brambles’ circular business model and Waste Positive targets 
reinforce the fundamentals of the circular economy by keeping

beyond our business boundary, we aim to use more recycled plastic 
waste in our products and expand our zero waste initiatives with 
our suppliers.

Case study:  
Pallecon Peppers Unlimited 
Peppers Unlimited, a condiment sauce 
producer annually shipping more than 
12 million gallons of sauce, sought to 
replace one-way corrugated boxes that 
require costly and wasteful disposal. They 
adopted CHEP Pallecon 315 collapsible 
liquid containers to protect their orders 
while in use and take up less space while 
not in use, achieve an efficient, sustainable 
shipping process and utilise the trackable 
barcode for inventory and food safety.

Food  
Positive

  Collaborate with food banks to serve 
rescued food to 10 million people

Brambles has once again exceeded its initial Food 
Positive target by facilitating meals to over 16.2 
million people for FY22. 

This result was achieved in the context of extreme 
pallet, raw materials shortages and supply 
chain disruption.

Compounding global issues have exacerbated an 
existing food crisis in many regions placing even 
more importance on food relief agencies. 

Brambles’ supply chain expertise and our assets 
help food rescue organisations provide meals 
to millions of people worldwide. This is made 
possible through in-kind support, provision of 
logistics knowledge and skills, employees for 
volunteering and financial donations.

With food insecurity intensifying, Brambles’ businesses have 
become even more critical in helping to facilitate the flow of 
rescued food to and from food relief organisations. Providing 
in-kind pallets and containers to food banks helps them address 
ongoing food relief requirements and emergency relief efforts, 
many of which are made worse by climate-related weather 
events, such as droughts, fires and floods. 

Brambles’ Food Positive programme is critical to 
multi-stakeholder collaboration and provides a dependable 
social safety net for people and families in times of crisis.

Brambles collaborates with food rescue organisations in each 
region to help them deliver their services. These include Global 
Foodbanking Network, Feeding America, Food Bank Australia 
and European Food Banks Federation (FEBA).

International Day of Awareness  
of Food Loss and Waste 
European Food Banks Federation (FEBA) organised a challenge 
for its members for the International Day of Awareness of 
Food Loss and Waste. CHEP was part of the jury choosing the 
winners alongside Nestlé, Kelloggs and General Mills. 

CHEP Mexico signs Pact for Food
In FY22, CHEP Mexico became a signatory of Pacto por la 
Comida (Pact for Food) with the collective aim to reduce 50% 
of food loss and waste in 10 years. Launched by Banco de 
Alimentos Mexico (BAMX), CHEP Mexico is the key supply 
chain & logistics partner alongside major FMCG retailers. 
Other stakeholders participating in the initiative are WWF and 
The Consumer Goods Forum. Silvia Suárez, CHEP LATAM Sr. 
Director for Sustainability, Strategy & Marketing, is the honorary 
president and will lead the expansion of Pacto by engaging 
stakeholders and ensuring key objectives are achieved.

CHEP Europe continues its commitment to alleviating hunger and 
reducing food waste by renewing its partnership with FEBA for 
another three years. Brambles will continue to provide supply chain 
knowledge, in-kind contributions (including training and consultancy 
in safety, logistics and warehouse management) and donations to 
help finance FEBA’s operations.

“We are honoured to partner with Brambles to leverage its knowledge 
and expertise to help drive efficiency and scale in European Food 
Banks. Their competence is an essential asset for the future of our 
organisation.” – Angela Frigo, Secretary General of FEBA

CHEP’s in-kind pallets donations are considered vital to daily 
operations and maximising food distribution efficiency. Over the 
last three years, Brambles have contributed to the redistribution of 
an estimated 300,000 tonnes of food transported on CHEP’s pallets 
in Europe.

FY22 achievements

Circular 
Economy 
Transformation

  Brambles will advocate, educate and impact 
one million people to become circular economy 
change makers.

Over 504,000 people have been reached in FY22 and 
over 599,464 since the FY20 baseline through our 
communication, training and advocacy, sharing the 
benefits of the circular economy. 

The negative impacts of linear business 
models are no longer a future concern, but 
are a present-day experience. Brambles’ 
Circular Economy Transformation programme 
leverages our leadership position to offer a 
positive strategy to progress a regenerative 
business paradigm.   

Brambles recognised as thought 
leader and students redesign our 
regenerative strategy!
Brambles had the honour of being selected by the 
EMF to submit a challenge in their famous ‘From 
Linear to Circular’ programme. This recognition of 
Brambles as a thought leader in circularity, and the popularity 
of our challenge with the students, shows how our regenerative 
ambitions have engaged people across the globe. 

“As some of you may have experienced, the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation training programme ‘From Linear to Circular’ is the 
perfect programme for beginners starting to understand circular 
economy,” said Marianne Richeux, Senior Manager, 
Zero Waste World.

Planet Positive:  
 
The regional APAC Procurement Team 
have worked tirelessly to uphold 
Brambles’ sustainable sourcing 
standards during heightened material 
supply shortages. These shortages 
were caused by COVID-19 and further 
strained by the Ukraine conflict.

The team maintained consistent 
communication with customers 
and emphasised our sustainability 
standards which the customers 
embraced. 

Their efforts ensured Brambles’ 
commitment to purchasing wood from 
responsibly sourced forests continued 
throughout the process. The initiative 
made significant progress in growing 
the timber supply base in APAC 
without compromising sustainability. 
By adding new suppliers, milling and 
manufacturing partners, the team 
increased the manufacturing of new 
pallets by 40% in 2022 compared 
to 2021.

Communities Positive:  

The CHEP Poland Communities 
Positive volunteers are firm believers 
in giving back to their communities 
because it transforms their 
perspective, expands networks and 
makes a real difference in people’s 
lives. When the conflict in Ukraine 
began, the team didn’t hesitate to 
organise shelters and gather supplies 
for Ukrainian refugees. They also 
focused on supporting Ukrainian 
mothers as they struggled with their 
new situation. The team developed 
an attitude of gratitude during that 
time and began to appreciate the 
importance of volunteering. 

Business Positive:  
 
This incredible team started nine 
LeanIn circles, which now involves 
over 90 women across LATAM (almost 
half the female employees across the 
region). These circles aim to create 
a network for women in our region, 
to support their professional and 
personal growth. These groups meet 
each month and the attendees mentor 
each other, and share advice and 
experience to help everyone advance 
in their careers and achieve their 
objectives and life goals. This support 
network enables CHEP LATAM 
to become more inclusive while 
supporting its gender equality goals.

Brambles 
Sustainability 
Week 
The past successes of Brambles’ Sustainability 
Day encouraged us to extend the event 
for an entire week. The expanded focus 
allowed employees to learn and participate 
in sustainability events, across different 
time zones, including the announcement of 
Brambles’ new Climate Positive targets.  

Positive Impact for People and the Planet 
Dependencies and impacts on nature and 
biodiversity is an emerging ESG issue
Brambles’ dependency on nature and its resources to 
create value underpins our 2025 commitment to adopting 
methodologies that account for our value chain’s natural 
capital risks and opportunities. In 2022, the Task Force 
for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) produced 
its V0.2 beta framework to help organisations understand 
and disclose evolving nature-related risks. Brambles will 
review the V0.2 version and assess its application to our 
business in FY23. 

Brambles are also involved in the pilot testing phase of 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Land Sector and Removals 
Guidance working group. The GHG Protocol Land Sector 
and Removals Guidance explains how companies should 
account for and report GHG emissions and removals 
from land management, land use change, biogenic 
products, carbon dioxide removal technologies, and 
related activities in GHG inventories and builds on the 
Corporate Standard and Scope 3 Standard. The guidance 
is currently being developed through a global, inclusive 
multi-stakeholder development process which began in 
2020 and will be finalised and published in 2023.

Sustainability Review 2022 Business PositiveIntroduction Planet Positive Communities Positive34

Stepping into the future, stepping into the positive.
Brambles’ sustainability programme demonstrates that by doing the right thing in the right 
way, businesses can have a positive environmental and social impact while strengthening 
financial returns.

Two years ago, we started a new phase of our sustainability programme, one based on 
an inspiring and challenging vision: to create a regenerative supply chain. Today, we can 
proudly announce that, step by step, this vision is becoming a reality. In FY22, we achieved 
significant progress in our 2025 Sustainability Targets, through deeper integration with 
key business functions and the acceleration of our Shaping Our Future transformation 
programme. Moreover, the regenerative ambition is now being adopted by a whole 
community of companies that realise that reducing damage is longer not enough.

The disruptions we see in global supply chains today have demonstrated that sustainable 
models are also more resilient. Our circular operations have never been more critical 
in making sure that supply chains keep moving while reducing environmental damage. 
Building a more sustainable supply chain is not just our moral obligation, it’s also an 
opportunity to create a stronger business. With the collaboration of our customers, 
suppliers and partners, and the drive and passion of our employees, we are creating the 
supply chain the world needs to step into a positive future.
