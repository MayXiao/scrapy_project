The Places Where We Thrive

Artwork description 
The artwork tells the story of a vision for 
our communities, both large and small, 
where they are all thriving and strong as 
they build lives, homes and legacies for 
present and future generations. Every 
community is connected by spirit and 
by country, surrounded by flourishing 
waterways and vibrant land that is 
enriched and cared for by its people. 
Communities are empowered to find new 
ways to build and expand, as they dream 
and innovate to create the places where 
we thrive.

Sustainability  
at Dexus
Our Sustainability Report describes our 
application of the Dexus Sustainability Approach 
from 1 July 2021 through to 30 June 2022.

The Dexus Sustainability Approach 
informs how we create long-term value 
through understanding and addressing 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) issues that are relevant to our 
operations.

In recognition of the importance of ESG 
for our business, we publish an integrated 
reporting suite at the end of each 
financial year that is aligned with the 
International Integrated Reporting Council 
<IR> Framework. The 2022 Annual Report 
describes how the Dexus Sustainability 
Approach objectives are integrated into 
our business model and provides an 
overview of our performance against these 
objectives. The 2022 Sustainability Report 
comprises several components:

– Sustainability Performance Pack, 
which expands on the performance 
highlights within the 2022 Annual 
Report and provides further insight into 
how we apply the Dexus Sustainability 
Approach

– Sustainability Data Appendix, which 
contains comprehensive datasets for a 
range of ESG metrics and indicators 

– Management Approach and 
Procedures, which describe the policies 
and procedures that underpin each of 
the objectives of our approach to ESG

Readers interested in our alignment with 
the ASX Corporate Governance Principles 
and Recommendations should refer to the 
2022 Corporate Governance Statement.

Sustainability at Dexus



Our approach  
to materiality
The concept of materiality is central 
to corporate sustainability as it helps 
organisations highlight and prioritise 
the ESG issues of greatest importance to 
their business models. It also helps inform 
stakeholders about how those ESG 
issues impact the organisation’s ability 
to create value, their impacts on society 
and the broader environment. 

Dexus has completed regular 
materiality assessments since 2011 
to inform our approach to ESG and 
reporting. We continuously seek to 
improve the information we report on, 
including reviewing material issues and 
key megatrends to ensure relevance. 

Periodically, we formally re-assess our 
material issues through an extensive 
process, facilitated by an independent 
specialist. In the intervening years, 
including in 2022, we conducted 
a management review of our key 
megatrends and material topics. 

Materiality assessment timeline and process

Dexus’s materiality assessment encompasses an assessment or management review using a four-stage process:

Review type 1. Initial analysis 2. Engage & consult 3. Identify & prioritise 
material topics

4. Reporting themes

Materiality  
Assessment

(every 3 to 5 years)

Desktop research to 
consider a wide range 
of megatrends that 
could present risks and 
opportunities for Dexus.

Interviews with 
internal and external 
stakeholders to identify 
key megatrends and 
understand Dexus’s 
positioning regarding 
risks and opportunities 
(SWOT analysis).

Identification of material 
topics associated 
with key megatrends, 
and prioritisation of 
material topics through 
engagement with Dexus 
senior and executive 
management.

Use of the material 
topics to determine 
reporting themes 
as specified by the 
Integrated Reporting 
Framework and GRI 
Standards.

Management  
Review 

(intervening years)

Research and review of 
key megatrends and 
material topics, and how 
they align with Dexus’s 
strategic risks, risk 
management activities, 
operations, and project 
initiatives.

Consultation with 
internal stakeholders to 
review key megatrends 
and material topics. 

Review material issues 
arising from industry 
collaboration and 
ESG surveys and 
benchmarks, such as 
CDP, GRESB, and DJSI.

Consultation with Dexus 
senior and executive 
management to confirm 
identified and prioritised 
megatrends and 
material topics.

Dexus has aligned with 
the Integrated Reporting 
Framework and GRI 
Standards to ensure the 
structure and content of 
annual results reporting 
adequately disclosed 
materiality issues and 
performance.

Our most recent materiality assessment identified nine material topics grouped within six megatrends. The 2022 management 
review of these material issues confirmed all nine topics remain a priority for stakeholders, and five of which saw increased 
emphasis in 2022. 

These material topics help structure our reporting and are a major consideration for how we evolve our approach to ESG over 
time. 

The nine material topics formed the basis for identifying: 

 – ‘Material matters’ for value creation as defined by the International Integrated Reporting Council <IR> Framework,  
which are disclosed as ‘value drivers’ within Dexus’s value creation framework on pages 4-5 

 – ‘Topic specific disclosures’ related to stakeholder impact as defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards,  
used to inform the content within the 2022 Sustainability Report

Dexus 
Sustainability 
Approach
The Dexus Sustainability Approach incorporates 
the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)  
‘six principles’ relating to responsible investment 
and active property management. 

The Dexus Sustainability Approach 
is the foundation that we use to 
effectively manage emerging ESG risks, 
opportunities and create long-term 
value. 

The approach is aligned with our 
strategy, supporting long-term value 
creation through the integration of 
material ESG issues into our business 
model (refer to the value creation 
framework on pages 4-5).

It incorporates five objectives which 
collectively direct our focus towards 
addressing the issues considered to be 
most material for our stakeholders.

Our purpose
The Dexus purpose, ‘To create spaces 
where people thrive’, articulates our 
reason for being in business. Our 
purpose works alongside the Dexus 
Sustainability Approach to inspire 
our people to create thriving spaces 
that have a positive impact on our 
stakeholders.

Managing risk
A prudent and robust approach to risk 
management is an essential part of our 
ongoing success. There are various risks 
that could impact the execution of our 
strategy and outlook, and the nature 
and potential impact of these risks can 
change over time. We actively review 
and manage risks faced by the group 
over the short, medium and long term, 
overseen by the Board Risk Committee.

Independent assurance
In addition to auditing the Financial 
Statements, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(PwC) provides limited assurance over 
selected environmental and social data 
metrics within the 2022 Dexus Annual 
Reporting Suite.

Limited assurance has been obtained 
for the 12 months to 30 June 2022. The 
Assurance Statement, and associated 
reporting criteria documents are 
available at page 182.

Aligning with global goals
As a signatory to the UN Global 
Compact (UNGC), we are committed 
to upholding the UNGC’s ten principles 
and supporting broader UN objectives 
such as the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs).

The UNGC’s ten principles are  
derived from:

–  The Universal Declaration  
of Human Rights

–  The International Labour 
Organisation’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and  
Rights at Work

–  The Rio Declaration on  
Environment and Development 

–  The United Nations Convention 
Against Corruption

The SDGs are a set of 17 universal 
goals applicable to all countries at all 
stages of development. They detail a 
path to 2030 to end extreme poverty, 
fight inequality and injustice, protect 
the planet, and provide a framework 
for global and local sustainable 
development efforts. Our approach 
to aligning with the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals has involved 
reviewing and prioritising the 17 SDGs 
to identify those that Dexus can most 
contribute towards through our core 
business activities. As a result, Dexus 
has prioritised four SDGs and aligned 
with specific targets under each of the 
Goals to drive more targeted delivery 
and positive impact.

Our priority SDGs and targets are aligned 
with the Dexus Sustainability Approach. 
Dexus’s adoption of specific goals and 
targets rather than broader corporate 
alignment was informed by The SASB 
Real Estate Sustainability Accounting 
Standards, which specify ESG topics 
considered to be material for real estate. 
This targeted approach enables us to 
have a positive influence through our core 
business activities.

10  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Our capacity to sustain financial 
performance depends on our ability to 
leverage our key resources to create 
value, underpinned by a high standard 
of corporate governance. 

Our strategy is to deliver superior 
risk-adjusted returns for investors from 
high quality real estate in Australia’s 
major cities. Continued execution of 
our strategy over time requires effective 
deployment of our key resources and 
relationships, including:

 – Financial – The pool of funds 
available to us for deployment 
which includes debt and equity 
funding, funds from our third party 
capital partners to invest on their 
behalf, as well as profits retained 
from our property management, 
development, and trading activities

 – Manufactured – Our properties, 
which are central to our ability to 
create value as a real estate owner, 
manager and developer 

 – Human – The knowledge, expertise, 
and performance of our people 

 – Social and relationship – The 
relationships we nurture with our 
customers, local communities,  
and suppliers 

 – Natural – The natural resources  
we use such as energy, water,  
and materials 

The objectives of the Dexus  
Sustainability Approach are aligned 
with our key resources and relationships: 

 – Sustained Value – Delivering long 
term financial performance for our 
investors and third party capital 
partners supported by active 
capital management, strong 
corporate governance, and the 
achievements across our other 
Dexus Sustainability Approach 
objectives

 – Leading Cities – Focusing on 
maintaining and developing a 
high-quality property portfolio that 
contributes to economic prosperity 
and sustainable urban development 
across Australia’s key cities 

 – Thriving People – Maintaining 
an engaged, capable and high-
performing workforce, within an 
inclusive environment, that delivers 
on our strategy 

 – Future Enabled Customers and 
Strong Communities – Partnering 
with satisfied and successful 
customers, prosperous and strong 
communities, and capable suppliers 
with whom we enjoy productive and 
enduring relationships

 – Enriched Environment – Providing 
an efficient and resilient portfolio 
that minimises our environmental 
footprint, helping us to mitigate 
climate risk and prepare for a 
resilient future 

Sustained Value
Our approach to ESG is aligned with our 
overarching goal of delivering Sustained Value.

Sustained Value performance

COMMITMENTS
→  Based on current 

expectations regarding 
interest rates, continued asset 
sales and barring unforeseen 
circumstances, Dexus expects 
distributions of 50.0-51.5 cents 
per security for the 12 months 
ended 30 June 20231, below 
the 53.2 cents per security 
delivered in FY22

→  Maintain a strong and 
diversified balance sheet

Focus areas
→  Maintaining leadership  

in ESG benchmarks

1 Assumes average floating rates of  
2.75%-3.75% (90-day BBSW), the 
transition of circa $21 billion of FUM 
from the acquisition of the AMP 
Capital real estate and domestic 
infrastructure equity platform and 
circa $50-$55 million of trading profits 
(post-tax).

Financial performance 
Our goal is to deliver superior 
long-term performance for our 
investors and third party capital 
partners.

Progress against commitments

Achieved our commitment  
to deliver distribution per security 
growth of not less than 2% for the  
12 months ending 30 June 2022. 

Dexus achieved 2.7% growth in 
distributions per security for the  
12 months ending 30 June 2022  
(53.2 cents). This result was above our 
initial market guidance for distribution 
growth of not less than 2% which was 
upgraded in the second half to growth  
of not less than 2.5%.

Achieved our commitment  
to maintain a strong balance 
sheet while further diversifying 
debt.

We maintained a strong and 
conservative balance sheet with 
gearing (look-through)1 at 26.9%, 
within our target range of 30-40%, 
while maintaining conservative debt 
maturities and hedging levels. Refer to 
page 39 in Dexus’s 2022 Annual Report 
for more information.

In FY22, Dexus announced that it 
entered into an agreement with AMP 
to acquire AMP Capital’s real estate 
and domestic infrastructure equity 
business, with up to $21.1 billion2 
of funds under management. This 
transaction is expected to complete in 
the second half of the 2022 calendar 
year and further solidifies Dexus as a 
leading real asset manager, with new 
capabilities and an expanded product 
offering underpinned by a best practice 
governance and risk management 
framework.

1 Excluding Dexus’s share of co-investments in

Strong corporate 
governance 
Our corporate governance 
framework integrates ESG 
across the breadth and depth 
of Dexus. We regularly review 
and update our policies and 
procedures to ensure our 
organisation adapts to shifting 
risks and opportunities.

The Board ESG Committee considers 
the material ESG issues relevant 
to the group and supports us to 
maintain our position as a global 
leader in ESG performance.

The Board ESG Committee supports  
the Board in:

 – Understanding the expectations  
of our key stakeholders

 – Understanding how our ability to 
create value is impacted by  
ESG issues

 – Monitoring external ESG trends  
and understanding associated 
risks and opportunities

The Board ESG Committee meets 
four times a year and during 
the year engaged with Dexus 
management teams on a range 
of ESG topics, including:

 – Harnessing technology and 
innovation to improve customer 
experience such as the air 
filtration pilot at One Margaret 
Street, Sydney (page 28) 

 – Supporting the wellbeing of our 
people and customers through 
implementing initiatives aligned to 
Dexus’s corporate partnership with 
the Black Dog Institute (page 30)

 – Launching and progressing our 
Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan 
(page 31)

 – Strengthening ESG in our supply 
chain through extended supply 
chain mapping and supplier 
assessments (page 33)

 – Progressing towards our net zero 
emissions target (page 36)

 – Renewable energy and energy 
efficiency initiatives (page 37)

 – Addressing climate risk across 
the portfolio (page 42-43)

There has been no change 
in membership to the Board 
ESG Committee.

The Group Management Committee 
saw one change in FY22 with the 
Executive General Manager, Investor 
Relations, Communications and 
Sustainability leaving Dexus in 
February 2022. The Chief Financial 
Officer is now responsible for the 
Listed Investor Relations team and

Sustained Value



Engaging with investors 
We recognise the importance our  
investors place on ESG topics 
and issues for long-term value 
creation. 

In FY22 we engaged with current 
and prospective investors to discuss 
our approach to ESG, to learn about 
their priorities and concerns, and to 
gain broader insights on how ESG is 
impacting local and global markets. 

Our discussions in FY22 revealed the 
following key topics of interest:

 – How we are supporting female 
representation in senior and 
executive management 
towards our 40:40:20 gender 
representation target

 – The launch of our Reflect 
Reconciliation Action Plan and 
our approach to implementation 

 – How we are managing modern 
slavery risks in our operations 
and supply chains

 – Our approach to climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, 
including transition risks 
and opportunities  

 – Acceleration of our net zero  
emissions target and our 
implementation approach 
and progress

 – Our onsite solar PV program and  
the opportunities and challenges 
for deploying renewables across  
industrial assets 

 – How we are collaborating with 
industrial customers to incorporate 
leading environmental sustainability 
features within new industrial 
developments supported by 
Green Star certifications

We contribute to the prosperity of 
Australia’s cities through the delivery 
and management of world class 
properties. Our properties attract high 
calibre customers whose businesses 
create jobs and support local, regional 
and national economies. 

Similarly, our investment portfolio 
mainly comprises prime CBD offices 
in Australia’s gateway cities and 
includes some of the country’s most 
iconic assets. We are one of Australia’s 
largest owners and managers of prime 
office property with 1.6 million square 
metres of office space spanning 45 
office properties, covering the CBDs of 
Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.

Over the past year, COVID-19 
lockdowns continued to impact the 
physical occupancy of offices, with the 
Omicron variant delaying the return 
to the office into 2022. While people 
continue to work flexibly, the return of 
people to offices continued to gain 
momentum, particularly in core CBD 
markets. 

One of the key megatrends positively 
influencing our business model is 
urbanisation. In Australia, our major 
cities contribute around 80% to national 
GDP. The CBDs are the engine room 
for most of this economic activity, 
supporting hundreds of thousands of 
businesses and millions of jobs. 

Urbanisation is supported by the 
growth drivers of strong, long-term 
population growth and record levels 
of infrastructure investment which 
enhance our cities’ accessibility, 
liveability and sustainability.

The activation of our $17.7 billion 
development pipeline enhances 
portfolio quality, while providing our 
third party capital partners with  
co-investment opportunities to create 
places where our customers can thrive.  

The group development pipeline 
includes several city-shaping projects, 
providing us with a strong platform for 
organic growth and value-creating 
opportunities. 

We utilise our capability to secure 
development sites and create the next 
generation of buildings, ideally helping 
shape our cities for the future as 
desirable places to live, work and play, 
while contributing to job creation and 
economic growth.

Leading Cities
As a real estate company our properties are 
central to how we create value. Our investments 
and value creation potential are closely linked to 
the success of Australia’s major cities which are 
recognised for their amenity, ease of access, and 
place to do business.

Horizon 3023, Ravenhall

Dexus developed 132,100 square metres 
of industrial facilities in Ravenhall, 
Victoria. Partnering with our engaged 
customers, we have developed the 
first 6 Star Green Star Design & As 
Built facility in our industrial portfolio. 
Featuring a 200kW solar PV array, 
electric vehicle charging bays, and 
water reuse and recycling infrastructure 
to supply irrigation and bathroom 
amenities, the facility was realised 
through a collaboration with our 
partners Electrolux, JLL and Qanstruct.

Atlassian Central, Sydney

During the year we progressed our 
agreement with Atlassian to fund, 
develop and invest in their new 
headquarters in Sydney. Atlassian 
Central is an exciting example of the 
future of the workplace that is aligned 
with our purpose of creating spaces 
where people thrive. 

The development, spanning 
approximately 75,000 square metres 
of gross floor area (GFA), will comprise 
a market-leading sustainable 39-level 
office tower, with retail amenities and 
new YHA accommodation space 
at its base, as well as a new public 
realm around Central Station. The 
development is targeting leading 
sustainability outcomes, including: 

 – An ambitious goal to achieve  
50% reduction in embodied carbon 
for structure, superstructure and 
facades from the concept to delivery  
phases of the development

 – The project is targeting the 
highest energy efficiency industry 
benchmark

 – Operating via 100% renewable 
electricity

 – An all-electric design, with  
fuels removed from retail and 
commercial kitchens

The building is located adjacent to the 
Central Place Sydney development 
and within Sydney’s innovation and 
technology precinct. This is a State 
Government-led Technology hub and it 
sets a new global benchmark in modern 
workspace that values environmental 
and social impacts and outcomes.

Waterfront, Brisbane

The Waterfront Brisbane development 
will play a key role in the revitalisation 
of Eagle Street Pier and the 
transformation of the Waterfront 
Place precinct into Brisbane’s premium 
business and leisure destination. 

Harnessing leading-edge technology 
to minimise the environmental impact 
of the building has been central in the 
planning process. We are committed 
to the adoption of circular economy 
principles in the base building delivery 
and fit-out processes and will further 
apply these principles in managing 
waste in the precinct’s operation.

To achieve the precinct’s net zero 
aspirations, Waterfront Brisbane’s 
design will incorporate a number of 
initiatives which go beyond being net 
zero in operation, including:

 – Employing responsible construction 
management and environmental 
management procedures, including 
sustainable procurement, life 
cycle impacts optimisation, and 
minimisation of embodied carbon

 – Flood resilience initiatives to respond 
to the threat of rising sea levels and 
increasing catastrophic weather 
events

 – A passive-façade, electrified design 
that reduces energy use, and 
maximises on-site renewables to 
reduce grid-demand

 – Plans to divert over 80% of waste 
away from landfill by adopting a 
circular economy approach to  
waste management

Creating leading 
city precincts
Our city-shaping developments 
lift the benchmark for sustainable 
development across Australia’s  
major cities.

Progress against commitments

Progressed our commitment  
to create city-shaping precinct 
projects that improve the 
amenity and vibrancy of 
Australia’s CBDs 

We continued to progress planning on 
our city-shaping projects, including 
Central Place Sydney and Atlassian 
Central in Sydney, Waterfront Brisbane, 
60 Collins Street in Melbourne and 
Dexus Healthcare Property Fund’s 
Australian Bragg Centre in Adelaide.

Employee engagement 
Our approach to employee 
engagement recognises that high 
performance depends on fostering 
an inclusive and constructive culture, 
continuously improving the employee 
experience by listening to our people 
and supporting their wellbeing.

Progress against commitments

  Progressed our commitment  
to employee engagement.

In FY22, we implemented a new survey 
platform and engagement measures, 
which allow us to compare our internal 
results with external benchmarking. 
These results deliver our People and 
Culture teams real-time reporting, as 
well as better enable our leaders to 
implement remedial action plans in 
a timely manner. The average overall 
engagement score in the new platform 
in FY22 was 70%.

Sustaining connection with our people

Our employees remain proud to work 
for Dexus with an engagement result 
of 89% favourable, which was 4% higher 
than the Real Estate norm. 

To sustain connection with our employees 
through the ongoing lockdowns, a suite 
of engagement boosting activities and 
virtual social events were rolled out. 
These included, amongst other initiatives, 
hampers from the CEO and a virtual 
magic show attended by employees and 
their families or housemates. 

Employee engagement 

At Dexus, we value openness and  
trust across our workforce. 

We host monthly engagement sessions 
to provide employees the opportunity 
to engage with a member of the  
Group Management Committee (GMC) 
or the Board of Directors.  Each month  
a Director or GMC member invites 8-10 
employees to participate in an open 
forum discussion and to raise topics  
of interest. In FY22, 106 employees 
participated in a Director or 
GMC engagement sessions.

Diversity and inclusion 
Our approach to inclusion and 
diversity allows us to harness different 
perspectives for better decision 
making, as well as providing access 
to the widest pool of available 
talent. Our people identify with a 
variety of different cultural and ethnic 
backgrounds, and we aim to build 
a diverse workforce that reflects our 
customers and communities.

Progress against commitments

Progressed our commitment  
to achieve a 40% female,  
40% male, and 20% either/other 
representation (40:40:20 target) 
across senior and executive 
management roles by FY23. 

Dexus progressed towards its 40:40:20 
target with 36% female representation 
across senior and executive 
management roles at 30 June 2022. 
We are mindful that we have not 
met our target, and we continue to 
put in place strategies to increase 
female representation both within our 
organisation and across industry.

Achieved our commitment  
to maintain recognition as an 
Employer of Choice for Gender 
Equality. 

Dexus was awarded an Employer of 
Choice for Gender Equality citation by 
WGEA in FY22, recognising our active 
commitment and progress towards 
achieving gender equality in the 
workplace.

Achieved our commitment  
to maintain standing on AWEI in 
relation to LGBTI+ inclusion. 

Dexus was again recognised as a 
Bronze Employer by Pride in Diversity’s 
Australian Workplace Equality Index.

Key    Achieved    Progressed    Maintained

Other key achievements

Starting our reconciliation journey

In FY22, Dexus’s Reflect Reconciliation 
Action Plan (RAP) was endorsed 
by Reconciliation Australia. This 
is an important early step on our 
reconciliation journey with Australia’s 
First Nations peoples. In June 2022, 
Dexus launched Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander Cultural Awareness 
Training to all employees. 

Supporting the LGBTI community  
and fostering allies

Our TRIBE network has continued  
to build awareness and support for 
LGBTI+ inclusion in the workplace.  
3% of our people disclosed they 
identify as LGBTI+ and 88% identify 
as an LGBTI+ ally1. In March 2022, 130 
employees attended a webinar hosted 
by TRIBE which featured Ken Davis, a 
member of the ‘78ers – the participants 
in the first Sydney Gay and Lesbian 
Mardi Gras. The webinar focused on 
the historical challenges faced by the 
LGBTI+ community, progress made 
towards acceptance and the issues 
that still need to be addressed to 
enable a truly inclusive community. 

Inspiring the female leaders  
of tomorrow

We continue to play an active role in 
the Property Council of Australia NSW 
Girls in Property program. The program 
raises awareness among high school 
students to promote the career paths 
available in the property industry 
and encourages greater female 
participation. In June 2022, 35 students 
and their teachers attended a behind 
the scenes tour of 25 Martin Place, 
Sydney and the surrounding precinct. 
Here they heard from our all-female 
project leadership team about the 
challenges and opportunities that a 
career in the industry might present.

CASE STUDY 

Supporting future female 
leaders in property
Supporting our commitment 
to enhance gender diversity 
within the property sector, we 
progressed our Future Leaders 
in Property program, providing a 
pathway for the next generation 
of female property leaders. 

Launched in FY21, the 12 month 
program was designed in 
partnership with an organisation 
that creates programs for 
schools looking to inspire, 
challenge and shape career 
plans. 

In October 2021, Students 
visited Waterfront Place in 
Brisbane where they learnt the 
importance of placemaking 
in developing precincts. 
They gained insights into 
the planning of our city-
shaping project, Waterfront 
Brisbane. Taking into account 
sustainability, connectivity and 
cultural experiences as they 
participated in a project that 
designed a thriving city centre

This program received positive 
feedback achieving a +50 Net 
Promoter Score, and supporting 
the intent of the program, 
we employed a program 
participant in an intern role.

Thriving People



Professional 
Development 
Dexus provides a range of professional 
development opportunities to ensure 
that our people are equipped with 
the skills necessary to do their job 
and enable them to grow and further 
develop their talents.

Progress against commitments

Progressed our commitment  
to roll out mental health 
awareness training to all 
employees. 

As of 30 June 2022, 78% of People 
Managers had completed mental 
health training for leaders, while  
25% of the workforce had completed 
mental health training. Working with 
our community partner, the Black Dog 
Institute, a rollout of support tools such 
as meditation apps, interactive self-
care guides, toolkits, manager support 
kits as well as self-based e-learning will 
become available to all employees in 
August 2022.

Achieved our commitment  
to target a key talent retention 
rate of 90% or higher.

In FY22, our key talent retention rate 
was 100%. We continued to support 
the learning and development of our 
people through strong internal talent 
mobility, with one in four opportunities 
filled by internal candidates.

Progressed our commitment  
to roll out Lead @ Dexus to 
all people managers. 

At 30 June 2022, 92% of people 
managers have completed the 
training, as well as 45% of our fixed 
term and permanent employees. 
Training initiatives across the business, 
including Lead @ Dexus, continue to 
be impacted by COVID-19, with teams 
operating with limited capacity for 
training to cover reduced staffing 
in a challenging environment.

Key    Achieved    Progressed    Maintained

Other key achievements

Supporting our managers  
with practical tools

We recognise the impact a direct 
manager has on employee experience 
and engagement. To support our 
managers, we ran a Manage@Dexus 
program throughout FY22 comprising a 
series of one-hour interactive webinars. 

The program was designed to equip 
people managers with practical tools 
to evolve their management approach 
and create an environment for personal 
and professional performance. Topics 
included check-in coaching, managing 
difficult conversations, how to motivate 
and engage, manager impact, creating 
focus, direction and expectations, 
having career conversations, and 
coaching on development plans.

Retaining and rewarding  
great talent

Employee recognition, together with  
an engaging and meaningful employee 
experience is key to retaining great 
talent. 

We recognise the achievements and 
career milestones of our people in 
Quarterly Town Hall events, with awards 
granted to employees demonstrating 
our Values, supporting our Safety 
and ESG commitments, as well as 
celebration of tenure milestones. 

In September 2021, with the majority of 
employees in lockdown and a period of 
heightened business activity, the Board 
and Group Management Committee 
launched a series of activities to 
recognise everyone’s contribution and 
drive employee wellbeing. To cater 
for all ages and households, including 
parents working at home with young 
children, the series included virtual 
magicians, meditation and mental 
health webinars, as well as a gift 
hamper chosen by the employee. 

Employee Health  
and Wellbeing 
Dexus prioritises health and safety 
across its workplaces and supports the 
physical, mental, financial, and work 
wellbeing of its people.

Prioritising a safe  
work environment

In FY22, we achieved a safety audit 
score of 99.7% across our corporate 
and building management office 
workspaces, as well as Dexus Place 
workspaces. 

In an engagement survey conducted in 
February 2022, 90% of our people told 
us they feel their manager genuinely 
cares about their wellbeing (3% higher 
than the Real Estate 2021 norm). 

Supporting physical wellbeing

The provision of annual health 
programs helps keep our workforce 
focused on staying healthy. This 
year 37% of our workforce used the 
vouchers offered for complementary flu 
vaccinations, representing an increase 
of 12% on FY21.

Dexus again participated in the 
STEPtember challenge, which is 
Australia’s leading health and wellness 
fundraising event. Through STEPtember 
we encourage our employees to walk, 
swim, ride, wheel or spin their way 
to 10,000 steps per day during the 
month of September – for the benefit 
of children and adults who live with 
Cerebral Palsy. 539 employees and 
customers took part in the challenge 
who collectively took over 158 million 
steps and raised over $114,000.

CASE STUDY 

Dexus Family and Care Hub
The nature of the pandemic has merged home and work 
life more than ever before. Recognising the challenge this 
presented for many of our employees with families and young 
children, we partnered with leading expert, Parents at Work, 
to launch a new family and care hub. 

The Work+Family Hub provides our employees access to  
work and family education resources to support people  
as they prepare for leave, or to manage carer responsibilities.  
These include:

 – Interactive webinars, where people can 
connect with other parents and carers, to share 
experiences on balancing work and care

 – Expert advice from specialists on topics of interest 
including returning to work after taking parental 
or carers leave, achieving flexibility between 
home and work commitments, as well as cyber-
security information for parents of young adults

 – One-on-one coaching with a qualified, experienced 
Executive Coach. This coaching is designed 
to provide employees with the opportunity to 
confidentially discuss work and family plans, 
as well as career and wellbeing needs

To celebrate the launch of the Hub, a ‘Parents at Work’ 
webinar was hosted by our Chief Investment Officer, in 
discussion with Customer Experience Director from Parents at 
Work, Fiona Hitchener. The conversation included topics such 
as the role of planning, prioritisation and ‘keeping it human’ 
to help manage flexible working.

The Work+Family Hub is a welcome enhancement to  
our suite of employee wellbeing offers which includes: 

 – Physical health checks, vaccinations 
and health insurance benefits

 – Family and company social events, role flexibility,  
and study assistance 

 – Professional memberships, networking opportunities,  
and learning and development programs

 – Mental health assistance, parental programs and  
access to personal life coaching

 – Access to Dexus’s Employee Share Ownership 
Program, superannuation/financial advice services, 
recognition pool and recruitment referral programs

Supporting mental wellbeing 
Our partnership with the Black Dog 
Institute enables Dexus to drive 
awareness of mental health and 
wellbeing. In September 2021 as 
part of our R U OK Day awareness 
campaign, our Chief Operating Officer 
co-hosted a webinar with David 
Westgate, who is an ambassador 
for the Black Dog Institute. 

The webinar was attended by  
194 employees, informing them on:

 – The benefits Black Dog 
Institute provides within our 
communities that we operate

 – Challenges that come  
with living with mental illness

 – What the Black Dog 
Institute is doing to improve 
people’s mental health 

 – Noticing the signs of mental  
illness in yourself and others

 – Removing the stigma  
surrounding mental illness.

We will continue to partner with the 
Black Dog Institute throughout the year 
to promote mental health awareness 
and educate our people, with a view to 
expand engagement with our customer 
communities. 

A key priority in the year ahead will be 
to integrate the AMP Capital portfolio 
and people onto the Dexus platform. 

Our teams will be integral to the 
success of the integration. We are 
committed to supporting our people 
with a range of tools and initiatives to 
ensure the transition is inclusive and 
managed with care.

Enhancing employee benefits
Wellbeing allowance: We continue to 
reinforce the importance of investing 
in holistic wellbeing through providing 
a wellbeing allowance. This market-
differentiating employment benefit 
provides an additional $100 per month 
allowance for employees to invest in an 
activity or product that supports their 
wellbeing.

Parental leave: We increased our 
parental leave policy entitlements for 
primary and secondary carers to 16 and 
4 weeks respectively, with no tenure 
requirement and the policy allows leave 
to be taken in any continuous or non-
continuous format.

Supporting our people  
through pregnancy loss

Our partnership with Pink 
Elephants enables us to provides 
resources, information, and peer-
support for employees impacted 
by early pregnancy loss. 

Building on our partnership, a Dexus 
employee completed training to 
be a Peer Support Companion. 
The Peer Support Companion 
role provides informal support 
to Dexus employees who have 
experienced early pregnancy loss.

26  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Dexus’s capacity to create value 
depends on how well we support our 
customers’ success, the strength of our 
local communities and the capabilities 
of our suppliers.   

Our Future Enabled Customers 
and Strong Communities objective 
recognises the importance of listening 
to our customers, supporting the local 
communities where we operate, and 
extending the impact of our approach 
to ESG across our supply chain.

We understand how high-performing 
workspaces enhance employee 
productivity and wellbeing. We support 
our customers by listening to them and 
understanding their needs. We are 
harnessing leading technology and 
innovation to enable collaboration 
in hybrid and flexible working 
arrangements, living our purpose to 
create spaces where people thrive. 

The relationships we build with local 
communities are important as these 
communities visit our properties and 
deliver the activity and vibrancy that 
makes them leading destinations. We 
amplify our social impact through our 
community partnerships with the Black 
Dog Institute and Planet Ark, as well as 
many other significant organisations.   

Our success would not be possible 
without the support of our many 
suppliers. We work closely with our 
suppliers to achieve operational 
efficiencies, enhance customer 
experience, and extend our impact on 
key environmental and social issues. We 
prioritise worker health and safety, and 
assist our suppliers in managing risks 
in our supply chain, including modern 
slavery risks.  

Future enabled

We are partnering with Warren & Mahony 
Architects supported by Arup on a 
multi-client research study about hybrid 
collaboration, focused on optimising 
collaboration and interaction between 
people working in the office and remotely. 

We are conducting this research study

University of Queensland on the impact 
of remote working on recruitment and 
onboarding staff, and the University of 
Melbourne on a pilot to trial activity-
based working in the academic sector. 

Implementing leading  
workplace strategies 

We are working with CSIRO on the 
development and national rollout of 
its new hybrid workplace strategy. 
Implementing this new strategy will 
complement a pilot study within Dexus. 
Within this pilot study, we are exploring 
how hybrid working can benefit our 
people through greater flexibility and 
choice, and optimise our customer 
and business outcomes. Longer term, 
we are working with Atlassian on the

CASE STUDY 

Promoting health through 
customer education and 
services 

In FY22, Dexus worked closely 
with health experts to educate 
and share useful resources with 
our customers. In October 2021, 
we hosted a customer seminar 
with special guest, Professor Tony 
Cunningham (Co-director of the

access to leading spaces across 
our portfolio. Located at 309 Kent 
Street in Sydney, Genea offers a 
comprehensive range of assisted 
conception procedures, as well as 
genetic diagnosis and infertility 
counselling. To support their 
valuable work, we promoted a 
number of their webinars across our 
Sydney portfolio to connect them 
with interested customers.

Future Enabled Customers 



Social impact 

Dexus’s capacity to create value 
is influenced by the strength of its 
relationships with the communities 
in which it operates. With 4,466 
customers across our platform, 
and a transformative development 
pipeline, we are in a unique position to 
make a positive social impact in the 
communities in which we operate and 
contribute to important issues where we 
can make a difference.

Progress against commitments

Achieved our commitment  
of supporting the wellbeing 
of our people and customers 
through implementing initiatives 
aligned to our corporate 
partnership with the Black Dog 
Institute.

In FY22, we delivered customer 
education events to help our 
commercial customers gain awareness 
and support on mental health. We also 
offered an exclusive customer discount 
for future mental health training.

Achieved our commitment  
to influence the sustainability 
practices of our people 
and customers through 
implementing an engagement 
program with corporate partner 
Planet Ark.

In June 2022, we hosted a Planet Ark 
Circular Economy education session 
in Brisbane. The content from this 
presentation was shared across our 
platforms nationally. The session 
educated our customers on how their 
companies can reduce waste, and  
re-use materials.

Key    Achieved    Progressed    Maintained

Other key achievements

Amplifying our social impact through 
community partnerships

Over the year we contributed over 
$0.8 million financially and in-kind to 
communities across Australia through 
initiatives such as:

 – Black Dog Institute: Dexus staff 
raised $9,600 in our annual 
Christmas auction with Dexus 
matching this amount, resulting in 
$20,000 being donated.

 – Planet Ark: Each week properties 
across our portfolio auction the 
decorative flowers in our lobbies, 
rather than sending them to landfill, 
to raise money for our charity 
partners. 

 In FY22 we dedicated 145 weekly 
flower auctions across 24 properties 
to Planet Ark, raising over $7,500. 

 – Foodbank Australia: In total, Dexus 
customers and staff raised over 
a tonne of non-perishable items 
and $6,600 donations, equating to 
15,000 meals for people in need.

 – STEPtember: Over 570 customers 
and employees participated in the 
challenge, raising nearly $120,000 
for our charity partner – the 
Cerebral Palsy Alliance.

Encouraging our people to connect 
with and support community causes 

We ran volunteering campaigns in 
the quarter ending 30 June 2022 to 
encourage our people to support 
community causes that connect to our 
purpose. Our teams contributed their 
time to a variety of causes, including 
OzHarvest’s Cooking for a Cause and 
Cerebral Palsy Alliance’s Easter Show 
Buddy Day.  

We were excited to partner with 
Eat Up Australia whose mission is to 
feed hungry kids so they can grow, 
learn, and succeed. Our Sydney and 
Melbourne teams rolled up their sleeves 
and made almost 2,500 sandwiches for 
kids experiencing food insecurity across 
schools in NSW and Victoria. 

Measuring social value to  
improve transparency

We collaborated with industry peers 
and contributed to the development of 
a Collective Social Impact Framework 
by the Property Council of Australia’s 
Social Sustainability Committee. 
We look forward to identifying 
opportunities for us to trial the

CASE STUDY 

Cultural awareness 
Every day across Australia, 
thousands of people work, visit or 
shop in Dexus-managed buildings. 
As such, we believe we have 
a significant role in supporting 
reconciliation through the 
communities in which we operate. 
Implementing our Reconciliation 
Action Plan (RAP) is an important 
early step on our reconciliation 
journey with Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples. 

In FY22, the launch of a cultural 
awareness online training module 
during National Reconciliation 
Week was a key milestone in the 
implementation of our RAP. The 
training, designed in partnership 
with PwC Indigenous Consulting 
provides our people with an 
understanding of the diversity of 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples across Australia and 
what they can do to support our 
commitment to reconciliation within 
their role.

Progressing our 
Reflect Reconciliation 
Action Plan 
Reconciliation means working together 
to strengthen relationships between 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples and non-indigenous peoples 
to foster respect, trust and equality 
while acknowledging our shared 
histories. 

Progress against commitments

Progressed our commitment to 
advance Dexus’s reconciliation 
efforts with First Nations peoples 
through implementing the 
Reflect Reconciliation Action 
Plan. 

Dexus’s RAP is endorsed by 
Reconciliation Australia. In FY22 we 
commenced the roll out of cultural 
awareness training.

Recognising the Traditional Owners  
of the land within our portfolio

To support our understanding and 
respect for local first nations cultures, 
we have commenced a mapping 
exercise of the traditional lands and 
custodians in areas in which we 
operate across Australia. In FY23, we 
will continue mapping our portfolio 
and engage with local Elders and 
Traditional Owners to confirm that our 
mapping is accurate.

Engaging our suppliers 
on modern slavery risk

We understand the importance 
of managing modern slavery 
risk across our operations and 
supply chain, and welcome the 
increased interest from investors, 
customers and suppliers on how 
we are addressing these risks.

Dexus seeks to build long-term 
relationships with its suppliers, 
identifying partners that present strong 
alignment of interests and enthusiasm 
for contributing to the objectives of our 
Sustainability Approach.

Dexus conducts an Annual Supplier 
Survey to gather feedback on our 
working relationships, measure supplier 
alignment on ESG management 
approaches, in support of our 
Sustainability Approach objectives, and 
to support them to extend our these 
objectives down the supply chain. 

The results of this survey indicated that: 

 – 57% of suppliers who participated 
have a RAP in place or plan to 
introduce one within 12 months

 – 37% of respondents who 
participated said they have a 
gender diversity target or program 
in place

 – 10% of suppliers who responded 
participate in voluntary 
sustainability certification  

Supplier engagement

Every year, we depend on our large 
network of suppliers to progress our 
development pipeline and manage 
our properties efficiently. This includes 
providing cleaning, maintenance or 
security services at our properties, or 
through partnerships with suppliers to 
deliver elements of our customer offer, 
such as wellbeing service providers. 

Supplier engagement  
on modern slavery risk

Since the commencement of the 
Modern Slavery Act 2018, our approach 
to collaborating with our suppliers 
recognises that our supply chain is an 
extension of our business and forms 
part of our social license to operate. 

We have publicly lodged our 2021 
Modern Slavery Statement with the 
Australian Government, which is also 
available at www.dexus.com. 

Our 2022 Modern Slavery Statement 
will be lodged and made available in 
December 2022.

Our Anti-Modern Slavery Working 
Group is responsible for promoting 
a culture of best practice and 
continuous improvement as well as the 
development and oversight of strategy 
and operational initiatives relating to 
modern slavery. During the year, the 
group oversaw a number of activities 
across each dimension of our modern 
slavery management framework.

Progress against commitments

Achieved our commitment  
to require our design consultants 
to consider modern slavery in the 
supply chain of materials and 
products they specify to be used 
in development projects, and 
advocate for industry change by 
encouraging peers to adopt the 
same approach. 

In FY22, we updated our design 
consultancy agreements to require 
design consultants to conduct 
appropriate due diligence on materials 
to ensure the materials are not linked to 
modern slavery or other human rights 
abuses. Additionally, our consultants will 
be required to provide evidence of this 
due diligence being conducted.

Key    Achieved    Progressed    Maintained

Other key achievements
This year, we engaged with two of our 
joint venture partners to enhance our 
approach to managing modern slavery 
risks. As a result, Dexus is preparing 
for a pilot Cleaning Accountability 
Framework audit at one of our office 
properties. This audit will help identify 
improvements and opportunities to 
partner with our cleaning suppliers.

Influencing our  
supply chain 

Our capacity to create value depends 
on strong working relationships with 
capable suppliers of products and 
services. Our supply chain also extends 
our economic impact, through our 
procurement spend and associated job 
creation.

Progress against commitments

Progressed our commitment  
to conduct assessments on key  
Tier 2 services suppliers. 

We initiated an annual supplier code of 
conduct attestation process to assist 
us in identifying Tier 2 suppliers. This 
resulted in 15 subcontractors being 
invited to respond to the Property 
Council of Australia’s modern slavery 
due diligence questionnaire. 

Progressed our commitment  
to extend our supply chain 
mapping to other geographies 
beyond Australia. 

We engaged EcoVadis to conduct ESG 
audits on our supply chain. Suppliers 
will be audited annually until they 
achieve an EcoVadis benchmark score 
that is acceptable to Dexus. Once this 
benchmark score has been attained, 
we will extend the audit frequency to 
once every three years. The tool will 
allow us to extend our supply chain 
mapping beyond Australia.

Key    Achieved    Progressed    Maintained

Other key achievements

KPMG completed an independent 
review of our two key suppliers. 
While no modern slavery issues were 
identified, the audit highlighted that 
suppliers reviewed could enhance their 
internal processes and policies. Further 
information will be disclosed in our 
annual modern slavery statement to  
be released in December 2022.

COMMITMENTS

→ Implement EcoVadis supplier 
verification across preferred 
suppliers in FY23, targeting 
coverage of 80% of preferred 
supplier spend engaged on 
the platform by FY24

Achieved net zero emissions for 
building operations across the  
group managed portfolio

34  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



We are continuing to build an efficient 
and resilient portfolio that minimises 
impact on the environment and will 
thrive in a climate–affected future.

We want to leave a positive legacy 
by rethinking how we use and value 
natural resources. We actively manage 
energy, water and waste through 
building optimisation, and through 
customer engagement and awareness 
programs. By pursuing initiatives that 
help us consume less and source more 
sustainably, we better service our 
people, customers, and planet. 

Our commitment to achieve net zero 
across operational emissions is a key 
step on our sustainability journey. 
The floods that impacted New South 
Wales and Queensland in 2022 further 
highlighted the material risk to people, 
communities and property that climate 
change presents, as well as the growing 
financial risk to the economy. 

We recognise the importance of 
building resilience to climate change 
across our business and portfolio 
and are subsequently embedding 
climate resilience into our property 
management practices. 

Embedding climate resilience into our 
practices will maximise customer and 
occupant wellbeing, maintain reliable 
and continuous building operations 
and prepare our communities for the 
future. 

Enriched 
Environment
Our buildings and future developments will 
shape our environments and landscapes for 
decades to come, so we have a responsibility 
to act now.

Enriched Environment



This achievement delivers strong 
climate action for the planet, enhances 
our vision for smart, sustainable 
workspaces, and is being certified by 
the internationally recognised Science 
Based Targets initiative as aligned with 
a ’below 1.5°C global warming’ future.

Our pathway to net zero comprises:

1. Reducing carbon emissions through 
energy efficiency

2. Transitioning to 100% renewable 
electricity from base building 
operations from July 2021 in the 
form of Large-scale Generation 
Certificates (LGCs) or Green Power. 
In FY22 we sourced over 115,000 
MWh of renewable electricity 
from renewable electricity supply 
agreements in Victoria, Queensland 
and New South Wales, and via 
GreenPower purchases in Western 
Australia. 

3. Continuing to invest in certified, 
nature-based carbon offsets 
for our remaining emissions to 
account for emissions from natural 
gas, wastewater, refrigerants, as 
well as waste and recycling. In 
FY22 we balanced approximately 
24,000 tonnes of emissions through 
certified carbon units. 

4. Verifying we are net zero and 
maintaining this status through 
Australia’s Climate Active carbon 
neutral program. We have 
undertaken limited assurance for 
our net zero achievement and 
Climate Active certification is 
underway.

Key   Achieved   Progressed   Maintained

Achieving net zero
Delivering net zero emissions across 
our managed property operations is a 
key milestone for Dexus and reinforces 
our commitment to act on climate 
change. Achieving net zero also aligns 
with changing customer and investor 
sentiment for low-carbon investments.

Progress against commitments

Achieved our commitment of net 
zero emissions across the group-
managed portfolio by 30 June 2022.

Since FY08 we have been working 
to continuously improve the group 
portfolio’s energy efficiency and 
associated emissions through our 
building operations, transactions and 
developments. As at FY22, we have 
reduced emissions intensity by 62%. Of 
the remaining emissions, around 81% 
has been avoided by transitioning to 
renewable electricity and 19% has been 
balanced through carbon offsets.

Beyond Net Zero – Influencing our value chain 
Approach to managing emissions 
moving forward

Our developments will have a 
long-lasting footprint for decades 
to come. In addition to striving to 
meet our ambitious sustainability 
commitments, we also supported 
customers with their own emissions 
journey and seek ways to play a role in 
decarbonising our entire value chain.

We do this through leveraging insights 
and solutions towards smarter 
workspace solutions, working with 
customers and suppliers on low 
carbon fit outs, or sourcing renewable 
electricity, we can play an important 
role in the whole of economy transition 
to net zero. We are already working 
with our customers and suppliers 
to achieve these collective goals.

The Waterfront Brisbane development 
team has been actively engaging with 
local suppliers, services providers, and 
specialists to create one of the most 
sustainable developments in Brisbane. 

In collaboration with our value 
chain partners we have sought to 
understand and incorporate:

 – Low embodied carbon  
materials in construction

 – Circular economy principles in 
construction and operations

 – Use of the Green Star rating 
framework to develop solutions to 
go beyond net zero

The recently completed development 
at the Herston Car Park opposite the 
Royal Brisbane Hospital is a exemplar 
for us to demonstrate beyond net zero. 

The carpark utilised is ample 
roof space to installed a 99kW 
solar PV system and ten Tesla 
Powerwall-2 batteries.

The solar PV system is designed to 
have sufficient capacity to charge 
the batteries for both night-time 
use and powering daytime energy 
demands. It is anticipated that 
this will enable the carpark to 
achieve emission-free operations 
and be future ready to support 
the transition to electric vehicles.

Other key achievements

Climate Active certification

We are working towards achieving 
certification under the Climate Active 
Carbon Neutral standard across the 
portfolio. 5 Martin Place, Sydney and 
145 Ann Street, Brisbane became 
the first two buildings in our office 
portfolio to be certified carbon neutral. 
Additional buildings will be rated 
post-July 2022 once they have a full 
12-month record of renewable energy 
purchasing. 

Dexus Industria REIT (DXI) also achieved 
certification with the Climate Active 
Carbon Neutral Standard for both its 
corporate activities and the emissions 
associated with the properties under 
its operational control. DXI is one of 
the first A-REITs to be certified carbon 
neutral across both its portfolio and 
managed operations.

Supporting our partners on  
their net zero journeys

As a member of The Australian Climate 
Leaders Coalition (CLC), we are 
collaborating with value chain partners 
on a number of cross-sector initiatives 
to influence the reduction of Scope 
3 emissions in relation to the built 
environment. We are currently working 
with four CLC Members, to develop a 
proof of concept to reduce Scope 3 
Emissions. This project is focused on 
how the business, in partnership with 
our customers, can collaboratively 
reduce Scope 3 emissions, at two sites 
- Dexus Healthcare Property Fund’s, 
North Shore Health Hub, St Leonards, 
and Waterfront Brisbane.  

Approach to 
managing emissions 
moving forward
While it is important to celebrate the 
net zero milestone, this is by no means 
the end of our journey. Our pathway 
has been designed for ongoing net zero 
emissions across our group managed 
portfolio’s building operations over the 
long term. 

However, our portfolio is evolving. 
Our priorities in the year ahead 
include integrating the AMP Capital 
portfolio. As this and other new funds 
and mandates are welcomed to the 
platform, we commit to working with 
our investment partners to align to our 
commitment to net zero. 

Resource efficiency
Energy efficiency at the asset level 
remains critical to driving long-term 
value as savings in energy and water 
consumption contribute to lower 
occupancy costs as well as reduce 
environmental impacts.

Progress against commitments

Progressed our commitment 
to reduce energy intensity by 
10% across the managed office 
portfolio by FY25 against a 2019 
baseline 

In FY22 we achieved an 15.0% energy 
intensity reduction. COVID-19 related 
government mandates impacted 
the level of physical occupancy of 
our buildings and contributed to this 
reduction. We expect FY23 to result 
in higher physical occupancy and an 
increase in base building energy use 
as workers return to the office requiring 
greater building operational needs. 

Progressed our commitment 
to reduce water intensity by 
10% across the managed office 
portfolio by FY25 against a 2019 
baseline

We achieved a 49.9% water intensity 
reduction. Similarly, we expect FY23 to 
result in an increase in water use due 
to higher physical occupancy post 
the end of COVID-19 lockdowns as 
customers return to the office  
and CBD.

Other key achievements 
Updated method for measuring 
refrigerant-related emissions 

Refrigerant leakage can be a key 
contributor to direct emissions, 
especially when conservatively 
estimated using default leakage rates. 
During the year Dexus transitioned to 
a more accurate accounting method 
for refrigerant leakage, utilising 
equipment service records that record 
actual refrigerant losses measured by 
equipment top ups. This has helped 
lower Scope 1 emissions by around 80%, 
are reduced the number of carbon 
offsets required to achieve net zero 
emissions.

Enriched Environment



Renewable energy
Transitioning to 100% renewable 
electricity is at the heart of our net zero 
plan.

Achieved our commitment  
to source at least 70% of 
electricity from on-site and  
off-site renewable sources 
across the group’s managed 
portfolio by FY25 

This year we transitioned to sourcing 
100% renewable electricity, resulting 
in over 117 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of 
electricity sourced from either on-
site solar PV systems or off-site via 
established renewable electricity 
agreements and GreenPower 
purchases. 

In FY22, Dexus re-tendered electricity 
for its Western Australian portfolio, 
securing a renewable electricity 
supply agreement with Synergy for 
the next three years with generation 
being sourced from the Warradarge 
Wind Farm - a local WA GreenPower-
accredited power station.

Key   Achieved   Progressed   Maintained

Other key achievements 

Supporting our customers to  
increase renewable energy uptake

A key pillar of our approach to achieve 
net-zero is the installation and use 
of onsite renewable energy. Kings 
Square 2 in Perth is an A-grade office 
building with almost 20,000 square 
metres of floor space occupied by Shell 
Australia. 

In April 2022, Dexus partnered with 
Shell Energy installed a 99.9 kW solar 
PV array at the property, which is 
expected to generate almost 143 
megawatt hours (MWh) of emission-
free electricity annually, reducing the 
reliance on grid-sourced electricity at 
the property by almost 18% per annum. 
The electricity generated will also 
positively contribute to the building’s 
decarbonisation efforts by eliminating 
over 97 tonnes of emissions annually.

This collaboration between Dexus 
and Shell Energy at Kings Square 2 
demonstrates the positive impact 
that can be made through seeking 
opportunities to increase renewable 
energy generation, enabling Dexus to 
achieve its sustainability goals while 
supporting our customers to meet their 
own decarbonisation goals. We will 
continue to partner with Shell Energy to 
expand rooftop solar across the group’s 
industrial portfolio and support our 
customers to increase renewable energy 
uptake and reduce carbon emissions.

Dexus Industrial REIT  
continues to invest in solar

Over the past four years, Dexus Industria 
REIT’s investments in 2.5 megawatts 
of onsite solar installations has saved 
approximately 2.4 million kilograms 
of carbon dioxide emissions from 
being released into the atmosphere, 
exceeding the emissions attributable to 
the portfolio under the Climate Active 
standard.

Waste Management
We aim to incorporate circular 
economy principles into our waste 
management approach to maximise 
the productivity of resources and 
reduce environmental impact.

Progress against commitments

Progressed our commitment 
to achieve an average 4-star 
NABERS waste rating by FY25 
across the group office portfolio. 

We improved our rating to 3.0 stars 
across 70% of the portfolio as at 
30 June 2022. As of 30 June 2022, 
the managed-portfolio includes 
five properties that are meeting or 
exceeding the group’s FY25 4-star 
NABERS Waste target.

Key   Achieved   Progressed   Maintained

Other key achievements 
Engaging our customers to improve 
waste recycling at 175 Pitt Street, 
Sydney 

Optimising waste management 
practices with the support of our 
customers is an important step towards 
decarbonising building operations. In 
2020, 175 Pitt Street, Sydney recorded 
a below average recycling rate of 
7% and a NABERS Waste rating of 
1 star. To address this, the Property 
Management and Facility Management 
teams collaborated with customers 
and site cleaning staff to implement 
a high-visibility awareness campaign 
on correct waste disposal sorting 
practices. 

175 Pitt Street in Sydney also 
established a ‘Green Team’ led by the 
Property Management team to focus 
on continued engagement efforts. As a 
result, during the past year the waste 
recycling rate increased from 7% to 
34%, lifting the NABERS Waste rating to 
3-Star. Ongoing plans are in place to 
help achieve the 4-Star NABERS Waste 
Target.

Promoting circular economy in 
partnership with Planet Ark

Our partnership with Planet Ark enables 
us to educate and engage our people 
and customers on environmental 
sustainability, empowering them to 
make positive change.

In June 2022, Planet Ark hosted an 
event for our Brisbane customers on 
understanding the value of materials 
and leveraging the circular economy 
through its Australian Circular 
Economy Hub program. The workshop 
educated business leaders on how 
their companies can reduce waste, 
re-use materials, leverage renewable 
energy, and how an innovative model 
for rethinking our approach to products 
and services can result in better 
environmental outcomes.

38  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Embracing the circular economy at QV 
Melbourne 

In partnership with Sustainability 
Victoria and a circular economy 
consultant, Dexus led a collaborative 
project to measure and map how 
materials flow through the QV mixed-
use precinct with the intention of 
improving the circularity of these 
material flows. A workshop in February 
2022 involving Centre Management, 
QV retailers and cleaning service 
providers reviewed the findings of a 
precinct waste audit and the identified 
opportunities to transition from a 
single-use and disposal pathway 
towards higher value outcomes and a 
re-use mindset. The workshop directed 
focus on organic food waste and 
metals with a series of initiatives that, 
with the support of the QV customer 
community, can eliminate up to 50% 
of the total waste generated at QV 
Melbourne. 

QV management team explored a 
range of products and services to 
be considered for implementation, 
including food waste conversion (by 
live organisms) to high-quality animal 
feed and organic fertilizer, mobile app 
solutions aiming to reduce surplus food 
going to waste by linking to customers 
and charities, and reuse of food 
containers to reduce single use plastics. 
A retailer engagement campaign took 
place to explain the program and has 
been positively received by QV retailers. 

Indoor environment
We continue to drive improvements 
in building performance and 
measurement to enhance human 
health and wellbeing.

Progress against commitments

Progressed our commitment 
to deliver an average 5-star 
NABERS Indoor Environment 
rating across the group office 
portfolio by FY25, delivering 
initiatives to enhance occupant 
health and wellbeing

In FY22, we rated several buildings for 
the first time, improving performance 
to 4.9 stars, measured across 70% 
of our portfolio. Recently acquired 
portfolios which have previously not 
been rated under NABERS Indoor 
Environment, providing further 
opportunity to expand the program  
in FY23.

Key   Achieved   Progressed   Maintained

Other key achievements 
Active air filtration 

The importance of air quality in our 
buildings continues to remain a focus 
area for Dexus. Air filters provide an 
important first line of defence to filter 
fresh air entering the building and a 
passive indoor air quality control for 
our buildings. In FY22 we continued 
to progress our air conditioning filter 
upgrade program, which involves the 
installation of F7 grade air filters or 
higher.

The Building Technology team 
conducted comprehensive research 
and validation to examine other 
technologies that are on the market 
to enhance indoor air quality. In FY22 
we trialled an air filtration system using 
Bipolar Ionisation (BPI) technology 
at One Margaret Street, Sydney 
to enhance the indoor air quality. 
Air quality and hygiene specialists, 
and independent scientists were 
engaged to conduct the onsite testing 
and validate the results. The trial 
successfully demonstrated that the BPI 
technology improves air quality without 
impacting energy efficiency.

CASE STUDY 

Optimising air quality for a healthy workplace
Healthy workplaces are an essential component of 
occupant wellbeing and productivity. Improving the 
health of the indoor environment within our locations 
supports our social and environmental sustainability 
commitments to our customers and enhances their 
experience within our workspace.  

This year, we conducted testing and audits on several 
Dexus sites against our healthy building metrics. At 
one tested location – 480 Queen Street in Brisbane 
– we identified opportunities to improve air quality 
performance. 

These included increasing the frequency of 
comprehensive cleaning for all air conditioning units, 
upgrading CO2 sensors throughout the building to 
improve air exchange visibility, as well as upgrading 
the air filtration medium to F7 grade filters (above 
Australian standards) and increasing the frequency in the 
replacement of these filters.

As a result, we saw significant improvements in all key 
areas of our testing criteria. These improvements are 
reflected in our recent NABERS Indoor Environment 
rating performance, achieving 5.5 Stars in FY22.

To further align our healthy buildings 
initiatives with international best 
practice, we are advancing the WELL 
and Safety certification process across 
our portfolio. 

Health and wellbeing remains a priority 
across office development projects 
through designs that will incorporate 
WELL design features. 

A holistic suite of health and wellness 
measures that are being adopted 
within the design of precincts including 
Waterfront Brisbane include:

 – Air conditioning systems designed 
for optimum air filtration and 
thermal comfort

 – Ventilation designed to improve 
indoor air quality in the building 

 – Effective exhaust systems to 
eliminate indoor pollutants

 – Architectural and mechanical 
design to improve acoustic comfort 
conditions

 – High-colour rendering, glare 
reducing lighting compliant with 
best practice general illuminance 
standards

 – Solar glare controls and good 
access to daylight and views

 – Low VOC and low formaldehyde 
materials 

Waterfront Brisbane also features 
bicycle parking amenities accessible 
from the ground plane, adjoining a 
proposed widening of the Riverwalk, 
which encourages active transport, 
a safe and enjoyable experience for 
pedestrians and cyclists.

Biodiversity
We aim to deliver a positive impact 
on biodiversity through enhancing 
and managing biodiversity outcomes 
across properties that we develop and 
operate.

Protecting nature and enhancing 
biodiversity at Horizon 3023 Ravenhall

The Horizon 3023 industrial precinct 
at Ravenhall, Victoria incorporates 
a 32-hectare biodiversity reserve 
featuring high-quality grasslands and 
habitats for endangered fauna, such as 
the Striped Legless Lizard. In FY22 we 
continued our efforts to enhance the 
biodiversity value of the reserve by:

 – Carrying out land management 
such as the removal of noxious 
grasses and weeds, which if 
untreated, can outcompete the 
high-value grasslands

 – Land rehabilitation including 
removal of debris and materials 
that were infested with pests 
and relocation of grazing horses. 
These activities improved the 
establishment of the vegetation 
and native flora and fauna 

 – Conducting control burn off 
to reduce hazardous biomass 
accumulation that impacts the 
regrowth of the native Wallaby 
Grass and other vegetation

Evidence of increased numbers of 
species including the Striped Legless 
Lizard, Eastern Blue Tongue Lizard, 
Little Whip Snakes and Tiger Snakes 
have been observed. It is hoped these 
ongoing efforts, as part of the ten-
year management plan of the site, will 
continue to facilitate and support the 
regeneration of natural ecosystems 
and contribute to a positive biodiversity 
outcome.

Seeking biodiversity co-benefits 
through carbon offset projects

In addition to our direct initiatives, 
we supported local and international 
carbon projects that deliver biodiversity 
co-benefits. In line with our purchasing 
criteria, currently we direct over half 
our investment towards Australian-
based projects and over 50% of offsets 
retired are derived from ‘nature-based’ 
land care activities including forest 
preservation, reforestation and habitat 
regeneration, and tree planting. 

Building certifications
Building certifications are an important 
tool for us to integrate leading practice 
into our developments and operation, 
to benchmark property performance, 
and to confirm our standing in the 
market.

Green Star

We retained our existing portfolio Green 
Star Performance certification and in 
FY23 we are expanding coverage to 
87 properties, including office, retail, 
industrial and healthcare assets. We 
expect the portfolio performance will 
be maintained with some uplift on a 
number of properties due to building 
performance enhancements.

North Shore Health Hub, St Leonards 
in NSW was awarded a 6 Star Green 
Star Design & As Built v1.2 certified 
rating, representing world leadership 
in environmentally sustainable building 
practices, and exceeding its 5 Star 
target. Underpinned by our healthcare 
fund’s Clean Energy Policy, the North 
Shore Health Hub adopts design 
elements that enhance operational 
efficiency, including the installation of a 
160 kilowatt (kW) solar system to offset 
the facility’s carbon emissions.

At  Horizon 3023, Ravenhall, a custom-
built facility for Electrolux achieved 
6 Star Green Star Design & As Built 
certification. This result was achieved 
by a collaborative design process along 
side our customer.

40  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Some of the key features that are 
attributed to the 6 Star Green Star 
certification include:

 – A 200kW solar PV system, enabling 
the tenant to reduce their carbon 
footprint and support their journey 
to achieve climate neutrality  
by 2030

 – Water harvesting to use rainwater in 
irrigation and bathroom amenities

 – Acoustic noise reduction in office 
and showroom for worker comfort 

 – Glare reduction applied to office 
and showroom for worker comfort 

 – A life-cycle approach to equipment 
and material selections

 – Sustainable materials used 
throughout the build

 – Dedicated parking and charging  
for electric vehicles

NABERS

Dexus has a well-established NABERS 
program to benchmark energy and 
water performance nationally, using a 
rating scale from 1 to 6 stars. 

In FY22, the office portfolio NABERS 
Energy and Water ratings remained 
stable at 5.0 stars, with physical 
occupancy impacted by the COVID-19 
lockdowns and a shift to hybrid 
working across some of our customers’ 
workforces. 

The portfolio average NABERS Energy 
rating for office (with GreenPower) 
increased from 5.1 stars to 5.3 stars, with 
an increase in renewable electricity 
purchasing aligned with our net zero 
emissions commitment. The portfolio 
NABERS Water average increased from 
4.5 stars to 4.7 stars. 

The office portfolio NABERS Energy and 
Water averages remained elevated due 
to the impacts of low occupancy driven 
by the lockdowns, with property teams 
proactively controlling building systems 
to minimise unnecessary energy and 
water use. 

Key highlights from the office  
portfolio include:

 – Improved energy ratings at  
321 Kent Street and 33 Alfred Street 
in Sydney from 5.0 stars to 5.5 stars 

 – Recorded NABERS Water 
improvements across 20 assets 
including 309 Kent Street (5.5 stars), 
56 Pitt Street (4.0 stars), and 33 
Alfred Street (4.5 stars) in Sydney 
each recording 1-star improvements 

 – An inaugural rating for the 
completed South Tower at 80 
Collins Street, Melbourne, achieving 
a 4.5 star NABERS Energy and a  
5.5 star NABERS Water ratings

Enriched Environment



Waterfront Brisbane

Waterfront Brisbane has considered exposure 
to future climate risks including predicted 
rising sea levels and higher ambient 
temperatures. Resilience measures have been 
embedded in the development process, 
including: 

 – Flood resilience initiatives such as flood 
gates and reduced stormwater discharge 
to respond to the threat of rising sea 
levels and increasing catastrophic 
weather events

 – Climate responsive design to passively 
reduce energy use and assist renewables 
in meeting demand

 – All-electric base building services, with 
photovoltaic systems maximised in 
suitable areas, and a commitment to be 
carbon neutral in operation

Climate Resilience
We remain committed to reducing 
our climate impact by lowering 
emissions, adapting to climate-
related risk by enhancing portfolio 
resilience, and influencing our value 
chain to collaboratively tackle the 
emerging climate challenges.

Conducting site-specific  
climate risk assessments 

We identified 11 assets for site 
specific risk assessments to identify 
risks to our assets for the short 
and long term, how these risks are 
currently managed, and implement 
specific actions to address them. 
We shared learnings with the due 
diligence team and others to inform 
adaptation planning and resilience. 
From these site-specific climate risk 
assessments, we identified several 
key possible actions: 

 – Investing in ventilation 
maintenance and upgrades due 
to increased temperatures and 
frequency of heatwaves

 – Investing in roof and façade 
design improvements to mitigate 
heat, hail, and flood impacts

 – Introducing energy security 
measures, including for Dexus-
owned generators, to mitigate 
against storm or heat-related 
power failures

 – Engaging with local authorities 
to understand local mitigation 
strategies for fire and landslide 
risks and increase structural 
checks due to impacts from 
flooding and heatwaves

Designing resilient properties 

Managing and adapting to the 
physical risks of climate change 
over the long-term has been an 
important consideration for the 
buildings in our development 
pipeline.

Horizon 3023, Ravenhall

We have partnered with customers to 
integrate high performance and resilience 
through:

 – High-efficiency lighting solutions that pair 
natural light harvesting via translucent 
roof panels together with LED fixtures with 
daylight control

 – Rooftop solar PV arrays included as 
standard to provide renewable electricity 
for powering equipment such as electric 
forklifts

 – Water management measures including 
efficient fixtures, fittings and rainwater 
harvesting for irrigation of drought-
tolerant landscaping

Atlassian Central, Sydney

We are partnering with Atlassian on their 
visionary headquarters in Sydney, comprising 
a 39-storey hybrid timber office tower 
within Sydney’s Tech Central precinct. 
This development is targeting a range of 
ambitious sustainability goals, including:

 – 50% reduction in embodied carbon by 
embracing highly engineered timber 
products that offers significant weight 
reduction advantages over a traditional 
concrete and steel approach. This 
will be paired with material sourcing 
of low carbon products for structure, 
superstructure and facades for the ‘cradle 
to gate’ phases of the development

 – Operating using 100% renewable 
electricity

 – All-electric design, with fossil fuels also 
removed from retail and commercial 
kitchens

1. From FY18, Dexus separated reporting of permanent and fixed-term employees. 
2. Corporate contractors, agency temps or consultants that performed work on a time and materials basis (e.g. a project with a defined beginning and 

end date). A ‘corporate contractor’ is an individual contracted by Dexus to perform work prescribed by Dexus, usually at a Dexus corporate office 
location. Corporate contractors generally cannot be replaced with a new individual performing the same work, without terminating the existing 
contract and creating a new contract for the new individual. Using terminology within the reporting standard GRI 403: Occupational Health and 
Safety 2018, corporate contractors are characterised by Dexus having both control of work and control of the workplace. Note the distinction with 
‘site-based contractor’ as defined on page 56.

1. Engagement information is sourced directly from internal employee engagement surveys administered during the year (our Employee Listening 
Strategy is detailed on page 111). The figures reported above are an average of employee surveys administered during the reporting period.  

2. In FY19, Dexus began delivering employee engagement surveys at least twice annually, instead of a larger survey once every two years. Engagement 
scores reported in FY19 are thus not directly comparable to previous years and should not be considered indicative of a trend.  

3. In FY22, Dexus began measuring engagement on a new platform, Culture Amp. The FY22 engagement score is the aggregated measure of five 
questions, rather than three questions in previous years. The engagement score reported in FY22 are thus not directly comparable to previous years 
and should not be considered indicative of a trend.  

4. The Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) reported for FY22 is the score for October 2021 only. ENPS is based on a scale of -100 to +100.  
5. The number of flexible work arrangements reported include formal agreements where employees have indicated that they work part-time, work 

remotely or flexibly according to an agreed schedule, job share, receive extended leave without pay for a period greater than one month, or 
purchase additional annual leave. The reported figures do not include informal flexible and hybrid work arrangements where employees work 
remotely or vary their hours of work on an ad hoc basis. All employees are eligible for informal flexible work arrangements and agree such 
arrangements with their managers as required. 

6. The number of flexible/hybrid working arrangements reported includes employees accessing ad-hoc flexibility, usually while still maintaining their 
normal workload.

1. Prior to FY19, Dexus reported on gender diversity in senior management based on FTE. From FY19, Dexus reports on gender diversity across a broader 
range of management levels based on headcount and will no longer provide reporting on gender diversity using FTE. The use of headcount is 
consistent with the standards used by the Australian Government Workplace Gender Equality Agency and with other diversity metrics reported by 
Dexus. 

2. FY22 data on gender diversity in senior management has been independently assured. 

Commentary and methodology 
All people data is taken from each year’s headcount report as at 30 June, produced by Dexus People and Culture. 

‘Senior management’ includes executive management and senior management positions within the Dexus workforce. 
Executive management and senior management positions include Dexus employees whose role is mapped to one of the 
following four occupational categories: ‘CEO/head of business’, ‘KMP (key management personnel)’, ‘other executives/general 
managers’, and ‘senior managers’, as outlined within worker classification guidance Standardised occupational categories of 
managers: February 2018 published by the Australian Government’s Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). 

‘Non-Executive Directors’ are independent directors of DXFM and does not include the CEO who is counted in the senior 
management team for the purposes of workforce reporting.

Term Description 

Fatalities Fatalities that occur as a result of an injury or disease occurrence. 

Lost day rate (LDR) The number of days lost to injuries/diseases for each one million hours worked is calculated as 
follows: 

days lost due to injuries/diseases 
LDR =                                                                                     ×1,000,000

Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rate (LTIFR) 

The number of occurrences of injury or disease for each one million hours worked is calculated as 
follows: 

number of lost time injuries/diseases 
LTIFR =                                                                                    ×1,000,000 

number of hours worked 

Lost Time Injury Incidence 
Rate (LTIIR) 

The number of occurrences of injury/disease for each one hundred full time equivalent employees is 
calculated as follows: 

number of lost time injuries/diseases 
LTIIR =                                                                                    ×100 

number of full-time equivalent employees 

Lost-time injuries/diseases Those occurrences that resulted in a fatality, permanent disability or time lost from work of one 
day/shift or more and if the incident relates to a Dexus employee, is recorded via a WorkCover 
claim. 

No lost-time 
injuries/diseases 

A work-related injury or disease (including a permanent disability or a fatality) that results in one or 
more days absent from work (not including the day of injury) and is supported by a workers 
compensation certificate. 

Number of Dexus employee 
hours worked in the period 

Refers to the total scheduled number of hours worked by all Dexus employees as recorded at 
30 June of each year. Dexus offers employees flexible work arrangements and staff are employed 
under individual contracts that stipulate 38 hours per week for each full-time employee. As Dexus 
does not track employee working hours and staff do not engage in overtime or shift work, Dexus has 
defined the ‘number of hours worked’ as 1,824 hours per annum (equal to 240 days x 7.6 hours) per 
full- time employee. 

Number of full-time 
equivalent employees 
(FTEs) 

Is defined as the number of workers who were employed by Dexus as recorded at 30 June 2022.  

FTE data for the purpose of these statistics represents the active Dexus workforce, and is based on 
the metric ‘Total FTE’ as defined by the Australian Public Service Commission, as the number of full-
time equivalent employees directly employed by the organisation at a point in time where part-time 
employees are converted to full-time equivalent based on the hours they work as a proportion of the 
hours for a full-time employee. 

Number of workers Is defined as the number of workers who were employed by Dexus as recorded at the end of 30 June 
2022. 

Headcount data for the purpose of these statistics represents the active Dexus workforce and is 
based on the metric ‘Total Headcount (ongoing)’ as defined by the Australian Public Service 
Commission, as the number of ongoing employees directly employed by Dexus at the point in time 
described above. 

Occupational disease A disease arising from the work situation or activity (such as stress or regular exposure to harmful 
chemicals), or from a work-related injury. 

Occupational disease rate 
(ODR) 

The number of occurrences of occupational diseases for each one million hours worked is calculated 
as follows: 

number of occurrences of occupational diseases 
ODR =                                                                                   ×1,000,000 

number of hours worked 

Recorded injuries Recorded incidents that resulted in lost time and/or for which first aid or medical treatment was 
administered. Prior to FY20, lost time injuries were not included in this number. 

Site-based contractor An individual employed by an organisation other than Dexus, who performs work as directed by their 
employer at an operational asset controlled by Dexus. In these situations, Dexus generally has a 
contract with the third-party organisation to provide a service (e.g. cleaning, security), and the third 
party organisation can select different individuals to provide the service without varying its contract 
with Dexus. Using terminology within the reporting standard GRI 403: Occupational Health and 
Safety 2018, site-based contractors are characterised by Dexus having control of the workplace, but 
not having control over the individual’s work. Note the distinction with ‘corporate contractor’ as 
defined on page 50.

Dexus does not have any collective agreements as all employees are employed under individual contracts which comply with 
the National Employment Standards (NES). All employees are covered by an Award or NES. These awards or standards clearly 
indicate that all employees are free to associate. Dexus places its employees on an individual agreement, which cannot under 
legislation, remove any rights an employee has under an award for NES.

1. From FY19, Dexus reports parental leave and retention rates are based on headcount, prior years are based on FTE. 

Commentary and methodology 
The turnover calculation is a count of voluntary departures divided by the count of employees as at 30 June in each year. All 
relevant headcount data is taken from the headcount reports produced by Dexus People and Culture at 30 June each year. 

The employee count reflects the total number of people employed by Dexus and accounts for circumstances such as flexible 
work arrangements and inactive employees on parental leave that are counted in full as departures.

salary and comparing it to the average female salary 

2. In FY19 and FY20, the large increase in total number of employees resulted in an overall decrease to median employee total annual compensation 
based on FY18. This results in a ratio with a negative denominator that cannot be reduced further.

64   Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report 

Resource consumption data preparation 
Resource consumption data is derived from office, industrial, retail, convenience retail, hotels and healthcare properties owned or 
managed by Dexus for part or all of the 12 months ending 30 June 2022, with the inclusion of Dexus corporate tenancies. 

Dexus has prepared its environmental dataset to fully align with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, and the National Greenhouse and 
Energy Reporting Act and Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard calculation methods and factors where applicable. Prior years’ 
data has been updated to reflect current information where applicable, resulting in minor restatements. Repetition only occurs when 
there is an overlap of reporting periods. There may be small discrepancies in the totals in some tables due to rounding. 

Like-for-like data has been based on a portfolio whereby operational control and data for energy and water was available for the full 
24-month like-for-like period. 

Reporting boundaries 

Boundary name and description Used for 

Dexus operational control for corporate reporting and carbon neutrality 

Dexus has applied the principles contained within the National Greenhouse and 
Energy Reporting Act 2007 and its associated guidelines to determine the 
operational control of its properties across Australia. Dexus has operational control 
of a facility if it has the authority to introduce and implement any or all of the 
operating, health and safety and environmental policies for the facility. 

Where Dexus has operational control of a facility, it reports 100% of energy, water, 
waste and emissions applicable to base building operations. Dexus excludes energy 
consumption from tenant spaces where the tenant receives separately metered 
energy invoices and excludes whole facilities where they are leased to a single 
tenant occupying the entire premises. 

The boundary includes environmental data and emissions relating to Dexus’s 
corporate operations, comprising Dexus regional office tenancies and proportion of 
corresponding base building services attributable to each tenancy, as well as 
corporate travel across all staff employed directly by Dexus nationally. 

This boundary also serves as Dexus’s ‘Organisation carbon neutral boundary’ for the 
purposes of achieving carbon neutrality under Australia’s Climate Active Carbon 
Neutral Standard.  

– Group managed portfolio – 
environmental inventory and intensities 
pages 65-68 

– Progress against commitments and 
performance targets page 71 

– Achieving carbon neutrality under 
Australia’s Climate Active Carbon Neutral 
program 

 
 

Equity share boundary based on landlord control for fund reporting 

‘Landlord controlled’ and ‘tenant controlled’ areas are defined by GRESB within its 
Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide. In essence, this boundary consists of 
reporting on all common area building spaces and services on all properties within a 
Dexus entity on an equity share basis, irrespective of whether Dexus or another 
landlord has operational control. The separation is defined between landlord and 
tenant, not between operators. 

Tenant spaces, and buildings that are wholly under the control of tenants  
(e.g. through triple net leases) are not reported.

intensities (pages 72-83): 
• Dexus group portfolio 
• Dexus (DXS) listed portfolio 
• Dexus Industria REIT (DXI) portfolio 
• Dexus Convenience Retail REIT (DXC) 

portfolio 

 

Location-based vs market-based emissions accounting 
Dexus has traditionally reported its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with NGER and the GHG Protocol using 
‘location-based’ emissions accounting, whereby Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions from electricity purchases are accounted for 
using published state-based electricity grid emissions factors. 

In conjunction with Dexus’s target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2022, since 2018 Dexus has also 
adopted market-based emissions accounting as defined within the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Market-based 
electricity emissions calculations take into account purchases of renewable energy directly via Power purchases Agreements 
or GreenPower and supplied via retailers in line with Australia’s Renewable Energy Target. 

Dexus has separated its electricity purchases between renewable electricity (direct purchases and indirect via retailers), which 
is accounted for as zero emissions, and remaining non-renewable electricity, which is deemed to be derived from fossil fuels, 
where emissions are accounted for by applying state-based ‘residual mix factors’. 

Residual mix factors representing the emissions from fossil fuel electricity generators are derived from the Scope 2 & 3 
location-based factors above for each state, by scaling them for the proportion of electricity generated from fossil fuels by 
subtracting the Renewable Power Percentage (RPP) from total (or 100%) of electricity supplied. This approach assumes that 
the proportion of renewable energy is equitably distributed across Australia. 

Refer to the Dexus 2022 Assurance Criteria at pages 182-196 for further details including the list of consumption and emission 
sources, and references for factors that have been applied.

Climate Active Program 
Dexus participates in Climate Active, the Australian Government Carbon Neutral program, and maintains carbon neutral 
certification for its corporate operations under the Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard. 

In 2011 Dexus was the first real estate investment trust in Australia to achieve a carbon neutral certification for our head office. 
In FY22 Dexus is expanding its inventory to include its corporate offices and managed property portfolio.  

The inventory in the table above will form the basis of Dexus’s FY22 Climate Active Certification, which has commenced and is 
targeted for completion prior to October 2022. 

 

Dexus - Net greenhouse gas emissions intensity 

Dexus’s track record towards net zero emissions is illustrated below. The group’s Scope 1, 2, and 3 location-based operational 
emissions intensity (shown as bars above the line) demonstrates continued reductions from ongoing investment in energy 
efficiency, and for FY22 this amounts to a 62% reduction against FY08.  

Of the remaining emissions, 81% has been avoided by sourcing renewable electricity and the final 19% has been balanced 
through carbon offsets.

Energy Savings Scheme 
Dexus creates Energy Savings Certificates (ESCs) through participation in the NSW Energy Savings Scheme (ESS) for 
improvements in base building energy efficiency. The NSW Government scheme is administered by the NSW Independent 
Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal. ESCs are earned for each demonstrated tonne of carbon dioxide saved. Each ESC is 
equivalent to 1 tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (t CO2-e).

1. According to the ESS rule, each ESC has a value of 1 notional megawatt hour, where each notional megawatt hour is attributable to energy savings 
arising from a recognised energy saving activity (undertaken by Dexus group). These notional savings are reported as energy consumption avoided 
and are converted from actual electricity and gas savings using factors of 1.06 and 0.39 respectively. 

2. Includes 25,389 ESCs transferred to Dexus for properties acquired within the Dexus Office Partnership in April 2014.

Management 
Approach and 
Procedures
The Sustainability Approach and Procedures 
explains how Dexus manages the economic, 
environmental and social impacts related to  
its business. 

It aligns with the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) Standards, which 
prescribes organisations to disclose 
details of their approaches to 
managing material sustainability issues 
they have identified.

The Sustainability Approach and 
Procedures is a component of the 
2022 Annual Reporting Suite. It should 
be read in conjunction with the 
Sustainability Performance Pack and 
Sustainability Data Appendix, the 2022 
Annual Report and the 2022 Corporate 
Governance Statement.

Enhancing impact reporting
Reporting is crucial for providing 
decision-useful information to Dexus 
stakeholders, and for enhancing 
our strategy and approach over 
time through benchmarking our 
performance. To address these 
objectives, our approach to reporting 
includes the following aspects:

Regular materiality assessments that 
inform both strategy and reporting 
(pages 6-7)

 – Alignment of sustainability reporting 
content with the GRI Standards

 – Publication of an integrated Annual 
Report since 2019, aligned with the 
International Integrated Reporting 
Council <IR> Framework

The Dexus Sustainability Approach 
directs the business to create sustained 
value through delivering a positive 
impact (and reducing any negative 
impacts) for its stakeholders and the 
environment, as expressed through its 
objectives. We use the principles of 
impact mapping to communicate how 
our sustainability approach activities 
lead to benefits for employees and 
customers and for Dexus. The outputs, 
outcomes and impacts in the impact 
map also serve as indicators for us 
to evaluate our performance and 
continuously enhance our approach.

Sustained Value

Superior long-term performance for our investors and third 
party capital partners, supported by an integrated approach 
to ESG within our business model.

Dexus’s Sustainability Approach is the 
lens that we use to identify, prioritise, 
and address the environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) issues that 
matter most to our stakeholders. The 
key objectives of our Sustainability 
Approach (Leading Cities, Thriving 
People, Future Enabled Customers and 
Strong Communities, and Enriched 
Environment) guide how we manage 
the ESG risks and opportunities that 
influence how we create long-term 
value. The disclosures across each 
key objective area support the 
objective of Sustained Value, while 
the Sustained Value section of the 
Dexus Sustainability Approach and 
Procedures focuses on corporate 
governance and risk management.

Dexus aspires to the highest standards 
of corporate governance and has 
embedded policies and procedures 
to enhance corporate performance 
and protect the interests of key 
stakeholders.

Good governance is about doing 
the right thing, complying with laws, 
managing risk, upholding human rights 
and building honest relationships. 
We are committed to an open and 
transparent workplace that is free from 
corruption, anti-competitive behaviour, 
bribery and discrimination.

Our governance approach aims to:

 – Maintain the health and safety 
of our employees, customers and 
visitors

 – Maintain a working environment 
free of harassment, bullying and 
discrimination

 – Uphold labour standards and 
respect human rights

 – Continually comply with relevant 
laws, regulations and industry best 
practice

 – Create a workplace culture of 
inclusion and work-life balance

 – Manage environmental, financial 
and social risk

Committee also oversees the activities of the Anti-Modern Slavery Working Group, Climate Resilience 
Working Group, Energy Procurement Working Group, Social Impact Working Group and Reconciliation 
Action Plan (RAP) Working Group.

Property Executive 
Committee (PEC)

Chaired by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), PEC members include the Chief Investment Officer  
(CIO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Executive General Managers overseeing operational and 
strategic objectives relating to:

– Property performance

– Development and trading

– Funds management

Investment Committee Reviews and endorses all major investment proposals (including acquisitions, divestments, 
developments and major capital works) concerning Dexus and each of our third party capital 
partners and funds.

Board and management 
committees
Dexus Funds Management Limited 
(DXFM) is the Responsible Entity of 
each of the trusts that comprise Dexus. 
DXFM, along with other responsible 
entities in the group, is also responsible 
for management of third party funds on 
behalf of the group’s third party capital 
partners.

The Board implements a corporate 
governance framework that applies to 
all DXFM schemes, Dexus Industria REIT 
(DXI), Dexus Convenience Retail REIT 
(DXC), the Dexus Wholesale Property 
Fund (DWPF), the Dexus Healthcare 
Property Fund (DHPF) and capital 
partner investments.

To assist stakeholders in accessing key 
documents outlining our approach to 
corporate governance, we maintain 
a Corporate Governance section 
on our website www.dexus.com/
corporategovernance. 

We publish a Corporate Governance 
Statement that presents our 
governance framework against the 
ASX Corporate Governance Principles 
& Recommendations – Fourth Edition 
(ASX Principles) and discloses how 
we continue to meet each of the ASX 
Principles during the financial year.

While the framework adopted by Dexus 
meets the requirements of the ASX 
Principles, it also addresses additional 
aspects of governance which the Board 
considers important. 

Dexus has five Board Committees to 
assist in fulfilment of its responsibilities. 
There are management committees 
including the Group Management 
Committee (comprising senior 
executives of the organisation). 
Employees can make recommendations 
through these forums as well as directly 
to senior management.

The table below describes Board and 
management committees with a focus 
on governance, risk management and 
assurance.

Continuous improvement Regularly reviewing and updating policies to ensure continued relevance. 

Compliance matters are reviewed by the Responsible Entity Board, Board Risk 
Committee, the Group Management Committee (GMC) and the Corporate 
Executive Committee (CEC).

1.2  Operational practices
We have developed a Compliance 
Management Framework and a Risk 
Management Framework outlining how 
we identify and address compliance 
and risk management.

These frameworks support the 
development and implementation of 
compliance, risk management and 
corporate governance procedures 
across the business. The Risk 
Management Policy applies to all 
Dexus employees who are required 
to understand, promote and be 
responsible for ensuring that controls 
are in place to effectively manage risks 
that apply to activities within their day- 
to-day responsibility.

The management frameworks support 
customers, third party capital partners, 
people development, supplier 
partnerships and engagement within 
communities. The frameworks are 
reviewed on an annual basis to ensure 
they remain current and adequately 
address the risks inherent in managing 
the business.

Compliance Management 
Framework
Compliance is a vital component of our 
corporate governance approach and 
assists in:

 – Building trust with investors, 
customers and clients

 – Protecting our brand and reputation

 – Promoting our values

 – Demonstrating to industry and 
the community that we act with 
integrity and do the right thing

 – Complying with laws, regulations 
and industry standards

Dexus’s Compliance Management 
Framework satisfies the requirements 
of the International Standard for 
Compliance Management Systems – 
ISO 37301:2021. Activities conducted 
within the framework comply with the 
relevant Australian legislation and 
regulations including the Corporations 
Act, Privacy Act, Competition & 
Consumer Act, Tax & Stamp Duty 
legislation, Retail Leases Act, Real 
Estate Licensing Acts, Environmental 
Acts and Regulations, and Anti-
Money Laundering & Counter Terrorism 
Financing Act and ASX Listing Rules.

We promote a culture of compliance 
through a framework in which all 
employees contribute and participate. 
The Compliance team oversees the 
compliance management framework 
while the entire business is responsible 
for ensuring that their business 
procedures adhere to Dexus’s policies.

The framework:

 – Acknowledges our commitment 
to compliance, good governance, 
ethical behaviour and continuous 
improvement

 – Focuses on protecting the interests 
of investors, third party capital 
partners and employees

 – Ensures where a fiduciary obligation 
exists, the interests of the client 
are put before the interest of the 
responsible entity and/or trustee

 – Ensures that our financial services 
and products are provided honestly, 
fairly and efficiently

 – Seeks to prevent, identify and 
quickly respond to breaches of 
applicable laws, industry codes and 
standards and business rules

Record keeping
We have a Records Management 
Policy which provides guidance in 
relation to the storage and retention 
of records for Dexus. Records must 
be created and maintained to satisfy 
business and regulatory requirements 
as well as industry operating standards. 
The policy covers all types of records 
including paper and electronic media.

Delegations of authority
We have operating limits in place that 
set out the authorities of employees to 
contract on behalf of a Dexus entity or 
a fund that Dexus manages.

Conflicts of interest
Management of conflicts of interest at 
Dexus is addressed by the following 
policies: 

 – Directors’ Code of Conduct

 – Employee Code of Conduct 
(incorporating Gifts, benefits & 
entertainment)

 – Conflicts of Interest – Business

 – Conflicts of Interest – Personal 
Policy (including gifts and 
entertainment)

 – Securities Trading Policy (including 
Inside Information)

Together they inform employees of 
what constitutes a conflict of interest 
and describe the processes in place 
for identifying and managing them. 
Conflicts may arise in a variety of 
situations:

 – Related party dealings

 – Allocating property transactions 
amongst clients or third party 
capital partners

 – Tenant (customer) conflicts

 – Transfer of assets between schemes 
or clients

 – Personal conflicts

Dexus board members are required 
to adhere to the Directors’ Code 
of Conduct. Directors must comply 
with the legal framework governing 
the operations of Dexus, which 
includes anti-corruption policies and 
procedures.

All actual or potential conflicts are 
reported to Dexus’s Compliance team 
so that necessary controls are put 
in place to effectively manage the 
conflict. These controls may include:

 – Ensuring a transaction is conducted 
at arm’s length

 – Removal of conflicted employees 
or teams from a transaction or 
decision

 – Establishing information barriers 
so that employees and teams 
operate solely in the interests of 
the respective funds or third party 
capital partners

 – Avoiding a transaction

We maintain a Conflict of Interest 
Register which provides a central record 
of all material conflicts to ensure that 
they are effectively identified and 
managed. Conflicts of interest are 
reported to the Board Risk Committee 
quarterly.

Anti-bribery and corruption
We are committed to achieving the 
highest corporate standards and 
working against corruption in all its 
forms, including extortion and bribery.

The Fraud, Corruption and Bribery 
(Prevention and Awareness) Policy 
outlines expectations for employee 
conduct relating to lobbying, meetings 
with law makers and receiving gifts 
and benefits. Dexus does not make 
political donations or provide gifts to 
politicians or public servants. As per 
the Dexus Political Donations Policy, 
Dexus employees and Directors are 
prohibited from using Dexus funds 
for political contributions. Where we 
engage with government we do so in 
an ethical and transparent manner. 
The Stakeholder Engagement section 
(page 105) provides additional detail 
on our approach to engaging with 
government.

Transparency and  
continuous disclosure
We take an industry-leading approach 
to transparency and disclosure of 
responsible investment practices. This 
is supported by the Property Council 
of Australia’s Voluntary Best Practice 
Guidelines for Disclosing Funds From 
Operations (FFO) and Adjusted 
Funds From Operations (AFFO). These 
measures enable a transparent 
comparison of financial performance 
between Dexus and its listed property 
peers.

We are committed to providing 
investors, the broader market and 
other stakeholders with accurate and 
timely information about material 
activities. We comply with the 
continuous disclosure requirements 
of the Corporations Act and ASX 
Listing Rules. A Continuous Disclosure 
Committee oversees compliance with 
the Continuous Disclosure Policy.

We respond annually to several investor 
surveys and benchmarks, publish 
research papers, and formally disclose 
group performance in accordance with 
best practice frameworks published by 
the International Integrated Reporting 
Council (IIRC) and the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI).

Compliance monitoring
We conduct ongoing compliance 
monitoring to ensure that business units 
are operating in accordance with legal 
and internal requirements.

We also ensure that management 
and the Board have sufficient risk and 
compliance information to enable them 
to exercise their responsibilities and 
discharge their duties effectively.

The purpose of compliance monitoring 
is to:

 – Check that controls/preventative 
procedures are in place to ensure 
that business and system processes 
are operating adequately, function 
appropriately, and are compliant 
with relevant laws, regulations, 
industry standards, codes and 
internal standards

 – Self-assessment / quarterly 
attestation checklists

 – Assist with the identification of 
actual, possible or imminent 
compliance incidents

 – Test the effectiveness of the 
compliance policies and structure

90  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



 – Determine where problems are 
being encountered within the 
business and the reason for them

 – Monitoring compliance risk 
indicators trends to identify 
behaviours within teams that 
would indicate a poor approach to 
compliance

 – Identify compliance training needs

Monitoring takes the form of:

 – Self-assessment checklists

 – Compliance review and verification

 – Targeted reviews

 – Ad hoc reviews

 – Compliance risk indicators

Internal Audit program
Internal audit is an independent, 
objective assurance and consulting 
activity designed to add value and 
improve our operations.

Internal audit assists in improving 
business performance by providing 
an independent and disciplined 
approach to evaluate and strengthen 
risk management, business processes, 
internal controls and governance 
activities across the organisation. 

The Corporate Executive Committee 
(CEC) oversees the group’s risk 
management, compliance 
management and Internal Audit 
program. KPMG performs the activities 
of an Internal Audit function which 
reports to the CEC and Board Audit 
Committee.

We maintain an Internal Audit Charter 
which sets out the roles, responsibilities, 
authorisation, activities and reporting 
relationships of the Internal Audit 
function. The Charter is reviewed 
and approved by the Board Audit 
Committee on an annual basis.

In the conduct of its activities the 
Internal Audit function plays an active 
role in:

 – Developing and maintaining a 
culture of accountability and 
integrity

 – Promoting and supporting Dexus’s 
Three Lines of Defence Model by 
maintaining an independent ‘third 
line’ in relation to effective risk 
management and control

 – Facilitating the integration of risk 
management into day-to-day 
business activities and processes

 – Promoting a culture of risk- 
consciousness, self-assessment and 
adherence to high ethical standards

 – Maintaining a professional and 
experienced Internal Audit function, 
through the engagement of 
suitably qualified professionals, 
with sufficient knowledge, skills, 
experience, and professional 
certifications to meet the 
requirements of the Internal Audit 
Charter

 – Establishing a quality assurance 
program which supports the 
operation of internal audit activities 
and is responsive to the business’ 
needs

 – Ensuring that engagements are 
performed with proficiency and due 
professional care

The Internal Audit function includes 
examining, evaluating and monitoring 
the adequacy and effectiveness 
of governance, risk management, 
financial and operational controls 
designed to manage risks and achieve 
objectives.

Internal Audit program activities involve:

 – Developing and implementing a 
flexible annual internal audit plan, 
adopting an appropriate risk-
based approach, which is approved 
by the CEC and Board Audit 
Committee

 – Assisting us to promote awareness 
of key risks, our risk culture and risk 
mitigation activities

 – Supporting audit activities through 
facilitation, process design and 
advisory services

 – Reporting on the outcomes 
of internal audits to senior 
management, the CEC and Board 
Audit Committee and, depending 
on the scope of the audit, other 
relevant Board Committees

 – Keeping our employees informed 
of emerging trends and successful 
practices in internal auditing

 – Assisting in the investigation of 
significant suspected fraudulent 
activities and notifying findings to 
the CEC, Board Audit Committee 
and Board Risk Committee

 – Conducting follow up activities on 
the status of agreed significant, 
high and moderate rated 
recommendations

Board evaluation
We recognise that performance 
measurement and management are 
integral to our Board’s success and we 
believe that Board evaluations can 
contribute significantly to performance 
enhancement at the organisational, 
Board and Director levels.

The Board Nomination Committee 
oversees the Board performance 
evaluation program. The evaluation 
process looks at the performance of the 
Board and its committees. 

Individual Director performance is 
also evaluated. When appropriate, 
an independent expert is retained 
to conduct the evaluation. Any 
areas for improvement identified 
in the performance evaluation 
process are agreed by the Board 
Nomination Committee which oversees 
the implementation of process 
enhancements.

The Performance Evaluation Policy 
outlines a formal approach to 
review and improve performance 
management.

External feedback and  
grievance procedures
We are committed to continuous 
improvement and seek to appropriately 
address feedback received from 
investors, customers, employees and 
other stakeholders. Any grievance 
escalated to the Head of Governance 
or Head of Compliance is addressed 
through grievance or complaints 
policies and procedures. For example, 
an investor complaint may relate to 
grievances involving our financial 
products/services or privacy matters.

A customer complaint may relate to a 
significant issue relating to poor service 
or a poor customer experience.

We maintain policies and procedures 
to address grievances formally raised 
by stakeholders in relation to Dexus, 
our products or services, or the 
processes we use for dealing with 
feedback itself. Our grievance process 
emphasises conciliation to ensure that 
inappropriate and unlawful practices 
cease and that grievances are resolved 
in a sensitive and timely manner.

92  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Should a complaint require subsequent 
remedial action, this may involve 
training, amendments to procedures 
or controls, or enhancements to 
monitoring or review processes.

A register of grievances is maintained 
and reported to the Board Risk 
Committee and the Board ESG 
Committee.

Internal grievances and 
whistleblowing
To maintain a positive and productive 
work environment, we have 
implemented a whistleblower program.

An important part of the program is the 
open and honest discussion of ethical 
issues. We encourage employees to 
raise problems with their manager. 

Should this not be possible for any 
reason, employees are encouraged 
to raise their concerns of possible 
breaches of law or procedure, 
irregularity, compliance issue, ethical 
issue or anything else of concern with 
any of the following representatives:

 – Head of Governance

 – Head of People and Culture

 – General Counsel

 – Dexus’s statutory auditors, PwC

 – Dexus’s internal auditors, KPMG

We have also appointed an 
independent disclosure management 
service provider, Your-Call, to enable 
employees, and employees of services 
providers on site to report securely, 
anonymously and confidentially 
information about dishonesty, fraud, 
unsafe environments, unethical and 
other inappropriate behaviour in the 
workplace.

Tax and overseas operations
The Dexus group operates and earns 
revenues exclusively in Australia. All 
revenues remain in Australia and 
Dexus does not shift profits to other 
jurisdictions. The Dexus Annual Report 
discloses additional information about 
the group’s approach to taxation.

1.3  Risk Management 
Framework

Effective risk management is critical 
to value creation and requires an 
understanding of risks during all phases 
of investment from asset selection, 
acquisition, allocation, ownership and 
management through to divestment. 
Responsible investment and active 
property management principles 
are integrated into our sustainability 
approach.

All Dexus employees are required 
to understand, promote and be 
responsible for ensuring that controls 
are in place to effectively manage 
risks that apply to activities within their 
day-to-day responsibility, including 
risks associated with business decisions, 
processes, systems or people and 
external events.

Dexus’s Risk Management Framework 
articulates our approach to managing 
risk. The framework is aligned to the 
Australian and New Zealand Standard 
for Risk Management – Guidelines 
ISO 31000:2018. The key objective of 
the Framework is to provide Dexus 
employees with a foundation from 
which the business can achieve its 
strategy by effectively identifying and 
managing the risks and opportunities 
that impact on the realisation of that 
strategy.

The framework defines Dexus’s process 
for managing risk and involves the 
systematic application of policies, 
procedures and practices including  
but not limited to:

 – Communicating and consulting 
with appropriate external 
and internal stakeholders

 – Defining the scope of risk 
management activities, 
understanding the external and 
internal context in the environment 
in which Dexus operates and 
defining the risk criteria relative  
to objectives

 – Conducting risk assessments to 
identify, analyse and evaluate risks

 – Planning and implementing 
risk treatment, assessing the 
effectiveness of controls and 
determining that the risk profile 
is aligned with Dexus’s risk 
appetite, strategy and culture

 – Monitoring and review of risks to 
provide assurance and improve  
the quality and effectiveness of 
process design, implementation  
and outcomes

 – Reporting to management and 
boards including to the Corporate 
Executive Committee (CEC), 
Group Management Committee 
(GMC), Board Audit Committee 
and Board Risk Committee

 – Providing training to support 
employees’ awareness of and ability 
to execute their risk management 
responsibilities. This extends to 
our key business partner CBRE via 
annual risk roadshows addressing 
risk, operational and ESG topics

Our property portfolio varies by 
geographic location, asset type 
and tenant type. These variables 
present specific risks that are 
managed, monitored and audited 
in relation to health and safety, 
building safety, environmental, 
security and insurance risks.

External review of work health and 
safety (WHS) and environmental 
procedure management is conducted 
through a comprehensive risk audit and 
review program to identify, evaluate 
and mitigate risk in the following areas:

 – Health and safety audits: 
compliance/ spot audits, ISO 
45001:2018 audit/ gap analysis, 
ISO certification audit, principal 
contractor audit incident 
investigations (as and when they 
occur)

 – Building safety: Property risk 
assessments (including and not 
limited to confined space, height 
safety, and plant risk assessment), 
and facade condition audits

 – Environmental: Hazardous 
materials assessment and audit, 
Environmental management 
assessment and audit, ISO 14001 
audit/gap analysis, ISO certification 
audit 

 – Security: security risk assessment, 
external security review

 – Insurance risk: underwriting 
assessment, insurance valuations 
program, risk engineering program

We have developed an in-house 
property risk management and 
auditing tool, Periskope, that provides 
systematic and rigorous property risk 
profiling. Periskope is a single point of 
access for tools and data, assisting in 
property risk management.

Dexus completes an annual review of its 
risk management framework applicable 
to all employees. Risk management 
policies, procedures and governance 
committee structures are reviewed to 
ensure continuous improvement and to 
minimise the risk of ethical or corruption 
breaches. 

The review process involves the 
facilitation of risk workshops with senior 
management to review and update 
the risk register. Dexus has a Fraud, 
Corruption and Bribery (Prevention 
and Awareness) Policy that outlines its 
commitment to ethical behaviour.

Risk appetite
Risk appetite is the amount of risk a 
business is willing to accept to achieve 
its strategy. It promotes the principle 
of ‘freedom within boundaries’ to 
assist management in executing the 
strategy. In accordance with the ASX 
Corporate Governance Principles 
& Recommendations and ASIC 
Regulatory Guide (RG) 259, the Board 
of each Responsible Entity sets the 
risk appetite for the business. The risk 
appetite consists of statements which 
are a combination of principles which 
align to our strategic objectives.

The Risk Appetite Statement helps to 
guide decisions by outlining risks for 
which we have no appetite and risks we 
may be willing to accept provided it is 
transparent, prudently managed and 
justified by the returns of the business in 
the pursuit of strategic objectives.

Risk Appetite Statements are subject 
to annual review, or more frequently 
if there is a significant change to the 
business or operating environment and 
approved annually by the respective 
boards.

Work health and safety (WHS)
We recognise our duty of care to 
our customers, employees, investors, 
agents and the wider community to 
ensure all Work Health, Safety and 
Liability (WHS&L) risks in our property 
portfolio are appropriately managed. 
To achieve this, we have implemented 
a comprehensive risk management 
system to ensure the effective 
management of WHS&L risks across the 
portfolio.

We believe that teamwork is essential 
in everything we do. Therefore, while 
management plays a key role in 
creating a safe and healthy work 
environment, optimal success can 
only be achieved when responsibility 
is shared between all stakeholders 
including management, employees, 
customers, contractors and service 
providers.

We also recognise our duty of care to 
the health and safety of contractors. 
As the activities of contractors can be 
of a high-risk nature, we implement 
contractor management software 
across all managed properties to 
ensure all properties across the portfolio 
have a standard approach and a 
system for the WHS&L management 
of contractors that complies with 
relevant Legislation, Codes of Practice, 
Standards and the Dexus WHS&L 
system.

Dexus has a WHS&E Strategy, which 
the vision statement and key pillars are 
summarised in the table below. 

WHS&E Vision Statement: “To achieve 
a workplace where our people and 
communities care for each other, 
everyone goes home safe and well and 
the environment is preserved, in the 
successful operation of our business”.

The WHS&E strategy house consists of 
5 key Pillars:

1.  Organisational WHS&E Culture: 
Instilling leadership, attitudes and 
behaviours that positively value and 
promote WHSE outcomes

2.  Governance: WHS&E is integrated 
into all business operations to 
ensure compliance and a high level 
of performance

3.  Safe Together: WHS&E risks are 
known and  effectively managed 
to keep everyone physically and 
mentally safe and well

4.  Safe Design & Environment: 
Buildings are designed, built 
and maintained to the highest 
standards

1.4  Integrating sustainability
We integrate sustainability in our operations by linking our approach to our performance outcomes through establishing 
policies and governance frameworks, setting targets and embedding these into day-to-day activities.

Engagement Policies Commitments Practices Measure and report

We engage with 
stakeholders to identify 
and manage material 
issues which have the 
greatest impact on our 
stakeholders.

Dexus’s ESG policies 
encapsulate our 
‘Sustained Value’ 
vision and inform all 
stakeholders of their 
legal and corporate 
responsibilities for the 
management of ESG 
risks and opportunities.

We set measurable 
performance targets 
across our key 
stakeholder groups in 
line with our strategy, 
and we drive ethical 
and responsible 
performance in all 
areas of operations. We 
integrate sustainability 
objectives into our 
group scorecard, which 
is used to determine 
individual objectives and 
remuneration outcomes.

We integrate ESG 
management 
practices within day-
to-day operations, 
developments and 
investment decision 
making to enhance 
corporate performance 
and create sustained 
value.

Within our annual 
Sustainability 
Performance Pack, we 
report our performance 
across each of our key 
objectives including 
achievements against 
targets.

We report our 
management 
approaches within our 
disclosure according to 
best practice standards 
(e.g. Integrated 
Reporting Framework, 
GRI).

1.5  Evaluation and process improvement
We seek to continuously improve our governance approach through:

 – An annual review of the Compliance Management Framework and Risk Management Framework

 – Independent reviews such as internal audits and reviews undertaken by industry experts

 – Attending industry forums and seminars, including those provided by law firms and regulators

 – Circulars and newsletters from law and accountancy firms and regulators

Leading Cities

A high-quality portfolio that contributes to economic prosperity and 
supports sustainable urban development across Australia’s key cities.

Dexus’s strategy is to deliver superior 
returns from high quality real estate 
in Australia’s major cities. Our focus 
on cities means that our success is 
intrinsically linked to the overall growth 
and prosperity of the cities where we 
operate.

Our Leading Cities objective 
contributes to urban prosperity by 
directing us to invest in, develop and 
manage world class, sustainable 
properties and precincts that enhance 
local amenity and vibrancy. Across 
our buildings, we seek to attract high 
calibre customers whose businesses 
support local, regional and national 
economies.

We expand our reach and engage 
local communities through 
collaboration and consultation with 
authorities and industry associations 
and work together with peers and other 
stakeholders to lift urban development 
standards and share insights.

Focus areas for our approach  
to Leading Cities include:

– Generating economic impact: 
Responding to local community 
interest in precincts and 
development projects that 
contribute amenity, vitality and 
economic prosperity to their area

– Integrating ESG into transactions: 
Ensuring that sustainability factors 
are considered in transaction 
activity, to manage our portfolio’s 
exposure to emerging risks and 
identify potential opportunities

– Showcasing sustainable 
development: Using our 
development projects to 
demonstrate how the urban form 
can minimise its environmental 
impact and enhance wellbeing

– Stakeholder engagement: Working 
with our stakeholders to understand 
what matters to them and using 
their insights to enhance how we 
operate

The boundary for our approach 
encompasses Dexus’s group portfolio, 
including development projects, 
with impacts mainly felt by Dexus’s 
customers, suppliers and local 
communities.

2.1  Management 
framework

Several areas of our business, under 
the leadership of the Board and Group 
Management Committee (GMC), 
collaborate to deliver our objective of 
Leading Cities. The framework below 
provides insight into the developments 
and transactions management 
structure and policy framework, which is 
an important contributor to our Leading 
Cities objective. Management of 
standing investments also contributes 
to the objective of Leading Cities, and 
relevant management frameworks for 
standing investments are described 
in the Future Enabled Customers 
and Strong Communities section 
(page 121), and Enriched Environment 
section (page 143). Several policies are 
publicly available at www.dexus.com/

2.2  Management practices
Investment due diligence
Dexus has a rigorous process for 
evaluating the risks and opportunities 
relating to investment decisions. This 
includes reviewing long-term asset 
plans and conducting appropriate 
environmental due diligence on 
acquisitions so that ESG risks are 
identified and effectively managed.

The Investment Committee reports to 
the General Management Committee 
and is responsible for reviewing 
all investment, divestment and 
development proposals for Dexus and 
its third-party capital partners.

The Investment Committee recognises 
its fiduciary duty to act in the best 
interests of Dexus and its third party 
capital partners and uses a formal 
process and templates to collect and 
evaluate a wide range of data relating 
to risks, opportunities and impacts 
before approving or endorsing each 
investment decision.

The due diligence process is used to 
identify ESG risks, such as exposure to 
physical climate risk and the ability to 
attract and meet customers’ demand 
based on asset energy performance.

This process requires details (and 
external peer review by specialist 
consultants) on the potential 
acquisition’s environmental 
performance, including NABERS and 
Green Star ratings, energy and water 
consumption and climate change 
impact assessments. Building upgrade 
and improvement plans, past energy 
and water audits and environmental 
risk assessments are also reviewed, 
along with costings required to 
implement upgrades to the property in 
line with the group’s net zero emissions 
ambition. 

Potential acquisitions are screened 
to ensure responsible investment 
principles are upheld. 

Outcomes of the due diligence process 
influence Dexus’s investment decisions:

– Material issues could lead to the 
abandonment of the potential 
investment

– Less significant issues, risks and 
opportunities may influence the 
investment price or the terms of 
sale, and may present opportunities 
to reposition and add value to 
under-performing properties 
through environmental, carbon and 
climate resilience initiatives 

– No material issues are identified

In summary, if an investment fails to 
meet the ESG due diligence criteria, 
it may prevent a transaction from 
proceeding.

Developments
The Development team identifies ESG 
issues in the due diligence process 
that may affect an investment and 
are reviewed and approved by 
the Investment Committee. It then 
categorises them as:

– Material issues that may lead to the 
abandonment of the development 
option

– Less significant issues, risks and 
opportunities that impact the 
decision and/or the investment 
metrics, or the scheme 
recommendations

– Insignificant issues that are not 
deemed to affect Dexus or its third 
party capital partners

If an issue is uncovered, decisions 
are made whether to pursue the 
development opportunity or mitigate 
the impact.

We review environmental metrics 
for development opportunities with 
reference to our environmental targets 
and objectives.

We seek peer reviews by specialist 
consultants on insights on matters 
including but not limited to general 
sustainability, climate-related risks 
and the climate resilience of the 
development’s design.

Development helps enable the delivery 
of our strategic objectives and Dexus 
has a strong track record in developing 
high quality office, industrial, retail 
and healthcare properties in key 
Australian markets. Our developments 
have a focus on delivering superior 
risk adjusted returns through quality, 
sustainability and enhancing public 
amenity.

98  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Drivers for sustainable 
development
Our approach to integrating 
sustainability into our development 
projects responds to a range of 
internal and external drivers that 
underpin ongoing investment in 
property efficiency and financial and 
environmental sustainability. These 
include:

– Improving rental returns: The 
desire to reduce operating costs 
and manage risk associated with 
utility prices. Reduced outgoings 
can mean that Dexus is able to 
increase profit margins. Evidence 
has shown that the most efficient 
and sustainable buildings attract 
premium rents

– It makes financial sense: Investment 
in energy efficient technology is 
proven to be one of the lowest 
cost-effective ways to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and 
project investments are paid 
back through reduced utility and 
maintenance costs in a reasonable 
timeframe. This is particularly 
evident for new designs, in 
which ESG opportunities can be 
incorporated at reduced marginal 
cost

– Partnership approach to ESG: We 
collaborate with our customers to 
understand their functional needs 
and ESG aspirations for a tailored 
development response that meets 
customers’ long-term space needs

– Consumer demand and sentiment: 
The leasing market is competitive, 
and customers often have a 
choice of properties to occupy. 
An increasing expectation among 
customers is for their property to 
perform efficiently to meet their ESG 
needs and minimise outgoings. For 
example, government agencies 
set minimum standards for base 
building NABERS ratings as a 
minimum requirement when 
selecting potential space

– Industry leadership: Taking 
a leadership position on ESG 
initiatives, including reduced carbon 
footprint and best practice industry 
ratings (such as Green Star ratings) 
and responsible investment by 
applying suitable focus on ensuring 
that its properties are leaders in 
their respective markets

– Benchmarking: Green Star, NABERS 
and WELL ratings enable our 
customers, investors, and other 
interested stakeholders to assess 
the relative ESG performance of 
Dexus properties against industry 
benchmarks

– Future proofing: Dexus tackles 
ESG issues and maximises property 
performance as part of its long- 
term risk management strategy and 
incorporates COVID safe measures. 
This ensures the property portfolio is 
best placed to deal with potential 
future issues including introduction 
of environmental minimum 
standards, taxes or financial 
penalties associated with resource 
use and greenhouse gas emissions, 
and new legislation

– Attracting and retaining investors: 
ESG performance is one of several 
criteria in which investors allocate 
funds. Investors interested in 
investing in sustainable companies 
will refer to stock exchange 
sustainability indices including Dow 
Jones Sustainability Index to assist 
them

Demographics and accessibility
Development design is informed by our 
Research team, which provides insights 
into market and demographic trends. 
These insights are combined with local 
community engagement feedback and 
incorporated into development briefs 
to ensure that the completed property 
will meet market and demographic 
demand now and into the future.

Properties are designed to offer 
flexibility and adaptability in tenancy 
design. Where appropriate, Dexus 
invokes inclusive design by engaging 
local communities, governments, 
employees and other groups to 
contribute to the design, so the built 
outcome is reflective of the interests 
and diversity of its users and other 
stakeholders.

All developments are required to ensure 
accessibility in accordance with the 
provisions of the Australian Disability 
Discrimination Act 1992.

Site selection and design
A large proportion of our developments, 
particularly across the office, industrial, 
healthcare and retail portfolios, occur 
within existing developed areas (i.e. 
brownfield sites). We seek development 
opportunities in properties in highly 
connected urban environments and 
integrate our developments with 
multi modal transport networks and 
facilitate active transport options. 
Our developments aim to create city 
precincts that enhance the amenity 
and vitality of Australia’s central 
business districts.

When selecting sites in greenfield 
locations and developing site design, 
our projects seek to protect, restore 
and conserve aquatic ecosystems, 
farmland, floodplain functions, and 
habitat for threatened and endangered 
species.

These features are often protected 
through development approval 
conditions that we comply with and 
at times seek to exceed in order to 
achieve a net positive biodiversity 
outcome (see Dexus’s Biodiversity 
Policy).

Development approval conditions 
and other measures included in 
development contracts help minimise 
negative impacts of construction by 
directing projects to:

– Manage waste by diverting 
construction and demolition 
materials from disposal

– Manage waste by diverting 
reusable vegetation, rocks and soil 
from disposal

– Protect air quality during 
construction

– Protection of surface water and 
aquatic ecosystems by controlling 
and retaining construction 
pollutants

– Protect and restore habitat and 
soils disturbed during construction

Developments seeking Green Star 
Buildings certification are directed 
to minimise negative impacts of 
construction through the redefined 
Responsible and Positive categories. 
Environmental impact assessments are 
carried out at all sites and on selected 
sites social impact assessments are 
undertaken.

Integrating sustainability factors 
into development projects
We partnership led approach with 
our customers in the preparation of 
design briefs for new developments 
and refurbishments. Design briefs 
describe the scope and nature of the 
development works and incorporate 
a range of requirements and minimum 
standards relating to sustainability 
issues and performance. Each design 
brief is unique to the development 
or retrofit, however an overarching 
document is created for each works 
project for the purposes of tendering 
and holding contractors to account 
against a fully documented list of 
requirements.

We seek buy-in from customers and 
agree the final brief before proceeding 
with construction. We incorporate 
sustainability into all aspects of 
the design through the inclusion of 
sustainable property features including 
passive cooling, efficient lighting, and 
air conditioning, as well as applying 
minimum standards to equipment and 
materials such as insulation R-values 
and Water Rating Labels for water 
fixtures.

Green building certifications
Dexus selectively rates new 
developments against the Green 
Building Council of Australia’s (GBCA) 
Green Star certification1  and continues 
to present Green Star opportunities 
to all pre-lease construction 
opportunities. Dexus targets to achieve 
at least 5 Star Green Star ratings for 
projects registered in the legacy Green 
Star Design & As Built v1.3 rating or 4 
Star under the new Green Star Buildings 
v1 ratings across all new office and 
healthcare developments as well as 
select industrial developments.

Selected office developments 
seek excellence in property health 
and wellbeing by targeting WELL 
certification from the International 
WELL Building Institute.

1 Developments seeking Green Star 
certification during FY22 may choose to 
register the development under Green Star 
Design & As Built v1.3 (project registrations 
closed 31 December 2021) or the new Green 
Star Buildings v1 that was released on  
29 October 2020. Please refer to the Green 
Building Council Australia’s website for  
further information.

100  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Element Dexus’s approach

Biodiversity  
and habitat

Our development sites are often brownfield sites with negligible biodiversity value. Where biodiversity may be 
impacted by our activities, the Dexus Biodiversity Policy directs teams to ensure our developments have a net 
positive impact on biodiversity and apply an approach to avoid, minimise, restore and offset adverse biodiversity 
impacts.

Developments seeking a Green Star certification are directed to manage biodiversity issues in the relevant 
category credits (Land Use and Ecology in Green Star Design & As Built v1.3; Nature Category in Green Star 
Buildings v1).

We comply, and direct our suppliers to comply, with development conditions that relate to biodiversity 
conservation at our development sites.

Building safety Our development projects are expected to uphold the highest standards in building safety, both in terms of 
safety during construction and the ongoing operation of the asset.

Our goal for all projects is a no harm, safe workplace with zero fatalities at all stages of the property lifecycle. 
Complementing this approach is a peer review of the development’s design scheme to ensure building safety is 
achieved in building operations post completion.

Climate change 
adaptation and 
resilience

We assess potential climate change risks and changes to exposure and vulnerability regarding future climate 
scenarios.

Developments with high inherent climate change risk that are seeking a Green Star certification are directed to 
manage climate change adaptation issues in the relevant category credits (Adaptation and Resilience in Green 
Star Design & As Built v1.3; Resilient and Positive Categories in Green Star Buildings v1).

We comply, and direct our suppliers to comply, with development conditions that relate to climate change 
adaptation at our development sites, including but not limited to flood mitigation measures.

Incorporating climate-related issues into development processes can ensure that Dexus properties are low 
carbon from day one of operation and have the capacity to integrate the technologies of the future as they 
mature. Key actions supporting the climate resilience of our developments include:

 – Enhancing policies, procedures, and design briefs to ensure that climate-related issues are considered 
throughout the development process, including the use of minimum standards and stretch goals where 
appropriate

 – Exploring design opportunities that maximise the adaptability and flexibility of buildings over time, so they can 
accommodate future changes in climate and technology

 – Assessing the embodied carbon of our developments, with a view to reducing embodied carbon over time

 – Continuing the use of tools such as Green Star and life cycle assessment

Energy 
consumption/ 
management 
and greenhouse 
gas emissions

Across our developments, we aspire to design for operational efficiency, targeting net zero emissions from 
operations by 30 June 2022 and sourcing 100% renewable energy.

We collaborate with industrial customers to incorporate on-site solar electricity generation for new industrial 
developments.

Developments seeking a Green Star certification are directed to integrate energy and emissions management 
issues in the relevant category credits (Energy in Green Star Design & As Built v1.3; Positive Category in Green Star 
Buildings v1).

Energy efficiency is integrated into the whole-of-property design process, and projects seek to exceed relevant 
energy codes, achieve leading Green Star and NABERS Energy ratings (office and retail) and support our net zero 
emissions ambition. Common energy efficiency measures include:

 – High efficiency HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) systems

 – High efficiency lighting

 – Independent building commissioning

 – Occupant sensors and controls to match indoor environmental conditions with occupant requirements

 – Energy modelling to assess property energy performance and inform design

 – The design process incorporates opportunities to leverage site environmental conditions such as natural light, 
thermal and ventilation conditions in the operation of buildings.

Element Dexus’s approach

Environmental 
and health 
attributes 
of building 
materials

We aim to take a lifecycle approach to inform financial business cases for low embodied carbon  
for materials at key projects.

Building materials selection for Dexus developments is usually undertaken by development contractors. 
Dexus’s Sustainable Procurement Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct is built into all development 
contracts and contains expectations for contractors regarding the environmental performance and 
health attributes of building materials.

We obtain product data sheets from contractors detailing the environmental and health attributes of 
building materials as part of the design phase that is incorporated in the certification and operational 
pack of the property. Wherever a development brief is likely to contain hazardous materials, the 
contractor is to provide independently certified laboratory tested hazardous materials clearance 
certificates.
Developments seeking a Green Star Building certification are directed to address issues regarding the 
environmental attributes of building materials consumption and management issues in the relevant category 
credits (Materials in Green Star Design & As Built v1.3; Positive Category in Green Star Buildings v1).

Dexus’s Sustainable Procurement Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct directs suppliers to procure sustainable 
products and services where feasible that:

 – Have a lower embodied carbon footprint due to selection of raw materials and efficient manufacturing 
processes

 – Contain a high recycled content and produced in a way to ensure it can be disassembled and/or recycled 
through common services

 – Are certified to internationally recognised standards or demonstrate other applicable sustainability criteria

 – Support our net zero emissions target

Health and 
wellbeing

We support occupant health and wellbeing at our developments through focusing on indoor environmental 
quality and supporting initiatives in property design and subsequent operations, including comprehensive end-
of-trip and wellness facilities.

Developments seeking Green Star Buildings certification are directed to integrate health and wellbeing 
management issues in the relevant category credits (Indoor Environment Quality in Green Star Design & As Built 
v1.3; Healthy Category in Green Star Buildings v1).

At select developments, we elect to obtain WELL Certification to further enhance a property’s health and 
wellbeing performance. Alternatively, indoor environment principles from the WELL certification are considered 
and incorporated into the development to improve and enhance the customer experience.

Location and 
transportation

Most of Dexus’s portfolio is strategically located in Australia’s major cities with strong multi-modal transport 
networks. Our site acquisition strategy is considerate of the transport attributes. We encourage active transport 
use of our customers by providing end-of-trip facilities in our properties and supporting initiatives such as access 
to bicycle maintenance through our online property portals.

Developments seeking Green Star Buildings certification are directed to integrate multi-modal transportation 
access and facilities issues in the relevant category credits (Transport in Green Star Design & As Built v1.3; Places 
Category in Green Star Buildings v1).

102  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Element Dexus’s approach

Supply chain Dexus’s Sustainable Procurement Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct are included in all developer contracts 
and direct suppliers to comply with relevant legislation and contribute to our sustainability objectives.

Water 
consumption/ 
management

We focus on sound water management through designing new properties to achieve minimum NABERS Water 
standards (office and retail), water capture (such as rainwater) opportunities and reuse and the specification 
and installation of water-efficient fixtures. 

Developments seeking Green Star Buildings certification are directed to integrate water consumption and 
management issues in relevant category credits (Water for Green Star Design & As Built v1.3; Positive Category 
for Green Star Buildings v1).

Water management is integrated into the whole-of-building design process, and projects seek to exceed 
relevant energy codes and achieve Dexus’s Green Star and NABERS Water (office and retail) ambitions. Common 
requirements and measures included in developments are:

 – Requiring high efficiency fixtures to enhance indoor water efficiency

 – Requiring drought tolerant native landscaping and use of non-potable water application to capture 
alternative water sources (rainwater, stormwater, greywater) for non-potable water uses and outdoor uses to 
enhance outdoor water efficiency

 – Water system commissioning and tuning to enhance process water efficiency

 – Leak detection systems

 – Occupant sensors to control water flows

 – Sub-metering of water uses in buildings

Waste 
management

We focus on waste management through development and implementation of construction and operational 
waste management plans. We consider a long-term ownership view in the design of spaces to accommodate 
the prevailing operational waste management practices.

Developments seeking Green Star Buildings certification are directed to integrate waste management issues in 
relevant category credits (Operational Waste, Construction and Demolition Waste credit guidelines for Green 
Star Design & As Built v1.3; Responsible Category for Green Star Buildings v1).

Expected inclusions within construction waste management plans are:

 – Construction waste signage

 – Targets for waste stream recovery, reuse and recycling

 – Waste separation facilities

 – Waste monitoring (including hazardous and non-hazardous waste monitoring)

Contractors have financial incentives to recover, reuse and recycle building materials through avoided costs 
associated with sending waste to landfill. We educate employees on appropriate waste management and 
support contractors to deliver waste management education at our development sites.

2.3  Stakeholder engagement
Building and nurturing strong working relationships with our stakeholders is critical to our value creation. Our key stakeholders 
include investors, third party capital partners, customers, communities, our people, suppliers, government, and media. We aim 
to build lasting relationships with our stakeholders through an active program of engagement activities. As part of our periodic 
materiality assessment, we involve groups of our key stakeholders to help identify key issues that impact our ability to create 
value for our stakeholders over the short, medium and long term. The table below identifies our key stakeholder groups and how 
we engage with them. Additional detail is also available in the Dexus Stakeholder Engagement Guideline at 
www.dexus.com/corporategovernance. 

Stakeholder group Engagement objectives and activities

Dexus (DXS)  
investors

Dexus is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX: DXS) and has a large investor base of 
more than 29,000 Security holders. The majority of securities are owned by institutional investors 
such as superannuation funds, active equities managers, sovereign wealth funds and index funds. 
More than half of our investors are based offshore, with strong representation from North America, 
Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia.

Objectives
Our engagement with investors aims to:

 – Educate investors about our business and listed vehicles on our platform using accurate,  
timely and comprehensive information

 – Understand investors’ perceptions about us

 – Exercise best endeavours to assist in Dexus’s security price reflecting fair value

 – Enhance interest in Dexus as a suitable investment proposition

 – Maintain a diversified investor base

 – Benchmark our performance using ESG surveys and questionnaires

How we engage
Dexus has an Investor Relations and Communications Strategy that promotes an informed 
market and encourages participation with investors. This strategy involves providing an open 
and ongoing two-way dialogue with the investment community and other key stakeholders that 
integrates the communication of financial and operational performance and regulatory reporting 
requirements. Enquiries and feedback received from Dexus investors are addressed in a timely 
manner in accordance with Dexus’s policy on the handling of enquiries and complaints.

A core element of our engagement with investors is the comprehensive reporting of our 
performance through:

 – Annual and half-year reports that include property performance metrics, key events that 
have occurred and their impacts on the portfolio including but not limited to acquisitions, 
divestments and developments

 – Annual General Meetings and opportunity to meet the Board of Directors and Executive team

 – Quarterly update on property performance metrics

 – Participation in key broker conferences and events attended by institutional investors globally

 – Hosting tours on key properties to enhance investor understanding of our property portfolio

 – Sustainability performance reporting including current NABERS ratings, Green Star 
certifications, intensity figures for energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as 
efficiency improvement projects

 – Participation in investor ESG surveys and responding to investor requests for ESG information

 – Perception studies completed by third parties to understand investor sentiment and our 
position relative to peers

Stakeholder group Engagement objectives and activities

Third party capital partners 
(unlisted investors)

Dexus’s funds management business has a diversified mix of institutional, wholesale and retail 
investors across its nineteen managed vehicles, with strong representation from Australia, 
plus Asia, North America and Europe. Third party capital is largely sourced from domestic and 
offshore superannuation/pension funds, with sovereign wealth funds, insurance agencies, 
multi-managers, corporations, educational and charitable entities in the institutional space. 
Additionally, individuals, self-managed super funds/discretionary trusts in the retail space are 
also represented.

Objectives
In addition to the objectives for Dexus investors, the funds management business works to:

 – Attract and retain capital from third party partners

 – Inform its third party capital partners (and their advisors) on the broader Dexus business and 
our integrated model

 – Ensure investor confidence in Dexus’s corporate governance processes and management of 
related party conflicts

 – Understand investment, reporting, ESG and regulatory requirements of its diverse investor base

 – Promote transparency and ongoing two-way dialogue

How we engage
Regular quarterly update meetings, consultation meetings, investor day events are held for 
ongoing engagement with the institutional investors and regular communications and webinars 
held for our retail investors and distribution network.

The unlisted pooled funds hold Annual General Meetings. These funds also provide best-in-
class corporate governance through the provision of Investor Advisory Committees comprising 
a combination of majority and minority investors to oversee key fund decisions including related 
party transactions.

Joint venture partners are intimately involved in the management of the portfolio and are 
included in decision-making on all major matters.

Third party capital partners, depending on the vehicle invested in, may receive formal monthly, 
quarterly and annual reports including property and financial performance metrics, comparison 
against benchmarks (where relevant), key events that have occurred and their impacts on the 
portfolio (e.g. acquisitions, divestments, developments).

Third party capital partners also have access to dedicated investor internet portal, enabling 
self-service access to transaction data, investment information and key documentation on the 
investment vehicle.

Government, regulators,  
and industry

We maintain an active and extensive engagement program to represent the interests of Dexus 
with various government authorities, politicians and industry bodies.

Dexus contributes to industry associations through membership fees and sponsorship 
opportunities.

Our involvement in industry associations is designed to contribute to a collective voice that 
champions the property industry’s role in delivering sustainable economic growth.

Dexus does not make political donations or provide gifts to politicians or public servants 
(including hosting or attending events that can be classified as donations). As per the Dexus 
Political Donations Policy, Dexus employees and Directors are prohibited from using Dexus 
funds for political contributions. Where we engage with government we do so in an ethical and 
transparent manner.

Objectives
The objectives of our engagement with government and regulators include:

 – Maintaining our reputation as a contributor to economic growth and leading city outcomes

 – Understanding potential legal and regulatory changes relevant to the Dexus business

 – Ensuring authorities have current information about our properties in their jurisdiction

 – Understanding how we can deliver on civic priorities through our developments and operations, 
including how we can enhance the public realm of our precincts

 – Contributing to industry reform

Stakeholder group Engagement objectives and activities

Government, regulators, 
and industry  
(continued)

How we engage
The Dexus Corporate Affairs and Communications team manages engagement with public 
authorities and industry associations.

We work closely with the main body representing the property industry – the Property Council 
of Australia – to support and encourage effective policy development for the property industry, 
developing recommendations and drafting submissions to government and statutory authorities. 
Dexus is represented on a range of Property Council industry committees and may be requested 
to participate in working groups facilitated by the Property Council. In these situations, Dexus 
representatives act for the benefit of the property industry as a whole. Areas of engagement 
include collaborating on issues such as gender diversity, green buildings, and strategic urban 
planning.

We also work closely with the Committee for Sydney, Committee for Melbourne, Committee for 
Brisbane and Committee for Perth, independent peak advocacy and urban policy think tanks 
that advocate for the cities they represent.

We regularly engage with the industry and broader stakeholder communities through speaking 
engagements, presentations or panel representation, at both Australian and international 
conferences and events.

We engage with local, state and federal government officials and policy makers as needed 
to discuss and present our views regarding issues such as local and state planning, local 
infrastructure and the environmental and social impacts of proposed developments. In 
these engagements, we aim to foster constructive two-way dialogue that aligns Dexus and 
government interests and delivers a mutually beneficial outcome. We undertake political 
engagement activities, including the use of lobbyists, in line with legislative restrictions in the 
various Australian jurisdictions.

The Dexus Risk, Compliance and Governance teams maintain a respectful and transparent 
relationship with regulators and aim to meet any of their requests for information in a timely 
matter. We support regulatory examinations and ensure prompt reporting of compliance 
incidents where required.

Media We engage with local, state and national media to communicate news about our activities that 
is material to markets and of interest to the broader community. We also recognise the value of 
social media as a communication tool.

Objectives
Objectives of our media engagement include:

 – Providing relevant, accurate information about Dexus and its activities to media outlets for 
dissemination

 – Managing and enhancing Dexus’s reputation

How we engage
The Dexus Corporate Affairs and Communications team leads our engagement with mainstream 
media and LinkedIn and is responsible for the coordination of the group’s external messaging to 
ensure accuracy and consistency.

We provide a single point of contact for media outlets for enquiries and, through a coordinated 
program with executives, regularly engage in conversation with key national and state-based 
media representatives. The Dexus Media & External Communication Guidelines provide guidance 
for employees on engaging with the media and ensuring any information provided is accurate 
and appropriate for disclosure. All official Dexus spokespeople undertake media training 
organised by the Corporate Affairs and Communications team.

Dexus maintains a presence on the following social media networks:

 – LinkedIn - www.linkedin.com/company/dexus-property-group/

 – Instagram – www.instagram.com/dexus_community

We use LinkedIn to disseminate stories about our workspace insights and activities. Instagram is 
managed by the Marketing team and is used to market our spaces via imagery. The Dexus Social 
Media Guidelines describe our approach to social media and provides guidance for employees 
on the appropriate use of social media.

We regularly review our media engagement activities, using insights from media monitoring 
providers and social media networks to understand our reach, emerging issues, and trends of 
interest to our stakeholders.

Stakeholder group Engagement objectives and activities

Communities at 
development projects

At all properties (100%) under development, we engage with local communities and relevant 
authorities as part of the development approvals process. Dexus believes that positively 
engaging with local communities and authorities foster good relationships at all stage of the 
development process and post completion.

Objectives
We recognise the value of community consultation on new developments and refurbishments to:

 – Provide relevant and accurate information about Dexus group development projects

 – Understand how development projects may impact local communities and inform mitigation 
activities

 – Receive community and stakeholder group feedback on development design and features

How we engage
The exact methods of community engagement depend on the nature of the development.  
Aspects that are generally included in our approach to community engagement include:

 – Identifying stakeholders that may be impacted by the development

 – Identifying nuisance and/or disruption risks (e.g. noise, traffic changes)

 – Development and implementation of a communication plan to our stakeholders (e.g. hotlines, 
fact sheets)

 – Development and implementation of a monitoring plan (e.g. monitoring issues register)

 – Development and implementation of a risk mitigation plan

108  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Thriving People

Building an engaged, capable and high-performing workforce,  
within an inclusive environment, that delivers on our strategy.  

People and capabilities Thriving people

Our Thriving People objective 
recognises the direct relationship 
between the capability of our people 
and the success of our business.  
When we effectively engage our 
people, develop their capabilities and 
provide opportunities for growth, we 
can harness their full potential and 
enhance our sustained value creation.

The focus areas for our approach  
to Thriving People are:

 – Employee engagement and 
retention: the more enthusiastic 
and engaged our people are, the 
more likely they are to remain at 
Dexus and contribute positively, 
leading to greater productivity 
outcomes, lower recruitment costs 
and increase employee satisfaction. 
We are focused on creating and 
supporting a culture where our 
people are fulfilled by their work 
and have opportunities to grow

 – Professional development: creating 
learning opportunities and offering 
development is a core component 
of attracting and retaining a 
talented workforce. We support the 
ongoing growth of our people by 
providing targeted and structured 
learning and development that 
meets their unique needs

 – Inclusion and diversity: an  
inclusive workplace with a diversity 
of views is a driver of competitive 
advantage. Diversity means valuing 
an individual’s race, gender identity, 
age, religious belief, ethnicity, 
cultural background, economic 
circumstance, disability, expression 
of thought and sexual orientation 
as well as their experiences, 
skills and capabilities to create 
a business environment that 
encourages a range of  
perspectives

 – Workplace health, safety and 
wellbeing: we have a duty of care 
to our people, as well as investors, 
customers, and the wider community 
to ensure workplace health and 
safety (WHS) risks are appropriately 
managed. We recognise that 
safety incorporates more than 
physical safety, with psychological 
safety contributing significantly 
to productivity outcomes and 
employee engagement. We value 
our people and recognise the 
intrinsic importance of their health 
and wellbeing as well as its impact 
on business performance

The boundary for our approach 
encompasses all Dexus employees 
across our corporate offices and site-
based teams within the Dexus group 
portfolio.

3.1  Roles and responsibilities
Several areas of our business, under the leadership of the Board and Group Management Committee (GMC), collaborate to 
deliver our objective of Thriving People. The table below provides insight into the relevant management structure and policy 
framework.

Several policies are publicly available at www.dexus.com/corporategovernance.

Our purpose
The Dexus Purpose was defined by our 
people and sets out themes that guide 
us on our value creation journey. These 
themes include:

 – Who we are: We are a passionate 
and agile team who want to make 
a difference

 – Why we come to work: We create 
spaces where people thrive

 – What we believe in: We are here 
to create value for customers, 
investors, communities and our 
people

 – How we behave and what we value: 
Openness, trust, empowerment, 
integrity

We set annual goals relating to our 
Thriving People focus areas and report 
on progress against these goals in our 
Annual Reporting Suite.

3.2  Employee engagement 
and performance

We nurture and sustain an engaged, 
high-performing workforce that 
embraces our purpose and is motivated 
to deliver on Dexus’s strategy. Employee 
Engagement represents the level of 
enthusiasm and connection employees 
have with Dexus. It is a measure of how 
motivated people are to put in extra 
effort and a sign of how committed 
they are to staying. Engaged 
employees are more likely to generate 
and implement innovative ideas, apply 
discretionary effort and act as brand 
custodians.

110  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report

http://www.dexus.com/corporategovernance


We survey our people at least twice 
per year to understand levels of 
engagement and sentiment around 
workplace circumstances such 
as inclusion and diversity, change 
management, and health and 
wellbeing. An outcome of these 
surveys is an Employee Engagement 
Score, which we use as our key metric 
for tracking and is comprised of 
five engagement questions which 
encompass connection, motivation and 
commitment. We also analyse survey 
results by business unit to understand 
how sentiment varies across Dexus 
and to identify any focus areas. We set 
Employee Engagement Score targets 
in our annual reporting and use survey 
results to inform action plans to lift 
engagement where required.

The Dexus Purpose is an important 
component of how we engage our 
employees and instill the right culture. 
The purpose directs our people 
to focus on value creation for our 
investors, customers, employees and 
communities. It reinforces our values  
of openness and trust, empowerment 
and integrity.

Employee attraction  
and retention
Attraction, engagement and retention 
of employees is an integrated and 
continuous process. The GMC conducts 
a talent management and capability 
assessment and the Board People & 
Remuneration Committee oversees  
this process.

Our recruitment model incorporates  
the following aspects:

 – Attraction – Using advanced 
recruitment technology to support 
an enhanced best practice 
recruitment process, supported by 
hiring managers who have been 
educated on unconscious bias

 – Attraction – Operating a careers 
website to capture talent pools 
for key job segments. This process 
provides an efficient way to access 
a diverse range of talent pools, 
enabling the group to attract the 
best people effectively

 – Attraction – Regularly updated 
Employee Value Proposition (EVP) 
with key values clearly articulated 
throughout recruitment process

 – Retention – Promoting 
opportunities internally to aid 
career development

 – Retention – Pipelining and 
developing internal candidates  
for future opportunities

Performance management  
and role clarity
Employees undertake ongoing  
check-ins with their managers to:

 – Agree on and evaluate progress 
against targets and objectives

 – Agree on a personal  
development plan

 – Discuss personal flexibility needs 

We adopt a Scorecard methodology 
to manage executive and employee 
performance, which measures 
contribution and achievements against 
threshold, stretch and outperformance 
targets. Scorecards also motivate all 
leaders and employees to strive for 
outperformance within their teams.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) 
are agreed with each employee in 
collaboration with their manager, to 
provide a measurable yardstick against 
actual performance. KPIs align with 
organisational goals and values, and 
vary for each employee depending on 
their role. Our 3+1 approach to setting 
personal objectives directs employees 
to set three individual KPIs that align 
with organisational goals, and a 
personal Thrive goal that identifies the 
one simple thing they need to thrive. 
Thrive goals can relate to factors 
such as career, passion, flexibility, 
development, health or volunteering.

Reward, recognition and benefits
We recognise and reward employees 
who contribute to the success and 
growth of the group. Our remuneration 
structure is based on:

 – Market competitiveness

 – Alignment of performance 
payments with the achievement 
of financial and operational 
objectives that support the group’s 
risk management framework and 
values-based culture

 – A targeted mix of remuneration 
components including immediate 
performance payments and 
deferred performance payments 
linked to returns over the longer 
term

The Board People & Remuneration 
Committee reviews trends in employee 
reward structures and strategies in 
other comparable companies. The 
annual employee remuneration review 
considers gender pay gaps to maintain 
gender pay equity.

All employees are employed in Australia 
and are paid a living wage above 
the Australian National Employment 
Standards.

Key components of our reward and 
recognition program are:

 – Fixed Pay – each position is 
matched to a comparable industry 
role using benchmark data and 
continually reviews and assesses our 
position with an aim to be market 
leaders

 – Benefits – comprises a Wellbeing 
Subsidy ($100 per month), Dexus 
Days (5 days of additional leave 
annually), Employee Share 
Ownership Plan ($1,000 grant per 
annum) and other employment, 
lifestyle and financial benefits

 – Incentives – Group Incentive Plan, 
Recognition Pool, Short- and Long-
Term Incentive plans. Performance is 
generally assessed over a one-year 
period commencing 1 July however, 
senior management and executives 
also focus on a longer time horizon 
through the deferred elements of 
the Short-Term incentive plan (1 
and 2 years) and the Long-Term 
incentive plan (3 and 4 years)

Our Recognition Pool ensures that we 
reward performance that goes above 
and beyond daily tasks, allowing 
for the acknowledgement of great 
performance through non-financial 
means. 

Some of the rewards in the Recognition 
Pool include:

 – Peer acknowledgement through 
forums and employee updates

 – Additional time off above and 
beyond standard allowances

 – Education of interest to the 
individual, including attendance at 
courses, seminars and conferences

 – Experiences of interest to  
the individual

Dexus offers several employee benefits 
in line with contemporary Australian 
market practice. Benefits are offered 
regardless of full-time or part-time 
employment status but may be pro-
rated in the case of leave and life 
insurance benefits, which are based 
on the employee’s regular salary level. 
Temporary employees engaged via 
a labour hire agency or contracting 
agreement receive benefits from their 
primary employer, the cost of which 
is factored into the hourly rate or 
service fee paid by Dexus. Temporary 
employees are not eligible for the 
following benefits: leave benefits, life 
and disability insurance, membership to 
the corporate discount program, study 
assistance.

Minimum notice periods for 
Dexus employees
Notice periods at Dexus vary 
depending upon level of seniority of 
the role. The position of CEO must 
provide 6 months’ notice of intention 
to resign, and senior executives must 
provide three months’ notice of their 
intention to resign from their respective 
positions. The minimum notice period 
for termination of fixed term and 
permanent employees’ employment 
is two weeks’ during probation and 
one month notice once ongoing 
employment has been confirmed.  
For casual employees the notice  
period is 1 week.

Managing organisational 
changes
Effectively delivering against both our 
strategic and operational requirements 
now and in the future results in 
consideration of our organisational 
capacity and the need for change.   

Change initiatives vary in size and 
nature but can include adjustments to 
organisation structures, policy, process, 
behaviours or a combination of these. 

Organisational changes are managed 
by identifying and assessing the 
change objectives, likely impact, 
stakeholders, dependencies, risks 
and benefits. When a program of 
change is endorsed, the business unit 
or leader sponsoring the change is 
accountable for overseeing stakeholder 
management, communications and 
reporting progress to Management.

Where a change involves organisational 
redesign, consideration is given to the 
capability requirements aligned with 
our strategic and operational goals. 
Where organisational redesign results 
in significant changes or the closure 
of a role, employees are informed in a 
reasonable timeframe and wherever 
possible, impacted employees are 
provided development to meet the role 
requirements or internally redeployed. 
Employees who involuntarily leave 
Dexus may be eligible for career 
transition support services, including 
personal coaching, retraining, tools and 
support to assist with exploring career 
options.

We provide career transition support 
that is tailored to the seniority of the 
individual and the role opportunities 
that match their experience and skillset.  
All levels of career transition support 
include access to a marketplace of 
services for the individual to use “points” 
allocated to select the wellbeing, 
career coaching, reskilling and career 
strategies to meet their personalised 
goals. 

Employees remain eligible for our 
Employee Assistance Program for up to 
three months post their employment 
to provide additional personal support 
through any transition.

3.3  Learning and 
development

At Dexus we take a blended learning 
approach, recognising that the best 
learning comes from a variety of 
methods:

 – Experience: learning through doing

 – Exposure: learning through others

 – Education: formal learning such 
as classroom sessions and online 
learning

We design and implement a 
comprehensive learning and 
development curriculum to build 
employees’ skills, knowledge and 
experience to deliver business 
objectives. The Training and Education 
Policy outlines the objectives for 
training employees with a focus on 
strategic training needs that Dexus  
has identified:

 – Ensuring that our people maintain 
the necessary knowledge, skills and 
experience required to perform their 
job functions and responsibilities 
fairly, honestly and efficiently

 – Developing new knowledge and 
skills to foster innovation and to 
grow employees’ capabilities

 – Updating knowledge and skills for 
changes to legislation, regulatory 
policies and standards, company 
policies and procedures, economic 
and financial developments, new 
products and new market practices

 – Ensuring compliance with relevant 
industry training standards and 
qualifications

 – Increasing awareness of our 
compliance policies and 
expectations relating to ethics and 
integrity

Managers work with each employee 
to ensure they have the necessary 
capacity, competence, knowledge, 
training, seniority and skills to perform 
their role.

Our people work with their managers 
to prepare and implement individual 
training and development plans to 
maintain and build upon their skills, 
knowledge and career experiences. 
Activities include executive coaching, 
support mentoring programs, study 
assistance and a talent management 
process designed to promote employee 
development.

Training activities also extend to 
developing the capabilities of the 
group’s partner providers, including on-
site training of facilities management 
teams in the operation of enhanced 
building management systems and 
customer service.

Leadership development
We conduct leadership development 
programs to enhance consistent 
capabilities of management and to 
drive commercial and cultural change. 
Our leadership program includes 
individualised development plans 
that target improvement in specific 
behaviours, skills and knowledge, along 
with experiences to enable success in 
the leadership role. Lead @ Dexus is our 
core leadership program, which aims to 
create alignment on the expectations 
common to all leaders across Dexus, 
whether they are leading others, teams, 
or the organisation.

An online performance management 
system is used to manage and improve 
the abilities of managers and to 
facilitate employee self-development.

People managers participate in 
a Manage @ Dexus series which 
comprises a series of lessons which 
equip new and developing managers 
to meet team leadership and role 
responsibilities.

Directors attend facilitated education 
and training events to meet their 
Continuing Professional Development 
requirements and contribute to their 
obligations set by the Australian 
Institute of Company Directors.

3.4  Inclusion and diversity
We are committed to attracting and 
retaining a diverse workforce that 
brings a range of perspectives and 
helps us execute our strategy in an 
ever-changing business environment.

Diversity policies and practices
Our Inclusion and Diversity Policy 
embraces diversity in gender 
identity, race, age, disability, sexual 
orientation, nationality, education, 
socioeconomic background, work 
experience, relationship status, family/
carer responsibilities and personality. 
These factors influence the unique 
perspectives that our employees bring 
to the workplace. Our people should 
feel safe and empowered to bring their 
whole selves to work every day.

Set out on page 114 is a summary of the 
objectives and approaches within our 
inclusion and diversity strategy.

Gender diversity and pay parity
Dexus is recognised as an Employer 
of Choice for Gender Equality by 
the Workplace Gender Equality 
Agency (WGEA), an affirmation of 
our commitment to building gender 
diversity and sustaining gender equality 
within our workforce.

We have a target to achieve 40:40:20 
gender representation in senior and 
executive management roles by FY25.

Dexus is committed to closing the 
gender pay gap, with a goal to 
achieving and maintaining pay parity 
in like-for-like roles.

Our approach to achieving gender 
pay parity is consistent with WGEA 
guidance, and includes:

 – Reducing the absolute pay gap 
through progressive action and the 
40:40:20 target

 – Monitoring the market-relative pay 
gap, which benchmarks employee 
pay against appropriate market 
benchmarks, and taking action 
to rectify any material variation 
between how females or males are 
positioned against the relevant 
benchmarks

 – Monitoring the peer-relative pay 
gap, which compares the average 
female and male full-time fixed pay 
where the same role is occupied 
by at least three individuals from 
each gender, and taking action to 
rectify any instances where female 
and male pay varies significantly in 
these ‘like-for- like’ roles

Dexus’s approach to achieving gender 
pay parity has been endorsed by 
WGEA. It is designed to progressively 
close the gender pay gap, provide 
assurance that the remuneration 
offered to employees is both ‘fair’ 
and ‘equitable’, and identify where 
there may be cases of conscious or 
unconscious bias in the application of 
our remuneration approach.

Other initiatives focused on supporting 
gender diversity include:

 – Future Leaders in Property – this 
program targets high school girls 
interested in exploring career 
opportunities within the property 
industry, and is aligned to active 
projects in Dexus’s development 
pipeline

 – Champions of Change Coalition 
– Darren Steinberg, Dexus CEO, 
champions gender equity within 
the property industry as part of the 
Champions of Change Coalition

 – Conferences and panels – 
Encouraging gender balanced 
forums and panels for internal 
and external events, as well as 
encouraging Dexus’s external 
partners, suppliers and conference 
organisers to adopt Dexus’s 
approach

114  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Supporting parents and carers
We provide paid parental leave for 
both primary and non-primary carers 
regardless of gender. All parental leave 
benefits exceed statutory minimums 
and are available to eligible employees 
regardless of whether they are also 
eligible for government-issued benefits.

We do not have a minimum 
employment period eligibility 
requirement for access to these 
benefits.

We recognise the gender imbalance 
regarding traditional caring 
responsibilities and actively encourage 
male employees to access paid 
parental leave entitlements. We 
ensure continuity of superannuation 
throughout unpaid parental leave and 
provide a return-to-work program to 
supporting employees transitioning 
from parenting to work (both part-time 
and full-time).

Our inclusive Parental Leave Policy 
complements our goals of attracting 
and retaining the best talent and our 
purpose of creating spaces where 
people thrive. This is demonstrated by:

 – Return to work targets being 
consistently achieved, which 
is indicative of our strong 
engagement with working parents, 
our strategic talent framework and 
constructive culture

 – An increase in males taking paid 
primary carer leave which supports 
our gender equality agenda

 – Increasing numbers of employee 
supported with job security and 
career continuation within the first 
year of employment

 – Continued participation with ‘Pink 
Elephants’, Dexus’s support of this 
charity that supports employees 
and families who’ve experienced 
miscarriage and early pregnancy 
loss.

Parent and care support at Dexus 
goes further than support during the 
early stages of parenthood. We have 
partnered with ‘Parents At Work’, a 
leading expert consultancy providing 
work and family education to provide 
Dexus parents and carers with access 
to their Work + Family Hub. The 
hub provides resources to support 
employees as they prepare for leave, 
manage their carer responsibilities 
or plan to support someone else. 
Employees are invited to join 
interactive webinars throughout the 
year to connect with others and share 
experiences on how to make the work-
life juggle work.

Flexible job design
We strive to create a work environment 
which encourages and promotes a 
healthy work-life balance and offers 
flexible working hours to support this. 
Our Flexible Work Policy enables our 
people to arrange flexible working 
arrangements with their manager.

The policy seeks to increase personal 
wellbeing and employee engagement, 
improve team performance and 
motivation, maximise productivity and 
retain talent.

Our Flexibility Policy underpins our 
commitment to a culture of inclusion 
and workplace gender equality, 
providing our people the flexibility to 
choose their place of work that best 
supports their productivity.

Diversity networks,  
initiatives, events
We have established several networks 
and initiatives that embed inclusion 
across the organisation and recognise 
diversity in all its forms:

 – The Dexus TRIBE Network is 
an employee-led group that 
celebrates LGBTI+ inclusion in the 
workplace, supporting Dexus’s 
broader commitment to enabling 
psychological safety at work

 – The Reconciliation Action Plan 
Working Group (RAP WG) is a 
cross-functional and national 
working group, established to 
progress the main objectives of the 
Reflect RAP and to ensure that we 
deliver a meaningful contribution 
to reconciliation. NAIDOC Week 
and National Reconciliation 
Week are recognised annually 
to acknowledge the history, 
and celebrate the culture and 
achievements of First Nations 
people

 – Dexus participates in the Share-
A-Book program where books are 
donated to indigenous, refugee and 
marginalised communities

 – Dexus also celebrates cultural 
diversity on through the 
acknowledgement and celebration 
of various days of cultural 
significance throughout the year

 – International Women’s Day is 
celebrated annually to recognise 
the success of all the women across 
Dexus

Human rights
 – Our Human Rights Policy outlines 

commitments to sustainable 
procurement, First Nations rights, 
equal opportunity and human 
rights legislation. Dexus reviews and 
monitors human rights against the 
policy internally and with key service 
providers and business partners. 
Pages 133-138 detail our approach 
to supply chain management, 
including upholding human rights 
and addressing modern slavery.

The Dexus People and Culture team 
use a human rights due diligence 
process including an identity 
and visa status check during the 
recruitment process. Any material 
issues such as a candidate’s inability 
to evidence their right to work will 
lead to the abandonment of potential 
employment. All Dexus employees 
earn wages above Australian legal 
minimums and are free to associate 
and enter into collective bargaining 
agreements.

We uphold human rights in our 
workplace through:

 – Building an inclusive and diverse 
workplace that is free from 
discrimination, bullying and 
harassment, and that offers equal 
opportunity in career advancement

 – Providing leave entitlements and 
other benefits enabling employees 
to enjoy the right to family, 
recreation and work-life balance

 – Focusing on employee health and 
safety through risk management 
and wellbeing initiatives

 – Training employees so they can 
recognise the occurrence of 
discrimination, modern slavery, and 
other human rights abuses, and feel 
confident to speak up

Other focus areas identified by our 
People and Culture team in recent 
human rights assessments include:

 – Addressing the gap in 
superannuation to primary carers 
due to taking parental leave

 – Reviewing policies and support 
systems available to employees 
suffering from domestic violence

 – Providing services and support 
systems to employees experiencing 
mental health concerns

We conduct exit surveys for staff 
that leave the business. The surveys 
help Dexus determine whether 
organisational culture or human rights 
considerations contributed to an 
employee’s departure.

3.5  Health and wellbeing
Safe & Well
Dexus has established a Safe & Well 
program to support the mental, 
physical, financial and work wellbeing 
of our people. Safe & Well provides a 
breadth of resources, freely accessible 
to Dexus employees. These resources 
work alongside our partnership with 
Benestar (also known as the Employee 
Assistance Program), which offers 
counselling and coaching services to all 
employees and their families. We also 
partner with the Black Dog Institute 
who specialise in the research of mental 
health and provide support through 
programs, digital tools, apps, clinical 
services and public resources.

Safe & Well supports the mental 
wellbeing of our people through:

 – Access to services and information 
from mental health groups

 – E-learning education programs

 – Mindfulness tools

 – Educational videos on resilience, 
managing stress for positive 
change, and maintaining mental 
health during a crisis

Safe & Well supports the physical 
wellbeing of our people through:

 – Medical offerings such as flu 
vaccinations

 – Health insurance offer with 
Medibank for savings on private 
health insurance (note that Dexus 
employees who are Australian 
citizens or permanent residents 
have access to healthcare through 
the Australian Government, 
regardless of whether they purchase 
private health insurance)

 – Resources to support healthy 
movement and sleep patterns

 – Nutrition advice and resources

Safe & Well supports the financial 
wellbeing of our people through:

 – Dexus days to promote wellbeing

 – Wellbeing allowance of $100 added 
to all employee pay each month

 – Gifting of Dexus securities through 
the Employee Share Ownership Plan 
(provides $1,000 of Dexus securities 
every year to all full- and part-time 
permanent employees)

 – Benefits associated with Dexus’s 
preferred superannuation provider, 
MLC

Safe & Well supports the work wellbeing 
of our people through:

 – Clarity in objectives and 
expectations, through our 3+1 
approach to setting personal KPIs 
(page 111)

 – Our check-in culture that promotes 
continuous feedback

 – Connecting our people with each 
other across the business through 
social and networking events

 – Collaboration systems that enable 
our people to work together 
effectively

Our people also have access to  
the wellbeing products and services 
(page 116).

Maintaining a safe workspace
Our Work Health, Safety and Liability 
(WHS&L) statement demonstrates 
Dexus commitment to WHS&L. We 
recognise we have a duty of care to 
our investors, tenants, employees, 
agents and the wider community to 
ensure all Work Health, Safety and 
Liability (WHS&L) risks in our property 
portfolio are appropriately managed. 
To achieve this, we have implemented 
a comprehensive ISO 45001:2018 
accredited workplace health and 
safety management system to 
ensure the effective management of 
WHS&L risks across the portfolio. The 
Statement governs the development, 
management and monitoring of 
tailored WHS&L risk management 
systems, training of personnel, and 
designation of responsibilities and 
resources to meet program obligations. 
It also governs the group’s Return to 
Work policy for injured employees, 
in addition to the monitoring, 
evaluating and reporting of our WHS&L 
performance. 

116  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



The key legislation governing WHS at 
Dexus is the Work Health and Safety 
Act and Regulations that varies across 
the states where Dexus operates.

We implement a comprehensive 
workplace health and safety program 
that is certified under ISO 45001:2018, 
an internationally applied standard 
for occupational health and safety 
management systems. Through this 
system, we comprehensively monitor 
the health and safety of employees 
and manage solutions to prevent 
workplace incidents, risks and 
occupational diseases.

Employee health and safety is 
supported by our Periskope risk 
management system, which contains 
information on WHS and property- 
related incidents and risk assessments, 
manuals, guidance material, tasks 
management and audit information.

Upon inception and at least annually, 
employees are trained on Dexus’s 
health and safety management system 
and the use of systems including 
Periskope. Employees are made aware 
of their roles and responsibilities 
regarding risk identification and 
reporting. Incident reports must be 
completed for all incidents within 
24 hours or as soon as reasonably 
practicable. If the incident involves 
a Dexus employee, it also must be 
reported to the Return-to-Work 
coordinator and the Risk team as soon 
as reasonably practicable.

We encourage our people to come 
forward with concerns and report 
incidents without fear of reprisals. 
The Dexus Whistleblower Policy and 
independent disclosure service are 
also available to Dexus employees 
who wish to raise concerns under the 
protections available to whistleblowers 
per Australian legislation.

Health and safety programs are 
subject to annual external audit and 
improvement plans are monitored 
by the Risk team and the Dexus 
Workplace Health, Safety and 
Environment (WHS&E) Committee. WHS 
risk management is also overseen by 
the Corporate Executive Committee 
(CEC), Group Management Committee 
(GMC), Board Risk Committee and the 
Board.

To reinforce a risk aware culture that 
prioritises health and safety, we have 
embedded WHS into the Group 
Scorecard through a safety audit score 
and we maintain a standing target of 
zero fatalities.

Information on the applicability of our 
WHS&L Statement and program at 
our properties is provided at page 116 
(customers, occupants, visitors) and 
page 138 (contractors).

Dexus Workplace Health, Safety 
& Environment Committee
The Dexus Workplace Health, Safety 
& Environment (WHS&E) Committee is 
open to all employees and functions to:

 – Champion health, safety and 
environment initiatives in the 
workplace

 – Participate and consult in  
WHS&E matters

 – Ensure Dexus workers are 
represented in health and  
safety matters

 – Facilitate co-operation in 
instigating, developing and carrying 
out measures to improve the health 
and safety of workers

 – Assist in the ongoing development 
of safety standards, rules and 
procedures

 – Consider and address findings 
from health and safety audits or 
monitoring reports

Ergonomics
An important component of our 
approach to ensuring a safe and 
healthy work environment is the 
provision of appropriate workstations 
and resolving any ergonomic issues 
that may arise. All employees complete 
an ergonomic self-assessment and 
develop an action plan (if required) 
with their manager. If an employee 
identifies an ergonomic hazard, it is to 
be reported to their manager who will 
report the issue to the Risk team or the 
People & Culture team.

A WHS&E team representative can 
provide assistance completing a risk 
assessment and/or provide guidance 
in the use of the Dexus Workstation 
Arrangement guide and implement 
associated controls. Where appropriate 
we will engage an ergonomist to 
assist in this process. To support an 
autonomous hybrid working model, our 
employees complete a Flexible Working 
Hazard checklist for workspaces outside 
of a Dexus corporate office location. 
The checklist ensures that employees 
engaging in flexible or remote work are 
in a safe and appropriate environment. 

In addition to incorporating WHS 
training and an ergonomic self-
assessment, the checklist evaluates 
the proposed working environment for 
common hazards such as electrical, 
fire, trip hazards, and other potential 
concerns. All checklists must be 
reviewed and signed off by the 
employee’s manager.

Employee Work Health &  
Safety Training
We ensure all our employees are 
provided with adequate information, 
instruction and training to perform their 
job safely.

All Dexus employees undertake 
the Dexus WHS&E induction upon 
commencement of employment. Our 
People and Culture team maintain a 
record of employee attendance and 
ensures that employees can access the 
Dexus Employee Handbook.

The WHS&E representatives, Risk team, 
and People and Culture team identify 
all additional WHS&E competencies for 
the organisation and assign training 
to employees as required. The People 
and Culture team assists our employees 
in maintaining a training plan that 
is documented in each employee’s 
performance management process 
and reviewed twice per year. Additional 
WHS&E training responsibilities are 
assigned to employees with regard to:

 – WHS&E competency requirements 
of existing policies and procedures

 – WHS&E competency requirements 
of safe work practices

 – Levels of risk associated  
with work roles

 – Specific licensing requirements  
(if any)

 – Any industry qualifications that  
may be required to carry out 
particular task

Thriving People evaluation 
framework
We use the principles of impact 
mapping to communicate how our 
sustainability approach activities 
lead to benefit for Dexus and our 
stakeholders. The outputs, outcomes 
and impacts in the impact map also 
serve as indicators for us to evaluate 
our performance and continuously 
enhance our approach. Several of the 
indicators are reported annually in our 
Annual Reporting Suite.

Our approach to building technology
Dexus’s approach to building technology seeks to digitally enable our buildings to maximise value for all stakeholders and 
establish Dexus as a leader in implementing proptech (property technology). Technology can maximise value through 
managing risk, reducing costs and increasing revenues. It can also enhance the health and wellbeing of customers as well as 
their overall experience with the building, while reducing energy consumption and impact on the environment. Meeting these 
objectives necessitates an approach that avoids gimmicks and directs investment into scalable solutions that can deliver value 
across our portfolio.

Dexus’s Building Technology Team leads the delivery of our Building Technology Strategy and Smart Building Blueprint. Dexus’s 
cross-functional Smart Building Collaboration Team combines internal expertise with contributions from external partners 
including consultants, suppliers, and industry groups to ensure a consistent, holistic approach to technology deployment across 
our assets.

The motivation, value drivers, strategic outcomes, and priority enablers of our Building Technology Strategy are summarised in 
the table below.

Dexus Building Technology Strategy

Vision: “Digitally enable our buildings to maximise value for all stakeholders”

Motivation

 – Digitisation of products and services

 – Technology explosion and rate of change

 – New opportunities

 – Customer demand

 – Real estate transformation and disruption

Priority enablers

 – Premium connectivity

 – Portfolio standardisation

 – Portfolio-scale procurement

 – Cyber security framework for buildings

 – Resilient buildings

Value drivers

Revenue

 – Customer experience and brand to attract  
and retain customers

 – Catalogue of customer proptech services

management, cardless visitor 
management, digital concierge

 – Occupancy sensors with real time 
people tracking

Building technology supports the 
delivery of the Dexus Sustainability 
Approach through enabling emissions

Our Customer Promise
Our aspiration is to build the world’s 
best office platform, renowned for 
customer centricity and consistently 
outperforming industry benchmarks. 
Our Customer Promise drives the way 
in which we operate and contributes 
to our goal of being a workplace 
partner of choice. We know that our 
customers are more likely to be satisfied 
when we listen to their concerns and 
address their needs. Our customer-
centric approach is underpinned by our 
Customer Promise to:

 – Listen, understand and respond to 
customer needs

 – Make things ‘simple and easy’

 – Innovate to enrich the customer 
experience 

We take an active leasing approach 
to drive portfolio performance and 
reduce forward lease expiry. Our ‘simple 
and easy’ lease is designed to simplify 
negotiations and adopts a common- 
sense approach centred on creating a 
partnership with our customers in the 
execution of the lease. Our portfolio-
wide approach to forward leasing 
provides flexibility to accommodate 
customers’ needs within the group 
portfolio, enhancing customer retention 
and minimising downtime.

We value our customers’ opinions and 
actively engage to assess customer 
satisfaction levels, gather feedback on 
our performance, and gain insights to 
drive innovation.

We have conducted annual 
customer surveys since 2013 to 
understand customer sentiment, drive 
improvements, and monitor the impact 
of initiatives. Our survey encompasses 
the performance of our people, 
buildings and services, plus customer 
future needs and general feedback. 
In recent years, we have also included 
questions around workplace responses 
to COVID-19 and remote working levels.

4.2  Customer workspace 
and professional 
services

Dexus’s product and service offering 
aims to provide a seamless, efficient 
customer experience that maximises 
customer satisfaction with their 
workspace and with property 
management. We understand that 
when our customers are satisfied, they 
are more likely to renew their lease with 
us for longer periods and refer us to 
their peers.

Listening to our customers, we have 
curated a range of services that 
are carefully designed to satisfy the 
everyday needs and enhance the 
experience of the people who work in 
our properties. The services we provide 
are grouped into the four key pillars of 
Wellbeing, Convenience, Community 
and Sustainability.

 – Wellbeing: Offering services and 
amenities that promote the health 
and wellbeing of customers through 
quality end-of-trip facilities, yoga, 
Pilates and fitness classes

 – Convenience: Delivering a 
convenient work experience 
through five-star concierge, 
transport solutions, simple and 
easy leases, and access to Dexus 
Place, a tailored extension of our 
customers’ work environment that 
includes meeting, training and 
conference facilities and bespoke 
event space supported by state-
of-the-art technology

 – Community: Creating customer 
communities through activations 
in our office foyers, on-site retailers 
and online property portals 
providing workplace news and 
information, events and retail 
offerings

 – Sustainability: Working with our 
customers to achieve energy, water 
and waste efficiencies for their 
tenancies along with sustainable 
fit-out designs

Key activities include:

 – Customer Support Centre – 
operational 24 hours a day, 7 days 
a week for customers to raise and 
track service requests, view and 
update account details, retrieve 
lease correspondence, and access 
itemised invoices and tenancy 
payments

 – Project Delivery Group – Dexus’s in-
house service that offers customers 
project management and capital 
works delivery for office fit-outs

 – Security services – security 
personnel to facilitate safe building 
operation, visitor management, and 
after-hours access

 – Concierge services – five-star 
concierge service at selected 
properties providing on-site 
assistance to customers, occupants, 
and visitors

 – Mobility services – car sharing and 
car parking solutions (for example, 
Divvy)

 – Flexible space arrangements – 
offerings such as Dexus Place, 
which provides off-site workspaces 
and telepresence immersive 
conferencing experience, as well 
as SuiteX, which provides pre-fit 
spaces for short term leases that 
provide flexibility for evolving 
businesses

 – Speculative suites – provides 
bespoke feel pre-fit spaces for 
small businesses who normally 
would not have access to premium 
office towers

 – National leasing team – our leasing 
team works across Australia and 
takes a portfolio-wide approach to 
ensure that we can accommodate 
customers’ needs in the group 
portfolio as they grow and change

management consulting service, 
helping customers to align their 
workplaces with organisational 
goals and strategy

4.3  Networking and 
customer connection

Every Dexus office property is a 
community of individuals. As a landlord, 
we support the customer experience by 
facilitating connections within property 
communities through networking 
events, exclusive offers from retailers, 
and charity activations. We know that 
when individuals feel connected to 
others and to their workspace, that 
they look forward to coming into work 
and are more engaged, which has 
a positive impact on our customers’ 
businesses.

We facilitate networking and 
community connection within many of 
our office buildings through:

 – Online building portal – a platform 
to inform customers of important 
information and activations within 
the property, including events and 
activations

 – Events and activations – a curated 
program of networking events, 
wellbeing activations, cultural and 
diversity celebrations that create 
community cohesion and enhance 
customer experience

 – Retail offerings, partnerships and 
promotions – exclusive offers that 
connect Dexus customers to each 
other, and provide them with the 
services and products that they 
need

4.4  Occupant health, 
safety and wellbeing  

We seek to be a market leader when it 
comes to the safety of our properties, 
including the prevention of physical 
harm, stopping the spread of disease, 
and providing healthy workplace 
environments.

Maintaining safe buildings  
for customers, occupants  
and visitors
All Dexus-managed properties are 
covered by a safety management 
system that is certified against ISO 
45001:2018 to address work health, 
safety and liability property risks.

Hazards and risks are assessed through 
a range of mechanisms including 
regular inspections, third party audits, 
and ongoing communication with 
customers, facility managers, and other 
stakeholders. 

The  inspection and audit program are 
designed to identify, assess and monitor 
risks associated with Dexus properties 
including general housekeeping, 
fire, essential services, plant and 
equipment, building structure, and 
emergency. The inspection and audit 
program is systematically implemented 
with frequency requirements generally 
based on risk. Where hazards 
are found, corrective actions are 
established and logged in Dexus’s risk 
management system (Periskope) to be 
tracked until resolution of hazard.

Customer involvement is critical 
for ensuring a safe and productive 
workplace environment. Dexus 
engages with customers where 
required, to identify, assess and 
mitigate workplace hazards/impacts, 
review risk processes, introduce or 
change monitoring procedures and 
propose changes to premises, work 
systems, plant or substances used.

The Dexus Work Health Safety & 
Liability Manual contains detailed 
instructions on hazard and incident 
reporting, including key steps to be 
taken by stakeholders for each type of 
hazard or incident.

Certain incidents must be escalated to 
Dexus senior management and to the 
relevant regulator depending on the 
nature of the incident, as specified in 
the manual. Dexus senior management 
provides a quarterly report to the Board 
Risk Committee with an update on 
WHSE performance including incidents 
and injuries experienced at Dexus 
assets (and Dexus workplaces). 

Healthy buildings – indoor 
environmental quality
We believe we have an important role 
in enhancing the health and wellbeing 
of our customers by providing a healthy 
physical environment. We recognise 
industry trends towards healthy 
living and evidence-based research 
demonstrating the costs of ill-health to 
corporate productivity.

We have listened to our customers who 
have identified health and wellbeing 
as the highest importance to them and 
their business. Embracing wellness helps 
our customers attract talent. It is part of 
our value proposition, helping to attract 
and retain tenants.

The following activities are 
incorporated into our operational plans 
to ensure healthy indoor environments:

 – Conducting air filter reviews and 
replacements/upgrades

 – Reviewing procedures to ensure 
adequate fresh air ventilation, 
filtration of return air and 
acceptable thermal comfort

 – Updating the air quality 
specifications in Dexus’s 
Environmental Management Manual 
(which will help set expectations for 
future procedures and investment 
related to indoor air quality)

 – Establishing alerting protocols to 
forewarn customers of ambient air 
quality conditions as well as specify 
mitigating actions for facility teams 
to follow

 – We actively manage property 
accessibility, indoor environment 
(internal temperature, humidity 
and air quality), acoustics, access 
to natural light, and overall 
performance to create comfortable 
indoor working environments that 
maximise health and productivity. 
Dexus has also expanded the use 
of NABERS Indoor Environment 
(NABERS IE) ratings across the 
portfolio, to help benchmark indoor 
environmental quality and inform 
continued enhancement of how 
we ensure healthy buildings across 
the portfolio. Dexus is targeting a 
5 star average NABERS IE rating 
for its office portfolio by 2025. At 
select developments, we elect to 
obtain WELL Certification to further 
enhance a property’s health and 
wellbeing performance.

Customer health and wellbeing
Our customers have access to a range 
of health and wellbeing services, 
offerings and amenities within their 
properties and via online building 
portals. Types of amenities available 
include end-of-trip facilities, bicycle 
storage, group fitness, yoga and Pilates 
classes.

4.5  Customer 
environmental 
sustainability

We actively manage the environmental 
performance of our properties and 
target continuous improvement to 
reduce energy consumption, water 
use, and carbon emissions, as well as 
provide optimal working environments. 
This assists our customers in meeting 
their own sustainability objectives 
and priorities by providing workplaces 
that are designed and operate to 
the highest sustainability standards. 
Customers directly benefit via reduced 
costs from resource consumption 
efficiencies and productivity 
improvements from healthier working 
environments.

In all Dexus originated developments, 
we incorporate sustainable design 
principles in new developments and 
rate against the Green Building 
Council of Australia’s (GBCA) Green 
Star Buildings rating tool and highlight 
the Green Star opportunities and 
features in all pre-lease construction 
opportunities.

Operational performance is 
benchmarked using NABERS Energy 
and Water ratings and Green Star 
Performance ratings. Specialist 
systems support the identification 
and rectification of issues in building 
mechanical systems to help maintain 
optimal property performance.

Resource efficiency and  
net zero emissions
As part of Dexus’s target to achieve net 
zero emissions by 30 June 2022 and 
source 100% renewable energy by 2030, 
all Dexus-managed properties are on a 
trajectory to achieve a net zero position 
for base building services. We are also 
committed to working with customers 
to reduce the emissions from customer- 
controlled spaces by 25% by 2030.

To sustain continuous improvements in 
energy and water efficiency across the 
group property portfolio, we use smart 
meters to validate utility bills, identify 
consumption and report anomalies. 
Energy and water sub-metering has 
been installed in key office properties to 
deliver incremental efficiencies.

We engage with customers on 
sustainability upgrades in properties 
and how they can achieve efficiencies 
in their tenancies. We collaborate with 
customers to improve their sustainability 
performance and awareness through 
initiatives such as City Switch, a 
national tenant energy efficiency 
program. We are both a signatory and 
a landlord within the program.

We aim to drive improvements in 
customers’ energy efficiency through 
green building committees and other 
programs. These programs include 
involvement in the annual Earth Hour 
campaign and the NABERS Energy and 
Water ratings and tenancy ratings.

We undertake initiatives to receive 
regular, open feedback from our 
customers. Customer feedback helps to 
determine the important sustainability 
issues that keep property performance 
on the right track.

Reducing fit-out waste
We provide fit-out guides that 
encourage the use of sustainable 
products and whole-life costings, which 
enable customers to understand how 
reuse and recycling can have positive 
impact towards costs and carbon 
emissions.

More information on our approach to 
reducing fit-out waste is provided on 
page 147.

Green leasing
We play a leading role in developing 
the Better Building Partnership (BBP) 
and were instrumental in designing 
and communicating its green leasing 
standard and Gold Lease badge which 
defines a best practice approach for 
property owners and occupants to 
collaborate on sustainability initiatives, 
encourages information sharing and 
cooperation and removes barriers 
to implementing mutually agreed 
improvements over time.

The green leasing standard is a world- 
first, aimed at helping property owners 
and occupants to benchmark their 
agreements against others and save 
on power and water bills. Dexus’s 
simple and easy lease is Gold Lease 
rated under the BBP leasing standard, 
which is the highest level available. This 
enables an active partnership between 
Dexus and our customers and seeks to 
deliver better environmental outcomes 
and reduce outgoings.

4.7  Strong Communities
We also interact with the broader community where we operate. Our most material community-related issues are:

 – Health, safety and security: we have a duty of care to ensure our properties are safe and deliver healthy environments. We 
promote health and wellbeing through community programs and activities and in the design of spaces

 – Economic impact on local communities: we are a major stakeholder in the communities where we operate, and contribute 
to local communities via corporate giving, community collaborations and partnerships, providing local employment 
opportunities both through our developments and through our customers’ occupation of our properties, and through 
delivering community infrastructure including creating spaces where the community can interact. It extends to our 
contributions to First Nations reconciliation in Australia through creating opportunities for career development and 
economic participation for First Nations peoples in the property industry and enabling Dexus employees and customers to 
participate in meaningful activities that will strengthen their awareness and cultural understanding. 

The boundary for our approach encompasses initiatives and activations with our two major community partners, Planet Ark 
and the Black Dog Institute, as well as charitable activities for not-for-profit organisations and the communities in which we 
operate.

Strong Communities management framework
Several areas of our business, under the leadership of the Board and Group Management Committee (GMC), collaborate to

Each year we set, review and update 
corporate commitments within our 
responsible investment framework 
following input from our stakeholders. 
Refer to our annual performance 
reporting for details on commitments 
and progress against community 
priorities.

This section describes local community 
contribution and engagement across 
our property portfolio. Dexus also 
consults with the community on new 
developments and refurbishments to 
address community concerns, and to 
incorporate features that benefit our 
customers and the broader community.

Dexus’s capacity to create value 
is influenced by the strength of its 
relationships with the communities 
in which it operates. During FY22, the 
Social Impact Working Group (SIWG) 
continued to implement Dexus’s Social 
Impact Strategic Framework.

The Framework aligns with Dexus’s 
Sustainability Approach and is 
designed to streamline community 
activities and maximise the value 
created for the communities in which 
we operate. 

As part of the Framework, Dexus has a 
tiered partnership model, detailing how 
charity contributions and activities will 
be approached, covering:

 – Sponsorship

 – In kind contribution

 – Workplace giving

 – Employee volunteering, 
participation and donations

 – Mentoring and networking

 – Brand recognition for charity 
partners

Community partnerships that 
drive sustained value
Dexus’s two major community partners, 
The Black Dog Institute and Planet 
Ark, complement Dexus’s Sustainability 
Approach and strengthen its social 
impact as an organisation, delivering 
positive outcomes for the communities 
in which we operate, our people and 
our customers.

Dexus continues to work with these 
partners in the following areas: 

The Black Dog Institute: Is the only 
research institution in Australia 
dedicated to mental health and suicide 
prevention with a national focus across 
all age demographics with a key focus 
on:

 – Evolving the mental health 
awareness and education of our 
people in line with our Safe & Well 
program

 – Engaging with the communities in 
which we operate through targeted 
and meaningful activations across 
our retail, industrial and office 
spaces

 – Aligning the extensive research 
of the Black Dog Institute to our 
Sustainability Approach and 
utilising it to support our people and 
customers across various initiatives

Planet Ark: Is one of Australia’s leading 
environmental behaviour change 
organisations, with a focus on working 
collaboratively and positively with 
communities, the government and 
businesses with a key focus on:

 – Educating our people and 
customers on environmental 
sustainability topics, including 
resource reduction and recycling

 – Empowering our people and 
customers to make positive 
environmental changes

 – Improving Dexus buildings’ 
environmental footprint

 – Creating opportunities for our 
people to contribute through 
volunteering initiatives

Corporate philanthropy
We aim to align our philanthropic 
activities with the interests of our 
people, our customers and the 
communities in which we operate. 
This ensures a targeted approach 
that helps to affirm Dexus’s social 
impact and engages our workforce in 
delivering our purpose.

We support causes that are important 
to our people, by matching the value of 
donations made by employees in their 
personal capacity to select causes. 
Recent dollar matching initiatives have 
supported the Black Dog Institute and 
Foodbank.

Employee guidelines for 
supporting community 
organisations
We encourage our people to 
participate in activities that help to 
support the community – this can 
be done during work hours or during 
their own personal time. We have 
established guidelines for how our 
people can fundraise or volunteer for 
community organisations and make a 
positive social impact.

Any community activity being 
undertaken by an employee where they 
are representing Dexus or involving our 
suppliers, customers or the broader 
team should align with the Dexus 
Sustainability Approach across the 
areas of:

 – Health and Wellness

 – Strong Communities

 – Diversity and Inclusion

 – Environment

If an employee wishes to participate 
in an activity that involves fundraising 
or volunteering for a community 
organisation or initiative, they can 
consult with the SIWG to ensure that 
their charitable activity aligns with the 
Social Impact Strategic Framework.

Employee volunteering
We provide our people with one day 
of paid volunteering leave per year, to 
enable them to contribute their time 
to a charity of their choice. We also 
encourage teams to volunteer together 
to both support community causes and 
build team cohesion. Examples of team 
volunteering activities have included 
bush care, preparing meals for families 
at shelters, and assisting with larger 
fundraising events.

Activations and partnerships
A key component of Dexus’s community 
contribution comes from the use of 
our assets for community causes. 
Dexus-managed retail centres act 
as community hubs, and leverage 
relationships within their local 
catchments to deliver fundraising 
events that support local causes.

Key areas of contribution include:

 – Use of Dexus retail space or office 
lobby space (at no charge) by 
community organisations seeking to 
fundraise or enhance awareness of 
their cause

 – Activating public spaces creating 
vibrant spaces and experiences, 
using placemaking to bring the 
community together

 – Working with local authorities 
and the community to proactively 
maintain safe precincts, retail centre 
management works with at-risk 
youth through local youth groups 
and schools to promote safer 
communities

 – Connections with other local 
organisations such as local 
councils, chambers of commerce 
and industry groups on community 
issues

130  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Evaluating outcomes and benefits
Dexus regularly reviews its community engagement strategy and maintains regular contact with its community partners.  
We use the following key performance indicators to measure the outputs and impacts of our community engagement program. 

Community contribution objective Outputs Impacts

Corporate giving philanthropy  – Financial value of cash donations  
to charitable organisations and 
community partners

 – Direct support for community issues

Supply chain
Dexus partners with suppliers to 
achieve operational efficiencies, 
enhance customer amenity and 
positive environmental outcomes. We 
develop long-term partnerships that 
address sustainability impacts and 
create shared value.

Dexus acknowledges our responsibility 
to ensure that standards relating 
to people, the environment and the 
communities in which we operate 
are maintained and continuously 
improved throughout our supply chain. 
We recognise that we can have a 
positive influence on our suppliers, 
contractors and their employees, 
products and services and through 
positive, collaborative relationships, we 
will create shared value. We recognise 
the central role that suppliers play 
in optimising asset performance, 
managing risk and delivering customer 
amenity.

Dexus ensures that suppliers partnering 
with Dexus: 

 – Provide products and services that 
represent good quality and value, 
are fit for purpose, and comply 
with all legal requirements and 
standards 

 – Operate accordingly to sound 
environmental principles including 
reducing carbon emissions in line 
with Dexus’s commitments

 – Consider the impacts of their 
activities on the social and 
environmental sustainability of the 
communities in which we operate 

 – Manage their employees and 
upstream service providers ethically 
by upholding human rights, fair 
labour management practices and 
diversity and inclusion principles, 
and addressing modern slavery, 
in line with Dexus’s signatory 
commitment to the United Nations 
Global Compact 

 – Provide their employees with a 
safe work environment, and the 
appropriate equipment, training 
and support

Supply chain composition
Dexus’s supply chain encompasses a 
diverse range of products and services 
which are grouped into procurement 
categories. Dexus defines its preferred 
suppliers and applies an assessment of 
inherent supply chain ESG risk for each 
procurement category.

Our Sustainable Procurement 
Framework helps minimise potential 
impacts from our upstream supply 
chain. Sustainable procurement is built 
into all supplier engagements through 
requiring supplier compliance with the 
policies listed in the table above. Refer 
to our website at www.dexus.com for 
publicly available policies.

An internal Embargo Policy outlines our 
approach to managing contractors 
and service providers that do not meet 
our performance standards. It identifies 
the circumstances in which a contractor 
or service provider will be placed on 
the embargo list and sets the criteria 
in which a supplier can be assessed to 
be removed. Should we determine to 
place a supplier on the embargo list, 
we will not engage with that contractor 
or service provider until the issues of 
concern have been appropriately 
addressed. The embargo list is updated 
on an ongoing basis.

In addition to this policy suppliers 
providing services to Dexus managed 
properties who do not endorse Dexus’s 
Supplier Code of Conduct via an 
annual attestation are prevented 
from undertaking new work with the 
business.

As a signatory to the United Nations 
Global Compact and the United 
Nations- supported Principles of 
Responsible Investment (PRI), we 
manage our supply chain to account 
for human rights, environmental, social 
and economic factors in its purchasing 
decisions.

Supply chain objectives
We aspire to and dedicate focus 
towards using our aggregate spend 
to positively influence our suppliers, 
contractors, products, services and 
workers. We take a long-term view to 
partner with our suppliers to achieve 
quality service by:

 – Fostering a ‘no harm’ safe 
workplace with zero fatalities 
target, and establishing robust 
safety compliance systems

 – Monitoring performance through 
regular engagement, reporting 
against contract key performance 
indicators and supported by regular 
contractor spot checks for service 
providers at each Dexus managed 
property

 – Engaging with suppliers through 
self- assessments to gain a 
comprehensive insight into their 
relationship with us through 
360-degree feedback, how they 
manage their own sustainability 
risks and those for their most 
significant suppliers

In addition, we seek to collaborate 
with suppliers to address human rights 
and modern slavery risks across our 
supply chain, through enhanced due 
diligence, risk profiling and supported 
by assessments.

We rationalise suppliers where possible 
by identifying partners that can best 
meet our needs and optimise their 
engagement across our portfolio. This 
leads to fewer suppliers and closer 
relationships with our business and a 
greater alignment of interest. It also 
presents a greater opportunity to 
embed our sustainability approach with 
suppliers.

General supply chain 
management priorities
Our corporate supply chain goals  
are to:

 – Maintain an efficient procurement 
process operating under sound 
governance that achieves the best 
value for money, meets business 
requirements and delivers financial 
and sustainability outcomes based 
on a whole-of-life costing

 – Identify key risks and opportunities 
particularly in high value, high 
impact contracts and improve the 
overall impacts of the products and 
services we procure

 – Mandate that suppliers abide by all 
minimum standards and laws in the 
countries in which they operate

 – Maintain safe workplaces in line with 
our goal for ‘no harm’, safe work 
environments with zero fatalities

 – Treat suppliers and contractors 
fairly, with respect and dignity 
demonstrating probity, equity and 
transparency

 – Continue to develop and manage 
relationships with suppliers and 
contractors to encourage them to 
promote a best practice approach 
to employment practices, social 
outcomes and the environment

 – Challenge suppliers to deliver 
tangible, innovative and sustainable 
solutions that deliver mutually 
beneficial outcomes

 – Continue to assess each contract’s 
merits against a set of sustainability 
principles and ensure environmental 
and social impacts are assessed in 
line with our policies and objectives, 
emerging best practice and industry 
standards

 – Ensure prospective and new 
suppliers understand sustainability-
related contract criteria and 
requirements

 – Mandate that all suppliers 
acknowledge and abide by the 
Dexus Sustainable Procurement 
Policy & Supplier Code of Conduct

 – Maintain sustainable procurement 
capability by engaging and 
upskilling employees and 
implementing sustainable 
procurement training for 
procurement and contract 
managers

 – Collaborate with suppliers and 
seek feedback as part of contract 
management

 – Where appropriate, increase the 
purchase of products that support 
community-based charities, are 
carbon neutral or have a lower 
carbon footprint, are more efficient 
or meet internationally recognised 
sustainability performance 
standards

 – Where appropriate, partner or 
encourage supplier participation in 
community engagement and with 
our philanthropic activities

134  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Understanding supply chain 
sustainability risk exposure
We conduct a periodic group-
wide supply chain sustainability risk 
assessment to identify and categorise 
the supply chain risks relevant to our 
geographical operations and the types 
of products and services it procures.

The assessment involves the following 
staged process to assess the most 
relevant supply chain issues.

1.  Contextual ESG factors are 
reviewed against emerging trends 
and issues. These are mapped 
against our procurement categories 
to identify the inherent ESG risks 
that may apply to Dexus

2.  Supplier categories with significant 
inherent risk are analysed against 
our material ESG issues to assess 
each in terms of their relevant 
inherent risk

3.  Inherent risk hotspots are 
evaluated and ranked within 
a matrix according to their 
level of inherent risk

The outcome of the risk assessment 
is a risk matrix of sustainability risk 
exposures across each of our major 
supply chain categories. The matrix 
informs procurement processes and 
sustainability ambitions, including 
specification of requirements, and 
questions during tendering and the 
screening of suppliers.

In addition, the matrix is referenced for 
establishing contract key performance 
indicators (KPIs) and the adoption 
of best practice sustainability 
management and monitoring over the 
lifecycle of the project.

We conduct an annual supplier 
spend analysis to prioritise a list of 
suppliers based on the category-level 
assessment. Together, the supplier 
spend analysis and supplier category 
risk assessment direct ongoing 
engagement with suppliers through 
due diligence and verification activities 
(monitoring and engagement).

Managing supply chain
Our staged procurement and contract 
management process optimises 
performance and supplier service levels, 
manages risk, maintains symbiotic 
supplier relationships in order to realise 
shared value. The overall risk rating 
for the procurement category and 
spend details the extent to which due 
diligence and supplier monitoring is 
undertaken. The table below details key 
aspects of this process with reference 
to supplier engagement.

136  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Tender documentation and service 
agreements integrate sustainability 
policies and key performance 
indicators. Dexus communicates its 
expectations and ESG requirements 
to all suppliers and requires each one 
to operate in line with our Sustainable 
Procurement Policy & Supplier Code 
of Conduct as well as understand 
Dexus’s requirements and commitments 
outlined in its Human Rights Policy.

With each supplier engagement 
Dexus seeks to ensure that investment 
considerations:

 – Address impact on supply chains 
and comply with Dexus’s Supplier 
Code of Conduct including 
materials, contractors, consultants 
and other professional services

 – Are in line with recognised and 
accepted local labour and 
employment practices where that 
investment results in employment 
or engagement of suppliers, 
contractors and professional service 
providers

Specific standards regarding ESG are 
agreed with contractors based on the 
prepared design brief. All work carried 
out must comply with the brief.

We prioritise supplier engagements 
based on the commodity/ service 
involved, the size of the contract, 
supplier values and its criticality to 
business continuity.

A supplier assessment process takes 
into account labour practices, social, 
environmental and human rights issues. 
Suppliers are encouraged to work 
with us to reduce carbon emissions, 
adopt sound environmental principles, 
manage their people ethically, drive 
positive supplier relationships and 
consider the impacts of their activities 
on the communities in which they 
operate.

Ongoing data collection and 
performance analysis provides a 
benchmark for site teams that oversee 
supplier services. This provides valuable 
insights on how performance trends 
vary over time and across sites. This 
data is used as an input into initial 
reviews of supplier contracts and 
periodic reviews of our panel of 
preferred suppliers.

Addressing modern slavery risk  
in our supply chain
We are aware of the following modern 
slavery risk factors across our supply 
chain:

 – Use of low-skilled, contract,  
and/or migrant labour

 – Subcontracting and use of third-
party labour hire agencies

 – A highly competitive and cost driven 
business sector

 – Procurement of specific materials 
(the production of which may 
involve modern slavery)

 – Supplier operations in countries with 
weak or opaque commitments to 
human rights

Based on this understanding of 
modern slavery risk factors, our supply 
chain sustainability risk assessment 
suggested the following categories 
as focus areas: cleaning and waste 
management services, security services, 
capital works at operational assets, 
development works, IT, corporate 
merchandise, and procurement of 
materials sourced from overseas.

Relevant contractual documentation 
contains modern slavery requirements 
and we have enhanced the 
consideration of modern slavery risk 
factors during the supplier selection 
process. We also deliver awareness 
campaigns to educate suppliers 
and their workforces about modern 
slavery and how to report concerns, 
through integration of modern slavery 
information into site induction terminals 
and signage in key locations across 
assets in our portfolio.

We conduct due diligence on 
suppliers both before and during our 
engagement with them, to understand 
human rights risk exposure and any 
potential breaches. As part of the 
Property Council of Australia Modern 
Slavery Roundtable, we collaborated 
with industry peers through to develop 
a common supplier due diligence 
platform questionnaire.

We are using the responses to identify 
higher risk suppliers with whom we 
should engage to ensure modern 
slavery risks are appropriately identified 
and managed.

We have established procedures 
to enable individuals within our 
supply chain to identify and escalate 
concerns. The Dexus Whistleblower 
policy specifies grievance mechanisms 
available to stakeholders to safely and 
anonymously raise concerns about 
modern slavery in our operations and 
supply chain. The Whistleblower Policy 
includes reference to modern slavery 
and specifies that its coverage includes 
the workforces of Dexus suppliers, as 
well as their spouses and dependents. 
We included this material to make it 
clear to individuals in our supply chain 
that Dexus wants to hear from them 
if they have concerns, and that they 
will be covered under the protections 
specified in the policy.

When a concern is raised, or we 
otherwise become aware that an 
individual in our supply chain may 
be impacted by modern slavery, we 
investigate the matter further and take 
appropriate action. The appropriate 
action would depend on whether Dexus 
has caused the impact, contributed to 
the impact, or is linked to the impact 
through our business relationships. In 
all cases, the focus is on mitigating the 
risk to the individual(s) experiencing the 
impact and using our leverage to foster 
continuous improvement.

More information on our approach to 
addressing modern slavery risk in our 
supply chain is provided in Dexus’s 
annual Modern Slavery Statement, as 
well as the Sustainability Performance 
Pack (pages 2-45).

Procurement procedures
Our procurement procedures outline 
the buying process for the Dexus 
operational divisions, and by authorised 
third party property managers. The 
procedures accompany the Dexus 
Operating Limits, Conflicts of Interest 
and Tendering policies. The procedures 
ensure that:

 – Service providers are engaged 
based on merit

 – Conflicts of interest are 
appropriately identified and 
managed

 – Our interests are legally protected 
(including the avoidance of 
fraudulent transactions)

 – Our insurances are not 
compromised

An important step in this process 
is engaging with suppliers during 
tender evaluation to determine their 
alignment with Dexus’s to evaluate the 
effectiveness of Dexus’s sustainability 
aspirations and ongoing alignment 
after engagement.

Tender process
Our tender process ensures that 
service providers are chosen based 
on merit and capacity to deliver 
works, acceptance of Dexus’s Terms 
and Conditions and Supplier Code of 
Conduct and alignment with Dexus’s 
sustainability aspirations. The number 
of organisations invited to tender 
varies taking into account a project’s 
size, complexity and procurement 
guidelines. We are committed to a 
transparent and competitive tendering 
process. The process is subject to 
detailed monitoring and oversight. 
Major tenders involve a prequalification 
process and assessment by a panel 
against agreed financial and non- 
financial metrics.

A Project Control Group (PCG) is 
established for high value projects. The 
PCG includes appropriately qualified 
representatives from Dexus, co-owners 
and senior representatives of the core 
service providers and contractors 
or consultants, for example builders, 
architect, project manager or leasing 
agents.

Employee responsibilities  
and training
Our employees receive periodic training 
on procurement best practices as well 
as property-related products, services 
and requirements. This provides them 
with the required skills and industry 
knowledge to appropriately select and 
appoint service providers.

All employees with responsibility for 
selecting, appointing and monitoring 
service providers must ensure 
performance and compliance with 
contractual agreements via standard 
contract templates.

Supplier monitoring and 
relationship management
We monitor the performance of major 
contracts through:

 – Regular performance review 
meetings with site teams that 
assess performance against KPIs

 – A Non Conformance Reporting 
(NCR) process

 – Customer surveys covering the Net 
Promoter Score (NPS) from the end 
users’ perspective on the services 
being delivered

 – Select contractor worker surveys

 – A requirement for annual attestation 
of compliance with the Dexus 
Supplier Code of Conduct

 – Management of insurances, licences 
and induction training via the 
Contractor Management system 
(Rapid)

 – Annual contractor surveys of the 
preferred suppliers that invite 360 
degree feedback

 – Performance metrics embedded in 
the contract

 – High-level performance reviews 
that occur at least half yearly and 
incorporate formal feedback from 
internal stakeholders

 – Site and corporate team feedback, 
which is discussed with suppliers to 
directly manage exceptions against 
performance expectations

Service agreements set out the level 
and frequency of monitoring. Suppliers 
must perform an appropriate level 
of monitoring, which may include a 
combination of physical monitoring of 
activities and performance reports.

Contractor health and safety
Dexus recognises its duty of care to 
manage work health and safety risks 
across its managed property portfolio, 
including activities of its suppliers or 
contractors. Dexus’s Work Health, 
Safety and Liability (WHS&L) Statement 
outlines how we manage risks at 
our properties. It states the group’s 
commitment to maintaining safe 
properties, working with stakeholders to 
manage hazards, risks and continuous 
monitoring. 

Dexus implements a safety 
management system that is certified 
against ISO 45001:2018 to address 
WHS&L risks across the portfolio. 
Dexus uses a third-party contractor 
management system across all Dexus 
managed assets to assist in contractor 
engagement and monitor contractor 
compliance with Dexus WHS&L system. 

Contractor employees are required 
to identify the appropriate risk 
assessments such as Safe Work Method 
Statement (SWMS) and permits prior 
to commencing works on-site in the 
Contractor Management system 
(Rapid). Safety alerts are delivered 
directly to the contractor employees 
when they sign in.

The Dexus Work Health Safety & 
Liability manual sets out a consistent 
approach for contractor management 
across our portfolio. We focus on 
contractor health and safety at our 
sites through:

 – Delivering Dexus Contractor 
Induction and site-specific 
inductions that confirm contractor 
qualifications and make them 
aware of site-specific risks and 
procedures before work commences

 – Ensuring contractors are using the 
contractor management system 
and that they have supplied current 
documentation (e.g. contractors’ 
licences, insurance certificates, Safe 
Work Method Statements, WHS 
Plans)

 – Confirming that contractors 
correctly use the risk assessments 
and permits relevant to their 
activities

 – Consulting with contractors on WHS 
activities through ‘tool-box talks’ or 
using the Health & Safety meeting 
agenda available in Dexus’s safety 
management system

 – Reviewing contractor health 
and safety performance through 
conducting regular contractor spot 
checks, which are to be conducted 
monthly for Building Management 
personnel

138  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Supporting a climate resilient 
supply chain
As detailed in Dexus’s Towards Climate 
Resilience report, we have identified 
several opportunities to enhance the 
management of climate-related issues 
in our supply chain, including:

 – Completing supplier risk 
management assessments that 
focus on supplier capacity to 
manage climate-related issues, 
and engage with suppliers 
where required to enhance their 
awareness and understanding

 – Further integrating climate-related 
issues management into supplier 
engagement agreements as 
appropriate

 – Preferencing low or net zero carbon 
products, and collaborating 
with suppliers to increase 
disclosure through reporting and 
Environmental Product Declarations

 – Assessing our supply chain for 
risks and opportunities associated 
with the transition to a low carbon 
economy

 – Understanding areas of our supply 
chain that may be exposed to 
international trade disruptions

Grievance mechanism
Feedback from or about a contractor 
that becomes a formal grievance is 
addressed through Dexus’s Complaints 
Policy.

Contractor employees also have 
access to Dexus’s whistleblower 
service, Your-Call, to enable contractor 
employees to report grievances using 
a secure, anonymous and confidential 
mechanism.

Evaluation and process 
improvement
Our procurement process is subject 
to ongoing, risk-based auditing and 
monitoring via the Risk team and 
Compliance team. Potential breaches 
of procedures are investigated and 
may result in disciplinary action if 
substantiated.

Customers and communities Future Enabled Customers 
and Strong Communities

Enriched Environment

An efficient and resilient portfolio that minimises  
our environmental footprint and is positioned to thrive in  
a climate-affected future.

We recognise we have a duty of care to 
our stakeholders: investors, customers, 
employees, agents and the wider 
community, to sustain and protect the 
environment during the management 
of our property portfolio.

We understand the increasing 
environmental and social challenges 
caused by climate-related impacts to 
the environment and their effects on 
our communities, and we recognise 
our role to limit those long-term effects 
of human-induced climate change in 
line with the goals of the Paris Climate 
Agreement.

We seek to enhance the environmental 
resilience of our property portfolio 
by minimising our greenhouse gas 
emissions impact, adapting for change 
through environmentally friendly 
technologies, and influencing across 
our value chain. Dexus is committed 
to transitioning to a low carbon future 
through the group’s target to achieve 
net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 
30 June 2022.

The group adopts a holistic, 
precautionary approach to 
environmental challenges – from the 
boardroom to the plant room – to 
reduce operating costs, enhance 
property values and improve customer 
appeal, resulting in enhanced long-
term returns for investors together with 
lower environmental risks.

Adopting a sustainable approach to 
property operations contributes to the 
following outcomes:

 – Enhanced income through higher 
rental premiums for sustainable 
buildings

 – Reduced operations and 
maintenance costs

 – Improved customer comfort and 
amenity

 – Enhanced business reputation

 – Improved employee productivity 
and wellbeing

 – Investor demand

Our material environmental  
issues include:

 – Energy consumption: Optimising 
energy usage positively impacts 
the environment while reducing 
operating costs and exposures 
to volatility in energy prices. High 
performing buildings attract 
customers and increase occupancy 
and customer retention. This 
reduces financial risk, maximises 
the return on investment and gives 
customers an environmentally 
conscious space to occupy

 – Water consumption: Improving 
water efficiency, on-site water 
recycling and rainwater harvesting 
preserves a precious natural 
resource and reduces utility costs 
which leads to reductions in 
outgoings and maintenance costs. 
These outcomes reduce operational 
financial risks, improve reputation, 
help to attract and retain customers 
and maintain each property’s 
market competitiveness

 – Waste management: Minimising 
waste and increasing recycling 
through effective waste handling 
reduces raw material use and 
avoids environmental and health 
related hazards associated with 
sending waste to landfill

 – Biodiversity: Ecosystems and 
their species perform important 
biological functions in the 
environment around us. Protecting 
and enhancing biodiversity provides 
places for native flora and fauna to 
reside. Biodiversity contributes to 
protecting areas from soil erosion 
and floods, reducing climate 
change risks, recycling nutrients 
to boost farming productivity, 
capturing and retaining water, 
assisting with controlling pollution 
as well as providing aesthetic value

 – Climate action: Assessing climate 
change risks, reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions and implementing 
adaptation measures reduces 
operational and financial risks 
and assists in maintaining a 
property’s long-term resilience and 
competitiveness (embodied and 
operational carbon)

The boundary for these issues 
encompasses all properties within the 
Dexus group portfolio, with impacts felt 
across occupants and visitors, as well 
as local communities and habitats.

Environment Policy
Dexus’s Environment Policy outlines its 
commitment to minimising the overall 
environmental impact of its operations. 
The policy covers the group’s 
environmental commitments and 
details the management system that 
Dexus implements across the property 
portfolio, including:

 – Managing and monitoring potential 
risks and opportunities of climate 
change

 – Identifying and implementing 
compliance requirements

 – Educating, training and 
communicating to stakeholders 
about environmental impacts and 
commitments

 – Actively developing and promoting 
initiatives to improve environmental 
performance

 – Providing transparent monitoring 
and reporting of environmental 
performance

Dexus’s commitments  
and targets
In line with a precautionary approach 
to environmental challenges, each 
year we set, review and update 
corporate commitments within our 
responsible investment framework and 
sustainability approach, which are 
focused toward minimising the overall 
environmental impact of our operations, 
in the development, management and 
refurbishment of properties.

Refer to page 38-43 for further 
disclosure of annual commitments and 
progress against key priorities.

Resource efficiency
We target continuous improvements 
in energy and water efficiency, and 
emissions reduction across the group 
property portfolio. We use smart 
meters to validate utility bills, identify 
consumption and report anomalies.

Energy and water submetering have 
been installed in key office properties to 
assist in quantifying opportunities and 
measuring efficiency.

Asset teams review and develop asset 
plan for our office portfolio to assist 
and prioritise projects that maximise 
operational performance and reduce 
resource consumption. Our asset plan 
covers the following key elements:

 – Holistic building performance review

 – Asset plan review

 – Identify key opportunities

 – Develop business case to quantify 
investment and project

Assessing these elements informs the 
building performance. This assists us 
to plan and implement optimum plant 
and equipment upgrades to maximise 
energy efficiency and customers 
comfort.

We implement viable projects identified 
and aligned with the asset plan to 
complement the life cycle replacement 
and building improvement investment. 

Examples of energy efficiency initiatives 
include:

 – Chiller replacements

 – Use of energy efficient boilers

 – Improvement of air tightness and 
building isolation/insulation

 – Upgrades to building management 
and control systems (BMCS)

 – Mechanical works and retro 
commissioning

 – Installation of sub-meters and 
energy management systems

 – Lighting upgrades

 – ‘Virtual engineer’ building analytics

 – Onsite renewables including solar 
PV and supportive infrastructure 
such as battery storage

 – Electric vehicle charging facilities 

We embed sustainability practices 
within industrial estate master planning 
for new developments and through 
targeted technology and controls 
upgrades. Master planning initiatives 
reduce water and energy including 
the use of solar hot water, rainwater 
for irrigation and toilets use and native 
landscaping.

We benchmark energy efficiency 
performance against the leading 
industry benchmarks, NABERS and 
Green Star. NABERS provides resource 
consumption profiles for each property 
and helps to identify improvements. 
NABERS Energy and Water ratings are 
undertaken at least annually across the 
group’s office and retail portfolios.

Water use
Nearly all water consumed across 
Dexus’s portfolio is potable water 
purchased from local water utilities. 
Water consumption that is reported 
is sourced from local utility water 
providers. Dexus does not consume 
fresh surface water. Dexus consumes 
an immaterial amount of bore water 
at Willows Shopping Centre from a 
rechargeable source which is not 
included in the reporting for water 
consumption. 

Natural rainfall variability in Australia 
is large, reflecting the diversity of 
Australia’s climatic zones and seasonal 
patterns. Dexus recognises we can 
have a positive impact by minimising 
water use across our portfolio and 
preserving available water sources for 
the general population. More efficient 
usage of water also delivers cost 
savings for us and our customers.

Our asset plan program also focuses 
on water management. Examples 
of initiatives that we have deployed 
include:

 – Optimising or upgrading cooling 
towers

 – Leak detection programs

 – Use of water efficient appliances 
including fitting water efficient 
cisterns and fixtures in bathrooms 
to enhance water efficiency, and 
treating wastewater through 
central blackwater and greywater 
treatment plants, reducing potable 
water consumption via the provision 
of clean recycled water for the 
washroom flushing system

 – On-site rainwater harvesting and 
recycled water is used in toilet 
facilities to irrigate gardens and 
decorative plantings

All water from Dexus properties is 
discharged as sewage to water utilities 
and is never discharged directly to the 
natural environment. We ensure that 
our discharged water meets minimum 
requirements set out by local water 
utilities, including any requirements 
related to applicable trade wastewater 
permits. Stormwater is harvested for use 
on site or discharged via stormwater 
drainage.

144  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



Waste management
Waste generated by Dexus activities 
include:

 – Construction and demolition waste 
from development projects

 – Operational waste from the 
operation of buildings and 
associated with property usage  
by customers

 – Fit-out waste generated when  
de-fitting tenancies

 – Wastewater (described on page 148)

Construction waste
Dexus-owned construction sites are wholly 
managed by third-party contractors. 
Dexus does not have operational control 
of these sites and thus does not report 
on construction waste. At most sites, we 
require contractors to adopt principles of 
the Green Star certification that includes 
requirements for diversion of construction 
waste from landfill.

Environmental Management Plans at 
construction sites generally include Waste 
Management Plans that specify recycling 
targets for demolition and construction 
waste.

Operational waste
We contribute to and have adopted 
the City of Sydney’s Better Buildings 
Partnership (BBP) best practice 
guidelines for operational and strip-out 
waste management.

We implement waste management 
plans for each property. Comprehensive 
recycling streams are standardised and 
implemented as part of cleaning and 
waste services. We also look at other 
recycling opportunities on a property- 
by-property basis, for example recycling 
of materials removed from the site 
when it is under development; recycling 
of demolition material and providing 
reusable materials during demolition to 
local community groups.

We collaborate with customers and 
waste contractors to introduce recycling 
systems within their tenancies and offer 
ad hoc services such as electronic waste 
collection based on customer needs. 
Contractors also educate customers 
on recycling practices to maximise the 
amount of waste that can be diverted 
from landfill.

We report waste tonnage and recycling/ 
diversion rates for office and retail 
properties in line with best practice 
guidelines.

We include environmental sustainability 
criteria in tender evaluation processes 
for the provision of waste services to 
standardise waste management and 
recycling practices across the portfolio. 
We utilise weight-scales where feasible 
to directly measure waste and recycling 
performance and conduct bin profiling 
to assess contamination rates and 
identify opportunities. These enable 
us to capture relevant data on waste 
management and recycling.

De-fit (strip out) waste
Dexus supports and implements the 
BBP strip-out Waste Guidelines and 
for each tenancy de-fit project we aim 
to consistently achieve 80% materials 
diversion.

We achieve this through a structured 
approach including developing 
inventories, structured removal and 
sorting practices, and establishing 
downstream materials receivers. We 
actively identify charities and markets 
for furniture re-use to increase waste 
diversion from landfill.

Hazardous waste
Any hazardous waste produced by 
Dexus or at Dexus assets is managed 
in accordance with the Dexus 
Environmental Management System 
(page 148). Dexus does not transport 
solid or liquid hazardous waste (as 
defined as hazardous under the Basel 
Convention Annex) from one location to 
another for treatment.

Biodiversity
Biodiversity risk exposure is reviewed 
during the due diligence process for 
new acquisitions and within periodic 
valuations. Given the location of our 
developments primarily in urban and 
brownfield sites, there is limited exposure 
to biodiversity risks and opportunities for 
biodiversity enhancement. Risk exposure 
typically extends to our industrial 
portfolio where sites may be greenfield 
or may be situated close to waterways.

Our Biodiversity Policy focuses on 
protecting and enhancing biodiversity 
in and around our properties. We 
aspire to have a net positive impact 
on biodiversity and have applied an 
approach to avoid, minimise, restore 
and offset adverse biodiversity impacts 
within its properties. This includes making 
buildings and their surrounds a place for 
native flora and fauna to reside, and a 
place for people to enjoy.

Biodiversity is addressed in conjunction 
with the Green Star certification 
program, to determine if spaces can be 
created or improved in developments 
and building upgrades. For properties 
in operation, we work to incorporate 
biodiversity considerations within 
landscaping and grounds keeping 
activities. We do not engage in 
mining, exploration activities, operate 
manufacturing sites or conduct 
activities that lead to the extinction 
of International Union of Conservation 
of Nature (IUCN) listed endangered 
species.

We recognise that our suppliers can 
also impact on biodiversity. As outlined 
in our Sustainable Procurement Policy 
and Supplier Code of Conduct, we 
seek to source products or solutions 
that enhance, protect and retain native 
biodiversity and collaborate with 
service providers on influencing their 
supply chain to assist us to achieve our 
biodiversity objectives.

Environmental risk management 
and hazardous materials
We conduct a comprehensive risk 
audit program to identify, evaluate and 
mitigate the following risks:

 – Personal health and safety audits: 
compliance/spot audits, work health 
and safety risk profile, certification 
of safety system to international 
standard ISO 45001:2018, Principal 
Contractor audit, incident 
investigations

 – Building safety: confined space risk 
assessment, plant risk assessment, 
façade audits

 – Environmental: hazardous 
materials review, initial site audit, 
site re-inspections, certification of 
environmental management system 
to international standard ISO 14001

 – Security: security risk assessment, 
external security review

 – Insurance risk: underwriting 
assessment

We track the audit program via 
a proprietary online property risk 
management and auditing tool that 
enables systematic and rigorous 
property risk profiling. This provides 
a single point of access for tools and 
data and improves the disclosure of due 
diligence data.

Environmental management system
We maintain an environmental management system which is certified against ISO 14001. This system and accompanying 
manual forms an integral part of the Dexus Environmental Management (EM) Program. The EM program has been designed to 
identify, assess and manage environmental risks across our portfolio, specifically properties under management, developments 
and transactions, and to promote continual improvement.

The EM program involves the following environmental management approach:

Asset acquisition

Initial Status Audit (ISA) and  
Initial Hazardous Material Audit (if required)

Implementation of recommendations  
to comply with Dexus EM Program

Regular Risk Audit (compulsory) and  
Hazardous Material re-inspection (if required)

An Initial Status Audit 
(ISA) details site specific 
aspects and impacts and 
is undertaken for all new 
acquisitions.

An Initial Hazardous 
Materials Audit (HAZMAT) 
is undertaken if there is no 
previous information relating 
to Asbestos, Synthetic 
Mineral Fibres (SMF), 
Polychlorinated biphenyl 
(PCB) and lead based paint.

Environmental aspects considered 
within the day-to-day activities at our 
managed properties include:

 – Storage of environmentally 
hazardous materials – 
Environmentally hazardous 
materials can have a significant 
environmental impact if released to 
the environment

 – Waste generation – Management 
of solid and liquid waste materials 
requires safe handling and disposal

 – Stormwater discharge – Release 
of contaminants to stormwater 
may result in the degradation of 
stormwater quality, with potential 
subsequent impact on surface 
waterways

 – Trade waste and wastewater 
discharge – Discharge of 
wastewater to sewer requires a 
Trade Waste agreement. Release of 
unlicensed discharges to sewer may 
lead to prosecution

 – Emissions to atmosphere – 
Emissions to atmosphere (such 
as the discharge from cooling 
towers and kitchen exhausts, etc.) 
are managed to meet regulatory 
standards. We also recognise 
emissions of ozone depleting 
substances and refrigerants from air 
conditioning and refrigeration

 – Noise emissions – Noise and 
vibration may cause a nuisance 
to neighbouring properties 
or customers and give rise to 
complaints and subsequent 
prosecution under environmental 
legislation

 – Site contamination – Site 
contamination can result from loss 
of materials to soil and groundwater 
(leakage from underground storage 
tanks is a common source of soil 
and groundwater contamination)

 – Climate change – The 
manifestations of climate change 
include higher temperatures, altered 
rainfall patterns, and more frequent 
or intense extreme events such as 
heatwaves, drought, and storms

 – Energy management – Energy 
management activities aim to 
reduce energy consumption 
including electricity, natural gas 
and diesel to minimise the overall 
environmental impact of operations

146  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



5.3  Climate action
Climate change presents a range 
of risks and opportunities to Dexus’s 
portfolio and business strategy. These 
issues are described in detail in Dexus’s 
Towards Climate Resilience report, and 
comprise:

 – Transition issues associated with the 
transition to a low carbon economy 
(shifts to renewable energy, 
customer and market preferences 
for low emission properties, 
reputational considerations)

 – Physical issues associated with 
climatic changes (increasing 
frequency and severity of extreme 
weather, and longer-term climate 
considerations such as sea level rise 
and higher maximum temperatures)

The risk to Dexus from the adverse 
effects of climate change are varied 
with new and updated information that 
continues to emerge regarding the 
scale, likelihood and geographic areas 
that could be impacted. In addition 
to understanding the physical risks to 
properties and populations, Dexus, 
its customers and local communities 
are also faced with transitional risks 
including socio-economic effects, 
resource availability, and health and 
wellbeing.

Climate governance
Dexus recognises its fiduciary duty 
for ensuring effective governance 
and risk management procedures 
are implemented to integrate climate 
risks and opportunities across the 
group’s operations. Dexus’s corporate 
governance framework supports 
a culture that understands the 
importance of sustainability and 
ensures that climate-related issues are 
addressed appropriately at board and 
management levels.

The table below summarises the 
governance framework applied to 
addressing climate-related impacts 
across Dexus group.

The Board ESG Committee 
complements the work of the Board 
Risk Committee on climate-related 
issues because of the inclusion of 
climate change in Dexus’s Risk Appetite 
Statement and on Dexus’s key risk 
register. Climate- related issues are 
considered as one of several risks and 
opportunities that guide decision 
making in line with Dexus’s Risk 
Management Framework and overall 
strategy. The Corporate Executive 
Committee is tasked with ensuring 
effective management of risks that 
have the potential to impact Dexus’s 
strategy and outlook. As climate 
change is a key strategic risk to Dexus 
with potential impacts over the medium 
to long term, it is actively reviewed 
and managed within Dexus’s Risk 
Management Framework.

Climate-related issues are incorporated 
into the group’s operations through 
integration of the Dexus Sustainability 
Approach into the group’s strategy and 
through the consideration of climate 
change as a key risk, which has resulted 
in the development of control measures 
and detailed discussion of climate risk 

at leadership and board levels.

Climate change is a material issue for 
Dexus, and the Board ESG Committee 
is informed of climate-related risks and 
opportunities on a regular basis, along 
with planned and implemented actions 
to manage these issues. The Board 
ESG Committee meets quarterly to 
review and approve relevant corporate 
and compliance policies as well as 
review reports on ESG performance 
and climate-related risks, including 
active projects, achievements and 
performance metrics.

The Dexus cross-functional 
Climate Resilience Working Group 
collaboratively coordinates climate 
risk management initiatives across the 
group, meeting periodically to evaluate 
performance and maintain a current 
view of climate-related risks and 
opportunities.

Climate change has been incorporated 
into relevant group policies and 
procedures to provide guidance to 
employees and inform all stakeholders 
of Dexus’s commitment to managing 
climate-related issues. 

This includes Dexus’s Environment 
Policy and Environmental Management 
System (certified to ISO 14001), which 
apply across the group to properties 
under management as well as 
developments and transactions.

Climate scenario analysis
We use scenario analysis to help 
us understand and prepare for the 
impacts of climate change on our 
assets, markets and economies. 
This involves use of climate warming 
forecasts and modelling of plausible 
future events to build scenarios from 
which we can envisage the effects 
of climate change on our physical 
environment as well as the impacts on 
our future financial prosperity.

We test our physical resilience and 
ability to adapt by applying ‘high 
impact’ warming scenarios and 
we model events linked to rapid 
decarbonisation scenarios to highlight 
transition risks and opportunities.

Scenario (source) How the scenario has informed Dexus’s approach

Representative Concentration Pathway 
(RCP) 8.5 (Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change)

Used to assess property physical risk exposure and identify likely high impact 
climate-related outcomes, including the magnitude and specific locations where 
they are likely to occur. The outcomes inform Dexus’s acquisition strategy and 
physical property risk management activities.

Science Based Targets initiative 
sectoral decarbonisation trajectory 
using IEA 2°C scenario (International 
Energy Agency)

Used to inform energy use and price modelling out to 2030, with comparison against 
sector decarbonisation required to align with a 2°C warming trajectory, to support 
the development of Dexus’s target to achieve net zero emissions by 30 June 2022.

Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change)

Used to define plausible trajectories of global warming within the scenarios 
developed for Dexus’s Towards Climate Resilience report.

Inevitable Policy Response, Forecast 
Policy Scenario (Principles for 
Responsible Investment)

Incorporated into the “Delay and disruption” scenario within Dexus’s Towards 
Climate Resilience report, to test the business’s strategy against a forceful policy 
response to climate change in the near term.

Various scenarios for future climate 
impacts and policy pathways 
(e.g. CSIRO, Australian Bureau of 
Meteorology, Australian Energy  
Market Operator)

Incorporated into the scenario analysis contained within Towards Climate Resilience. 
The assumptions and references underpinning the Towards Climate Resilience 
scenarios are available in the Dexus Climate Scenario Analysis Supplement, 
available at www.dexus.com/sustainability-reporting-library.

148  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



As a result of the climate scenario 
analysis, we developed three 
company- specific climate scenarios to 
inform our climate resilience strategy. 
These are described in detail in our 
Towards Climate Resilience report:

The “Dedication and delivery” 
scenario: limits global warming to 
below 2°C by 2100 and represents 
an orderly transition to a low-carbon 
economy based on the prioritisation of 
sustainable development and global 
collaboration. This transition will be 
facilitated by decentralised energy 
grids, supportive policy and a strong 
carbon price. The sharing economy 
becomes mainstream, to drive waste 
reduction and resource efficiency.

The “Delay and disruption” scenario: 
represents a disorderly transition to a 
low-carbon economy based on abrupt 
policy shifts that occur after years of 
delay. Business-as-usual continues 
in the early 2020s, until the growing 
momentum for climate action leads to 
a forceful but disorderly set of policy 
responses before 2030 for which 
financial markets are underprepared.

The “Division and deterioration” 
scenario: means global warming may 
exceed 3°C by 2100 and this scenario 
represents a failure to decarbonise. 
The mounting climate impacts lead 
to protectionism and a breakdown 
in international cooperation that 
stymies climate action. Governments 
deprioritise the low-carbon transition 
while stakeholders continue to mount 
pressure on business to fill the gap.

There are socio-economic disruptions 
associated with extreme weather and 
longer-term climate shifts, threats to 
global supply chains from extreme 
weather events and breakdowns in 
international free trade agreements 
as well as mass migration which 
contributes to notable demographic 
changes and political challenges.

Climate resilience strategy
Dexus’s climate change resilience 
strategy involves:

1.  Mitigating our impact through 
decarbonisation, energy efficiency 
and renewable energy

2.  Adapting to physical and transition 
risks relevant to our properties, 
people and operations, and 
leveraging climate change- related 
opportunities

3.  Influencing our value chain by 
engaging customers and suppliers 
to reduce climate impacts, and 
engaging other key stakeholders on 
our climate resilience strategy

4.  Climate governance to support 
a culture that understands and 
appropriately acts on climate-
related issues at board and 
management levels

Dexus seeks to build the capacity of 
individuals, communities and systems 
in and around Dexus properties to 
adapt and grow with consideration to 
chronic stresses and acute shocks that 
may result from the effects of climate 
change. The table below summarises 
Dexus’s climate change resilience 
strategy, described in detail in its 
Towards Climate Resilience report.

Dexus climate resilience strategy

Reducing our impact Adapting to climate change Influencing our value chain

Mitigating our contribution 
to climate change

 – Net zero emissions by 2022: 
through energy efficiency and 
renewable energy and minimal offsets

 – Climate resilient building technology: 
preparing our portfolio for a low carbon 
future

 – Climate resilient developments: 
integrating life-cycle thinking and net 
zero emissions targets into the design 
and development of city- defining 
properties and precincts

Adaptations to enhance resilience

 – Climate resilient operations: 
addressing physical and transition 
risks at the property level

 – Climate resilient transactions: 
considering climate-related issues in 
transaction due diligence

 – Climate resilient research: tracking 
environmental, social, economic and 
political factors that could influence 
our resilience

Lifting industry practice and  
unlocking opportunities

 – Engaging with customers to adopt a 
whole building approach

 – Adopt a life-cycle approach and 
net zero emissions targets in new 
developments (NABERS Energy and 
Green Star commitments)

 – Procuring for a low carbon supply 
chain

Our climate resilience strategy responds to a range of climate-related issues that have been identified through our scenario 
analysis and risk management processes over the years, as described below. Our view of material climate-related issues is 
updated regularly based on research, evaluation of our climate resilience actions, and additional scenario analyses.

Climate risk management
Climate change is listed on the Dexus 
key risk register, which has resulted in 
the development of control measures 
and the detailed discussion of climate 
risk at board and management levels. 
The Board of Directors is ultimately 
responsible for risk management, 
including climate risk. The Board 
Risk Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the Group’s enterprise-wide 
risk management framework, which 
is aligned to the principles of ISO 
31000:2018.

Addressing physical risk
Since 2011, Dexus has undertaken 
portfolio-wide climate change risk 
assessments to understand the 
exposure of its portfolio to physical 
risks such as increasing frequency and 
severity of extreme weather, as well as 
longer-term shifts in climatic conditions.

The most recent physical risk 
assessments incorporated medium and 
long-term greenhouse gas emission 
scenarios from the Fifth Assessment 
Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, as well as 
climate projections from the CSIRO and 
the NSW Office of Environment and 
Heritage.

The RCP 8.5 scenario (outlined on page 
150) was chosen to identify high-impact 
climate-related outcomes, including 
the magnitude and specific locations 
where hazards are most likely to occur. 
A geospatial analysis was conducted 
to map our properties against their 
relevant climate zones and link to the 
scenario outcomes. Risk exposure was 
rated for each property using our two-
dimensional risk rating matrix, which 
assesses likelihood and consequence 
for each type of physical risk.

We also reviewed property-specific 
scenario data including flood maps, 
and likely frequency and intensity of 
bushfires and storms to assess each 
property and identify hotspots in each 
geographical market. To sense-check 
these results we surveyed facility 
and operations managers to assess 
climate vulnerability at their properties. 
Analysis has informed the overall level 
of physical risk exposure across all 
existing properties and geographical 
hotspots. Data is used to inform future 
investments and establish mitigation 
plans for existing investments.

Properties which have been identified 
as high risk through the portfolio-wide 
climate risk assessment, undertake 
site-specific climate risk assessments 
to evaluate significant climate- 
related vulnerabilities and adaptation 
actions. At the property level, natural 
catastrophe risks are assessed as part 
of Dexus’s risk engineering audit regime 
which uses a risk adjusted approach to 
selecting sites to audit. The assessment 
process involves sensitivity analysis 
and determination of climate risk 
level based on the inherent risk with 
reference to recent and historical 
natural disaster events such as flood, 
cyclone, hurricane, windstorm and 
earthquake, geographical factors, while 
factoring in climate change projections 
and previous loss data. Climate 
resilience is considered across all 
properties through its integration into 
Dexus’s Environmental Management 
System. This provides a structured 
property risk management process for 
head office and site-based teams to 
evaluate sensitivities and vulnerability 
levels as well as develop adaptation 
plans and actions moving forward.

Climate-related disclosures
Dexus discloses its approach to addressing climate-related issues within its Annual Reporting Suite, in accordance with the Task 

Addressing transition risk
Leveraging the business’ existing 
climate risk approach and the climate 
scenario analysis disclosed in its 
Towards Climate Resilience report, 
Dexus conducted an economic 
analysis of the climate- related 
transition impacts relevant to Dexus’s 
customer base over the next 10 years. 
The economic analysis explored 
the implications of transition risks to 
Dexus’s customer base and the drivers 
of financial performance relating to 
specific economic indicators, such 
as white-collar employment, industry 
output, interest rates and Consumer 
Price Index (CPI).

The analysis focused on the risk 
and opportunity to rental income 
by evaluating how customer sector 
outlooks are economically impacted 
based on their exposure to physical 
and transitional climate impacts. This 
analysis was undertaken to understand 
changes in customer demand for space 
and the economic outlook of all sectors 
(based on their sectoral impacts to 
climate change), highlighting which 
industry sectors are the climate winners 
and losers, and what is the associated 
impact on their demand for office 
space.

The economic modelling aligns with the 

“Dedication and delivery” and “Delay 
and disruption” scenarios from Dexus’s 
Towards Climate Resilience report and 
modelled climate-adjusted changes to 
the macro-economic environment.

The climate-adjusted economic 
analysis will be used by the business 
to forecast potential future financial 
impacts to revenue, arising from 
customer-related transition risks and 
opportunities.

The findings will also be used to:

 – Integrate into the business’s  
broader strategy

 – Identify suitable metrics for ongoing 
monitoring of climate transition risk

 – Indicate a pathway to future 
climate- related financial 
disclosures (such as climate-
adjusted valuations and integration 
into the financial statements).

This approach can also be expanded 
to review key capital expenditure and 
operational costs over time.

Climate metrics and targets
We committed to achieve net zero 
emissions by 30 June 2022 because 
we believe that ambitious targets 
lead to bold actions and the quest 
for innovative solutions. Our net zero 
emissions target has been verified by 
the Science Based Targets initiative as 
consistent with the effort required to 
limit global temperature increases to 
below 1.5°C.

Below is a list of climate-related metrics 
and targets that the business tracks, 
monitors and regularly discloses:

Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. 
The TCFD recommendations provide 
an effective lens for us to communicate 
with investors on where direct and 
indirect risks and opportunities exist, 
and the action we are taking to 
address them.

In addition, Dexus’s Towards Climate 
Resilience report identifies opportunities 
for evolving the business’ approach to 
managing climate-related issues and 
describes actions that Dexus can take 
to support its resilience across a range 
of climate scenarios. 

Reducing Dexus’s  
emissions footprint
Dexus consumes electricity, natural 
gas, diesel and solar energy for the 
operation of its property portfolio 
and aims to reduce emissions 
through improving resource efficiency, 
transitioning to clean energy sources 
and minimising waste impacts. Refer to 
pages 72-75 for a detailed disclosure on 
current environmental performance.

Emissions management
Our continuous improvement approach 
to addressing environmental issues 
includes a focus on reducing energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions. Dexus aims to reduce its 
emissions by:

 – Tracking greenhouse gas emissions 
across the group portfolio and 
ongoing disclosure of performance

 – Setting continuous improvement 
targets

 – Conducting ongoing energy 
management activities and 
initiatives across operations

 – Implementing energy and water 
efficiency projects

 – Generating energy on site from 
renewable sources

 – Purchasing accredited, emission-
free Renewable Energy Certificates 
and deploying renewable Energy 
Supply Agreements across the 
portfolio

 – Incorporating environmental 
performance into new 
developments and investment 
decision making

 – Maintaining carbon neutral 
certification under the Climate 
Active Carbon Neutral Standard via 
participation in the Climate Active 
Australian Government Carbon 
Neutrality Program

 – Actively participating in industry 
collaborations including GRESB and 
the City of Sydney’s Better Buildings 
Partnership

Renewable energy
We support the development of 
renewable energy and distributed 
energy generation across our managed 
portfolio. As a signatory to the RE100 
Initiative, we are committed to sourcing 
100% renewable electricity by 2030. 
This is delivered through on-site solar 
generation and off-site renewable 
energy opportunities such as through 
renewable energy supply agreements.

Dexus has an active management 
approach towards its energy 
procurement which helps progress 
the group’s net zero emissions 
target, leveraging its scale to secure 
competitive pricing, load flexibility 
and renewable electricity supplies. All 
current electricity tenders request 100% 
renewable electricity for base building 
consumption, which has become a 
standard approach across our portfolio. 
These agreements typically have a 
future start date and in the interim we 
purchase accredited GreenPower or 
Large-scale Generation Certificates 
(LGCs) until these agreements take 
full effect. Our approach is to source 
renewable electricity from GreenPower 
accredited power stations; primarily 
wind and solar.

We generate on-site energy across 
several properties, including emission- 
free solar hot water, solar photovoltaic 
(PV). Through these initiatives, we seek 
to harness natural resources to offset 
grid purchases of high-emissions coal- 
fired electricity production.

Carbon neutrality
We have set a pathway to net zero 
emissions by 30 June 2022 through 
energy and resource efficiency, 
renewable energy and nature-based 
offsets.

We are a signatory to the Australian 
Government’s Climate Active program 
and our corporate head office has 
been certified as carbon neutral since 
2011. In line with the Climate Active 
Carbon Neutral Standard, we offset 
direct emissions from refrigeration and 
electricity usage and indirect emissions 
generated by waste to landfill, paper 
use, airline travel and car mileage for 
national employees, taxi travel, hire 
cars and employee commuting.

Carbon neutral certification is 
achieved through assessing our energy 
consumption and developing an 
emissions management plan. The plan 
focuses on reducing waste to landfill, 
increasing recycling, increasing the 
use of recycled products, reducing 
use of consumables and paper and 
introducing new technologies to reduce 
energy consumption.

In 2022, we expanded our reporting 
boundary to include our managed 
property portfolio, and in addition we 
will be certifying selected properties 
via the Climate Active Carbon Neutral 
Standard for buildings.

5.4  Stakeholder 
collaboration on 
environmental 
performance

We collaborate across our value chain 
and conduct ongoing activities to 
manage and improve environmental 
performance. Key stakeholders 
include customers, employees, facility 
management and suppliers.

Customers
We collaborate with customers 
to improve their sustainability 
performance and awareness through 
initiatives such as City Switch, a 
national tenant energy efficiency 
program. We are both a signatory and 
a landlord within the program.

We aim to drive improvements in 
customers’ energy efficiency through 
green building committees and other 
programs. These programs include 
involvement in the annual Earth 
Hour campaign and supporting 
and encouraging tenancy-focused 
NABERS Co-Assess ratings. We 
undertake initiatives to receive regular, 
open feedback from our customers. 
Customer feedback helps to determine 
the important sustainability issues that 
keep property performance on the right 
track.

Employees
Through internal working groups, 
we engage and collaborate with 
employees to raise awareness of 
environmental issues and progress 
ideas and projects to improve 
environmental performance. We 
also encourage employees to 
pursue professional development in 
sustainability and ESG related fields.

Facility managers
Dexus directly manages more than 
90% of the properties within the group 
portfolio. The remaining co-owned 
properties are managed either by the 
co-owners or by a jointly appointed 
independent property manager.

We engage with co-owners and 
independent property managers to 
review their performance against the 
property management agreements, 
and to monitor alignment with our 
policies, procedures and KPIs.

We work closely with our facility 
manager partners for directly managed 
sites which involves day-to-day 
interaction regarding operations to 
maximise property performance, deliver 
customer service and respond to 
customer needs.

We employ dedicated retail 
management teams across directly 
managed retail centres. These 
teams work closely with the retail 
management team to maximise the 
performance of each centre within its 
local community.

Suppliers
We engage with like-minded suppliers 
on sustainability issues and practices. 
We work with preferred property 
services providers and equipment 
vendors to select best-of-breed 
products to minimise environmental 
impacts while meeting performance 
expectations. We communicate our 
sustainability expectations to all 
suppliers through the Dexus Sustainable 
Procurement Policy and Supplier Code 
of Conduct and suppliers contractually 
agree to support these policies. Please 
refer to the Supply Chain section of this 
document (pages 133-141) for further 
information.

Industry collaboration  
on climate action
Dexus’s climate change resilience 
strategy not only involves mitigating 
its impact through decarbonisation, 
energy efficiency and renewable 
energy but also involves collaborating 
across its value chain, engaging with 
customers and suppliers to reduce 
their climate impacts as well as 
engaging with other key stakeholders. 
Dexus actively participates in industry 
collaborative initiatives to advocate 
for broader adaptation to climate- 
related issues, such as the promotion 
of circular economy principles in waste 
management, changes to building 
code specifications, and incentives 
that support investment in low carbon 
initiatives.

Dexus also actively participates in 
industry collaboration as a way of 
enhancing its understanding of climate 
risks and climate resilience to enable 
a more comprehensive integration 
of climate risks across the business 
activities. For example, Dexus is a 
partner of the Green Building Council 
of Australia’s Carbon Positive Roadmap 
for the built environment, a member 
of the Property Council of Australia’s 
National Sustainability Roundtable 
and have pledged our support for the 
World Green Building Council’s Net Zero 
Carbon Buildings Commitment.

5.5  Evaluation and 
continuous 
improvement

Our environmental programs are 
subject to annual external audit. 
Performance against goals is monitored 
by corporate leadership teams and the 
Risk team.

The Board ESG Committee, Board Risk 
Committee and the Board oversee the 
management of environmental and 
social issues across the group.

Our management reviews performance 
against its environmental objectives 
on a quarterly basis. We report on key 
environment commitments every six 
months and report comprehensively 
on all commitments within our Annual 
Reporting Suite (available on our 
website). This is in line with requirements 
to transparently monitor and report 
performance as outlined in the 
Environment Policy.

We benchmark energy efficiency 
performance against the leading 
industry benchmarks, NABERS and 
Green Star. NABERS provides resource 
consumption profiles for each property 
and helps to identify improvements.

NABERS Energy and Water ratings 
are undertaken at least annually for 
applicable office and retail assets 
across its portfolio.

We employ measures to assess ESG 
performance including:

 – Monitoring utility consumption 
(energy, water, and waste) patterns

 – Billing data: We record energy 
and environmental data in a 
centralised environmental reporting 
system and facility managers (FMs) 
receive regular reports that track 
performance. The FMs are queried 
about trends that differ from 
expectations

 – Meter data: FMs use interval and 
sub-meter data for finer granularity. 
This data helps identify potential 
savings projects and confirms 
the effectiveness of implemented 
projects

 – Asset plans include energy/water 
projects identified from audits and 
employee/customer suggestions.

 – We conduct measurement and 
verification to confirm successful 
project implementation

 – Monitoring NABERS ratings for 
energy and water for all eligible 
properties. These ratings are heavily 
scrutinised as they form the basis 
for internal KPIs

 – Participating in investor and 
industry benchmarking surveys

 – Environmental performance 
undergoes ongoing review through:

 – Live monitoring of building 
consumption by FMs

 – Monthly sustainability team 
meetings involving stakeholders 
from Dexus and its managing 
agents

 – Monthly reporting of NABERS 
ratings activity and tracking 
targets

 – Monthly review of energy 
and water billing data and 
investigation into adverse 
consumption trends

 – Quarterly Board ESG Committee 
progress updates

We recognise there are challenges in 
delivering ESG outcomes across the 
portfolio. We seek to learn and evolve 
the journey to guide the portfolio to 
achieve our ESG target

We measure our success in 
environmental performance in the 
following ways:

 – Completion of commitment 
milestones

 – Achievement of targets

 – Feedback from customers  
and employees

 – Awards and external recognition

 – Inclusion and rankings within 
sustainability and leadership indices

 – Benchmarking against leading 
industry asset certifications such 
as NABERS, Green Star, and ESG 
benchmarks such as GRESB

156  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



GRI Content Index

Dexus has elected to prepare its 2022 
Sustainability Report in accordance 
with the GRI Standards (Core) 
Reporting Guidelines. By implementing 
the GRI Reporting Principles, Dexus was 
required to disclose its management 
approach and procedures, and 
performance, against a list of standard 
disclosures, as well as topic-specific 
disclosures based on the list of material 
topics. Dexus’s 2022 Materiality 
Assessment Process is described on 
pages 6-7 of this Report. 

Dexus has reported against the two 
main types of GRI Reporting Standards:

 – Universal Standards – GRI 102 
General Disclosures 2016 and GRI 
103 Management Approach 2016: 
disclosures that report contextual 
information about the group and 
the management approach for 
each material topic. 

 – Topic-Specific Disclosures: 
indicators that elicit comparable 
information on the group’s 
economic, environmental, and 
social performance for each 
material issue.

Dexus is aware that GRI has published 
revised Universal Standards and that 
they are in effect for reporting from  
1 January 2023. Dexus will prepare its 
2023 Sustainability Report in alignment 
with the revised Universal Standards. 

Dexus referred to the Global Reporting 
Initiative GRI Standards to help determine 
the 2022 Sustainability Report boundaries 
and for guidance on identifying and reporting 
material issues, management approaches and 
procedures, and key performance indicators.

To: The Board of Directors of Dexus Funds Management Limited  

 
Independent assurance report on the preparation of selected Subject Matter contained 
within their 2022 Sustainability Report and 2022 Annual Report in accordance with the 
Assurance Criteria 

Scope 
In accordance with the terms of engagement letter dated 20 January 2022, we were engaged by Dexus Funds 
Management Limited (Dexus) to perform an independent limited assurance engagement in respect of the 
preparation of selected Subject Matter reported within their 2022 Sustainability Report and 2022 Annual Report in 
accordance with the Assurance Criteria for the year ended 30 June 2022. The selected Subject Matter, which is 
presented at www.dexus.com/2022-sustainability-report and www.dexus.com/2022-annual-report and is as 
follows: 

● Total net energy consumption 578,416 GJ 
● Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 location-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 128,866 tCO2-e 
● Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 market-based GHG emissions 24,498 tCO2-e 
● Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 net GHG emissions 0 tCO2-e 
● Total water usage 1,051,071 kL 
● Total waste to landfill and recycling 7,679 t 
● Percentage of female employees (FTE) 51% 
● Percentage of females in senior management (headcount) 36% 
● Percentage of female Non-Executive Directors 43% 
● Absentee rate 3.1  
● Lost time injury frequency rate 0 
● Fatalities 0  
● Site-based Contractors Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) 2.26 
● Site-based Contractors Fatalities 0 

 

The Assurance Criteria against which we assessed the Subject Matter was prepared by Dexus and is titled 2022 
Reporting Criteria presented at: www.dexus.com/2022-sustainability-report and included as Appendix 1 to our 
Assurance Report. 

Dexus’s responsibilities 
Dexus is responsible for the Subject Matter and for the preparation of the Subject Matter in accordance with the 
Criteria.  

Our Independence and Quality control 
We have complied with relevant ethical requirements related to assurance engagements, which include 
independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 
competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. 

184  Dexus 2022 Sustainability Report



 
 

In accordance with Auditing Standard ASQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of 
Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, Other Assurance Engagements and Related Services 
Engagements the firm maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. 

Our responsibilities 
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the procedures we have performed and 
the evidence we have obtained.  

Our engagement has been conducted in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ASAE 3000) Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. That 
standard requires that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether anything 
has come to our attention to indicate that the Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Criteria, for the Period. The procedures we performed were based on our professional 
judgement and included: 

● Undertaking enquiries of management regarding the processes and controls for capturing, collating and 
reporting the Subject Matter; 

● Reconciling the Subject Matter with Dexus underlying records; 
● Agreeing underlying records back to supporting third party documentation on a sample basis; 
● Undertaking analytical review procedures over data and obtaining explanations from management 

regarding unusual or unexpected amounts; 
● Assessing the reasonableness of any material estimates made in preparing the Subject Matter; 
● Assessing the appropriateness of the GHG emission factors applied in calculating the Total Scope 1, 2 

and 3 GHG emissions and testing the arithmetical accuracy of the GHG emission calculations; and  
● Reviewing Dexus’ Assurance Criteria to ensure that it is appropriate for assurance and assessing the 

preparation and collation of the Subject Matter against the Assurance Criteria.  
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in 
extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement and consequently the level of assurance obtained in a 
limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a 
reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance 
opinion.  

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. 

Use of report 
This report was prepared for the Board of Directors of Dexus Funds Management Limited. We disclaim any 
assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report to any persons or users other than the Board of 
Directors of Dexus Funds Management Limited, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared. 

Inherent limitations 
Because of the inherent limitations of any assurance engagements due to the selective testing of the information 
examined, it is possible that fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be detected. A limited assurance 
engagement is not designed to detect all instances of non-compliance of the Subject Matter with the Criteria, as it

is limited primarily to making enquiries, of the management, and applying analytical procedures. The limited 
assurance conclusion expressed in this report has been formed on the above basis.  

Any reliance on this report by any third party is entirely at its own risk. We consent to the inclusion of this report 
within the 2022 Integrated Online Reporting Suite presented at: www.dexus.com/2022-sustainability-report to 
assist Dexus’ members in assessing whether the directors have discharged their responsibilities by 
commissioning an independent assurance report in connection with the selected Subject Matter. We accept no 
responsibility for the integrity and security of the Dexus website, which is the responsibility of Dexus 
management. This report is not intended to relate to, or to be read in conjunction with, any information that may 
appear on the Dexus website other than the Subject Matter and Assurance Criteria. Readers of this report on the 
Dexus website (who may read it for their information only) should bear in mind the inherent risk of the website 
changing after the date of our report. 

Conclusion 
Based on our review, which is not an audit, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria for the period 1 
July 2021 to 30 June 2022.

Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and have been adopted by the NGERA.  
GHG are measured in carbon dioxide equivalents and expressed in tonnes (tCO2-e). 

Scope 1 GHG 
emissions 

Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions) comprise GHG emission under associated with fuel 
combustion and use of hydrofluorocarbons for the following sources: 

− Natural gas (used for heating air and water). Natural gas data is derived from supply 
authority billing. Meter data and/or estimated data is applied based on Dexus’s 
methodology, set out below, if billing data is unavailable at the time of reporting. 

− Diesel Oil (Diesel). Diesel data is collected from site operations managers and is sourced 
from delivery invoices for diesel purchases and periodic diesel tank level readings. Billing 
data and/or estimated data is applied based on Dexus’s methodology if billing data is 
unavailable at the time of reporting.  

− Refrigerant gases (used within air conditioning equipment). The data for refrigerant 
gases is derived from a refrigerant register that lists all equipment under Dexus 
operational control. Leakage is measured via equipment maintenance records of 
refrigerant top-ups or by applying an annual leakage rate as defined with the National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination, July 2021, with global 
warming potentials relative to CO2 aligned with the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2014). 

 
Dexus does not have company fleet vehicles and no direct vehicle-related emissions have been 
reported.  
Scope 1 emissions have been calculated according to the National Greenhouse and Energy 
Reporting (Measurement) Determination, July 2021.

Scope 2 
location-based 
GHG emissions 

Scope 2 location-based GHG emissions comprise indirect GHG emissions associated with grid-
purchased electricity used for lighting and power. The data is provided by supply authority billing. 
Meter and/or estimated data is applied based on Dexus’s methodology if billing data is unavailable 
at the time of reporting. 
Scope 2 emissions have been calculated using published average grid emission factors according to 
the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination, July 2021. 
 

Scope 2 GHG 
market-based 
GHG emissions 

Scope 2 GHG market-based emissions comprise indirect GHG emissions associated with grid-
purchased electricity used for lighting and power. The data is provided by supply authority billing. 
Meter and/or estimated data is applied based on Dexus’s methodology if billing data is unavailable 
at the time of reporting.   
‘Market-based’ Scope 2 emissions involve separate accounting for any type of energy or energy 
attributed to a purchase via a contractual instrument, using source-based scope 2 emission factors 
evidenced by electricity attribute certificates, as defined within The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: 
Scope 2 Guidance.  
Dexus has separated its electricity purchases into three categories for emissions calculations: 
Renewable electricity: 

- ‘Supplied renewable electricity’ supplied as a proportion of total grid purchases from 
energy retailers within electricity supply arrangements, which involves retailers 
surrendering Large Scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) for electricity consumed by 
Dexus in line with Australia’s Renewable Energy Target (RET).  These are evidenced by 
electricity supply agreements and tax invoices for supply of electricity, as defined below 

- ‘Additional voluntary renewable electricity’ purchases made by Dexus that can be 
accounted using source-based scope emission factors evidenced by electricity attribute 
certificates obtained and surrendered by or on behalf of Dexus, as defined below 

Non-renewable electricity: 
- ‘Remaining electricity’ which is deemed to be derived from fossil fuels, where emissions 

are accounted for by applying state-based ‘residual mix factors’, as defined below  
 
Where: 
Electricity supply agreements and tax invoices – agreements between Dexus and electricity 
retailers for the supply of electricity, and subsequent invoices issued that state the volume of 
electricity consumed.  These agreements and tax invoices include details for the sourcing of LGCs 
in line with retailer requirements under the RET, with Dexus being the end-consumer of electricity. 
Energy attribute certificates – instruments have been developed to track energy production 
information (or its “attributes”) separately from actual energy delivery. These instruments typically 
flow from energy generation facilities to energy suppliers and ultimately energy consumers to 
support consumer claims about the type of energy used and its related attributes.  
Dexus recognises the following schemes and certificates as energy attribute certificates and has 
applied the nominated GHG emission coefficients listed in the table below for quantities of electricity 
purchased and consumed, or volumes of certificates that retired under these schemes.

Scope 2 
location-based 
GHG emissions 

Scope 2 location-based GHG emissions comprise indirect GHG emissions associated with grid-
purchased electricity used for lighting and power. The data is provided by supply authority billing. 
Meter and/or estimated data is applied based on Dexus’s methodology if billing data is unavailable 
at the time of reporting. 
Scope 2 emissions have been calculated using published average grid emission factors according to 
the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination, July 2021. 
 

Scope 2 GHG 
market-based 
GHG emissions 

Scope 2 GHG market-based emissions comprise indirect GHG emissions associated with grid-
purchased electricity used for lighting and power. The data is provided by supply authority billing. 
Meter and/or estimated data is applied based on Dexus’s methodology if billing data is unavailable 
at the time of reporting.   
‘Market-based’ Scope 2 emissions involve separate accounting for any type of energy or energy 
attributed to a purchase via a contractual instrument, using source-based scope 2 emission factors 
evidenced by electricity attribute certificates, as defined within The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: 
Scope 2 Guidance.  
Dexus has separated its electricity purchases into three categories for emissions calculations: 
Renewable electricity: 

- ‘Supplied renewable electricity’ supplied as a proportion of total grid purchases from 
energy retailers within electricity supply arrangements, which involves retailers 
surrendering Large Scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) for electricity consumed by 
Dexus in line with Australia’s Renewable Energy Target (RET).  These are evidenced by 
electricity supply agreements and tax invoices for supply of electricity, as defined below 

- ‘Additional voluntary renewable electricity’ purchases made by Dexus that can be 
accounted using source-based scope emission factors evidenced by electricity attribute 
certificates obtained and surrendered by or on behalf of Dexus, as defined below 

Non-renewable electricity: 
- ‘Remaining electricity’ which is deemed to be derived from fossil fuels, where emissions 

are accounted for by applying state-based ‘residual mix factors’, as defined below  
 
Where: 
Electricity supply agreements and tax invoices – agreements between Dexus and electricity 
retailers for the supply of electricity, and subsequent invoices issued that state the volume of 
electricity consumed.  These agreements and tax invoices include details for the sourcing of LGCs 
in line with retailer requirements under the RET, with Dexus being the end-consumer of electricity. 
Energy attribute certificates – instruments have been developed to track energy production 
information (or its “attributes”) separately from actual energy delivery. These instruments typically 
flow from energy generation facilities to energy suppliers and ultimately energy consumers to 
support consumer claims about the type of energy used and its related attributes.  
Dexus recognises the following schemes and certificates as energy attribute certificates and has 
applied the nominated GHG emission coefficients listed in the table below for quantities of electricity 
purchased and consumed, or volumes of certificates that retired under these schemes.

Renewable Power Percentage (RPP) – The renewable power percentage represents the number 
(or percentage) of LGCs each liable entity (i.e., electricity retailer) is required to surrender each year.  
Retailers in turn include the surrender of LGCs in electricity contracts, and as the end consumer of 
electricity, organisations like Dexus are receiving a proportion of total electricity in line with the RPP.  
Dexus is applying the RPP as a close proxy for the national proportion of renewable energy supplied 
to consumers via their electricity arrangements. 
The RPP is published annually by Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator: 
http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/Scheme-participants-and-industry/the-renewable-

Market-based ‘residual mix’ factors – emissions factors relating to fossil fuel electricity generators, 
and are derived from the published state-based grid emissions factors (location-based factors), and 
scaled for the proportion of electricity generated from fossil fuels by subtracting the Renewable 
Power Percentage (RPP) from total (or 100%) of electricity supplied, as follows:

Scope 2 ‘location-based’ grid factors have been soured from the National Greenhouse and Energy 
Reporting (Measurement) Determination, July 2021. 
Scope 3 ‘location-based’ grid factors have been soured from the National Greenhouse Accounts 
(NGA) Factors, August 2021. 
 
This approach has been adopted from the Property Council Scope 2 workbook, v1 28 June 2019 
published by the Property Council of Australia, however the calculations are applied individually to 
each state-based factor, rather than using a national approach.  
This deviation has been adopted to maintain consistency with location-based reporting – noting that 
once the RPP is used to separate grid-supplied electricity into renewable and non-renewable, this 
approach results in equivalent emissions, should an organisation not make any additional voluntary 
renewable energy purchases. 
  
Within this approach: 

- Electricity attribute certificates acquired directly by Dexus and surrendered are deemed to 
be additional to those surrendered to meet RET obligations 

- Given the interconnected nature of the National Electricity Market, it is assumed that the 
proportion of renewable energy is equitably distributed across Australia, including Western 
Australia 

 
Emissions accounting for ‘accredited power stations’ – Dexus operates rooftop solar 
photovoltaic (PV) systems that generate electricity from solar energy for consumption on-site by 
Dexus, its customers or exported to the grid.  
In some properties, the solar PV system has been registered as an Accredited Power Station as 
defined in Australia’s Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 and is eligible to create LGCs based 
on eligible electricity generated.   
For the LGCs created, Dexus acknowledges that, as the energy attribute certificate, the LGCs 
created carry the applicable renewable energy benefit and has the option to retire or transfer these 
LGCs. 
To avoid double-counting of renewable benefits (i.e. claiming solar and retiring LGCs), Dexus 
accounts for all electricity generated from accredited power stations as being 100% exported to the 
electricity grid and is substituted by an equivalent amount of ‘grid sourced’ electricity as an incoming 
supply to the property. The substituted electricity is accounted for using the market-based emissions 
methodology above, and in order to claim any renewable benefit, Dexus surrenders the equivalent 
LGCs with the Clean Energy Regulator. 

Scope 3

Scope 3 location-based emissions (other indirect emissions) comprise GHG associated with 
transmission and distribution losses (“energy losses”) associated with energy use, waste sent to 
landfill, recycled waste, and water/wastewater use, and emissions from corporate operations 
including office paper use, corporate travel and employee commuting.  
Data sources:

Energy 
consumed 

Energy consumed comprises primary energy sources, namely natural gas, diesel and electricity 
purchased by Dexus for facilities within the reporting boundary for Australia.  
Energy consumed also comprises secondary electricity that is generated from conversion of solar 
energy, and natural gas or diesel via combustion, for consumption within the facility. 
Energy consumed is calculated as a total figure converting measured usage to gigajoules using the 
methods and conversion factors specified within the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting 
(Measurement) Determination, July 2021.  
Energy consumption has been based on quantities invoiced or metered by suppliers or Dexus.  
Estimates are used when billing data is unavailable and these are based on Dexus’s methodology, 
drawing from secondary sources such as meter data or based on seasonal historical estimates. 

Energy 
produced 
 

Energy produced comprises energy captured from natural sources and the manufacture of energy 
from transformation from another fuel source within Dexus for facilities within the reporting boundary 
for subsequent consumption onsite or export offsite.  
Energy produced comprises: 

− Electricity production from solar radiation (solar PV). The data for electricity 
production from solar radiation is derived from site-based sub meters. Estimated data is 
applied based on Dexus’s methodology if meter data is unavailable at the time of 
reporting.  

o Dexus measures and reports on total energy produced, separated into the 
following end-use consumption outcomes: 

▪ Electricity consumed on site by Dexus 
▪ Electricity consumed on site by Customers 
▪ Electricity exported to the grid 

o Dexus delineates between LGC-producing and non-LGC-producing systems as 
follows: 

a. Accredited Power Stations: Larger solar PV systems that are registered as an 
Accredited Power Station as defined in Australia’s Renewable Energy 
(Electricity) Act 2000 are eligible to create LGCs based on eligible electricity 
generated 

i. Dexus applies a ‘grid-first’ approach and accounts for all electricity 
generated from accredited power stations as being 100% exported to 
the electricity grid and is substituted by an equivalent amount of ‘grid 
sourced’ electricity as an incoming supply to the property.  

 
b. Small scale rooftop solar systems: Smaller solar PV systems that are not 

registered.   
i. Dexus applies a ‘site-first’ approach’ whereby solar electricity is 

metered and recorded as ‘Solar Electricity’. Where an embedded 
network is operates at the property, solar benefit attributed to Dexus 
first, then its customers and then the grid on an annual net-basis 

 
− Dexus measures and reports on total energy produced, separated into the following end-

use consumption outcomes: 
o Electricity consumed on site by Dexus 
o Electricity consumed on site by Customers 
o Electricity exported to the grid

efficiency factors of 32% for natural gas and 40% for diesel, which represent the 
estimated electricity yield. Estimated data is applied based on Dexus’s methodology if 
meter data is unavailable at the time of reporting.  

Energy produced is calculated as a total figure converting measured usage to gigajoules using the 
methods and conversion factors specified within the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting 
(Measurement) Determination, July 2021. 

Total net energy 
consumed 

Total net energy consumed is defined as the energy consumed minus the energy produced within 
the reporting boundary. Net energy consumed excludes energy that is produced and exported 
‘offsite’ to a customer or a network.  

Water 
consumption 

Water consumption is based on quantities invoiced or metered by suppliers. 
Water consumption comprises: 

− Water purchased by Dexus from local water authorities and suppliers for assets for which 
Dexus has operational control 

− Recycled water from onsite greywater and blackwater treatment systems 
Water consumption excludes water use from onsite rainwater harvesting. 

Total waste Total waste is based on volume or weight quantities invoiced by waste contractors. 
Total waste comprises: 

− Waste measured in weight that is sent to landfill by waste and cleaning contractors on 
behalf of Dexus and our customers for office and retail assets for which Dexus has 
operational control. 

− Recycling measured in weight that is diverted from landfill by waste and cleaning 
contractors on behalf of Dexus and our customers for office and retail assets for which 
Dexus has operational control. 

− Where waste and recycling data is based off volumes rather than actual weights, waste 
contractors use a predetermined density factor to report to Dexus in weight. Waste 
contractors may apply different density factors based on their historical analysis of 
different waste collection practices employed at Dexus facilities. For example, there may 
be variations in bin size and average bin fullness across different facilities. 

Total waste excludes waste to landfill and recycling for industrial assets as Dexus does not have 
operational control over waste collection. 
Furthermore, waste data may be not available for all office and retail facilities.  The site area of 
those facilities that have been reported represents 100% of the total lettable area of retail and office 
facilities within the reporting boundary. 

Data confidence 
and estimation 

Where primary data such as utility invoices have not been received, estimates are applied using the 
following prioritised data methodology: 

1. 30-minute interval electricity, natural gas and water metering data supplied by 
MP/MDA Metering Dynamics 

2. Estimated data using an estimate that accounts for seasonal variances derived by: 
a. Derived from an actual figure for the same period in the prior year, 

adjusted for the length of the gap 
b. Derived from an actual figure for the prior month, adjusted for the length of 

the gap 
c. Interpolation between two adjacent actual readings, adjusted for the length 

of the gap 
3. Estimated data using the monthly average for the previous 12-month period.

The ‘Dexus workforce’ or ‘Dexus employees’ includes staff employed full-time, part-time, 
on fixed term contracts and on a casual basis and excludes independent 
consultants/service providers and temporary staff sourced via external agencies. 

Number of workers Number of workers - Is defined as the number of workers who were employed by 
Dexus as recorded at 30 June 2022.  
Headcount data for the purpose of these statistics represents the active Dexus workforce 
and is based on the metric ‘Total Headcount (ongoing)’ as defined by the Australian 
Public Service Commission (https://legacy.apsc.gov.au/appendix-common-workforce-
metrics), as the number of ongoing employees directly employed by Dexus at the point in 
time described above. 

Number of full-time 
equivalent employees 

Number of full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) - Is defined as the number of 
workers who were employed by Dexus as recorded at 30 June 2022.  
FTE data for the purpose of these statistics represents the whole Dexus workforce, and 
is based on the metric ‘Total FTE’ as defined by the Australian Public Service 
Commission (https://legacy.apsc.gov.au/appendix-common-workforce-metrics), as the 
number of full-time equivalent employees directly employed by the organisation at a 
point in time where part-time employees are converted to full-time equivalent based on 
the hours they work as a proportion of the hours for a full-time employee. 

Number of hours worked Number of hours worked in the period - Refers to the total scheduled number of hours 
of all Dexus employees as recorded at 30 June 2022. Dexus offers employees flexible 
work arrangements and staff are employed under individual contracts that stipulate 38 
hours per week for each full-time employee.  As Dexus does not track employee working 
hours and staff do not engage in overtime or shift work, Dexus has defined the ‘number 
of hours worked’ as 1824 hours per annum (equal to 240 days x 7.6 hours) per full-time 
employee.
