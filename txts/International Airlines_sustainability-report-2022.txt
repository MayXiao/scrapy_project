What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel? 

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are 
chemically almost identical to kerosene. 

The feedstocks for these fuels – 
currently waste materials such as used 
cooking oil, municipal waste or waste 
wood – absorb CO2 in their growth

cycle before this carbon is recycled into 
fuel and then consumed in the flight. 

There are eight certified pathways to 
making SAF based on use of specific 
technologies. These processes are certified 
to international standards to ensure the 
fuels are safe to use. SAF can be used in 
existing aircraft and airport fuelling 
infrastructure. 

IAG also ensures its SAF complies with 
strict sustainability certification schemes 
to ensure the feedstocks come from 
sustainable sources, and that the 
production processes conserve water 
and energy and have minimal wider 
impacts.

Leading our industry 
in SAF projects 

Role in IAG transition plan 
SAF is a key solution in IAG’s transition plan to net zero (Section A.1.2). It reduces carbon emissions on a greenhouse gas lifecycle 
basis and typically by 70 per cent or more compared with the fossil jet fuels it replaces.

IAG is on track to deliver a 100-fold increase in its SAF volumes between 2022 and 2030 and expects to use SAF for 70 per cent of 
total fuel in 2050. 

In 2021, the Group set a target of using one million tonnes of SAF a year by 2030, dependent on appropriate government policy 
support, and this volume will save as much carbon as taking one million cars off the road a year. The Group has now secured 
250,000 tonnes of SAF for 2030, committing US$865 million in SAF offtakes and investments.1

The Group has also made direct investments in new and innovative SAF production capacity, catalysing the wider development of 
the SAF market. These investments are typically coupled with SAF purchase agreements, which are critical to the financeability of 
the new SAF production capacity.

1 Based on an assumed jet fuel price in 2030 of $900 per metric tonne and contracted margins for SAF production.

Group airlines will be taking delivery 
of 7,500 tonnes annually from the 
Lanzajet Freedom Pines facility once 
construction is completed towards 
the end of 2023.

Planet spotlight: Sustainable Aviation Fuel in 2022 

First alchohol-to-jet SAF plant 
In October, the LanzaJet 
Freedom Pines plant in the US 
(see above) was the first SAF 
project in the world to receive a 
grant – of $50 million – from the 
Breakthrough Energy Catalyst 
Fund. IAG invested in this plant 
and will receive offtake when it is 
operational, which is expected to 
be the end of 2023.

New SAF offers for customers 
From June 2022, Vueling offered 
customers the option to fund 
SAF use on the day of their flight, 
via a partnership with Avikor. 
Over 50,000 passengers 
contributed, and Vueling 
matched their contributions, 
supplying over 50 tonnes of SAF 
at Barcelona and Madrid airports.

First UK-produced commercial 
scale SAF 
Across 2022, in partnership with 
the refining company Phillips 66, 
British Airways received the first 
UK-produced SAF on a 
commercial scale, which is 
manufactured using sustainable 
waste oils.

A.1.2. Transition plan 
Overview
IAG is targeting net zero emissions by 
2050 across its Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. 

‘Net zero’ means any residual emissions 
from IAG operations in 2050, or by the 
manufacture and transport of goods 
supplied to the Group, will be mitigated by 
an equivalent amount of CO2 removed 
from the atmosphere via carbon removals. 

IAG is on track to deliver its 2025, 2030 
and 2050 climate targets (see below) by 
carrying out emission-reduction initiatives, 
working in collaboration with key 
stakeholders and proactively advocating 
for supportive government policy and 
technology development.

IAG is also driving internal action by using 
climate-related annual incentives for over 
7,400 senior executives and managers.

Key measures to reduce emissions are 
fleet modernisation, SAF, market-based 
measures including the UK and EU ETS 
and CORSIA, and carbon removals. 

Less than 10 per cent of the emissions 
reductions to 2050 are from offsets.

Roadmap to net zero

IAG was the first airline group in the world 
to commit to net zero emissions and has 
been publishing its latest roadmap to this 
goal every year since 2019.

The version below is a core Group scenario 
which assumes continued policy support 
for aviation decarbonisation, an overall 
recovery to 2019 levels of passenger 
demand by 2024 and annual demand 
growth aligned with the long-term growth 
forecasts disclosed in Note 4 and 17 of the 
Financial Statements.

Key changes versus last year’s roadmap 
are an earlier ramp up of carbon removals, 
larger net emissions reductions from 
CORSIA, fuel efficiency gains tapering by 
2050, and an increased share of SAF in 
2050 to reflect proposed mandates. This 
roadmap maintains the assumption on 
hydrogen aircraft in the fleet from 2040 
and 5 per cent saving from airspace 
modernisation by 2050.

IAG invests in innovation to meet its targets, drive decarbonisation and accelerate wider change towards a more sustainable industry. 
IAG supports climate technology innovation via its Hangar 51 accelerator, venture capital investments, university collaborations, pilot 
schemes, supporting applications for grant funding, and research and development consortia. Since 2019, a dedicated sustainability 
category has been included in the Group accelerator programme Hangar 51.

IAG supports the 1.5°C ambition of the Paris Agreement and continues to review evidence on aviation pathways which support this.

Where possible, IAG will work with relevant stakeholders, including the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and Transition Pathway 
Initiative (TPI), to build an understanding of aviation industry pathways to net zero, how these contribute to national and global goals, 
and how companies and policy makers can drive investment into a green transition.

Future emissions intensity
Delivery of current decarbonisation 
plans, dependent on appropriate policy 
support, is expected to enable the 
following changes versus 2019:

Gross emissions (MT CO2):

• 2030 – 15 per cent lower
• 2050 – 73 per cent lower

Gross emissions intensity (g CO2/pkm):

• 2030 – 27 per cent lower
• 2035 – 39 per cent lower
• 2050 – 83 per cent lower

IAG supports the inclusion of carbon 
removals in industry decarbonisation 
pathways, and in external assessments 
of support for the 1.5°C global ambition.

IAG’s short- and long-term targets have 
been independently assessed by TPI as 
1.5°C-aligned and it’s mid-term target 
assessed as well-below-2°C-aligned.

The TPI assessment compared the 
milestones in the 2021 IAG roadmap 
with an industry-wide pathway 
modelled by the International Energy 
Agency (IEA), taking removals 
commitments into account.

What are carbon removals?

Carbon removals solutions extract CO2 
already in the atmosphere and store it in 
biological or geological ways. 

Four key types are relevant for IAG:

• Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) – include 
creating new forests and peatland

• BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage 
(BECCS) – capturing biogenic carbon 
from industrial facilities and storing it 
in e.g. underground aquifers

• CCS with SAF production – as above 
and including the use of byproducts 
which can absorb CO2

• Direct Air Capture (DAC) – absorbing 
CO2 directly from the air using a catalyst

Carbon removals projects differ from 
carbon avoidance projects, which prevent 
the future release of CO2. IAG sees carbon 
avoidance projects as a key transitional 
solution en route to full use of removals.

When IAG or operating companies choose 
to voluntarily invest in carbon avoidance 
and removal projects, they work in 
collaboration with key partners, carry out 
due diligence to select reputable providers 
and select projects carefully to meet and 
align with verified quality standards such 
as Gold Standard and Verified Carbon 
Standard (VCS).

Within the Group, British Airways started 
offering removals projects to customers in 
2022: mangrove restoration in Pakistan 
and a biochar project in Oregon, USA.

Role in IAG transition plan

By 2050, IAG will only use carbon 
removals to mitigate any residual 
emissions from its operations. 

By 2050 it will only work with suppliers 
who do the same, as part of meeting the 
Group Scope 3 commitment. It is already 
encouraging suppliers to transition from 
offsets to removals as part of a new 
supplier contract clause which is being 
rolled out across its supply chain.

Based on the latest roadmap detailed 
below, the Group expects to use 
approximately 100 MT of carbon removals 
between 2022 and 2050 to mitigate Scope 
1 emissions and could potentially be 
removing 2 MT annually in 2030, 
conditional on clear and globally agreed 
verification and quality standards for 
removals, inclusion of removals in ETS 
schemes, and stable policy support.

IAG expects to use removals to meet an 
increasing share of its CORSIA obligations 
between 2024 and 2035, conditional on 
the above, and supports wider guidance 
on how to transition to removals such as 
the Oxford Offsetting Principles.

It continues to advocate for policies that 
will accelerate global uptake of carbon 
removals, via the Coalition for Negative 
Emissions and other trade associations 
listed in A.1.7., and supports the inclusion of 
removals in the EU, Swiss and UK ETS.

2 Rounded to the nearest '000 tonnes CO2e.
3 2020 emissions were below the EU ETS sector cap for aviation so no net reductions were delivered.
4 For completeness, Scope 2 emissions cover electricity use at airports and overseas offices, which are partly outside IAG’s operational control.

 As part of complying with UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting regulation, IAG can disclose that 56 per cent of Group energy use was UK 
energy use, based on Scope 1 emissions and Group electricity use in UK-based offices.

A.1.3. Metrics and progress
Overview
IAG’s transition plan focuses on reducing 
CO2 from jet fuel use, as this represents 
over 99 per cent of Scope 1 emissions. 
The Group measures its full carbon 
footprint and tracks multiple metrics each 
quarter to ensure progress on tackling 
climate change. 

2022 saw strong progress against the key 
metric of carbon efficiency. With a 12 per 
cent improvement to 83.5g CO2/pkm1, the 
Group is on track to deliver the 2025 
target of 80g CO2/pkm.

Other factors like International Energy 
Agency emissions factors are used in 
specific cases as described in the NFIS.

IAG discloses methane (CH4) and nitrous 
oxide (N2O) as Scope 1 non-CO2 
greenhouse gases (GHGs), in line with the 
UK conversion factors. 

Emissions of CH4 were 13,072 tonnes in 
2022 and N2O were 198,324 tonnes.

A.1.4. Emissions reduction initiatives
Relevant standards: TR-AL-110a2. GRI 305-5.
Reducing gross and net emissions is a collective effort across the Group. Examples are throughout this report.

By 2030, fleet renewal and SAF programmes will have the biggest impact on reducing gross emissions, and CORSIA will have the 
biggest impact on reducing net emissions. In addition, other specific initiatives are run within operating airlines.

Here are savings from key initiatives in 2022, rounded to the nearest 10,000 tonnes: 

1,580,000 30,000 80,000 230,000
illustrative tonnes of CO2 
saved this year from a more 
efficient fleet, compared to the 
2019 fleet pre-COVID-19

tonnes of CO2 saved from 
SAF purchased this year, five 
times higher than the saving in 
2021

tonnes of CO2 saved from 
operational efficiency initiatives 
such as reduced use of landing 
flaps, single-engine taxi-in 
and reduced weight on-board

tonnes of CO2 avoided due 
to use of certified carbon offset 
projects, in locations such as 
Cambodia, Peru, the Congo 
Basin, Sudan and Malawi

A diverse portfolio of SAF
IAG continues to work with technology developers to establish a range of SAF supply options, including the projects listed below. 
The Group uplifts jet fuel in multiple locations including the US and Europe and therefore is exploring projects in multiple regions. 
It is working to support SAF projects which also remove carbon or capture and store it.

IAG has secured 25 per cent of its 2030 target volume of 1 million tonnes.

A.1.5. Scenario analysis 
Overview
In 2022, IAG carried out multiple and 
aligned forms of scenario analysis:

• The IAG Sustainability team and the 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
team reviewed all climate-related risks 
and opportunities and potential impacts 
to 2024 and 2030. The impacts of 
material risks are quantified as part of 
the Company-wide ERM process which 
receives Board oversight

• Operating airlines modelled compliance-
related costs, including from the UK and 
EU ETS and CORSIA, to 2030

• TCFD-aligned scenario analysis was 
repeated using a dual timeframe of 2030 
and 2040

• Ongoing analysis was carried out on the 
Flightpath Net Zero strategy to 2050 

This scenario work informs strategy, 
planning, risk management and financial 
management.

IAG takes a proactive approach to 
managing climate-related risks and 
opportunities, and is committed to 
managing their regulatory, reputational, 
financial, market and technology aspects.

Applying carbon prices 
IAG concurrently applies carbon prices to 
financial planning and to future scenario 
analysis. 

The fleet team uses updated carbon prices 
and price forecasts for shorthaul and 
longhaul fleet purchasing decisions, based 
on market values and reputable external 
sources. The Group airlines use carbon 
prices in financial planning, and flight 
operations teams and pilots use carbon 
prices in operational decisions about fuel 
uptake.

Potential acquisitions include an 
assessment of exposure to climate-related 
issues and policy.

For the period 2022-30, UK ETS prices of 
£75-£150/tonne, EU ETS prices of €67-
€130/tonne and CORSIA prices of $11-$21/
tonne were used for modelling compliance 
costs. 

EU and UK ETS prices are based on market 
prices and the UK Department for 
Transport (DfT) Aviation Forecast, and 
CORSIA prices are based on internal 
analysis and ICAO industry price forecasts. 

TCFD-aligned scenario analysis 

In 2022, IAG repeated a TCFD-aligned 
scenario analysis exercise, building on the 
2018 and 2021 exercises.

This was a structured, qualitative 
discussion of potential climate-related 
impacts and business responses, using the 
latest evidence and analysis from 
reputable sources like the UN, Eurocontrol 
and Climate Action Tracker (CAT).

1.5°C scenarios1 were chosen for 
transitional risks, in recognition of IAG and 
global targets. 2°C and 3°C warming 
scenarios were chosen for physical risks, 
based on the latest UN projections. 

2030 was chosen as the key timeframe, 
based on IAG targets and key policy 
timelines e.g. for SAF mandates. 2040 was 
also considered due to the possibility of 
the world overshooting 1.5°C in the 2030s 
leading to faster societal changes.

The 2021 and 2022 exercises involved 
representatives from multiple teams 
including Strategy, Treasury, Finance, 
Government Affairs, Commercial Planning, 
Investor Relations, People, Enterprise Risk 
Management, IAG Tech, IAG GBS, IAG 
Loyalty and sustainability representatives 
from all operating airlines. The Group 
Sustainability team collated inputs, which 
were reviewed by the IAG Sustainability 
Steering Group.

The Group remains resilient to the most 
material climate-related impacts – 
industry-wide policy shifts – and these 
have been quantified and mitigation plans 
embedded into financial and strategic 
planning. Industry-wide changes also 
create opportunities for the Group to 
move to become more resilient than its 
competitors.

To address significant uncertainty around 
future policy, technology and market 
trends, IAG is repeating scenario analysis 
annually. It will implement action plans in 
2023 to further improve resilience to wider 
changes.

1 ‘Orderly’ and ‘disorderly’ scenarios were chosen as per TCFD definitions. These scenarios compare smooth, predictable and idealised climate-related 
changes with abrupt, variable and disjointed changes across regions.

A.1.6. Risks and opportunities 
Climate-related risks are assessed and managed within the ERM framework as described in Section C.6. and in the Risk management 
and principal risks factors section under Principal Risk ‘Sustainable Aviation’. Opportunities are managed within relevant teams.

Transitional risks primarily affect airline activity between European destinations, which contributed 37 per cent of flying activity in 2022. 
Physical risks could affect IAG operations across its global network, reflecting the global nature of climate change. 

The carbon-reduction targets in the Flightpath Net Zero strategy are the key measures for assessing the mitigation of these risks, along 
with the consideration of these risks in relevant governance processes. The external risk environment, materiality of risks, mitigation 
actions and KPIs for these mitigating actions are reviewed regularly. 

The table below lists risks assessed through the ERM process. The most material risks are policy risks. Risk timeframes align with 
corporate planning timelines.

IAG continues to analyse risk and transition scenarios to inform mitigation plans to 2030. Key parameters for defining scenarios are 
below, based on UN, CAT, UK Climate Change Committee and internal analysis. These are kept under review. 

Physical risk parameters Current projection 2°C scenario 3°C scenario

EU emissions vs 1990 -55% (via Fit for 55) -55% -62%
US emissions vs 2005 -37% -50% -58%
Aviation (net) emissions vs 2019 -15% (via CORSIA) -15% -15%

1 Whether the cost impacts depend more on the temperature scenario (2°C or 3°C), or type of transition (orderly or disorderly).
2 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP), a globally recognised scenario for physical changes under different temperature ranges.
3 A 41 per cent drop by 2030 represents an orderly transition. A 27 per cent drop represents a disorderly transition because smaller global emissions 

reductions to 2030 require rapid decarbonisation after 2030 to return to 1.5°C by 2100.

Risk Impacts and Mitigation

Description as per previous page Potential unmitigated financial impacts How IAG is mitigating

Resilience to acute weather 
events

Days of lost revenue due to additional flight 
disruption and associated mitigation and 
passenger compensation costs

Existing operational resilience processes can 
minimise extra disruption from e.g. more 
turbulence from US-UK flights

Resilience of routes and 
assets to chronic climate 
changes

Changed revenue from a different route 
network or a different frequency of flights to 
climate-affected destinations, changes in 
operational maintenance costs

Scale of route network means impacts above 
plan are not material so no immediate action 
needed. Aircraft are mobile assets which can be 
moved to different locations to account for e.g. 
more hurricanes in Caribbean

Customer spend due to 
perceptions of IAG ESG 
progress

Customers change frequency of flying, duration 
of trips, or spend less relative to other carriers

Delivering emissions reductions, developing 
emissions dashboards for customers, 
expanding customer communications

Customer spend due to 
perceptions of aviation 
industry ESG progress

Customers change frequency of flying, duration 
of trips, or spend less relative to other travel 
modes

Support for global instruments like CORSIA, 
working via trade associations to advance 
green solutions

Perceived quality of offset 
and removal projects

Exposure to sudden variability in prices, cost of 
CORSIA credits, scale of growth in revenue by 
2050 due to available volume of removals to 
deliver net zero

Strategy to avoid price spikes, governance to 
ensure offset quality, a removals roadmap 
based on external evidence, advocacy for 
policy support and monitoring regimes

Supply chain readiness Sustainability compliance or technology change 
causing unplanned changes in cost of goods 
and services provided to IAG or associated 
supplier management costs, margin erosion 

Supply chain sustainability programme which 
includes ESG scorecards and supplier risk 
screening

Demand impact of EU and UK 
climate policy

Pass-through of industry-wide costs affects 
ticket prices and so demand

Impacts of emerging policy assessed as part of 
longer-term financial planning and strategy

Resilience to changes in 
CORSIA/ETS pricing

Exposure to long-term price increases affects 
compliance costs

Strategy to reduce impact of price spikes; using 
carbon prices in fleet and financial planning

Policy asymmetry across 
regions

Changing numbers of customers relative to 
other carriers who are under more favourable 
or more restrictive policy regimes

Advocacy for global solutions such as the ICAO 
Long-Term Aspirational Goal agreed in 2022

Extra regulation on activity 
not emissions

Industry-wide taxes or levies increase operating 
costs and have potential demand impacts, 
demand management measures equate to lost 
revenue 

Advocacy in support of emissions-reducing 
measures like SAF and against economically 
inefficient measures like taxes

Lack of supporting SAF 
infrastructure or policy

Higher prices of SAF in core markets due to 
lack of investment in SAF production or cost of 
inputs

Advocacy for SAF policy, e.g. via UK Jet Zero 
Council, and a strategy to procure SAF in 
regions where supportive policy exists

Regulation on non-CO2 
effects

Potential multiplier on ETS costs, lost revenue 
due to route restrictions, or operational costs 
due to non-CO2 management

External research suggests just 10% of flights 
could be 80% of impacts. Advocacy via trade 
associations to support monitoring and 
targeted solutions such as route optimisation 
and SAF uptake

Access to and readiness for 
lower-emission technologies

Higher ETS costs if technology access is 
restricted or technology development is slow

Hangar 51 Ventures team aligns research and 
work with the Flightpath Net Zero strategy

Access to SAF Changing unit prices of SAF in core markets Securing SAF deals and taking equity in 
early-stage projects where relevant

A.1.7. Stakeholder 
engagement
Relevant standards: GRI 102-13/43/44
Overview
The aviation industry will decarbonise 
faster with stakeholder and policy support.

The Group and its operating airlines 
regularly engage with key stakeholders: 
governments and regulators, shareholders, 
lenders and other financial stakeholders, 
trade associations, customers, suppliers, 
employees, communities, NGOs and 
academic institutions to advocate for 
support for emissions reductions and to 
share progress on Flightpath Net Zero.

As one example, IAG successfully delivered 
its first ESG day for investors in 2022, as 
described in the CEO letter in the ARA.

Internal governance ensures that wider 
stakeholder engagement on climate 
change is consistent with material issues 
and environmental goals. 

As per the IAG Code of Conduct, IAG does 
not use Company funds or resources to 
support any political party or candidate.

Key stances on climate change

IAG supports cost-effective approaches to 
deliver net zero emissions by 2050, 
advance low-carbon solutions, and support 
global efforts to align with 1.5°C.

Actions across ten associations are listed 
below. If the climate-related positions of 
trade associations are deemed to be 
substantially weaker or inconsistent with 
these internal stances, IAG representatives 
take roles on task forces and working 
groups and respond to consultations to 
communicate our stances and 
constructively move to alignment. 

IAG is proud to have consistent stances on 
climate change with all the organisations 
of which it is a member (below). IAG has 
positively influenced this outcome by 
contributing expertise and time to drive 
net zero commitments, and create and 
support roadmaps to net zero emissions 
across SA, A4E, oneworld, JZC, and ATAG. 
IAG has also driven and encouraged higher 
SAF ambitions across the JZC, oneworld 
and WEF.

IAG and key trade associations are listed 
on the EU Transparency Register. 

Key principles of climate-related 
engagement
Aviation is a global industry and IAG 
remains committed to global policy 
approaches. 

In 2022, it supported the strengthening of 
the global UN-regulated CORSIA scheme. 
Changes agreed at the ICAO General 
Assembly will ensure that net emissions 
from international aviation will be 15 per 
cent below 2019 levels in 2030, en route to 
the ICAO target of net zero emissions by 
2050.

IAG advocates for carbon pricing as a key 
instrument to determine both the pace of 
emissions reductions for the aviation 
industry and the balance of in-sector and 
out-of-sector reductions. 

IAG prioritises advocacy on SAF too, as 
this is a key emissions reduction driver in 
the next decade, and supports policies on 
operational efficiency, zero-emission 
aircraft and carbon offsets and removals.

It advocates for policies that are effective 
and fair across multiple airlines.

A.2.1. Waste
Relevant standards: GRI 306-1/2/3 
(2020).

Overview

IAG has one of the most comprehensive 
waste reduction plans in the airline 
industry.

The ‘5 by 2025’ plan covers five waste 
streams and five business units, with waste 
generation and recycling targets across 
on-board, office, cargo and maintenance 
waste and a zero-based approach to 
single-use plastic (SUP). IAG is committed 
to reducing, reusing and recycling waste 
and dealing with any hazardous waste in 
line with relevant national and international 
regulations.

A.2. Planet – wider issues

On-board services are the main source of 
waste. Key waste outputs include plastic 
packaging, leftover food waste, drinks cans 
and cabin items such as wrappers. Key 
inputs included on-board meals and 
amenity kits supplied to passengers. 

In 2022, IAG operations generated:

• 52,106 tonnes overall (27,613 in 2021)
• 51,133 tonnes non-hazardous waste 
• 973 tonnes hazardous waste. 

13,806 tonnes were recovered or recycled.

Waste is typically offloaded and processed 
at airports by third-party caterers, with 
some materials recovered on-site and 
other materials incinerated or sent to 
landfill. The majority of cabin and catering 
waste is processed at IAG’s hub airports 
– London, Madrid and Barcelona – 
although the Group flies to over 200 
airports worldwide.

Reducing food waste remains an area of 
focus. For example, Iberia offers a Buy-
Before-You-Fly service on shorthaul flights 
and British Airways offers a pre-ordering 
service for products from the on-board 
SpeedBird Cafe, to give passengers the 
choice of buying fresh and ambient 
products before departure. These services 
remove food waste from unpurchased 
shorthaul economy cabin meals while 
maintaining customer choice. British 
Airways has a target to halve food waste 
volumes between 2019 and 2025. 

The Group is also expanding its efforts to 
increase recycling. For example, in 2022 
Aer Lingus trialled the first-ever flights into 
Ireland to recycle on-board, Iberia 
segregated glass on-board for the first 
time, and Vueling rolled out trolleys which 
enabled waste segregation.

Below is the Group’s most comprehensive waste disclosure to date. Waste trends remain unusual due to the COVID-19 recovery and 
are expected to stabilise in 2023, allowing for more in-depth analysis of progress towards the 2025 goals.

Commentary on key metrics

Key metrics Description Commentary 

Overall waste Includes waste from all streams – on-board, office, cargo and 
maintenance waste – and an extrapolation of waste processed 
at overseas airports, where waste destinations are not always 
reported by third parties.

Waste volumes increased as flying recovered and 
waste intensity metrics are returning to pre-
pandemic levels. Trends are expected to stabilise 
in 2023.

Waste 
recycling and 
recovery

Includes re-use, downcycling, upcycling, energy from waste, 
composting and anaerobic digestion. Regulations, including 
International Catering Waste (ICW) regulations, limit the 
amount which can be recycled.

Overall recycling/recovery rates are 26 per cent, 
up from 21 per cent in 2019. The impact of airline 
recycling initiatives is expected to become clearer 
in 2023.

Single-Use 
Plastic (SUP)

Items made wholly or partly of plastic and are typically 
intended to be used just once or for a short period of time 
before they are thrown away. This aligns to the EU definition.

160 tonnes of SUP were reduced from initiatives 
such as using birchwood cutlery and replacing 
packaging on blankets. The IAG GBS Procurement 
team is evaluating alternatives to plastic as part of 
procurement processes.

Waste/pax at 
hubs

On-board catering waste generated per passenger, including 
volumes later recycled and recovered.

Passenger numbers are based on those inbound and outbound 
passengers who have their waste processed at hub airports 
London Heathrow and Gatwick, Madrid, Barcelona and Dublin. 

Waste generation ratios per passenger are 
gradually decreasing back to pre-pandemic levels.

Detailed descriptions of all waste metrics are available in the NFIS. 

A.2.2. Noise and air quality 
Relevant standards: GRI 305-7.
IAG has delivered a 12 per cent reduction in noise per take-off and landing cycle (LTO) versus 2019, driven by fleet renewal. It remains 
committed to reducing the impact of aircraft noise and air pollution on local communities near airports and supports innovation as a 
means of delivering this. Noise and air quality performance are monitored using national databases and global aircraft noise standards.

Group airlines continue operational practices to minimise noise impacts, such as the use of continuous descents. They engage with 
stakeholders such as community groups, regulators and industry partners to understand their concerns and participate in research and 
operational trials to identify and refine solutions. In 2021 and 2022, Iberia participated in the EU AVIATOR project to better understand 
air pollution at airports, including the impact of a 30 per cent SAF blend.

As indicated in the 2021 Annual Report, IAG planned to update noise targets in 2022 but has delayed this review until 2023 when flying 
demand is expected to stabilise. Detailed descriptions on all noise metrics are available in the IAG NFIS.

Metric Unit1 vly v2019 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018

1 % at standard is based on the fleet position at the end of 2021, including parked aircraft and excluding leased aircraft. Metrics per LTO are based on 
aircraft operational during the year. 80% of the IAG Fleet is CAEP Chapter 6-compliant, up from 74% in 2018.

Related risk: Operational noise restriction and charges
Risk and/or opportunity description and potential impact Mitigating actions

Airport operators and regulators apply operational noise 
restrictions and charging regimes which may introduce additional 
costs or restrict airlines’ ability to operate, e.g. restrictions on 
night flights.

• Investing in new quieter aircraft as part of fleet modernisation
• Continually improving operational practices including 

continuous descents, slightly steeper approaches, low-power/ 
low-drag approaches and optimised departures

• Internal governance and training and external advocacy in 
Ireland, Spain and the UK to manage noise challenges

B.1. Overview 
Our people are central to our business  
and key in delivering for our customers. 
The flexibility, commitment and support 
our colleagues have demonstrated  
have been critical to enable the Group’s 
recovery as markets re-opened and  
travel restrictions eased. 

Each airline had a different recovery path, 
reflecting their network and markets 
served. All have faced resourcing 
challenges as we established the capacity 
to meet increasing demands for travel. This 
resourcing challenge included recruiting 
around 17,400 new colleagues across the 
Group, driving a 17 per cent increase in our 
workforce year on year. The strength of 
the Group’s brands was key to attracting 
talent, but we faced industry-wide 
shortages in skilled resources especially in 
engineering and airport operation roles. At 
the end of 2022, around 66,000 people 
were employed across the Group in 77 
countries. Voluntary turnover at 8 per cent 
reflects both more normalised levels and 
the dynamic talent market in our key hubs.

The pandemic and inflation have created 
pressure for the business and for our 
people, and the approach to pay and 
conditions in each operating company 
reflected the different starting points  
and business context they face. The 
agreements reached by operating 
companies have endeavoured to strike the 
right balance between benefits to our 
employees and the competitiveness  
of the business in the long-term. 

At the start of 2022 we announced our 
ambition for 40 per cent of women in 
senior leadership roles by 2025. This new 
ambition was underpinned by a new 
diversity and inclusion framework and 
strategy and we have been making strong 
progress in making IAG a more inclusive 
place to work. 

In 2022, we have seen the percentage  
of women in the IAG Management 
Committee increase 8 percentage points 
with the appointment of Sarah Clements 
as IAG’s new General Counsel. We end the 
year at 34 per cent of women in senior 
leadership roles, up from 33 per cent in 
2021. We remain confident we are on track 
to deliver on our 40 per cent ambition and 
have instigated new succession and talent 
processes and implemented changes to 
ensure our recruitment processes are 
inclusive, and we are seeing more talent 
mobility across the Group as a result.

Description and commentary for key workforce metrics

Metric Unit Description Commentary

Employment Average 
manpower 
equivalent

Manpower equivalent is the number of 
employees adjusted to include part-time 
workers, overtime and contractors. 

The average is the mean of the manpower 
equivalent captured quarterly to reflect 
seasonality.

The 18.4% increase reflects our business’s growing 
recovery in 2022 and substantial recruitment and 
increases in full-time employment across the business. This 
is an average figure and most of the on-boarding of new 
recruits has taken place in the second half of 2022. 

This measure accounts for employees’ contractual 
schedule of work. 

Headcount Number of 
people

Headcount is the actual number of people 
employed across the Group (employees) 
at December 31, 2022.

Overall headcount has increased by 17% in 2022. This 
reflects recruitment drives across the Group’s key hubs. 

Composition % 
headcount 
by 
employment 
type, 
contract and 
employee 
categories

Composition is a breakdown of headcount 
as at December 31, 2022. Full-time 
employees are defined as those working 
full contractual hours as at December 31, 
2022. A temporary employment 
contract has a defined end date. 

The employee category breakdown 
portrays the distribution of the major 
groups within IAG’s workforce ’in the 
air‘ – pilots and cabin crew – and ’on the 
ground’ – airport, corporate and 
maintenance and logistics.

Increases in temporary workers to pre-pandemic levels of 
5%, driven by short-term capacity requirements and a 
return to more normalised seasonal resourcing. 

We have also seen an increase in full-time employees to 
80%. There have been significant net increases in full-time 
cabin crew +25% and airport operations employees +25%. 

Cabin crew composition levels have recovered this year to 
34% of the Group workforce.

Employees 
by country

Number of 
people

This metric depicts the distribution of the 
Group’s employees according to the 
country in which they are based.

The increase in the proportion of Group employees based 
in the UK reflects the recruitment drive currently underway 
in British Airways. This has seen nearly 9,000 UK-based 
employees join the Group. 

At the end of 2022 IAG had employees based in 77 
countries. 

Gender 
diversity

% women at 
Board, 
senior 
executive, 
and Group 
level

The share of women as a proportion of all 
staff at specific levels of seniority across 
the Group. 

There were 221 senior executives as at December 31, 2022. 

Gender diversity increased to 45% at Board level. IAG’s 
proportion of women in senior executive roles is currently 
34%. 

An increase in the proportion of women across the Group 
is associated with the recruitment drives in roles with a 
traditionally more balanced gender mix e.g. cabin crew. 

Age 
diversity

% of staff in 
each age 
band

The ‘on the ground’ managerial population 
includes all airport, corporate and 
maintenance roles equivalent to a 
manager across the Group.

The ‘in the air’ managerial population 
includes all pilot and cabin crew roles 
equivalent to captains and cabin 
service managers.

Employee turnover for <30 year old was 31% (2,951); 10% 
for 30-50 year old (3,022); and 7% for >50 year old (1,427).

Overall, the Group has seen a decrease in the proportion 
of employees aged between 30-50 years old. This is linked 
to significant growth in the <30 years age joining the 
group (+19%).

Workforce 
turnover

% voluntary 
and 
non-
voluntary 
turnover

Measured as the number of leavers as a 
percentage of the average number of 
Group employees in the year. The number 
of leavers excludes temporary contracts 
and death in service. Voluntary turnover 
occurs when employees choose to leave 
(e.g. resignation, retirement, voluntary 
redundancy) and non-voluntary turnover 
occurs when employees leave for reasons 
other than a personal decision (e.g. 
compulsory redundancy, dismissal). 

The overall annual turnover in 2022 was 9% – a total of 
5,930 employees, of which 916 were non-voluntary leavers. 
This compares to 6% in 2021, a total of 5,054 of which 685 
were non-voluntary leavers.

This increased turnover reflects more normalised turnover 
levels and the dynamic talent market in key hubs.

B.3. Equity, Diversity 
and Inclusion
Diversity is one of IAG’s core strengths, 
with colleagues joining us from across 
the world, and working in around 80 
countries. IAG continues to champion 
and make positive progress relating  
to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) 
initiatives and practices. A robust 
integrated framework for EDI guides  
our journey towards a diverse and 
inclusive culture and workforce.

In 2022, we reset our ambition of 40  
per cent women in senior leadership 
roles by 2025 and we have made  
strong progress in our first year with  
a 1 percentage point increase to 34 
percent. Our Group-wide plans go 
beyond gender. We are reviewing how 
we manage declarations in our core 
countries of operation, reflecting the 
cultural and regulatory environment, 
with an aim to use data and insights to 
set progressive targets and action plans.

The IAG Diversity Panel, created in  
2021, sees representatives across all 
operating companies sharing best 
practice and leading on the co-design 
and implementation of new EDI 
initiatives. In 2022, the panel welcomed 
internal and external guest speakers on 
specialist subjects such as gender 
diversity in aviation and reverse 
mentoring. Members of the panel have 
joined Women in Hospitality and Leisure 
(WiHTL) Committees, including 
specialist areas such as Race & Ethnicity 
and Disability. 

To support and underpin actions  
and initiatives across the group, work 
has taken place to review IAG’s key 
employment policies, ensuring they  
are inclusive and fair for all. 

Achievements in 2022
• IAG has increased the number of women 

in senior executive roles to  
34 per cent, a 1-percentage point 
increase on last year. 

• IAG’s new Equity, Diversity and Inclusion 
policy was approved by the IAG Board 
of Directors in July 2022. 

• Launch of the ‘Peppy’ menopause 
support App across IAG head office, 
British Airways and IAG Loyalty, 
recognising the impact of the 
menopause at work and offering  
24/7 advice, support, and information to 
those impacted both directly and 
indirectly.

• Having achieved the Bronze Investors in 
Diversity Award from the Irish Centre for 
Diversity, Aer Lingus now targets the 
Silver Award, with significant 
improvements to parental leave policies 
implemented in 2022 and a continuation 
in support for Dublin’s Pride Parade.

• British Airways achieved 40% women in 
senior leadership roles for the first time. 
The airline also successfully undertook a 
9-month pilot for reverse mentoring with 
colleagues from racially and ethnically 
diverse backgrounds and members of 
the British Airways Management 
Committee. In 2023, this programme will 
be rolled out to all senior managers 
across British Airways. 

• IAG Cargo invested in mental health first 
aid training for 59 colleagues across the 
company, supporting a culture of 
support and inclusion. In recognition of 
the global nature of the Cargo business, 
Rosetta Stone Language Learning 
launched and was made available to all 
colleagues. 

• IAG GBS have launched the first 
Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion policy 
for the company.

• IAG Loyalty placed EDI at the centre 
of its new values this year, stating ‘We 
take belonging seriously’. Bringing this 
to life included forming a colleague 
‘squad’ focused on  
the topic, the launch of a women’s 
development programme in 
partnership with Amazing If and an 
organisation-wide EDI survey. 

• Iberia have incorporated EDI into  
their values, transforming the previous 
value of ‘We are one’ into ‘We are one 
and diverse’. In 2022, the company 
also created and launched a network 
of diversity ambassadors who will be 
supported as champions and role 
models. 

• In Iberia Express the management 
committee reached 50 per cent 
female representation for the first time 
and there was a substantial 
improvement in female representation 
in First Officer pilot roles, moving from 
9 to 11 per cent

• Vueling finalised its D&I strategy  
and action plan. The company also 
celebrated achieving a 50% female 
management committee and a 
positive 44% of female colleagues 
working in team leader positions.

B.4. Health, safety and 
well-being 
Overview

IAG is committed to safeguarding the 
health and safety of our employees, 
customers and all others related to our 
activities. This means operating in a 
healthy, safe and secure way in compliance 
with all applicable laws, regulations, 
Company policies and industry standards. 
Health and safety are fundamental to 
our business, whether in the air or on 
the ground. 

IAG has robust governance processes in 
place led by the safety committees in each 
operating company. 

The IAG SECR Committee has oversight of 
all matters related to the operational safety 
and corporate responsibility of IAG’s 
airlines as well as to the systems and 
resources dedicated to safety activities 
across the Group.

IAG’s customers travel on aircraft and 
through buildings and environments 
that are subject to regulations applicable 
to health and safety in each country. 
Procedures, systems and technology used 
in our operations are designed to protect 
employees and customers alike.

Focus areas

As IAG continues to recover and grow 
in 2022, health and safety has remained 
a priority area for the Group. While Lost 
Time Injury (LTI) frequency rates have 
increased this year to 3.0 incidences per 
200,000 hours worked, this is still 
relatively low compared to pre-2019 levels, 
and reflects the increase in hours worked 
by front-line operational teams compared 
to 2021. 

To support and prioritise employees’ 
health and safety, our operating 
companies continue to provide employees 
with access to occupational health services 
and rehabilitation services. For example, 
British Airways has relaunched its Early 
Active Rehabilitation programme to assist 
employees back to work to help keep 
LTI severity rates low whilst providing 
employees the necessary support to get 
back to work. British Airways will also be 
commencing a project in 2023 to replace 
its current Occupational Health software to 
provide employees and managers with a 
better platform for colleague referral. IAG 
Cargo has trained 59 accredited Mental 
Health First Aiders as part of a new vision, 
mission and values launch across the 
business.

Most of our operating companies have 
supplemented government and 
healthcare-provided influenza vaccinations 
with their own programmes. Given the low 
levels of influenza since COVID-19 this 
initiative is seen as key to keeping our 
employees healthy and protected and 
maintaining productivity in the Group. For 
example, Iberia has continued its ‘Elige 
Cuidarte’ (‘Choose to take care of 
yourself’) programme with an objective to 
vaccinate all employees against the flu and 
providing workers with suggestions of 
health lifestyle habits. 

B.5. Human rights and 
modern slavery
IAG had no known cases of human rights 
violations across the Group during 2022, 
the same as in 2021.

IAG is taking steps to prevent incidences 
of modern slavery within the Group and 
across its supply chains.

The IAG Group Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Statement outlines these 
actions and is available on the IAG website. 
This statement is made under section 54, 
part 5 of the 2015 UK Modern Slavery Act 
(MSA). In terms of policies associated with 
human rights, IAG asks suppliers to comply 
with the Supplier Code of Conduct, which 
expressly prohibits the use of child labour 
and any form of slave, bonded, forced, 
involuntary prison labour, human 
trafficking or exploitation. Modern slavery 
clauses feature in all new supplier 
contracts as well as contract renewals.

IAG remains committed to taking swift and 
robust action if any evidence relating to 
slavery or human trafficking in our 
business supply chain is identified.

IAG is taking steps to prevent human 
trafficking. Human trafficking is of 
particular concern to IAG and to the wider 
aviation industry, as the Group transports 
millions of passengers every year and has 
tens of thousands of suppliers across the 
world. Operating airlines work closely 
with governments and the airports in 
which they operate to ensure that any 
suspected trafficking on our flights is 
identified, reported and dealt with 
appropriately. IAG also supports the 2018 
IATA resolution denouncing human 
trafficking and reaffirming a commitment 
to tackle this issue.

Operating airlines also train staff to 
recognise and respond to the signs of 
potential human trafficking situations and 
provide procedures for reporting where 
any cases are suspected. This training is 
managed at airline level. In 2022, over 
24,000 employees have completed 
training covering human rights topics, 
compared to 27,000 employees in 2021.

C.1. Sustainability strategy 
IAG’s vision is to be the world’s leading 
airline group on sustainability. 

That means using its scale, influence and 
track record to not only transform the 
business but drive the system-wide 
changes required to create a truly 
sustainable aviation industry. IAG is 
committed to delivering best practices in 
sustainability programmes, processes and 
impacts, while executing Group strategy. 

IAG aligns its environmental strategy with 
the three overall strategic priorities of the 
business described in the Strategy section.

C. Principles of 
sustainability governance

Material issues 
IAG orientates its sustainability strategy 
around material issues: those which are 
most important to key stakeholders and 
which have the biggest external impacts. 

To identify these issues over a three-year 
timeframe and to 2030, IAG repeated a 
materiality assessment in 2021 which was 
facilitated by an independent third party. 
External stakeholders included investors, 
corporate customers, policy makers, trade 
associations, fuel suppliers, airports, and 
NGOs. Internal stakeholders included IAG 
Board members, all IAG Management 
Committee members, and operating 
company sustainability representatives.

The results inform ongoing disclosures and 
strategy.

Tackling climate change was identified as 
the most material issue in the long-term. In 
the short-term, as the business recovers 
from the COVID-19 pandemic, profitability 
and customer and employee engagement 
and well-being remain high priorities. IAG 
will consider use of a double materiality 
assessment when it next repeats this 
analysis, which is expected to be 2024.

IAG does not have specific risk provisions, 
targets or guarantees related to non-
material issues such as water consumption, 
biodiversity, raw materials consumption or 
light pollution. More information on water 
and biodiversity is available in the 
Additional Disclosures section of the NFIS.

Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which 
assesses almost 15,000 companies globally 
on climate action. CDP awarded IAG a 
prestigious A-List award in 2022, placing 
the Group in the top 3 per cent of 
respondents worldwide. 

For the past two years, IAG has also  
been the highest ranked airline in the 
global Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) 
ratings, which assess 600 companies 
across 47 countries on their readiness for 
the low-carbon transition. 

IAG is in the top 10 per cent of airlines 
assessed by Sustainalytics, which  
gives ESG risk ratings to around  
15,000 companies worldwide based  
on public disclosures. 

IAG continues to engage with other 
relevant ESG rating agencies to enable 
more accurate calculations of IAG’s  
scores and to identify actions to improve 
these scores.

Jet Zero 
Consultation

A consultation on 
our strategy for 
net zero aviation

Jet Zero 
Strategy
Delivering net zero 
aviation by 2050 

July 2022

Governance spotlight: Jet Zero Council

Overview

In 2021, the UK Government 
created a new initiative 
called the Jet Zero Council 
(JZC), to provide advice on 
the Government’s ambitions 
to deliver net zero aviation 
and zero-emission flights. 

IAG support

IAG staff chaired two 
subgroups – a COP26 Group 
and the SAF Delivery Group 
– and the British Airways 
CEO is a member. 

In 2022 the work of the JZC 
supported the launch of an 
ambitious ‘Jet Zero Strategy’ 
for UK aviation.

Next steps

The Government also 
committed to reviewing the 
strategy every five years, and 
adapting its approach based 
on the progress made.

The JZC model has been so 
successful that it is being 
replicated in other countries.

Scope

The JZC is a partnership 
between industry and 
Government to bring 
together ministers and 
CEO-level stakeholders, with 
regular meetings and 
subgroups to drive the 
ambitious delivery of new 
technologies and innovation 
to cut aviation emissions.

C.2. Governance frameworks 
Relevant standards: GRI 102-46/-48
Overview
IAG has robust governance in place to ensure joined-up and progressive decisions on sustainability. 

This also helps to ensure that wider stakeholder engagement is consistent with material issues and environmental priorities and goals. 
An annual meeting planner for the Board ensures sustainability governance processes fit within the reporting and disclosure framework 
of the Group.

The Group’s unique structure means that each individual operating company has a distinct sustainability programme. These are 
regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with the Group sustainability strategy and principles, which covers material issues, KPIs and 
engagement plans. 

Relevant forums and levels of responsibility are indicated below. Information flows between groups is covered in Sections C.6., on the 
second page of the Risk Management and Principal Risk factors section, and in the Corporate Governance section.

Wider governance
Wider governance processes integrate sustainability aspects. As part of the Group-wide ERM process, sustainable aviation and people, 
culture and employee relations risks are presented bi-annually to the Audit and Compliance Committee and annually to the Board. 
One-year financial plans and three-year business plans are coordinated by Group Finance and include sustainability aspects.

In 2022, Group Sustainability representatives also attended the away days of other teams to support the embedding of sustainability.

C.3. Workforce governance 
Relevant standards: GRI 403-4, 408-1, 
409-1.
IAG aims to create an environment in 
which employees feel motivated, safe and 
able to thrive as this is central to the 
continued success of the Group. 

Working policies and rights at work
Core principles in the IAG Code of 
Conduct include fair and equal treatment, 
non-discrimination, fairness and respect for 
human rights. This Code applies to all 
directors, managers and employees of the 
Group and e-learning training to support it 
is mandatory and applicable to all 
employees and directors. In addition to the 
Code of Conduct, individual operating 
companies have responsibility for policies 
and procedures relating to their 
employees, including appropriate reward 
frameworks to ensure they can continue to 
attract and retain the best talent for every 
role. 

IAG has employees based in European 
countries which comply with the 
conventions of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), covering subjects that 
are considered as fundamental principles 
and rights at work: freedom of association 
and the effective recognition of the right 
to collective bargaining; the elimination of 
all forms of forced or compulsory labour; 
the effective abolition of child labour; and 
the elimination of discrimination in respect 
of employment and occupation. Outside 
the EU, IAG recognises trade unions in 
many jurisdictions, has collective 
agreements and meets/exceeds all 
relevant labour standards.

Collective bargaining arrangements are in 
place for 89 per cent of our workforce. In 
addition, IAG has a European Works 
Council (EWC) which brings together 
representatives from the different 
European Economic Area (EEA) countries 
in which the Group operates. EWC 
representatives are informed about and, 
where appropriate, consulted on 
transnational matters which may impact 
employees in two or more EEA countries. 
IAG completed the election and 
appointment process for the new Select 
Committee and Chair in early 2022, and 
the transition was completed in May this 
year.

Training and development 
Within the Group, individual operating 
companies have responsibility for the 
policies and procedures relating to their 
employees to ensure they can continue to 
attract and retain the best talent for every 
role.

Measures to support employee satisfaction 
and talent management are primarily 
managed within operating companies and 
each operating company has its own 
established methods of measuring 
employee satisfaction. In addition, IAG has 
introduced an organisational health survey, 
initially focused on management 
populations across all operating companies 
to benchmark management practices 
against a globally recognised metric. This 
survey was run initially in November 2020 
and repeated every six months since. 
Insights from the survey are used to shape 
and prioritise cultural development plans. 

Individual operating companies are 
responsible for learning, development and 
talent within their business, to enable them 
to ensure they have the right skills and 
capabilities required to support their 
strategy. In May, IAG completed a detailed 
review of succession planning and talent 
for all critical and senior roles which has 
been used to shape the Group’s talent and 
leadership development priorities and 
plans. Due to the diverse nature of Group 
businesses, both in terms of jurisdictions 
and operations, all training policies 
and programmes are implemented at 
operating company level. Each is 
responsible for determining the specific 
courses offered within their organisation, 
the frequency with which training courses 
must be completed, and the employees 
required to attend. However, across the 
Group, all operating companies are 
required to run the following mandatory 
corporate training courses for their 
employees:

• Code of Conduct
• Compliance with Competition Laws
• Anti-bribery and Corruption Compliance
• Data Privacy, Security and Protection

Diversity
At IAG, we believe diversity is key to 
innovation and to the future growth and 
success of our business. IAG is proud of 
the diversity of its workforce, with 
colleagues having joined from across the 
world, working in 77 countries, speaking 
dozens of languages and representing 
every element of the communities we live 
and operate in. It is this richness of 
backgrounds, of experiences, of cultures 
and ideas that makes our business tick.

We want our workforce to reflect the full 
diversity of the communities we live and 
work in. We want everyone to see role 
models they can identify with and to have 
the same chance of progression and 
development, and we want everyone who 
works for IAG to feel that their unique 
difference is recognised and valued. This 
means a focus on equity, diversity and 
inclusion. This allows us to be a place 
where everyone’s talents are recognised, 
where skills and capabilities grow, and 
where future leaders are nurtured and 
developed. 

IAG has recently published a revised 
Group-wide Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Policy to address and eliminate 
discrimination and promote equality of 
opportunity regardless of age, gender, 
disability, ethnicity, religion or sexual 
orientation. 

At Group level, IAG also has a Directors’ 
Selection and Diversity Policy that sets out 
the principles that govern the selection 
process and the approach to diversity on 
the Board of Directors and the IAG 
Management Committee. These policies 
have been approved by the Board of 
Directors.

See Section B.3. for more diversity 
initiatives.

C.4. Supply chain 
governance 
Relevant standards: GRI 308-2, GRI 414-2. 
Overview

IAG Global Business Services (IAG GBS) 
continues to engage with, support and 
monitor suppliers to ensure all products 
and services provided to IAG are on a path 
to net zero by 2050.

The IAG GBS Group Procurement team 
leads the Supply Chain Sustainability 
Programme by delivering in four key areas:

• The Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC)
• Independent risk screening and 

sustainability assessments
• Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 

Audits
• Embedding sustainability as standard in 

the procurement process

From insight to action in 2022
The SCoC has been issued to the existing 
supply chain and integrated into the new 
supplier onboarding process. New 
suppliers are requested to acknowledge 
their commitment to achieving net zero 
emissions by 2050, and the need for a 
roadmap, supported by deliverable plans, 
to achieve this target. 

IAG GBS is also partnering with EcoVadis, 
a market-leading provider of business 
sustainability ratings, to assess suppliers 
using a holistic environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) scorecard. 

This gives IAG and its suppliers a baseline 
for improvements across ESG issues, and 
suppliers can share them with customers 
and other stakeholders, which benefits 
wider industry sustainability. 

As a minimum, IAG requires its suppliers to 
provide a safe and healthy environment for 
their workforce. Supplier selection 
considers potential industry and 
geographical risk and, where necessary, 
on-site audits are carried out. These audits 
are performed by independent inspectors 
with CSR expertise using the SEDEX 
Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) 
methodology. In 2022, 32 of these audits 
were completed. 

All suppliers also undergo annual screening 
for any legal, social, environmental and 
financial risks. The Group Procurement and 
Compliance teams assess any suppliers 
identified as having potentially higher 
levels of risk and implement mitigation 
plans where necessary. Any issues are 
flagged to the risk owners within the 
Group to jointly take appropriate action.

In 2022, IAG GBS embedded sustainability 
aspects into the day-to-day operation of 
the organisation and included sustainability 
targets in the performance objectives of all 
IAG GBS employees. 

IAG GBS has verified the existing, active 
supplier base and IAG’s airlines’ interline 
relationships in Russia and Belarus in order 
to determine the potential implications of, 
and actions to be taken, due to the trade 
sanctions issued as a response to the war 
in Ukraine. Follow-up and support have 
been provided to IAG’s operating 
companies with regard to mitigation 
actions taken in response to the findings 
(e.g. payment stop/blockage) in 
coordination with the relevant Compliance 
Teams.

Building a sustainable future in 2023 

IAG GBS plans to assess the sustainability 
performance of suppliers representing at 
least 80 per cent of IAG’s total spend, and 
include sustainability aspects in the 
category planning process and additional 
measures into the selection and contract 
award process.

C.5. Ethics and integrity 
governance 
Relevant standards: GRI 102-16/-17,  
205-1/-2/-3
Overview
All directors and employees are expected 
to act with integrity and in accordance 
with the laws of the countries in which 
they operate. 

IAG’s Group Code of Conduct (CoC), last 
revised in 2019 and approved by the 
Board, sets out the general guidelines that 
govern the conduct of all directors and 
employees of the Group when performing 
their duties in their business and 
professional relationships. Mandatory CoC 
training and communications activities are 
carried out for directors, employees and 
third parties on a regular basis to maintain 
awareness and understanding of the 
principles that govern the conduct of the 
Group. This policy is available on the IAG 
website.

In 2022, a new Group-wide Whistleblowing 
Policy was issued and all the Group 
channels consolidated to one 
whistleblowing channel provided by an 
independent third-party provider, 
EthicsPoint, where concerns can be raised 
on an anonymous and confidential basis. 

This channel is available to members of 
staff as well as suppliers, with information 
on how to access it published in the CoC 
and SCoC. If any employee has a concern 
about unethical behaviour or 
organisational integrity, they are 
encouraged to first speak with their 
manager or a member of the Legal, 
Compliance or Human Resource teams. 
Similarly, suppliers are encouraged to 
contact their primary contact within the 
business.

IAG will not tolerate any retaliation against 
individuals using the whistleblowing 
channel or contributing to investigations 
arising from reports to the whistleblowing 
channel. 

Whistleblowing reports received for each 
Operating Company are triaged by the 
Compliance teams to direct to the most 
appropriate area for investigation, 
maintaining independence in this 
investigation process. 

The IAG Audit and Compliance Committee 
reviews the effectiveness of the 
whistleblowing channel on an annual basis. 
This annual review considers the volume of 
reports by category; timeliness of follow-
up; process and responsibility for follow-
up; emerging themes and lessons; and any 
issues raised of significance to the financial 
statements or reputation of the Group or 
other areas of compliance.

In 2022, whistleblowing reports concerned 
issues relating to employment matters (64 
per cent), dishonest behaviour/reputation 
(29 per cent), health and safety (6 per 
cent) and regulatory matters (1 per cent). 
All reports were followed up and 
investigated where appropriate, and no 
material concerns were identified. 

Anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering
IAG and its operating companies do not 
tolerate any form of bribery or corruption. 
This is made clear in the Group CoC and 
supporting policies which are available to 
all directors and employees. An anti-
bribery policy statement is also set out in 
the SCoC.

In 2022, a Group-wide anti-bribery and 
corruption policy was issued. This sets out 
the minimum standards that are expected 
by the Group, its directors and employees, 
including definitions and guidance for 
bribery, gifts and hospitality guidance, 
political and charitable donations, public 
officials, facilitation payments amongst 
others. 

Each Group operating company has a 
Compliance Department responsible for 
managing the anti-bribery programme in 
their business. The compliance teams from 
across the Group meet regularly through 
Working Groups and Steering Groups, 
under the IAG General Counsel. They 

conduct an annual review of bribery risks 
at operating company and Group level. 

The main risks identified for 2022 were 
unchanged from the previous year and 
relate to the use of third parties, 
operational and commercial decisions 
involving government agencies, and the 
inappropriate use of gifts and hospitality. 
No material compliance breaches were 
identified in 2022, as in 2021.

Anti-bribery and corruption training is 
mandatory for all relevant personnel in IAG 
operating companies, Group functions and 
the Board. Individual training requirements 
are set by each operating company and 
function and are determined by factors 
such as the level and responsibilities of an 
employee. 

Revised Group-wide anti-bribery e-learning 
was rolled out in 2019 and is required to be 
completed every three years. 

To identify, manage and mitigate potential 
bribery and corruption risks, IAG uses 
risk-based third-party due diligence which 
includes screenings, external reports, 
interviews and site visits depending on the 
level of risk that a third party presents. Any 
risks identified during the due diligence 
process are analysed and a mitigation plan 
put in place as necessary. Certain risks 
could result in termination of the proposed 
or existing relationship with the 
counterparty. The IAG Audit and 
Compliance Committee receives an annual 
update on the anti-bribery compliance 
programme.

There were no legal cases regarding 
corruption brought against the Group and 
its operating companies in 2022, as in 2021, 
and management is not aware of any 
impending cases or underlying issues.

IAG has processes and procedures in place 
across the Group, such as supplier vetting 
and management, Know Your 
Counterparty procedures and financial 
policies and controls, which help to 
combat money laundering in the business.

C.6. ESG risk management 
Relevant standards: GRI 102-11/-15.

Overview
Sustainable aviation risks and People, 
culture and employee relations risks are 
reported as principal risks to IAG.

These risks are considered and assessed 
under the Group ERM framework which is 
presented bi-annually to the Audit and 
Compliance Committee and annually to 
the SECR Committee and Board. More 
details on this framework, risk identification 
and assessment, and risk management can 
be found in the Risk management and 
principal risks factors section. 

All principal risks are linked to the Group 
strategic priorities which includes 
environmental sustainability.

Sustainability risks and opportunities, 
including climate-related risks and 
opportunities, are also identified and 
assessed by the Group Sustainability team, 
in conjunction with the Group ERM team, 
and presented to the IAG CPCASO, IAG 
MC and SECR Committee. Plans to 
mitigate risks are developed by relevant 
risk owners in specific areas of the 
business, with agreed initiatives included in 
relevant operating company business 
plans.

People, culture and employee relations 
risks are managed by the Group’s 
operating companies with guidance from 
the Group as appropriate.

Impact on operations and strategy
Sustainability risk assessments have 
informed specific decisions related to 
business operations and strategy, and IAG 
allocates significant resources to 
environmental risk management. Examples 
include:

• In 2018, TCFD-aligned scenario analysis 
identified a need for more ambitious 
action on climate change, which 
contributed to the 2019 decision to 
design and adopt the industry-leading 
Flightpath Net Zero strategy to deliver 
net zero emissions by 2050.

• In 2021, IAG set a new net zero target by 
2050 for Scope 3 emissions and IAG 
GBS appointed EcoVadis to help to 
track supplier sustainability performance 
and mitigate supply chain-related 
sustainability risks.

• In 2022, IAG expanded its commitment 
to invest in SAF development, 
production and supply, from 
US$400 million to the equivalent of 
US$865 million based on assumed 
energy prices, to manage climate policy 
risks and take advantage of energy-
related opportunities.

IAG is committed to mitigating the impacts 
of hazards which, if they occur, have 
uncertain but potentially negative 
outcomes on the environment or people. 

As such, IAG adopts precautionary 
measures to mitigate these hazards, an 
approach known as the precautionary 
principle. For example, the precautionary 
principle is applied to the planning of 
operations and the development and 
launch of new services, by integrating 
climate considerations into three-year 
business plans and one-year financial 
forecasts and aligning activities with the 
Flightpath Net Zero strategy.

IAG also manages risks via the use of 
ISO-14001-aligned environmental 
management systems and is planning for 
all material environmental impacts across 
100 per cent of flight operations and 
corporate activities to be covered by the 
IATA Environmental Management System 
(IEnvA) by the end of 2023. 

IEnvA is the airline industry version of ISO 
14001, the international standard for 
environmental management systems. 
IEnvA is tailored specifically for airlines and 
is fully compatible with the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO). 

Vueling achieved full IEnvA certification in 
2022 and British Airways and Aer Lingus 
have achieved partial (Stage 1) 
accreditation.

In terms of the amount of provisions and 
warranties for environmental risks, IAG 
does not take out any specific insurance to 
cover environmental risks.

C.7.1. Reporting and data 
governance 
The full contents of this sustainability 
report are included in the IAG Non-
Financial and Sustainability Information 
Statement (NFIS), which is third-party 
independently verified to limited assurance 
standards in line with ISAE3000 (Revised)1 
standards. Compliance with specific 
frameworks and standards is listed under 
relevant section headings.

IAG complies with current and emerging 
standards on sustainability reporting. 

These include obligations under EU 
Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial 
reporting and its transposition in the UK 
and Spain, the 2018 UK Streamlined 
Energy and Carbon Reporting regulation, 
the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852).

IAG does not align with GRI Core or GRI 
Comprehensive options but instead aligns 
with selected GRI standards based on 
compliance with Spanish Law 11/2018. In 
cases where GRI alignment was not 
possible, other standards aligned to airline 
industry guidance or internal frameworks 
were used and described.

Emissions data from intra-European flights 
is also independently verified within six 
months of the year end, for compliance 
with the UK and EU ETS, and for all flights 
for the UN CORSIA scheme. Any material 
changes to key metrics are highlighted in 
future Annual Reports.

IAG also goes beyond compliance 
requirements and voluntarily aligns 
sustainability reporting with the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB), the IATA Airlines Reporting 
Handbook, GRI Standards for material 
issues, and relevant criteria from external 
ESG rating agencies. IAG supported IATA 
and the GRI to develop the IATA 
handbook. 

The scope of environment performance 
data in this report includes all IAG airlines, 
subsidiaries and cargo operations over 
which IAG has operational control. This is 
also the scope of the net zero targets. 
Some exceptions for non-material business 
units have been applied for specific 
metrics, and these are clearly stated with 
rationale provided.

The scope of workforce and ethics and 
integrity data includes all IAG operating 
companies and support functions. Some 
exceptions have been applied and these 
are clearly stated with rationale provided.

The scope of human rights and modern 
slavery reporting is as above and includes 
data from all suppliers in the IAG supply 
chain.

For any specific cases where full-year data 
was not available for selected metrics, 
estimates have been applied based on 
business forecasts and data from prior 
months. Internal governance is in place to 
ensure that any estimations made are 
robust. Any prior-year restatements are 
indicated next to relevant metrics with 
reasons provided.

1 ISAE3000 is the assurance standard for compliance, sustainability and outsourcing audits, issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).
