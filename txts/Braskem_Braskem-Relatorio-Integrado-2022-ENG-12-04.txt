Message from the business leader

Expanding leadership in renewable raw materials

We are pioneers and global leaders in the production of plastics made 
from renewable sources. We currently have the capacity to produce 
200,000 tons per year of green ethylene, a chemical product made 
from sugarcane ethanol, which is the raw material to produce poly-
ethylene under the I’m green™ brand. At the time, the investment was 
a bet to combat climate change in the chemical and plastic industry, 
whose success is currently perceived by the growing demand from 
our customers for this product line.

At Braskem, we understand sustainable development as the 
way to transform our way of doing business. Thus, since our 
creation, we have sought to mitigate negative impacts and 
enhance the positive ones through innovative and sustainable 
chemical and plastic solutions to improve people’s lives.

In 2022, we significantly advanced in this journey from the re-
vision of our corporate strategy, consolidating as our strategic 
pillars sustainability and innovation – both fundamental to en-
able the projects and initiatives related to our growth avenues: 
the ambition to expand, in a sustainable manner, the renewable, 
recycled, and traditional petrochemicals businesses. 

Our growth avenues are linked to the 
commitments we made in 2020, which 

aim to address society’s global con-
cerns in the long term. Among them, 
we have defined the elimination of 
plastic waste, the fight against cli-

mate change, and social respon-
sibility, including the promotion 

of human rights, as central 
themes for our actions.

GRI 2-22

This early move put us in the lead in 
the production of polymers made from 
renewable raw materials and allowed us 
to acquire increased knowledge of the 
operation. Thus, last year we reached 95% 
utilization of green ethylene production 
capacity and commercialized about 
179,000 tons of I’m green™ polyethylene.

3 Integrated Report 2022



By 2030, we are committed to expanding our bioproduct production ca-
pacity to 1 million tons. We achieved important advances in this front 
during the year: we progressed with the expansion of the current green 
ethylene production unit to 260,000 tons, which is expected to be 
concluded in 2023, and we launched a joint venture with Sojitz for the 
production and commercialization of monoethylene glycol and mono-
propylene glycol made from renewable raw materials. Called Sustainea, 
the joint venture is the result of many years of research and develop-
ment in this technological journey.

Closing the loop of our products

We are betting on an increasingly circular business model that can rein-
sert our products into the value chain and avoid the inadequate disposal 
of plastic waste. To this end, we challenge ourselves to expand to 1 mil-
lion tons the commercialization of resins and chemicals with recycled 
content, as well as to recover 1.5 million tons of plastic waste by 2030.

Thus, in 2022 we launched a new circularity ecosystem, Wenew, in order 
to consolidate and strengthen all our action fronts, such as circular 
products (resins and chemicals), environmental education and proper 
disposal initiatives, technologies, and circular design. The implemented 
actions already show important results: we reached 40 grades of resins 
with recycled content in our portfolio and 42 grades under develop-
ment. In addition, we sold 54 thousand tons of resins and other products 
with circular characteristic and recovered 33.5 thousand tons in plastic 
waste through investments and partnerships in new businesses, socio-
environmental programs, and industry alliances. 

To boost the performance in this theme, we move forward with new in-
vestments to develop the plastic chain and leverage recycling. Thus, in 
february 2023, we completed the process of acquiring shares and sub-
scribing to new shares issued by Wise Plásticos S.A., a company in the 
mechanical recycling sector focused on polypropylene (PP) resins. We 
also announced the creation of a joint venture with ER Plastics, a dutch 
company, which uses an innovative technology that converts low-quality 
plastic waste into final products. In the United States, we acquired a mi-
nority stake in Nexus Circular, a chemical recycling company.

Growth with a focus on climate change

We are committed to reaching 2030 with an absolute 15% reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from our production processes and 
from energy purchases, and to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. 
Thus, anchored in the corporate strategy, our actions aim to achieve 
these commitments.

To guide the way toward the commitments made, we performed an 
analysis of potential projects based on the development of a Marginal 
Abatement Cost Curve (MAC Curve) for GHG emissions. The result was 
the mapping of more than one hundred projects, among energy effi-
ciency initiatives, renewable energy procurement, carbon capture and 
conversion, and expansion of the renewable raw materials base. The 
projects mapped by the curve have the potential to reduce up to 3.4 mil-
lion tons of CO₂e.

The mapped projects were prioritized and are being managed within the 
industrial decarbonization program, responsible for implementing cul-
tural change, governance, and processes in the operations environment, 
as well as investment projects for the reduction of emissions. 

Among them are the partnerships for the acquisition of renewable elec-
tricity globally. In Brazil, we contracted more than 220 average mega-
watts of renewable energy based on wind and solar with an average 
duration of 20 years, which represents approximately 40% of the volume 
of energy consumed by Braskem in the country. The agreements began 
to be signed in 2018, with the largest one coming in 2022, and allowing to 
avoid the emission of 3.3 million GHG tons during the course of the con-
tracts. The volume of energy contracted would be enough to meet the 
residential consumption of a city of 2.8 million inhabitants. In the United 
States and Europe we also had important advances in renewable energy.

We are also joining with partners to introduce technologies that accel-
erate the energy transition of our petrochemical complexes. Thus, we 
have advanced in an important partnership with Coolbrook, which aims 
to plan a pilot project for the electrification of crackers, allowing us, in 
the future, to use electricity supplied by renewable sources in one of the 
main links of our operation.

In 2022, we 
increased  
sales of  
products  
with recycled 
content  
by 144%.

5 Integrated Report 2022

Values that drive us

People are the basis of our operating strategy. 
Therefore, we believe that it is only possible to advance 
in our commitments for sustainable development 
by ensuring people's safety, ethical conduct, and the 
rights of all those who are part of our value chain. 

To guide our path in this direction, we base ourselves 
on the assessment of the human rights risks to which 
our operations and value chain are exposed, a process 
that helps us achieve our commitment of managing 
100% of the risks related to this topic by 2030. This 
past year we conducted this analysis for the second 
time and, as a result, we identified that 96% of the 
potential risks already have medium or high manage-
ment by Braskem (for example, for the issues related 
to the image of plastic). For the points not yet cov-
ered, we are elaborating new action plans. 

With regard to people, it is important to highlight 
our continuous support to families affected by the 
geological event in some neighborhoods of the city 
of Maceió (Alagoas-AL) in 2018. Throughout 2022, 
we maintained our work established in the Socio-
environmental Agreement, signed on December 30, 
2020, with the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, to 
repair, mitigate or compensate potential environ-
mental and socio-urban impacts arising from rock 
salt extraction activities.

We also continue to evolve in our operations with the 
human reliability journey, which aims to reduce expo-
sure to human error that can create an environment 
prone to accidents. We conducted 1,200 trainings ses-
sions on this theme globally, including employees and 
service providers. At the end of the year, we reached a 
rate of 0.85 accidents with and without lost time per 
million hours worked, a result aligned with the year 2021. 

Also, this year, we carried out the first editions of cen-
suses: one for self-identification of race and ethnicity 
and another for self-declaration of people with dis-
abilities. This is an important initiative, because this 
assessment allows evolving towards a more effective 
diversity strategy, equity, and inclusion. In terms of 
gender diversity, we achieved record participation of 
women in leadership, with 33% in 2022 compared to 
31% the previous year.  

Discipline and value creation

These actions were accompanied by the company’s 
operational and financial performance that re-
mained solid throughout the year through its robust 
financial strategy, with consistent operational cash 
generation, financial health, and discipline in capital 
allocation. In 2022, the result was impacted by the 
drop in petrochemical spreads in the international 
market and the lower sales volume due to the lower 
demand because of the macroeconomic scenario. 

Thus, we closed the year with a recurring EBITDA of US$2.1 billion, 64% 
lower than in 2021. Recurring cash generation was R$6 billion, with an 
18% return on cash flow. Additionally, the corporate leverage, in dollars, 
was 2.42x. It is worth mentioning that the risk rating agencies S&P and 
Fitch reaffirmed Braskem’s investment grade by maintaining the rating 
at BBB-, with a stable outlook. These results reinforce our commitment 
to efficient capital allocation and return to shareholders. 

It is worth mentioning that during the year we invested US$149 mil-
lion in projects aligned with Braskem’s long term commitments for 
sustainable development. Among the main projects are the expan-
sion of green ethylene capacity, CO₂e emission reduction and energy 
efficiency initiatives at the plants, and the construction of the high-
quality post-consumer resin recycling line in Brazil.

Strength and resilience

Our business strategy seeks to balance investment decisions and cap-
ital allocation with a focus on sustainability, ensuring shareholder re-
turn during the petrochemical cycles. The year 2023 will be challenging, 
but Braskem is prepared, and the defined strategy will guide the com-
pany to focus and prioritize its initiatives, generating positive impacts 
for all stakeholders.

GRI 2-22

Dear reader,

For Braskem, taking a long-term strategic view means 
achieving a balance between material issues for business, 
for people and for the planet. We understand that our ac-
tions must be based on principles for sustainable develop-
ment to create value for all our stakeholders, now and in 
the future.

Over the years, we have been building and aligning our 
strategy to the challenges, trends, and new global demands. 
Thus, understanding the risks, paying attention to market 
opportunities and society’s expectations, since 2021 we 
have focused our activities on themes that are relevant for 
Braskem and the petrochemical industry: the elimination 
of plastic waste, the fight against climate change, and so-
cial responsibility and human rights.

To ensure that the decision-making process in the com-
pany considers these and other commitments made 
for 2025, 2030, and 2050, we rely on a solid governance 
structure in which the Board of Directors actively par-
ticipates in discussions and decisions about the evolu-
tion of our long-term vision.

In 2022, we contributed with another crucial step for 
Braskem’s journey and for sustainable development: 
we approved the update of the corporate strategy that 
now highlights sustainability and innovation as strategic 
pillars; we positioned the renewable, recycled and tradi-
tional businesses, provided they contribute to the reduc-
tion of greenhouse gas emissions, as avenues for business 
growth; and we reinforced safety, people and governance 
as our foundations. 

This step consolidates what had already been happening 
in the last two years: attention to market opportunities 
to accelerate the achievement and capture value with 
the commitments made. In 2022, we approved the new 
corporate structures, such as the spin-off of Voqen, an 
energy trading company; the joint venture Sustainea, 
producer of bioMEG and bioMPG; the joint venture with 
ER Plastics to enter the circular applications market; and 
the acquisition of an equity stake in Wise, a company in 
the recycling sector. We also approved the launching of 
Oxygea that, with initial investment of 150 million dol-
lars, aims at fomenting start-ups and ventures to reach 
Braskem’s long term commitments.

Solid foundations

The strategic focus on growth combined with sustainability requires solid 
foundations and the reinforcement of the core values of our business. 
Integrity, ethics, and transparency must prevail in all strategic decisions, 
actions of executives, leaders, members, and in all relationships. 

In this sense, we recognize Braskem’s exemplary work in the continuous 
strengthening of the compliance system that, in 2022, obtained two 
major achievements: the maintenance of the ISO 37001 certification 
and the best historical score in the evaluation of the Ethos Institute 
since we implemented the Compliance System (9.9 out of an average 
of 7.4 in our sector). 

The recognition extends to a close look at human rights. This year, we 
reinforced our corporate risk matrix with the results of the updated 
human rights due diligence, which analyzed the potential risks of vio-
lation in our value chain. In this process we identified that most of the 
risks mapped, such as, for example, the image of plastic and socioeco-
nomic issues, are already being treated and monitored by Braskem.

People’s safety is a non-negotiable part of our ethical and responsible 
performance. In this aspect, the Board of Directors continues to closely 
follow the company’s decisions in relation to the communities affected 
by the geological event in Maceió. The programs dedicated to the safe 
and fair relocation of families, as well as the region’s socio-urban re-
mediation plan are progressing as expected, with the full dedication of 
more than 1,400 people and in alignment with the authorities. 

Sustainable growth

Over the years, Braskem has evolved its commitments in a manner in-
tegrated to the corporate strategy, acting in an increasingly sustain-
able manner, and focused on preserving and generating value to the 
planet, to society and to our shareholders. 

Even in a challenging global environment, Braskem reinforced its commit-
ment to its financial health and presented solid results throughout 2022, 
with recurring cash generation of R$6.0 billion, corporate leverage of 2.42x, 
and maintenance of its investment grade rating by Fitch and S&P.

We have a sharp vision for 2030. Focused on the perpetuity of the 
business, we will seek a balance between capital allocation, share-
holder return during the petrochemical cycles, while investing in the 
business and in new opportunities, generating a positive impact for 
all stakeholders.

GRI content summary

In 2022, we took another crucial step towards defining the company’s growth 
focus for the coming years, within a strategy that integrates our commit-
ments to sustainable development and maintaining our competitiveness. 

Throughout the year, we conducted a review and consolidation exercise 
of our corporate strategy, which is anchored on its strategic pillars and 
foundations, with a focus on creating value through balanced capital al-
location, returning value to shareholders over the cycle, while we invest 
in our growth avenues, impacting positively all stakeholders. 

Strategic pillars

Our strategic pillars reinforce the ambitions we have for the long term, 
considering the demands and opportunities in the traditional business, 
as well as ensuring that we look at the topic of sustainability in our in-
vestment decisions. Hence, our corporate strategy contemplates the 
following pillars:

Productivity and competitiveness: move towards the 1st quartile of 
the global cost curve of the petrochemical industry, focusing on de-
carbonization initiatives and high value-added investments.

Sustainability: to be a reference in the chemicals and plastics sector 
in sustainable development globally.

Growth and diversification: to increase diversification into bio-based 
and circular raw materials and products.

Innovation: deliver sustainable high value-added solutions through 
innovation in chemistry and plastics.

Value creation strategy Foundations

The foundations of our strategy reflect 
the values that we consistently prac-
tice and that are key to ensuring the 
achievement of our ambitions across 
the different pillars and growth avenues. 
They are:

Safety: safe operations as a perma-
nent and non-negotiable value.

People: a human-centered company 
that promotes diversity, inclusion, 
and human right.

Governance: governance and compli-
ance in line with market best practices.

Growth avenues

Traditional business

We will selectively invest to grow our 
current business seeking for produc-
tivity, and competitiveness improve-
ments, and continue to implement 
the decarbonization of our existing 
assets. These measures together will 
enable the delivery of our commit-
ment to reduce scope 1 and 2 emis-
sions by 15% by 2030 and achieve 
carbon neutrality by 2050.

Bio-based

Our strategy seeks to grow in bio-
based resins and chemicals, as well 
as increase the use of renewable 
raw materials, to meet our com-
mitment of expanding bioproducts 
capacity to 1 million tons by 2030. 
We intend to accelerate the de-
livery of this commitment through 
the creation of strategic and finan-
cial partnerships.

Recycling

We aim to grow in circular products 
(mechanical recycling) and expand 
the use of circular raw materials 
(chemical recycling), with a com-
mitment to reach 1 million tons sold 
of resins and chemicals with recy-
cled content by 2030. Also, we are 
working to prevent 1.5 million tons of 
plastic waste from being sent to in-
cineration, landfill, or dumped in the 
environment by 2030.

Intelius: global performance management

The purpose of Intelius, Braskem's global manage-
ment system, is to unify and simplify the way we 
translate strategy into results, and it was devel-
oped based on the ISO 45001, ISO 14000, RC 14001, 
and ISO 9000 standards, in addition to regulations 
of other standards applicable to the petrochemical 
industry (such as ABNT rules, API, and Programa 
Atuação Responsável® [Responsible Action Program]).

Also in 2022, we established a governance cycle for 
Intelius that considers a cohesive and consistent docu-
mentation structure, implementation of requirements 
based on gap analysis and action plan, audits for the veri-
fication of compliance of the requirements implemented, 
and the review, to ensure effectiveness of the manage-
ment system and adequacy to the company's strategies.

Continuous improvement
Intelius, which is composed of five pillars - Health, 
Safety and Environment (HSE), Quality, Industrial 
Effectiveness, Performance Management, and 
Continuous Improvement & Sharing of Best 
Practices – is applied mainly to the company’s in-
dustrial activities, and the implementation of its 
requirements leads to the identification and pre-
vention of impacts on workers’ safety and health, 
the environment, process safety, asset reliability, 
and the quality of our products, seeking to promote 
continuous process improvement.

The system is subject to an annual internal audit 
for the identification and repair of potential non-
conformities in relation to its guiding principles. In 
2022, 100% of the industrial units were audited, as 
well as the corporate processes related to certifica-
tions, such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, for example. 
More than 3,000 requirement compliance checks 
were performed, distributed among all units, totaling 
more than 650 audit hours, globally.

The materiality matrix is a fundamental tool for building our long-term 
commitments for sustainable development. Based on the most recent 
guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), in 2022, we updated our 
materiality matrix to identify the issues that are most relevant to our busi-
ness, considering environmental, social, economic and governance dimen-
sions. This update involved consulting with more than 1,200 internal and 
external stakeholders(1), including team members, leaders, customers, sup-
pliers and the financial market, as well as face-to-face interviews with 78 
leaders, benchmarking peer companies and analyzing key  corporate risks 
and opportunities for the sector(2).

The study resulted in more than 500 topics which, after analysis and  
cross-checking of data and perceptions raised during the qualitative and  
quantitative consultations, defined the 21 most relevant issues for Braskem. 
These issues were aggregated into two different groups, which guided the type 
of strategic action to be taken: the value protection group (16) and the value 
creation group (5). 

Braskem materiality matrix

Materiality matrix 
GRI 2-29, GRI 3-1, GRI 3-2

Value protection: issues whose impact management can protect 
Braskem’s tangible and intangible value over time, which preserve 
and strengthen the corporate image and mitigate business risks. 

Value creation: issues whose impact management can create  
tangible and intangible value for Braskem over time, which gen-
erate competitive advantage through business opportunities and  
strategic partnerships.

After reviewing the materiality matrix, we identified that most 
topics already have strategic ambitions or are part of the company's 
operational management. The new themes identified are being 
evaluated to define the level of action.

Sustainable Development 
Commitments
Approved by the board of directors in 2020, the sustainable development 
commitments were built based on our materiality matrix, had the par-
ticipation of our team members, leaders and executives, and also con-
sidering the analysis of global scenarios and trends, corporate risks and 
external references in sustainability. They encompass the dimensions of 
sustainable development (economic, social and environmental) and are 
aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with pri-
ority given to the topics where our biggest impacts were identified. This 
strategy consists of seven dimensions and sets Braskem’s second cycle

on four fronts that encompass all the challenges of the industry: 

These fronts seek to achieve our commitments of increasing to 300,000 tons 
per year the sale of products with recycled content by 2025 and 1 million tons 
by 2030, as well as preventing 1.5 million tons of plastic waste from being

Combating climate change

Climate change is a global challenge, and its impacts are felt in all dimensions of sustainable development. 
Thus, we wish to be global leaders in the chemical industry, with the best indicators in terms of GHG emis-
sions and a key player in carbon capture through the production of materials with renewable raw materials, 
based on three fronts:

Emission 
reduction

Reduction in the 
emissions of CO2e 
with focus on energy 
efficiency and increased 
use of renewable energy.

Carbon removal with 
stock in product

Accelerate the growth of company 
business in chemical products and 
polymers made from renewable 
raw materials that remove CO2e 
from the atmosphere.

Carbon to chemical 
conversion

Investment in technologies 
for carbon capture to store 
and use it as a raw material 
for the production of 
chemical products.

Thus, our purpose is to increase to 85% the total renewable electricity purchased for consumption in our 
industrial units, as well as to expand the production capacity of bioproducts to 1 million tons.

Part of the fight against climate change also encompasses business adaptation to extreme weather events. To 
mitigate the risks related to water scarcity, we have the commitment of increasing the water safety index of our 
operations to 100%, by means of water consumption efficiency and substitution of capture for safe sources.

We seek an absolute reduction of greenhouse gases emission, scopes 1 and 2, 
of 15% by 2030 (in relation to the average emissions for the years 2018, 2019 
and 2020), reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.

Social responsibility 
and human rights 

Progress in sustainable development also implies a just society, with opportunities for all and aligned with 
human rights. Therefore, our ambition is to be recognized as a company that promotes human rights and 
equity in our operations and supply chain, and that also contributes towards the local development of sur-
rounding communities. For that reason, we work on three fronts:

In 2022, we completed our second cycle of due diligence in human rights, a process 
that will help us achieve the commitment of managing 100% of human rights 
risks (high and medium) by 2030, in addition to supporting the achievement of 
commitments such as increasing the number of people benefited in communities 
to 500,000 people, increasing the percentage of women in leadership in Brazil to 
45% and the percentage of black team members to 35%, in the same period.

the key initiatives and projects 
that helped us achieve these

Governance in sustainability

To guarantee that short-term objectives are aligned with the long-
term objectives, Braskem relies on a governance structure that en-
sures the follow-up of the strategy's progress by executives through 
the Global Sustainability Committee. The Committee meets monthly, 
is divided into working groups for each dimension of the strategy, and 
for each of them an executive is designated as the responsible person. 
The matters discussed in this forum are submitted to the CECESG, an 
advisory committee to the Board of Directors for sustainability mat-
ters, according to the relevance of the agenda.

In furtherance of the commitments made, assigning roles and re-
sponsibilities to all professionals, since 2021 environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) aspects have been included in the corporate 
goals, which are assigned, according to positions and responsibilities, 
from the business leader to the base of the hierarchy. In 2022, the 
ESG targets attributed to the business leader represented 33% of the 
total targets established, against 30% in 2021.

Advisory Board

Since 2022, we have had a Sustainable Development Advisory Board formed by external 
and independent members. Its mission is to bring an unbiased and specialized perspective 
to decision-making related to the fulfillment of the company’s commitments on health, 
safety, climate change, plastic waste elimination, social responsibility and other themes of 
the strategy for 2025, 2030 and 2050. 

The board focused discussion on four themes: the sustainability strategy and long-term 
vision; the overall goals and ways to achieve them; advice on project portfolio and in-
novation; and know-how on sustainability trends and how to incorporate them into the 
company’s strategies.

Governance structure

Ordinary General Meeting (OGM)

A forum for the deliberation of shareholders, the Ordinary General Meeting (OGM) takes 
place every year after the end of the fiscal year to consider matters provided for in the 
Corporations Act, such as the directors’ accounts and financial statements; allocation 
of net profit from the fiscal year and distribution of dividends; election of the members 
of the BoD, if applicable, and of the Supervisory Board; and the overall remuneration 
of the directors and members of the company’s Supervisory Board. Extraordinary 
General Meetings (EGMs) may also be held whenever the corporate interest requires 
them, to deliberate on other matters under the purview of the shareholders.

The chairman of the Board of Directors does not exercise an executive role at Braskem.

Board of Directors (BoD)

Our corporate strategy and ambitions for sustainable development are 
guided by the constant evolution of our corporate governance and com-
pliance initiatives in accordance with best market practices.

Our Board of Directors (BoD) is the highest governance body, and its 
powers include to resolve on the company's Business Plan and on the 
objectives related to compliance and the environmental, social, and 
governance aspects (ESG), to analyze Braskem's initiatives linked to 
the ESG criteria and to encourage the adoption and constant update 
in relation to the best market practices applicable to its sector of ac-
tivity, to resolve on the Succession Plan of the Officers Appointed by 
the Bylaws and to set their duties, in addition to approving operational 
or expansion investments, as provided in its Internal Regulations and in 
Braskem's Bylaws.

In order to provide a complete overview of Braskem's governance 
system, all new members of the BoD participate in the Integration 
Program conducted by the Corporate Governance area, with presen-
tations on the culture, people, business environment, and Braskem's 
Compliance and Governance Systems. In addition, since 2018 the BoD, 
its advisory committees and secretariat are subject to an annual eval-
uation process organized by external advisors. GRI 2-12, GRI 2-17

Since 2021, the BoD has periodically evaluated the trends and evolu-
tion of the practices adopted by Braskem. During 2022, 25 meetings in 
all were held, including ordinary and extraordinary meetings, the main 
topics discussed being the monitoring of risk assessment, the discus-
sion, approval and launch of investments and projects in line with the 
2030 and 2050 sustainability commitments. As well as the BoD, our gov-
ernance structure is composed of the General Meeting, the Statutory 
Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and the advisory committees to 
the Board of Directors. GRI 2-12, GRI 2-14

Our Compliance area has among its main roles ensuring a constant evo-
lution of the maturity of internal controls, risk management, internal 
audit and compliance. To that end, we have a Chief Compliance Officer 
(CCO), who reports directly to the Board of Directors, via the Statutory 
Compliance and Audit Committee (CCAE), and indirectly to the CEO. In 
addition, we work based on our Global Compliance System Policy,  which 
addresses the guidelines and responsibilities of our team members, in 
addition to establishing instances of governance for their compliance. 
The goal of double reporting provides for autonomy, while at the same 
time, maintaining the connection with the business leader.

Braskem’s Compliance System consists of 10 integrated Risk Prevention, 
Detection and Remediation measures. The commitment of Braskem 
team members, especially leaders, to the implementation and practice 
of these measures is fundamental to the effectiveness and efficiency of 
the system. GRI 205, GRI 206, GRI 406, GRI 415, GRI 419 

Additionally, below the CCO, there are five structures 
that act in relation to the continuous improvement of 
our processes and risk management, with a team com-
posed of more than 80 people worldwide:

1. Internal Controls: advises the company on the evalu-
ation and design of processes and controls with a focus 
on minimizing risks, promoting the accuracy of ac-
counting records and adherence of processes to guiding 
documentation (internal normative documents), busi-
ness rules and laws and regulations in force. 

2. Risk Management and Business Continuity: supports 
the leaders of the business areas in the assessment, pri-
oritization, treatment and reporting of corporate risks.

3. Privacy and Data Protection: guides and organizes 
data protection through ethical solutions, in accor-
dance with global legislation such as the General Data 
Protection Law. 

4. Compliance: helps disseminate company values and 
promotes ethical, honest and transparent conduct. In 
addition to the codes of conduct, it provides training on 
topics such as ethics and anti-corruption. 

5. Internal Audit: this is an objective and independent 
assessment and consulting activity, designed to add 
value and improve Braskem's operations.

In 2022, we issued 25 reports referring to the review 
of various company processes, where we identified 
128 opportunities for improvement, generating more 
than 200 action plans for the business areas, with 
the aim of improving our governance and the internal 
controls environment.

We have also carried out the 2022 Global

confirming the commitment to continuous 
evolution of the system.

Commitment to compliance 

Our efforts to be a company recognized for integrity, ethics and transpar-
ency also earned us two major achievements in 2022: the maintenance 
and extension of the ISO 37001 certification and the best ever historical 
rating in the Ethos Institute’s assessment since we implemented the 
Compliance System. This result positions us as a benchmark in compli-
ance and above the overall industry average across all evaluated criteria.

In addition, besides being a signatory of the Private Sector’s Commitment 
to the Integrity of the Supply Chain, promoted by the International 
Chamber of Commerce (ICC), we maintain our engagement in com-
batting corruption by participating in the UN Global Compact’s  
Anti-Corruption Platform, in addition to promoting campaigns, internally 
and externally, on the subject(1).

Compliance Ambassador Program

In 2022, we began the Compliance Ambassador Program in Brazil, an initiative that aims to 
improve communication between all areas on the issues related to compliance within the 
company. In this first year, 12 team members from all of the vice presidents’ departments 
participated in a series of training events to become the contact point between the vice presidents 
and the Compliance area, disseminating the culture and correct use of compliance tools.

Ethical conduct
The Code of Conduct guides to our commitment to ethical, responsible 
and transparent management. With a global scope, it defines the values, 
principles and practices that guide the company’s performance, in ac-
cordance with all applicable laws.  

We also provide the Ethics Line Channel, a resource, in various languages, 
for receiving reports about violations of the team members’ and Third 
Party’s Code of Conduct. Created in 2007, it allows anonymous contact 
for whistleblowers to report information and facts in order to maintain 
an ethical and respectful corporate environment at Braskem. 

All pieces of information are received and treated with absolute confi-
dentiality and 100% of the cases received by the Braskem Ethics Line 
Channel are handled and analyzed independently. Reports to the channel 
can be made anonymously and no retaliation against to complainants 
is allowed. The results and action plans arising from the investigations 
undertaken by the Ethics Line are carried out independently and impar-
tially, being monitored by the Ethics Committee and by the Statutory 
Compliance and Audit Committee. GRI 2-26

In 2022, the greater confidence of the team members in the Channel 
was evidenced by a record number of reports being received. The 
Channel is a powerful tool for improving the work environment - 844 
reports were received in this cycle, with 52.8% of the total being unsub-
stantiated cases, cases with insufficient data or outside of the scope of 
the Channel. Completed investigations may result in the following out-
comes: remediation plans that aim to monitor, communicate and train 
team members on topics related to the conduct expected by the com-
pany; apply disciplinary measures based on internal guidelines; improve 
or create processes, controls and guidance documentation; and finally, 
request clarification from partners. 

Respectful relationships 
GRI 3-3 406

Based on the Diversity diagnosis we did in 2021, discussions with the af-
finity networks(2) – race and ethnicity, gender and LGBTQIA+ – and the 
analysis of reports received by the Ethics Line Channel, we identified that 
there are still situations of disrespect, harassment and discrimination 
within our work environment, especially in the industrial areas. 

For that reason, we developed the "Respect is Non-negotiable" project, 
which seeks to inform and raise awareness among people about its 
role in building an increasingly healthy, welcoming and inclusive envi-
ronment. A pilot was held on November 21, 22 and 23 in Alagoas. There 
were eight training sessions which included the leaders of the admin-
istrative areas of the Chlorine-Soda and PVC/MVC units and dialog 
with the operators of the control rooms. We also trained the leaders 
and team members in relation to the case of Maceió. As to the next 
steps we will compile the lessons learnt and expand this initiative to 
the other regions.

33 Integrated Report 2022

 

The risk assessment process leverages 
opportunities and identifies poten-
tially negative impacts on the company, 
whether financial, strategic, operational 
or regulatory.

Braskem’s risk management methodology 
is based on international references (such 
as ISO 31000 and COSO - Enterprise Risk 
Management), and divides risks into four 
categories: strategic, operational, finan-
cial and regulatory. Risks are periodically 
evaluated by the company’s directors and 
submitted to a regional and then global 
consolidation process, and are considered 
according to the potential impact and prob-
ability of occurring. The result of the analysis 
is presented graphically on a heat map and 
approved by the board of directors.

With the analysis approved, the pri-
ority risks are then treated and moni-
tored, by the Board of Directors and its 
advisory committees, where relevant, in 
order to mitigate and prepare the com-
pany to face adverse issues. Following 
the assessment of the corporate risks of 
all Braskem operations in 2022, we now 
highlight some risks that are being dealt 
with and monitored:

Growing global concern for the environment, as well as inadequate disposal of post-consumer plastic waste, with the 
trend of banning single-use plastic by governments and lawmakers. Mitigations include the development of initiatives 
to make Braskem a benchmark in the development of the recycling supply chain and the promotion of conscious con-
sumption of plastic. Image  

of plastic

The greater concern on the part of the general population, with the growing search for government alignment with the 
goals of the Paris Agreement, through the implementation of public policies that encourage the reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions. Our mitigation include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the processes and in the purchase of 
low-carbon energy and e the compensation of emissions with investments in renewable raw materials.

Environmental, health, and safety impacts to which chemical and petrochemical operations are subject. The nature 
of our industry may involve risks to our workers and to the communities surrounding the industrial areas and the 
areas of transportation and loading/unloading of its products and raw materials, such as pipelines, roads, and ports. 
As a result, Braskem is subject to stringent labor, environmental, and other regulations. Mitigation encompasses a 
permanent mapping of scenarios of potential high risks and respective treatments through specific governance, as 
well as programs to improve the human reliability, and actions for mechanical integrity of the units.

A characteristic of the petrochemical industry, which historically alternates between periods of limited supply, which 
generates price and margin increases, followed by capacity expansions (of supply), which press prices and margins 
down until demand can absorb this product surplus and a new cycle begins. Mitigations for this risk include maintaining 
a conservative cash position above the minimum required by the company’s financial policy and maintaining the 
elongated debt profile.

Increased cyberattacks, which may result in the exposure of sensitive data, unscheduled operational stops, and 
unavailability of systems that affect the regular operation of the company with consequent damage to its image and 
reputation. Mitigations include network segregation and initiatives to increase control of the environment and assets, 
monitoring team member behavior and constant testing to identify if the environment is safe.

Instability of macroeconomic and political factors, caused by economic crises, wars and conflicts, including sanctions, 
that alter business dynamics and reduce/block the availability of products and inputs, as well as changes in policies 
related to fiscal incentives. Mitigations consists of periodic analysis of economic and geopolitical changes that may 
impact Braskem's economic activity, in addition to monitoring the regulatory environment and projecting macro 
sectoral variables, among others.

By means of the synergy with the human rights due diligence process, the risks identified have been integrated into the company's risk mana-
gement process, and are now systematically evaluated according to the corporate risk evaluation process. Risks associated with human rights 
cover the topics of plastic image and social and environmental issues specifically on social and labor aspects in the value chain, as well as diver-
sity, equity and inclusion, among others. Complete information may be found in Human Capital and Social and Relationship Capital.

Highlights from 2022

Human rights are the focus of our commitments 
to 2030. For that purpose, we conduct our business 
to respect them, promote them and, if necessary, 
remedy them in accordance with the United Nations 
(UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, the UNPGs. Our Global Policy on Sustainable 
Development, Codes of Conduct for members and 
third parties, as well as the proposed value to the 
member, the BeUx, reinforce Braskem's commitment 
to this issue.33%

All these principles guide us towards a responsible

point is the conduction of a due diligence in human 
rights, for the periodic identification of potential 
risks involving violation.

We aim to manage 
100% of high and 
medium human 
rights risks by 2030. 

Due dilligence on human rights

We started the first cycle of due diligence on human 
rights at Braskem in 2017, based on global references 
and considering our operations in Brazil. In 2022, 
mitigation actions in relation to the risks identified in 
this analysis achieved the 96% mark.

In 2021, we started a new due diligence on a global scale, 
conducted remotely because of the pandemic, with a 
continued focus on centering rights-holders in assess-
ments. With respect to this, interviews were conducted 
with neighboring communities, team members and 
leaders, third parties and external experts, in addition 
to the analysis of documents, public information and 
information published in the media, resulting in, during 
2022, the identification of risks and impacts on a global 
and local scale.

We analyzed the risks to human rights mapped in 
relation to existing corporate risks – identified in 
accordance with the process set out in the Risk 
Management chapter. As a result, action plans 
designated for corporate risks already met most 
treatment recommendations for human rights. For 
those not envisaged, we are developing new action 
plans that will be integrated into corporate risks later.

As a result of the process, opportunities for improve-
ments were found in: 

Relationship with communities: communities are 
relevant stakeholders for us because they are 
neighbors to our industrial operations, where there 
are risks. For this reason we have implemented a 
number of actions to prevent negative impacts. You 
can find information on our main actions in the Social 
and Relationship Capital chapter.

Value proposition to team member: BeUx 
GRI 3-3 202

We have consolidated our ambition to be recog-
nized as a people-oriented company that promotes 
local development and human rights through BeUx, 
which reflects our most fundamental cultural ele-
ments, through competencies that guide and are 
expected of our members, developed and assessed 
in 100% of the company.

The annual performance evaluation process is based 
on these elements and guides the corporate initiatives 
and the individual development of the professionals. 
All members – including the business leader – have 
an Action Program (PA) with corporate and individual 
targets and behavioral competencies, aligned with the 
company’s culture.

To evaluate the competencies dimension, in ad-
dition to the traditional leader-led evaluation, we 
adopted the network evaluation format, which is 
a broader feedback system that also considers the 
view of peers and other members and leaders. In 
2022, 100% of the members undergone this evalu-
ation. It is important to note that the entire career 
management and development is defined based on 
these evaluations, and that the variable remunera-
tion (Profit Sharing) results from a combination of 
factors evaluated in this process.  GRI 404-3 

Supply chain: labor issues, slave labor, low visibility of 
the processes, among others, are problems that can 
affect any part of the supply chain, across all indus-
tries. Therefore, we have adopted a series of proce-
dures for evaluating third parties, in order to mitigate 
potential risks. You can find more details in the Social 
and Relationship Capital chapter.

Disposal of plastic: the plastic supply chain is sub-
ject to issues related to its disposal and, for this, we 
take a series of measures to return waste to the ap-
propriate location, whether through the recovery of 
material or environmental education. You can find 
the main actions in the Natural Capital chapter.

Occupational health: Given the nature of our oper-
ations, team members are potentially subject to oc-
cupational health-related risks, as well as the most 
recent concern over mental health. The COVID-19 
pandemic has intensified our actions on these topics, 
with programs aimed at the integral health of people. 
More details on this topic can be found later in  
this chapter.

Diversity, equity and inclusion: we operate in an 
ecosystem with different nations and cultures, each 
with their own complexities related to diversity, eq-
uity and inclusion. As a way to adapt to the chal-
lenges, we have implemented the Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion Program, which will be covered later in 
this chapter.

People’s safety is a non-negotiable value for us and we want all our team 
members to feel well and healthy in their working day at Braskem. As 
pointed out by the due diligence process in human rights, our industry 
is naturally subject to occupational health risks, intensified by the new 
work dynamics imposed by the pandemic.

For this reason, we take a number of measures to promote the safety, 
health and well-being of people. Regarding safety, we operate based on 
the Human Reliability Program and work closely with third parties. We 
also adopted measures regarding the safety of processes logistics and 
products. Regarding health and well-being, we implemented the Integral 
Health Program and continuous improvement in occupational hygiene, 
as well as programs aimed at the well-being of team members, the re-
sults of which were reflected in the Pulse Survey.
 
Human Reliability Program

Since 2018, we have consistently followed our human reliability journey – 
which is essential to achieving our 2030 health and safety goals. The pro-
gram aims to reduce the tendency for errors and losses in operations and 
maximize production and operational efficiency, relying upon integration 
between people and technology in processes.

In 2022, we conducted Human Reliability training for non-leaders in 
Mexico and the United States, and this process was started in Brazil, 
with more than 1,200 people taking part in the training, including team 
members and contractors, in all four countries, totaling more than 2,500 
people trained in the subject since 2019.

Technology at the service of safety 

Technology plays a key role in maintaining and ensuring the 
safety of all our professionals. Therefore, we started a digital ap-
proach to our health and safety projects with a focus on four 
main pillars of action:

Accident rate with and without lost time 
(1MM/HHT)
GRI 403-9

Braskem's global rate of accidents with and without leave (CAF + SAF) 
in 2022 was 0.85 per million of hours worked, which corresponds to 
a decrease by 1% in relation to the 2021 rate. The reduction over the 
years occurred due to the increasing activities of the Human Reliability 
Program, which, since 2019, trains and guides members and third par-
ties on this issue, as well as to the closer management of contractors 
with regard to HSE requirements. Other factors, such as the sharing of 
experiences and the disclosure of the safety rules, have also contrib-
uted to an improvement in the occupational accident rate.

For 2030, our 
commitment is 
to reduce the 
accident rate,
with and 
without lost 
time, to  
0.5 accidents 
per one million 
hours worked. 

Reduce human risk  
exposure with task 
elimination and automation.

Identify and prevent 
hazardous situations 
based on information and 
predictive maintenance.  

Improve skills and knowledge 
through training opportunities 
to build experience.

Adherence to procedures 
and processes with access, 
efficiency and application.

Process safety

One of our goals in the health and safety dimension 
is to reduce the frequency of process accidents. To 
this end, during 2022 we focused on studies for the 
identification, analysis and mitigation of process 
risks that may affect the population surrounding 
Braskem industrial facilities or the environment. 

The frequency rate of Tier 1 and Tier 2 process ac-
cidents was 0.43 (events per 1 million hours-man 
worked), 34% higher than the 2021 result, but the 
second lowest recorded by the company historically. 
In Tier 1 the rate was 0.08 in 2022, which corresponds 
to a 14% increase in relation to the previous year. 

The Tier 2 rate, on the other hand, was 0.35, com-
pared to a rate of 0.21 in the previous year, which rep-
resents an increase of 67%, and corresponds to the 
second best result of the last five years (2018-2022).

The focuses on process safety were:

Near Miss: improvement in the process for registering events and in 
the critical analysis process in the units.

Mechanical Integrity: management of assets to ensure that important 
pieces of equipment are always suitable for the application for which they 
were designed, throughout their useful life, in their specific operation. 
The program integrates the corporate areas of industrial reliability 
and efficiency, prioritizing units and other areas based on the need to 
improve process safety.

Risk Analysis: efforts to minimize the most significant risks of indus-
trial units by conducting in-depth risk mapping studies and engineering 
studies and with investments focused on mitigating identified risks.

Occupational diseases 
GRI 403-10

In 2022, we had five reportable occupational diseases in Brazil, of which 
three are linked to hearing loss. In this matter there was an expressive 
reduction, by 91% in relation to 2021, because in that year many inves-
tigations of previous years were concluded.

We are continuously working to improve the occupational risk manage-
ment. In this respect, we have developed a procedure with HSE directives 
for the construction of new projects or ventures. We also actively par-
ticipate in the development of legal rules related to the efficiency of in-
dividual protection equipment for noise and for carcinogenic chemicals.

Tier 1: Incident with loss of product containment above the limits established by the 
American Petroleum Institute (API) 754 for TIER 1 according to the released product 
or any release that causes: death of or injury to an employee or third party, hospital 
harm to or death of the external population, financial loss greater than US$100,000, or 
community evacuation.

Tier 2: Incident with loss of product containment above the limits established by the 
American Petroleum Institute (API) 754 for TIER 2 according to the released product or any 
release that causes: accident without leave of an employee or third party and financial loss 
greater than US$2.5 thousand.

Integral health

Two out of the five events of occupational disease relate to mental and be-
havioral disorders. Over the past five years, this indicator has shown us the re-
currence of such cases, and during the pandemic, structured actions for the 
promotion of a healthy work environment have become necessary.

Since then, we have worked to provide members with care and activities aimed 
at people's integral health. Thus, in 2022, Braskem began the development of a 
Global Program of Integral Health and Well-Being  - which initiative is divided 
into four pillars of like importance: physical, emotional/mental, social/family, 
and occupational health. The focus of this program is to encourage an increas-
ingly humanized and welcoming work environment, raising health levels and es-
tablishing a culture of well-being for our members. The program was structured 
in four phases:

In 2021, we developed the Mental Health Program for lead-
ership, in partnership with the Albert Einstein Hospital 
Research Institute, to provide training in topics related to 
mental health care. In 2022, we continued the program, to-
taling 26 groups, and 466 participants, impacting on 60% 
of Braskem leaders in all the regions in which we operate.

Another highlight is the Caring for People Program, cre-
ated during the COVID-19 pandemic to welcome our team 
members and promote an increasingly humanized and 
collaborative work environment, based on the four pillars: 
mental well-being, social well-being, support for new ways 
of working and professional improvement. In 2022, the 
program produced 11 livestreams and a video, totaling 5,171 
participants. And to extend the reach of mental health ac-
tions, we offered four livestreams on Saturdays for teams 
that work on a shift basis.

In the United States, the wellness team worked to raise 
awareness, on four core themes among team members: 
healthy eating, blood pressure, depression, and diabetes. 
In Mexico, the team reinforced physical and emotional 
health issues through the “Sentirte Bien” Program, fo-
cusing actions on stress and resilience. In Europe, the team 
launched Breakfast Talks with the Leadership and made 
the Gympass available in Germany, encouraging and pro-
moting physical health.

1. Overview: interviews with Braskem’s main leaders and focus groups 
in Brazil, Mexico, Europe and the United States with representatives 
from the areas of Human Resources and Health and Safety. Workshops 
were carried out with the participation of representatives from other 
areas of the company, mainly from the Industrial area, to align expec-
tations and analyze the Maturity Index.  

2. Assessment: mapping of regional initiatives and structures devoted 
to health and well-being, in addition to administering a health and 
lifestyle questionnaire with the goal of standardizing global diagnosis 
(Health Risk Assessment).

3. Strategy: planned for Q2 2023, the evaluation of Phase 2 results to 
define the actions that will be implemented.

4. Implementation: the last phase will take place between 2023 and 2025.

Pulse Survey

With the intention of evaluating the results of our ac-
tions and work practices, we created the Pulse Survey in 
2020. The survey is conducted twice a year and measures 
the perception of our team members regarding their ex-
perience at Braskem, well-being and engagement, also 
supports for the preparation of new action plans. Key in-
sights from 2022 include a sense of pride in belonging of 
our team members and the recognition that flexibility is 
a key factor for balance and well-being when adapting to 
new ways of working.

Highlights from 2022

Providing a diverse, inclusive and equitable environment for everyone 
is a priority for us. According to the conclusions of due diligence in 
human rights, multiculturalism is present in our daily lives, which pres-
ents even more challenges to actions in diversity, equity and inclusion 
(DE&I). Therefore, we have set commitments for 2030 within the di-
mension of social responsibility and human rights, in accordance with 
the particularities of DE&I in the regions in which we operate. 

Diversity, equity and inclusion

(1) Leadership positions include: coordinators, managers, directosr, vice-pres-

idents and business leader. To see the percentage of women for each hierar-

chical level, visit https://www.braskem.com.br/ESGdashboard.

(2) Only considers team members in Brazil and in the United States.

We have implemented several DE&I actions that, in 2022 were rein-
forced by the establishment of a global corporate guideline, whose goal 
is to set global commitments in DE&I and direct our actions in all the 
regions where we operate. 

One of our efforts to make progress in this area is to increase the rep-
resentation of minority groups. Within the pillar of race and ethnicity 
in 2022, globally we went from 30% black team members to 33%. We 
achieved this result through various initiatives such as: more inclusive 
selection processes, implementation of goals, reservation of some 
vacancies, awareness raising for leaders and team members, and a 
census of race and ethnicity, among others.

For 2030, our commitment is to increase 
the share of women leaders globally 
to 40% and black team members in 
Brazil and United States to 37%.

Highlights from 2022

Partnerships that merit special emphasis 

Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index

In the United States, Braskem maintains several 
partnerships that promote issues related 
to DE&I. Among them, we highlight: 

Women in Manufacturing: we are corporate members 
of the organization, which is the only national and global 
trade association devoted to providing year-round 
support to women in the manufacturing industry.

Out and Equal: we are partners with the 
leading organization devoted exclusively 
to LGBTQIA+ workplace equality.

Conselho DEI SPE: we are members of the Society of 
Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
(DEI) Advisory Council. The goal of the body is to emphasize 
the importance of these issues and create resources for 
professional development, guidance and recruitment 
to be used by the teams of member companies. 

Leadership training in
diversity, equity and inclusion

Continuing with the training of the most senior 
leaders in relation to DE&I initiatives in Brazil, we im-
plemented individual mentoring sessions with vice 
presidents and the CEO. We also held as training for 
everyone in the Board responsible for people and 
organizational culture. Over the course of the year, 
more than 4,700 people participated in livestreams, 
training sessions and workshops on diversity, equity 
and inclusion issues.

Inclusion of people with disabilities

In 2022, we opened up new opportunities including 
vacancies reserved for people with disabilities. We 
carried out a survey of the accessibility of our offices. 
We created health care and people management 
protocols and raised awareness on the topic among 
leaders. We conducted a census to map team mem-
bers who self-declare as having a disability, and an-
alyzed their needs. The census was carried out at the 
offices in Brazil and had a 75% participation, equiv-
alent to 1,079 members, with 12 people classified as 
having a disability after individual analysis of possible 
cases and medical evaluations.

Undergraduate internship

In the University Internship Program, we have es-
tablished goals for hiring black and ethnic minorities  
(45%), women (50%), and people with disabilities 
(5%). To make the process even more inclusive, 
English is no longer mandatory for most positions. 
In addition, when assessing resumes, we do not look 
at information such as age, educational institution 
and previous experience. The logical reasoning test 
was replaced by a decision-making journey.

In 2022, we launched the 
Black Journey with the goal 
of developing behavioral 
skills and providing other 
content to accelerate the 
inclusion of black people in 
the labor market; with this 
initiative, we reached more 
than 1,600 people in Brazil. 

In addition to the initiatives mentioned before, we 
also had some other advances such as our associa-
tion with the Women Lead Movement of the Brazil 
Network of the Global Pact; membership of the 
Women’s Movement 360, becoming a signatory to 
the Open Letter of Support for LGBTQIA+ People, 
the creation of a diverse hiring area and reserved 
vacancies for minority groups; accessibility surveys 
and improvement in the processes for the inclu-
sion of people with disabilities in the offices and the 
governance of affinity networks.

In 2023, Braskem is on the Bloomberg  
Gender-Equality Index for the third consecutive 
year. The index lists publicly traded companies 
that commit to an inclusive work environment  
and offer a work-life balance.



People are the foundation of our business. For this reason we con-
stantly strive to strengthen our relationship with all stakeholders. They 
help form the solid foundation that maintains the longevity of our busi-
ness. Not only is this part of who we are, it also integrates with our sus-
tainability pillar through our commitment to social responsibility and 
human rights.

Protecting communities 
We strive to act as agents of transformation within society and strengthen 
our relationship with the communities surrounding our operations. We 
believe it is our duty to contribute to the development of regions where 
we operate, generating shared value and well-being for all and promoting 
human rights in all of our relationships. 

The results of the human rights due diligence reinforce the work we have 
implemented over time with the communities that live in close prox-
imity to our operations and which potentially could be negatively im-
pacted. Therefore, we seek to strengthen the relationship and sustain our  
social license to operate through focusing on the promotion of actions 
that generate local development, respecting the specific characteris-
tics of each region and establishing trusting relationships through dialog  
and transparency.

By 2030, we

General 
total R$33,306,603.76 610,189 153

Based on the global social responsibility strategy, we invest in social and 
environmental impact projects in all locations where we operate. This 
is accomplished through donations, sponsorship, ISP, and the Global 
Volunteer Program, which primarily address three long-term causes: 
education, circular economy, and local entrepreneurship and innova-
tion. In addition, we also invest in projects according to the character-
istics of each location.

In 2022, we carried out 153 social actions that benefited more than 
610,000 people globally, including ISPs, donations, emergency cam-
paigns, and volunteering. More than R$33 million were invested.

In 2022, we concluded the community engage-
ment review in Bahia, completed the project in 
Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo (ABC), and Alagoas, and 
started building the framework in Rio Grande 
do Sul and Mexico. Our community engagement 
methodology seeks to establish an integrated 
and strategic vision of the relationship actions 
with the communities in each of the regions 
where we operate, by means of the identification 
of potential impacts, whether positive and nega-
tive, associated with our operations and the char-
acteristics of each community. 

Impacts assessed in the community 
engagement framework:

Environmental Impacts, identified by the 
Environmental, Health and Safety Guide-
lines for Petroleum-based Polymers Manu-
facturing of IFC.

Social and economic Impacts, identified by 
the GRI, Community aspect.

Impacts related to the guarantee of human 
rights, identified by Braskem's human rights 
due diligence.

This framework analyzes impacts on three levels: 
environmental, social and economic, and human 
rights. In addition, the evaluation criteria con-
template the impact responsibility, perception 
of the impact by the community, and materiality 
of the potential impact.

Social dialogue

We keep an open dialogue with all the commu-
nities located in the vicinity of our operations, 
through participation in the Advisory Community 
Councils (CCC)(1), the communication channels 
directly related to the industrial units, and the 
Ethics Line, as well as through associations of 
companies of the petrochemical centers where 
we operate.

We also keep open, in Brazil, the Program 
Formando Laços [Forming Ties], which focuses 
on receiving in our industrial units visitors from 
schools, universities, customers, suppliers, the 
community, and governmental and non-gov-
ernmental institutions, the press, among others, 
to know our processes and facilities. In 2022, 
in-person visits were resumed, and we received 
more than 1,580 people from the communities 
throughout the year.
  

Datafolha Survey

In 2022, we conducted a survey in Brazil with the 
support of the Datafolha Institute. The purpose 
thereof was to bring important information on the 
communities in the vicinity of Braskem's opera-
tions, such as profile, characteristics, habits, and 
perceptions, especially in relation to Braskem's 
image and on important issues to format the com-
pany's social actions in the regional offices.

This enabled us to check the degree of knowledge of 
the communities in relation to the petrochemical 
centers, as well as to identify the strengths and vul-
nerabilities of the industry and of the company, which 
will help us to delimit actions involving relationship, 
communication, and investment in social projects. 

(1) Committee organized by companies that are part of 
the petrochemical centers in which Braskem has oper-
ations. Other companies of the territory and represen-
tatives of the communities participate in this forum.

Support to the communities
Our actions with the communities have global reach and involve all locations where we operate or nearby regions 
affected by our business. They involve not only donations, but also volunteer work, educational programs, and 
initiatives aimed at protecting the environment.

In Brazil, we announced the first edition of a public bid – Projetos que Transformam [Projects that Transform] – to 
select and support social projects devoted to the local and sustainable development of the communities where 
we operate. The bid notice selected 17 initiatives that received, in the aggregate, R$1 million, and their representa-
tives attended four free virtual training sessions relating to project management and accountability aspects.

Corais de Maré

The Corais de Maré project promotes resto-
ration of the All Saints Bay (Baía de Todos-
os-Santos) reef. For that purpose, a new 
technique was developed using plastic and 
other recyclable materials to enhance the 
growth of the species Millepora alcicornis in 
seedbeds built using the skeleton of the sun 
coral, which is a species considered inva-
sive in the region. The technology is tested 
since 2022, on the sea bottom of Maré Island 
(Ilha de Maré), with the participation of re-
searchers, environmentalists, and fishermen.

The initiative seeks to recover part of the 
reefs of the All Saints Bay, the quantity of 
corals of which was reduced by about 50% 
since 2003, according to a survey conducted 
by UFBA researchers. These ecosystems are 
essential for biodiversity, since they shelter 
at least 25% of the marine species, and they 
also contribute to economic and food secu-
rity of the population of coastal towns, ac-
cording to studies conducted by the Global 
Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN).

In Mexico, our industrial plant in Veracruz is close to 
the Municipalities of Coatzacoalcos and Nanchital, 
where community meetings were held in the com-
munities of Nahualapa, Pollo de Oro, and Lázaro 

Cárdenas, with the total participation of 141 residents. The purpose 
of these meetings was to discuss the implementation and results of 
the social programs and the program on maintenance downtimes. 
In addition, several special topics were discussed in each commu-
nity, and a space was provided to hear feedback from the commu-
nity and answer to questions.

One of our plants in the United States is located near 
a residential area, in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. In 
2022, we attended five Marcus Hook Environmental 
Advisory Committee meetings and maintained an 

active relationship with local representatives to ensure that we are 
helping to meet the community's needs and expectations.

In that year we funded, through private social investment, a new waste 
collection center for residents to recycle household plastic waste, pro-
viding access to recycling. In addition, within the Volunteer Program, 
we partnered with Keep Pennsylvania Beautiful and the Marcus Hook 
Borough to conduct a clean-up and focused on areas near the Marcus 
Hook creek to remove plastic waste from the natural environment.

Emergency donations 

We carry out five emergency donation actions to support 
families in Bahia, Petrópolis (RJ), and Maceió (AL), who 
suffered from the heavy rains that affected these regions. 
In all, more than 121,000 people have been benefited and 
more than R$3.3 million have been invested.

We also make donations to combat the hunger and vul-
nerability resulting from the pandemic. We carry out two 
initiatives: the voluntary donation by members, in which 
Braskem quintupled the amount donated, and direct dis-
bursement by the company, in the amount of R$5 million, 
for the acquisition of food baskets. Both actions ben-
efited more than 178 thousand people with 56.7 thousand 
food baskets donated.

Global Volunteer Program

One of our main initiatives in favor of the communi-
ties surrounding our operations is the Global Volunteer 
Program, which originated in 2017 from our wish to in-
creasingly strengthen our relationship with people in 
order to encourage our members to perform volunteer 
actions that generate a positive social impact on the 
communities. We note that, in 2022, there was a reduc-
tion in the number of benefited persons if compared 
to 2021, because in that year we made relevant emer-
gency donations related to the Covid-19 pandemics 
and to fight hunger.

Total number  
of volunteers:   
1.4 thousand   
(1,091 members 
and 331 guests) 
in 6 countries.

Number of 
benefited people:  
37.2 thousand.

Acknowledged initiative 
In 2022, the Volunteering Games (Gincana de 
Voluntariado) received the Aplaude Award from 
the Brazilian Corporate Volunteering Council 
(CBVE), in the category Engagement Initiative. In 
Mexico, we received the award Mejores Prácticas 
de Responsabilidad Social Empresarial, 23rd edition, 
from the Mexican Philanthropy Center (Cemefi). 
In the United States, we were acknowledged as 
Cleanup Champions by the Plastics Industry 
Association (Plastic), due to the cleanup task 
forces carried out throughout the year.

Highlights from 2022

Maceió Case
Braskem has the non-negotiable value of the 
safety of people and, since the occurrence of the 
geological event in some neighborhoods of the 
city of Maceió (AL), in 2018, this has been the main 
priority, in view of its commitment to safety and 
social responsibility. Associated with this action, 
the company has carried out a series of actions 
related to the preventive evacuation of risk areas, 
financial compensation, geological stabilization 
and referral of unoccupied areas. Below are some 
of these key actions:

Support to residents

The Financial Compensation and Relocation Support 
Program (Programa de Compensação Financeira e 
Apoio – PCF), created in December 2019 with the 
purpose of pre-emptively relocating residents, as 
well as accelerating the compensation process, has 
achieved its goals and reached the end of 2022 with 
more than 98% of the families already relocated 
from the areas considered to be at risk. About 97% 
of residents have also received compensation pro-
posals with an acceptance rate of 99.6%.

The PCF is an integral part of the Agreement entered into between the 
Public Prosecutor’s Office, Defenders and Braskem, whereby, in addition 
to relocation and compensation measures, the program encompasses fi-
nancial support and technical support services, such as rent assistance, 
the cost of the changes, coatrooms, pet storage during the change period, 
real estate consulting, service channels, support in opening bank accounts, 
partnering with notary offices to issue documents and certificates, among 
others. The program has social technicians, facilitators for the process of 
financial compensation, legal and psychological support, all committed to 
seeking the best solutions for the residents of the region. This psycholog-
ical support service that the company offers is free for all families residing 
in the areas of evacuation and monitoring and who are included in the PCF. 
By the end of 2022, more than 33,000 visits have been conducted.

The PCF has completed its third year of existence having fulfilled the 
scope defined in the Agreement and, so far, out of a total of approximately 
19,000 entries made to the program, more than 18,600 have already re-
ceived the proposal for financial compensation, approaching its closing.

Plan for Closing and Monitoring the Salt Mines 

Throughout 2022, the Company continued to make its best efforts to 
adopt the necessary and appropriate measures to resolve the issues 
arising from the geological phenomenon, fully complying with all com-
mitments assumed. The actions for closing and monitoring salt wells 
follow the mine closure plan approved by the National Mining Agency 
(Agência Nacional de Mineração – ANM), aiming at stabilization of the 
cavities. The interpretation of the monitoring data makes it possible to 
observe a reduction of the ground movement velocity, which will con-
tinue to be monitored, even after the completion of actions planned for 
the coming years. The actions of filling the wells with sand, belonging to 
the first group of 4 cavities, are in an advanced phase, with the mon-
itoring of the ANM, and expected completion for the 1st half of 2023. 
Actions have already been initiated to fill the second group, of 5 cavities, 
according to the planned schedule. 



Socio-urban and environmental remediation measures

Braskem has been moving forward with the adoption of measures, es-
tablished in the Socio-environmental Agreement, signed on 12/30/2020 
with the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office, to repair, mitigate or com-
pensate potential environmental and socio-urban impacts resulting 
from the activities of rock salt extraction. 

In 2022, the Social Action Plan was prepared as a development of the 
work of the Technical-Participative Diagnosis, resulting in the proposal 
of initiatives that are divided into: Axis 1 - Social policies and reduction 
of vulnerabilities; Axis 2 - Economic Activity, Labor and Income; Axis 
3 - Urban and Environmental Renovation; and Axis 4 - Preservation of 
Memory and Culture. The current stage is a technical discussion of the 
diagnosis with the competent public bodies. The proposal for Potential 
Projects of social actions keeps evolving, to support the discussions 
between the agencies involved, as well as the conduct of public con-
sultation about the proposed diagnosis. 

The Socio-environmental Agreement also provided for the making of a 
diagnosis to evaluate the potential environmental impacts resulting from 
the extraction of rock salt and the preparation of an environmental Plan 
with detailed proposals for measures. This diagnosis has already been 
concluded and resulted in the preparation of an Environmental Action 
Plan, which is in the process of discussion with the authorities, following 
the procedure provided for in the Socio-environmental Agreement.

As an integral part of the transformation agenda and future referral of 
the vacated areas, the works of the Stabilization and Drainage Project 
of the Mutange Coast were started in January 2022, whose scope en-
compasses demolition, earthworks, construction of drainage system 
and planting of vegetation cover in the area involved, with completion 
planned by the end of 2023.

Also in 2022, the Partial Adherence Agreement of the Municipality of 
Maceió to the Socio-environmental Agreement was signed relating to 
eleven Urban Mobility actions in the region, of which two have already been 

initiated and continue to move forward. There are al-
ready about 300 workers involved in these two ac-
tions, and the implementation of each of the planned 
actions, in addition to expanding the generation of 
jobs, will bring benefit to the locations where they will 
be implemented, as well as to the city as a whole.

Urban integration of Flexais

In October 2022, we signed an agreement with the com-
petent public bodies to implement renovation mea-
sures in the Flexais region, located in the Bebedouro 
neighborhood, considering the socioeconomic islanding 
of this area, after the PCF relocation process. 

The Urban Integration and Development Project of 
Flexais expects to complete the 23 renovation actions 
in two years, based on initiatives to improve living con-
ditions and access essential utilities. There will also 
be payment of financial support to residents, vacant 
property owners and merchants.

Communication 

Since 2019, through social dialog with community 
leaders and merchants, information has been col-
lected and questions have been clarified about the 
PCF and about works and interventions in the areas, 
among other topics. Active listening is also con-
ducted that receives the demands of communities 
and seeks to support their resolutions, in addition 
to seeking opportunities for cooperation to mitigate 
local impacts.

There are various channels of direct contact with 
families, with messaging application support and an 
0800 Service Center. As of December 2022, approxi-
mately 224,000 telephone calls have been made. In 
addition, access to information about the actions re-
lated to Maceió is broad and transparent, through the 
website www.braskem.com.br/alagoas. The platform 
also provides regular accountability of the activi-
ties performed. In addition to social media channels, 
Communication relies on the Braskem Explains 
campaign, published in the main local media, to en-
sure that the most up-to-date information is always 
available and accessible.

Next steps 

In 2023, the priority will be to complete the final 
relocation support measures provided for in the 
PCF and, as well as the latest financial compensa-
tions, in addition to proceeding with the safe clo-
sure process of the 35 wells in the region, with this 
expected to last until 2024. In addition to these 
actions, the company will proceed with urban mo-
bility projects, the agreed renovation actions of 
the Flexais region and the forwarding actions of 
the unoccupied areas.

The company will also move forward with the ex-
ecution of the environmental plan and the defi-
nition of potential social action projects in the 
surrounding region.

Highlights from 2022 Reputation survey

Braskem has been monitoring its reputation since 2010 through an annual survey carried out with various 
stakeholders. The survey looks at emotional issues, degree of esteem, admiration, empathy and trust. It 
also uses rational indicators in seven dimensions: products and services, innovation, work environment, 
governance, citizenship, leadership and performance.

In 2022, Braskem’s score was with a strong reputation. We show significant growth of the reputation in-
dicator for communities around our operations in Brazil. We have also made a positive highlight for our 
reputation with society in general in Brazil, with growth in the reputation indicator for the second con-
secutive year.
 

Highest historical score at Ecovadis

Since 2009, we are invited by our customers to participate in Ecovadis' social and environmental eval-
uation. We used efforts to improve the answers to the questions of the questionnaire and, in 2022, we 
obtained Braskem's highest historical score in the evaluation, reaching 68 points, against 62 points of 
the classification of the previous year.

Proximity with customers
Our broad and diverse portfolio includes products that contribute to 
the productivity and competitiveness of clients in a variety of indus-
tries. Together, we seek to develop sustainable solutions that posi-
tively impact the entire production chain. This is the case with life 
cycle analyses, certified raw materials with renewable and circular 
content and recently the offer of carbon credits to offset emissions 
in the transportation of goods.

In order to strengthen our relationship with clients and present our en-
tirerange of solutions – their features, applications and degrees – we 
participate in various events throughout the year. In 2022, we partici-
pated in Expobor, Agrishow, Abrafat, all in Brazil, and K Fair, in Germany.

By 2022, Braskem had already 
completed 116 LCA projects in 
partnership with its customers.

Another important point of our participation was the presentation of innovation initiatives, such as Cazoolo 
to Oxygea and the Center for Technology and Innovation (CTI), at the petrochemical hub of Triunfo, in the 
south of Brazil. We also introduced Smartrails, a solution for our clients that replaces wooden sleepers 
with railway sleepers made of plastic. The coating is made of polyethylene with fiberglass and high-density 
polyethylene blocks. 

K Fair

In 2022 we also attended the K Fair, held in Düsseldorf (Germany) 
that happens every four years. One of the highlights was the launch 
of Wenew, a global circular economy ecosystem that encompasses 
circular technologies and products, and education initiatives on con-
scious consumption and proper disposal.

2022 was also a year of strengthening relationships 
with our suppliers, contributing to the achievement 
of greater reliability, competitiveness, safety and 
efficiency for our operations. In addition, we have 
strengthened our actions in Sustainability through 
initiatives that promote the engagement and devel-
opment of our partners on the topic.

From the registration process onward, our suppliers 
are invited to get to know and sign our Third Party 
Code of Conduct, which expresses their expecta-
tions about the conduct of partners working with 
Braskem. For more critical sectors, such as sug-
arcane ethanol, we also have exclusive codes and 
criteria for supply, whose compliance with the stan-
dards required by the company is essential for the 
formation of the partnership. 

Recycled plastic suppliers, in turn, are subject to a 
specific checklist and due diligence and subject to 
frequent audits. In addition, in the Registration pro-
cess itself, a survey of information from each partner 
is carried out with the goal of evaluating and classi-
fying the risk exposure with regard to environmental 
aspects; labor and human rights aspects; ethical 
aspects; and/or financial aspects of Braskem as re-
gards this new relationship and consequently acting 
with the establishment of possible mitigating plans 
if the relationship materializes.

GRI 3-3 308, GRI 308-2

Regarding sustainability aspects, we consolidated our partnership with 
Ecovadis, one of the world’s largest global supply chain sustainability 
rating companies, to evaluate the environmental, social and gover-
nance management of the supplier base. In 2022, we had 200% growth 
in the evaluated supplier base, which demonstrates the engagement of 
our supply chain on the topic. In addition, we also achieved the engage-
ment of 270 suppliers in the assessment of CDP Supply Chain Climate 
and CDP Supply Chain Water, with engagement rates of 82% and 72% 
respectively. Also worth highlighting is Braskem’s partnership with 
Childhood Brazil in the fight against sexual exploitation of children and 
adolescents on the highways, given its road distribution matrix.

Assessment of ethanol suppliers

The human rights due diligence process 
has reinforced what had already been 
identified a few years ago: the existence 
of risks associated with the ethanol 
supply chain, made from sugarcane, 
which is used for the production of I’m 
greenTM polyethylene. Since 2016, we 
have implemented the Responsible 
Sourcing of Ethanol Program to ensure 
integrity and sustainability practices 
in the cane chain through audits 
of suppliers and sub-suppliers. 

The program is structured into two 
pillars: compliance and excellence. 
The compliance pillar establishes the 
operational standards expected for 
the management of human resources, 
the environment, local communities, 
quality, and efficiency. The pillar of 
excellence refers to a Continuous 
Improvement Program, focused on 
issues relevant to the ethanol chain. 
In 2022, we revised the Program 
to broaden the themes addressed, 
reinforce governance requirements, and 
further mitigate risks in the chain.

2022 was also characterized by a volatile economic and supply scenario arising 
from the pandemic. In this context, expenditures with local suppliers of goods, 
services and Supplies totaled R$13.5 billion (79% of total expenditure).

Recognition

As a result of the consolidation of these part-
nerships, in 2022, we held the second edition of 
the Braskem Supplier Sustainability Recognition 
award, which highlights the ESG best practices 
of our suppliers and encourages our supply 
chain to take actions in socioenvironmental 
performance, human and labor rights, the envi-
ronment, ethics and sustainable Procurement.

In this process, the companies were evalu-
ated based on their scores in the Ecovadis, and 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) question-
naires, resulting in the recognition of 24 sup-
pliers that stood out the most in the period. 
The online event had an audience of more than 
1,000 Braskem suppliers worldwide.

Partnerships that transform

Since 2021, we have been working together with BASF on projects aimed at 
accelerating two crucial points for the chemical sector: recycling and carbon 
neutrality. In 2022, the partnership prioritized five actions, two of which are 
being implemented and one will start in 2023. One of them is the use of maritime 
logistical assets through the partnership, with the objective of optimizing idle 
capacity and reducing impacts on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). The 
partnership also resulted in an agreement, valid from 2023, in which Braskem 
supplies propylene with a circular attribute through the concept of mass balance, 
certified by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC).  
It is worth noting that the sustainable solutions made possible by the partnership 
with BASF are scalable and may be extended to other Braskem customers.

Risk management in input procurement

We review the input supply chain risk management process, creating 
global indicators and setting priorities by region and country, enabling 
the implementation of risk mitigating actions according to the degree 
of vulnerability presented. Such actions have also allowed us to im-
prove business relationships and product procurement strategies that 
are indispensable for our production processes, since this mapping is 
not limited to looking at only our main suppliers, but the entire supply 
chain and any potential impacts we are subject to. 

Foreign trade compliance and safety

Another standout front in 2022 was achieving the low-risk operator 
rating through the Authorized Economic Operator (Operador Econômico 
Autorizado, OEA) Certification in the Safety category, resulting in greater 
agility and predictability of loads in international trade flows.

Investment in class associations
In an ethical and transparent manner, we want to contribute to discus-
sions for the formulation of public policies related to the development 
of the petrochemical industry, the elimination of plastic waste and the 
fight against climate change, fundamental topics for the development 
of our industry and our business. 

In order to improve our governance and intensify our initiatives on topics 
that impact different regions, we created the Global Advocacy area in 
2022. An integral part of the Institutional Relations board, the new area, 
in support of Sustainable Development strategies, will focus on the cre-
ation of a governance system for the exchange of information among 
the various Institutional Relations teams in the different regions, the 
mapping of public policies and global impact initiatives and the mapping 
of stakeholders for the development of global positions on these fronts. 

At the end of 2022, along with other members of the International Council 
of Chemical Associations (Conselho Internacional de Associações de 
Produtos Químicos – ICCA), we participated in the first round of negoti-
ations seeking to reach a global agreement to eliminate plastic pollution. 
This round was the first in a series of agendas due to continue until 2024 
to come up with a global proposal covering all stakeholders in this chain.

We are also involved in discussions to develop public policies aimed at 
regulating the handling of plastic waste, especially in Brazil and Europe, 
which will support us in overcoming challenges in the recycling chain.

Also at the end of the year, we participated in several events during the 
27th UN Climate Conference in Egypt to present our strategy to combat 
climate change and key projects towards carbon neutrality. We also con-
ducted several interactions with government officials, partners and cli-
ents during the event.

It is essential for us to seek economic and financial results based on a 
solid development strategy, on constant strengthening of ESG prac-
tices, on long-lasting relations with our customers and, consequently, 
on the increase in the value generated for shareholders.

We understand that this is a key issue to enable our commitments of 
2030 and 2050. For that purpose, we are continuously working to guar-
antee the integrity of our production chain, the strengthening of our 
governance and compliance system, and the maintenance of a strong 
level of liquidity and positive cash generation, even in down cycle pe-
riods in the petrochemical industry.

Highlights from 2022

Cash generation

We ended the year with recurring EBITDA of US$2.1 
billion, 64% lower than 2021, an amount explained by 
factors such as the drop in international spreads of 
PE, PP and PVC in Brazil, PP in the United States and 
Europe, and PE in Mexico, as well as the lower volume 
of sales of major chemicals in the Brazil and PP seg-
ment in the United States and Europe.

In turn, the recurring cash generation in 2022 was 
R$6 billion due to the recurring EBITDA for the pe-
riod, the variation in working capital, and the compa-
ny’s operational and strategic investments referring 
mainly to the disbursements of scheduled mainte-
nance stoppages made in 2Q22 and the construc-
tion of the ethane import terminal in Mexico and 
the expansion of biopolymer capacity in Rio Grande 
do Sul, respectively. Adding the payments relating 
to the geological event in Alagoas, the Company 
presented a cash generation of R$3.3 billion.

Liquidity and indebtedness

We finished the year with gross debt of US$6.8 bil-
lion, with 96% of maturities concentrated in the 
long term and 4% in the short term. In line with the 
strategy of maintaining a robust cash position and 
given a volatile and unstable scenario for borrow-
ings in the international market in 2022, Braskem 
once again accessed the local market, issuing four 
operations totaling R$3.7 billion. Finally, corporate 
leverage, as measured by the recurring net debt/
EBITDA ratio in dollars, was 2.42x.

US$929 million
in corporate  
investments 
(-8% vs. what was estimated).

2022 represented the consolidation of the sustainability strategy to our corporate strategy. In October, we held 
the second ESG Day, a hybrid event where we presented our advances in sustainability and reinforced our com-
mitments for 2025, 2030 and 2050, which focus on three pillars: social responsibility and human rights; plastic 
waste disposal and combating climate change. 

There were about 730 participants including investors, journalists, banks and Braskem team members. The 
event had a positive impact with the media and among sell-side analysts, who make recommendation on 
buying, holding or selling stock.

In 2022, we launched the Braskem Invest podcast. The channel, avail-
able on different platforms, covers information related to the compa-
ny’s performance in its strategic pillars and the petrochemical sector, 
in addition to offering analyses and views on the company and the fi-
nancial market.

Credit lines

In 2022, we secured our first corporate credit line tied to a sustain-
ability-linked goal (Sustainability Linked Loan, SLL). We have signed 
two contracts with international financial institutions totaling US$150 
million tied to the growth in sales volume of Green PE I’m greenTM bio-
based in the coming years, there are incentive and penalty mecha-
nisms tied to the achievement of the established KPI. 

Also in 2022 we conducted a local debt issue. This is the 124th issue of 
agribusiness receivable certificates (Certificados de Recebíveis do 
Agronegócio – CRA), backed by credit rights in the amount of R$720 mil-
lion, by the Eco Securitizadora de Direitos Creditórios do Agronegócio. 
Our goal is to apply resources exclusively to the acquisition of ethanol 
from rural producers.

business growth. Through our initiatives and processes, we transform 
natural, renewable and non-renewable resources into chemical and 
plastic products, seeking to reduce and mitigate environmental and so-
cial impacts. 

Our focus is on combating climate change and eliminating plastic waste, 
seeking to be a benchmark in operational eco-efficiency in our opera-
tions in relation to water and energy consumption and effluent genera-
tion, atmospheric emissions and waste.

Highlights from 2022

At Braskem, we assumed the commitment to reach 
2030 with an absolute 15% reduction in greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHG) in scopes 1 and 2 – in relation 
to the average of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 – 
and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

In addition, we committed to expand our bioproducts 
production capacity to 1 million tons. For that purpose, 
we have adopted an action plan composed of three pil-
lars of operation: reduction of emissions in our opera-
tions, removal of biogenic carbon with stock in product 
and carbon capture/conversion into chemicals.

In 2022, we mapped potential projects to achieve 
these commitments by means of the development 
of a Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MAC curve) 
of GHG emissions. Based on this study, we devel-
oped a global route of initiatives of various levels of 
maturity and complexity, with different expected 
development horizons.

The global curve mapped 161 projects with potential 
to reduce 3.4 million tons of CO₂e:

Short term: efficiency projects and energy ma-
trix replacement. 
 
Medium-term: projects for the use of renewable 
raw materials.

Long-term: technology development projects 
for carbon capture and use.

The MAC curve allowed us to review and improve the 
internal cost of carbon, which is used since 2016 to 
analyze the feasibility of investment projects consid-
ering the variable of GHG emissions. Since 2021, this 
analysis is mandatory for certain lines of investment 
and it is based on a tool developed internally. The tool 
calculates the cost of the estimated emission of a 
project based on its technical specifications.

Inventory of GHG emissions

Since 2008, we account for the emissions of Braskem’s operations and publish the results in a GHG inventory, 
which currently follows the operational control approach, contemplating our global emissions of scopes 1, 2, and 
3, and which is annually verified by an independent third party. The inventory is our main tool to monitor our 
qualitative evolution in relation to the reduction targets of our climate change strategy.

The inventory observes the guidelines of The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol – Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard – Revised Edition from World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) – 2004 Revised Edition and the Specifications of the Brazilian Program 
GHG Protocol: Accounting, Quantification, and Publication of Corporate Inventories of the Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions – Second Edition and is verified by an external third party.

Emission map

Scope 1 emissions

Most of Braskem’s scope 1 emissions – 90% in 2022 – occur in our pet-
rochemical centers (crackers), where the raw material (of fossil and/or 
renewable origin) is transformed into plastic products, chemicals, and 
specialties in an energy-intensive process named cracking. With the 
reduction in the amount produced in 2022 compared to the previous 
year, our crackers did not operate at their optimal energy efficiency. 
As a consequence thereof, even with a smaller production, our GHG 
emissions of scope 1 remained stable in relation to 2021, with a small 
increase by 0.58%.

(2) Market-based, the approach of measuring Scope 2 GHG emissions using a specific emission factor directly associated with the source of the generation of purchased electricity.

Braskem’s scope 2 emissions presented a reduction if compared to 
2021, in the market-based approach (-31.26%).

Even though the electricity and vapor consumption remained stable 
in relation to the previous year, the emission factors of the intercon-
nected systems (grid) in which we operated were reduced, most ex-
pressively in Brazil, were the factor dropped by almost 66% due to the 
good performance of the hydroelectric plants (which was less frequent 
in 2021 due to the water crisis). Since the electricity consumed in Brazil 
originating from the grid represents a little more than 60% of the total 
consumption of scope 2 (electricity and vapor, the impact on emissions 
was considerable.

In addition, the reduction by 31.26% reflects the renewable and clean 
energy purchase agreements in Brazil, Germany, and the United States, 
strategy under implementation since 2018 and which has already 
brought important results in the inventory.

Scope 3 emissions

In 2022, Braskem's scope 3 recorded 27,281,767 tons of CO₂e considering all categories reported relating 
to the upstream and downstream emissions of our value chain. This amount includes the report of 12 cat-
egories out of the 15 categories applicable to scope 3, it being understood that categories 2, 13, and 14 
do not apply or are not material for our business. Considering the entire chain, the scope 3 emissions 
represent 72% of its total emissions for Braskem. Upon analysis of the results, we note that 85% of the 
total scope 3 emissions are concentrated in three categories, which are: 1- Goods and services pur-
chased; 10- Processing of products sold; and 11- Use of goods and services sold. This distribution profile 
is very similar to companies of our industry due to the purchase of fossil raw material and of the pro-
cessing carried out by our customers in the transformation of resins and use of the energy products sold. 

Review of the corporate 
inventory process

In 2022, we reviewed the greenhouse has 
emission management process, which 
is a fundamental initiative to consoli-
date and bring more assertiveness to 
the corporate inventory. While listening 
and understanding the new process, 
we identified three main frons for the 
inventory as a unified corporate GHG 
emissions management tool: quantita-
tive monitoring of corporate emissions 
reduction targets with the Industrial 
team; monthly monitoring of the plant 
emissions to understand the impact of 

“real-time” decision making; and to fore-
cast future emissions of our operations 
considering potential future projects.

In absolute numbers there was a reduction of 9% 
compared to 2021, mainly leveraged by a reduction in 
raw materials as a consequence of the reduction in 
the company's total production volume in the period, 
use of more accurate emission factors for transport 
(categories 4 and 9), reduction of the grid emission 
factor, border adjustment (category 15) and disre-
gard of waste and effluent emissions from Cetrel in 
scope 3.

In 2022, we were awarded the gold classifica-
tion of the GHG Protocol Brazilian Program 
(PBGHG) for the 12th consecutive time. This 
is a result of the coverage of the emissions 
(scopes 1, 2, and 3) and of the verification by an 
accredited third party in the 2021 inventory. At 
the CDP Climate, we were awarded grade B.

Industrial Decarbonization Program
To achieve the emissions reduction commitment set for 2030, in 2021 
we developed a program dedicated to industrial decarbonization. The 
program is based on three fundamental pillars: GHG Inventory, the basis 
for proper management of the topic; Culture, Process and Governance, 
which includes the development of an industrial mentality focused on 
operating and identifying improvements that can reduce greenhouse 
gases emission, strengthen the orientation of processes and gover-
nance for decision-making based on emissions, besides stimulating 
partnerships for the development and implementation of solutions; 
and the lines of action, distributed on the fronts:

Industrial mindset focused 
on decarbonization

In our strategy to fight climate change, we es-
tablish annual goals related to the reduction of 
emissions by industrial decarbonization projects, 
contemplated in the variable remuneration of the 
senior management.

In 2022 we also conducted the main global tech-
nical congress, which was created to encourage 
preparation of the industrial public to the chal-
lenges in climate change, focused on technical 
excellence. Its main purpose was to share the im-
provements and best practices involving industrial 
decarbonization, and also to present the external 
benchmarks. Twenty-eight initiatives with poten-
tial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were pre-
sented, and the majority of them originated from 
continued improvement projects. The industrial 
decarbonization capacity building track, which was 
implemented in 2021 and gathers the main con-
cepts and initiatives of the program, trained more 
than 700 people since then.

Based on the MAC curve developed this year, we 
prioritized 69 initiative to reduce emissions among 
the lines of action, it being understood that 48% of 
them are already in progress or in run-rate. The en-
ergy efficiency and electrification initiatives are the 
main fronts of the decarbonization portfolio, based 
on renewable energy and low-carbon fuels.

Implement continuous improvement operational initiatives with a 
view to reducing emissions.

OPERATIONAL DECISIONS

Reduce GHG emissions through energy integration, electrification 
and optimization initiatives.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Increase the share of renewable energy and low-carbon fuels in 
Braskem’s energy matrix.

Increase in energy efficiency in the 
ABC petrochemical center

Since 2019, we devote to a process of modernization of the electric system 
in the petrochemical center of the ABC region, in São Paulo. The project is 
carried out in partnership with Siemens, which is responsible for building 
and operating the high-efficiency co-generation system, and the joint in-
vestment amounts to approximately R$600 million.

The purpose is to update the technology of the system that serves this 
petrochemical center, which is made by substituting steam turbines by 
high-efficiency electric motors. The support originates from a new energy 
co-generation plant fed by residual gas with high hydrogen content from 
the petrochemical production process.

In 2022, we started the co-generation phase, which generated a reduction 
by approximately 35 kt CO₂e/year due to the use of electricity and natural 
gas. For 2023, we foresee conclusion of the project and an estimate re-
duction by approximately 100 kt CO₂e/year, in addition to estimated gains 
in energy efficiency (7.3%) and water consumption (11%).

Consumption of power

In 2022, even with lower absolute consumption, the indicator of total energy consumed was 4.7% higher if com-
pared with the previous year (11.31 GJ/t), mainly due to a reduction in the production and consequent worsening 
of the energy efficiency of the plants. Irrespective of that, throughout the year, we continue investing in renew-
able electric matrix and energy efficiency.

Voqen: Vocation for energy

In October 2022, we launched Voqen - new Braskem company, being one of its focuses the energy 
transition in our industry. Voqen already manages a portfolio of more than R$3 billion per year, will 
help us in the energy transition process and provide support to the entire chemical and petrochemical 
chain. We will offer our customers and partners all knowledge of the energy and gas markets we gath-
ered over the years, as well as customize renewable energy solutions and new business models.

Electrification with renewable energy

As part of our commitment to implementing of new tech-
nologies and solutions that drive to the sustainable devel-
opment, Braskem and Coolbrook plan to jointly implement 
a pilot project in which Braskem will evaluate the use of the 
disruptive technology, called RotoDynamic Reactor (RDR), 
on an industrial scale before implementing it into your 
crackers. Ultimately, the project involves the electrification 
of crackers through the substitution the use of thermal en-
ergy derived from fossil fuel for electricity generated from 
renewable sources, which is one of the ways for Braskem to 
reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

Biomass-based thermal energy

Veolia: in 2022, we executed an agreement to produce energy with the use of biomass-based steam. As 
from 2023, the operation will be carried out in Marechal Deodoro (AL), generating up to 900 thousand 
tons of steam/year, in 20 years, reducing approximately 150 thousand tons of CO₂e in the long term.

Investments in renewable electric energy

In 2018, we initiated a sequence of long-term agreements for the purchase of 
renewable energy. Since then, we signed agreements with an average term of 
20 years, for the supply of electric energy from wind and solar sources. In Brazil, 
our agreements represent 40% of the energy we purchase in the country and 
account more than 220 average megawatts. Also enable the construction of 
new ventures that contribute to the expansion of the electric system and the 
country's development, especially in the regions where we are located.

Clean energy and RECs certificates in Germany and in the USA

We evaluate the potential to increase our consumption of renewable energy globally. 
Therefore, in 2022 Braskem Europe commenced to implement its strategy of purchase of 
energy with renewable certificate for 100% of its consumption of electricity. As a result 
thereof, in that year the market-based emissions of scope 2 of Braskem of that region 
were 75% lower than the location-based emissions.

Braskem in the United States, in turn, signed a renewable electric energy purchase agreement, 
for a term of ten years, for the plant in Neal (West Virginia), which becomes effective in 2025. 
It has also entered into clean energy agreements for the plant in Marcus Hook (Pennsylvania), 
until 2027. Finally, it has acquired Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) for the Texas plants.

From a global emission perspective, we understand 
that biopolymers are an important solution for the 
petrochemical industry towards carbon neutrality. 
In fact, the raw material used for the production 
thereof contains carbon of biogenic origin, for ex-
ample, removed from the atmosphere during the 
plant photosynthesis process. Because they re-
tain biogenic carbon molecules for dozens of years, 
biopolymers can be considered as long-term in-
ventories of biogenic carbon.

Diversification into bioproducts

The year 2022 also marked the 
launch of Sustainea, a joint ven-
ture with Japan's Sojitz focused 
on the production and sale of monoethylene glycol (bioMEG) 
and monopropylene glycol (bioMPG) made from renewable raw 
materials. The raw material for PET, MEG has numerous appli-
cations and is essential for industries such the textile and pack-
aging industries, especially beverage bottles, but today it is still 
predominantly produced from fossil raw materials.

By means of this joint venture, the business plan contemplates 
the implementation of three industrial plants, with start-up of 
the first unit in 2025. Sustainea will also establish a production 
chain to ensure renewable and competitive raw material supply, 
as well as a logistics operation that enables the smallest pos-
sible carbon footprint. The expectation is that once the tech-
nology is approved, the plants will have a combined production 
capacity of up to 700,000 tons of bioMEG per year.

Carbon to chemical conversion

We are investing in the development of carbon capture technologies for storage and use as raw materials 
for chemical production. Our Innovation team is working with a pipeline where 170 ideas have been 
identified, 15 of which have been developed, becoming research already at various stages of development.

Among the projects are a partnership with Northwestern University in the development of a co-
electrolysis technology, which simultaneously transforms CO2e captured in CO and ethylene into 
ethylene oxide. With the University of São Paulo and the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), 
we worked on creating a new technology to convert CO2e into light olefins or linear alpha-olefins. 
Together, we are also developing an electrocatalytic system to convert CO2e  and water into ethanol. 

With New Iridium, a startup from Colorado, United States, we are supporting the development of a 
photocatalytic system that uses light energy to promote the conversion reaction of CO₂2e into organic 
acids. In addition to the projects to convert CO₂e, we also have a partnership for the development of 
capture technologies with membrane in cooperation with Compact Membrane Systems (CMS).

With respect to the project of University of Illinois, from Chicago, initiated in 2019, we have obtained 
positive results, with the conclusion of the development of the technology in laboratory, and we are 
evaluating the commencement of the pilot plant to continue the development of the technology in 
larger scale. 

 
For that reason, we announced in 2021 the expansion 
of current green ethylene capacity at the Triunfo pet-
rochemical complex in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) from 
200 kt/year to 260 kt/year, with an estimated invest-
ment of US$87 million, which is expected to start op-
erating in the first half of 2023. As expected for 2022, 
we also continue to study the feasibility of expanding 
green ethylene production to Thailand, in partnership 
with SCG Chemicals – during 2023, we expect to reach 
project milestones such as investment approval.

In 2022, we formalized our partnership with Lummus 
for licensing technology to produce green ethylene. The 
partnership will accelerate the use of bioethanol for the 
production of chemicals and plastics.

Climate adaptation 
GRI 201-2

We concluded the climate risk review, with time horizons of 2030 and 
2050, in which we identified and evaluated the physical and transition 
risks, as well as the climate-related opportunities that could impact the 
company under different climate scenarios. The study also included 
mapping the existing control measures for the identified risks and up-
dating the climate change adaptation plan.

The study included scenarios limiting the average temperature increase 
to 2°C by the end of the century, providing a wide diversity of plausible 
outcomes and meeting the best practices for climate risk studies estab-
lished by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Its scope reflected all operations in the countries where the company 
operates, with potential physical risks raised associated with ten types 
of climate threats that vary according to the region of the analyzed units 
in Brazil, Mexico, the United States, and Germany. After the climate risk 
classification process, the highest risks were identified, totaling 22 in the 
time horizon of 2030, and thus action plans were defined to eliminate or 
reduce these risks.

Among the industrial units, those located in Brazil presented the 
highest incidence, where extreme climate events, such as severe 
droughts, heavy rains and floods, can occur. For each of the risks, clas-
sified as high, we prepared action plans with adaptation measures. As 
for the opportunities, identified and classified as priorities, we selected 
those with the greatest potential positive impact on the business and 
defined actions to enhance them. The incorporation of climate risks 
to the corporate risk management process, aligned with Braskem's 
strategy, allows for the anticipation of due adaptation measures, which 
can avoid or control certain risks, and the exploitation of the opportu-
nities identified in the study.

Climate adaptation and water security

One of the main physical climate risks to which we are exposed is water scarcity; therefore, water 
risk management is completely interconnected with climate risk management. The main actions for 
mitigating water risk is the search for new safe sources of water catchment, thus avoiding potential 
conflicts with the community and increasing water security. One example is Aquapolo, which serves 
part of the operations in the Southeast region of Brazil, and is one of the main initiatives we have 
implemented for water risk mitigation, the largest reuse plant in operation in Latin America with 1,000 
liters/s capacity.

In operation since 2012, the project is the result of a partnership between sanitation company SABESP, 
at the time with the private operator BRK Ambiental and Braskem in a 41-year contract to supply 
the company's plants in the ABC petrochemical complex. Nowadays, the Aquapolo is under GS Inima 
management and supplies almost 100% of the water consumed by the units of ABC Paulista, which 
contributes to minimizing the risks of scarcity in the region.

For the selection of new safe water sources, using as reference the requirements of the CEO Water 
Mandate and our sustainable development strategy, with technical support from a specialized con-
sulting firm, we developed a tool that considers technical, social, environmental, economic, and risk 
aspects in the decision-making process for new water sources; this way, these new water withdrawal 
options will be more aligned with our strategy, underpinning the achievement of the 100% water se-
curity index by 2030.

64.5Water is a fundamental resource for petrochemical pro-
duction, used in cooling processes and steam genera-
tion, as well as incorporated into certain products. Water 
scarcity – magnified by climate change – can negatively 
impact our business and the continuity of operations.

Therefore, based on the study of climate risks and on 
the studies of hydrographic basin risks in the regions 
of our operations, we defined and have been imple-
menting action plans for water safety for all industrial 
units, in alignment with the climate change adapta-
tion plan, especially for those with the highest risk of 
droughts and water unavailability: the northeastern 
and southeastern regions of Brazil.

Among our goals for this topic is the use in our opera-
tions of 100% water from safe sources by 2030. In 2022, 
the global water security index was 65.3%, an decrease 
of 4.1% compared to 2021. The eco-efficiency indicator of 
Braskem’s water consumption in 2022 was 4.30 m³/t, al-
most 3% higher than the previous year’s result.

We concluded the technical reassessment of indica-
tors and concepts related to water, based on the most 
recent updates of recognized international references, 
such as WRI, GRI, CDP, CEO Mandate, among others. 
One of the main review points is the standardization 
of the concept of safe water, which has already been 
updated to calculate the 2022 water security indicator. 
This review will allow us to follow a path in line with our 
commitment for 2030.

Another important change refers to the reassess-
mento of water reuse indicator, which is part of the 
water security index, what resulted in adjustments to 
exclude process improvements inherent to the tech-
nologies used in the plants. This adjustment impacted 
the water security indicator in 2021 and 2022.

The effort for an efficient management of water re-
sources was recognized by the Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) with an A- grade in the water security question-
naire. The non-profit environmental organization se-
lects the best publicly traded companies in the world in 
relation to sustainability aspects.

We are also part, since 2019, of the CEO Water Mandate, 
a UN Global Compact platform that brings together 
more than 150 companies committed to advancing the 
management of water resources. After joining the Race 
to Resilience initiatives of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Water 
Resilience Coalition, a coalition led by CEO Water 
Mandate, which aims to preserve the world's freshwater 
resources through collective actions in water-scarce 
basins, we are evaluating existing collective action ini-
tiatives in the southeast and northeast regions of Brazil, 
regions of potential water stress, to select the one most 
adherent to Braskem's strategy and with potential posi-
tive socio-environmental impact.

Rio de Janeiro: we signed a memorandum of 
understanding with the concessionaire Águas 
do Rio (Aegea Group) for a project to supply 
the company's industrial plants in Duque de 
Caxias with reused water. The project is aligned 
with the climate adaptation objectives, with 
a focus on achieving 100% water security 
for its industrial units by the year 2030.

Alagoas: we are evaluating alternatives for the 
reuse and desalination of seawater for the two 
industrial units. To support the project selection 
process, we developed a methodology with an 
external consulting firm, with criteria that will 
be considered to define the winning proposal. 
This process should be completed by 2023.

Developed in partnership with Fortlev, a national leader in 
water storage solutions, the project aims to produce and 
distribute (with the help of the Friends of Good Institution) 
water tanks in 80 villages in the states of Alagoas, Pernambuco 
and Ceará. The action benefited around 10,000 people 
and Braskem was responsible for donating Polyethylene 
resin to produce more than 2,000 water tanks.

We are committed to expanding the commercialization of resins 
with recycled content to 300,000 tons in 2025 and 1 million tons 
by 2030, as well as recovering 1.5 million tons of plastic waste by 
this same year. Thus, increasingly committed to strengthening and 
achieving the circular economy, we launched Wenew, the company’s 
new circularity ecosystem which includes circular products (resins 
and chemicals), environmental education and proper disposal ini-
tiatives, technologies and circular design. 

We denominate the last three initiatives as Wemove, a movement that 
aims to educate and engage people in society and raise awareness 
about ways to achieve a more circular plastics supply chain.

Our global portfolio comprises 40 grades of post-consumer recycled content resins and 42 grades are in de-
velopment. We have plastic resins produced from mechanical recycling, and chemicals such as solvents and 
specialties, repurposed from the company’s traditional production processes. Braskem’s circular products 
are the result of plastic waste recycling and recovery processes and, for this, we invest in innovative waste 
recycling and recovery technologies.

Circular product portfolio
In 2022, Braskem in the United States announced a novelty that contrib-
utes to the company’s commitments to the circular economy. This is the 
expansion of the polymer portfolio, which now includes two new poly-
propylene (PP) grades with post-consumer recycled (PCR) content. The 
solutions are used in a wide range of US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) food contact applications, including consumer packaging, caps, 
and household utilities. With the launch, we want to help our clients 
meet their recycled content goals in the FDA food contact market, which 
currently has limited PCR solutions. 

In Brazil and Mexico, we completed 
the lifecycle analysis study of recycled 
content resins, which showed 
up to a 48% reduction in carbon 
footprint over conventional resin. Chemical

Extending our recycling supply chain

In 2022, we made significant strides to achieve our 
goal of expanding our portfolio to include 300,000 
tons of thermoplastic resins and recycled content 
chemicals by 2025. One of them was the signing of a 
contract for acquisition of shares and subscription of 
new shares issued by Wise Plásticos S.A., a company 
in the mechanical recycling sector focused on poly-
propylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) resins.

As of the present, Braskem owns 61.1% of Wise's 
share capital. A significant part of the investment – 
estimated at R$121 million – will be allocated to dou-
bling current production capacity to around 50,000 
tons of recycled products by 2026. The transaction 
was approved by CADE on november 2022, com-
pleted on february 2023, and and is connected to 
Braskem’s circular economy strategy, creating even 
more sustainable and innovative solutions based 
on the improvement of opportunities in the plastics 
production chain, which includes the recycling chal-
lenge in Brazil.

Also in 2022 we inaugurated, in partnership with 
Valoren, the first mechanical recycling plant in 
Brazil. With an investment of approximately R$67 
million, the unit is expected to transform 250 mil-
lion post-consumer packaging – made of poly-
ethylene and polypropylene – into 14,000 tons of 
high-quality recycled content resin annually. After 
the process, the resins will serve as raw materials for 
the transformation industry.

In addition, we announced the formation of a joint 
venture with ER Plastics in the Netherlands. The 
company, which will be controlled by Braskem, is re-
sponsible for creating an innovative technology that 
converts low-quality plastic waste into final prod-
ucts. With this, we will expand our performance in 
the supply chain, based on a new business model, 
and be able to expand the use of this technology to 
other regions.

The ER Plastics has a nominal mechanical recycling ca-
pacity of 23,000 tons per year, that transforms mixed 
plastic waste into compression-molded parts (plates 
for use in construction and pallets). For Braskem, the 
operation is aligned with the commitment of achieving 
300,000 tons of sales of products with recycled con-
tent by 2025.

Braskem Idesa and Alcamare

The partnership between Braskem Idesa and Alcamare, 
Mexico’s largest recycler, will help drive the relevance of 
PE and PP recycling in the country. Through a long-term 
contract, we will develop and trade food-quality recycled 
material, i.e., food contact-capable recycled products.

Highlights from 2022

In search of new technologies with high potential for plastic waste 
recovery, we have invested in several partnerships to increase the 
quality of post-consumer recycled content resins and expand their 
application possibilities. Among these projects is the partnership 
with the Institute for Sustainable Process Technology in developing a 
technology for separation and recycling of mixed plastic waste sent for 
pyrolysis. With an investment of €2 million, the project will enable the 
recovery of plastics that will become raw materials for resin production.

Together with Senai, we are working on chemical recycling research 
into solutions for use of flexible post-consumer plastic. The goal of 
this partnership – which has an investment of R$2.7 million – is the 
development of catalysts to improve the quality of the products 
generated in the plastic chemical recycling process.

Another disruptive project with Valoren also focus on chemical 
recycling that will transform, by means of the pyrolysis process, plastic 
waste into certified circular raw material, which will be used in the 
manufacture of resins or chemical inputs. The project, which involves 
a joint disbursement of R$44 million, should start operating in the first 
quarter of 2023 and will have the capacity to produce six thousand 
tons of circular products per year.

We also made a capital investment to acquire the minority stake in Nexus 
Circular, a company that operates in chemical recycling. The proprietary 
technology project converts films destined for landfill and other 
hard-to-recycle plastics into high-quality raw materials. The 10-year 
agreement announced by the two companies considers the supply of raw 
materials for the production of circular PP resins certified by Braskem. 

Technology development

In 2022, we accounted for 33.5 thousand tons of re-
covered plastic, an increase of 156% over the last year, 
due to the consolidation and increase of collective 
actions and consumer engagement. This result con-
siders the volume of plastic waste recovered through 
sales of post-consumer resins (PCR), which totaled 
28.3 thousand tons, an increase of 115% compared to 
the previous year.

Among these actions are cashback system initiatives. 
In 2022, we signed and operated with three compa-
nies in this segment, in which people exchange their 
sanitized post-consumption packaging for credits 
available on a card, provided directly at the collection 
points (fixed and mobile). The units accept materials 
made of plastic, glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, 
among others. With the card it is possible to make 
purchases in local establishments, such as markets, 
pharmacies, and bakeries.

Triciclo, Coletando and Molecoola helped install 34 
new voluntary delivery points in the states of São 
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia. In addition, we made 
it possible to include PE and PP collection at more 
than 200 points that were already in operation. With 
Coletando, the action (also cashback) is carried out 
in 17 municipalities of four states (SP, RJ, MG and BA). 
The waste collected goes to one of the 25 partner 
cooperatives that allocate the materials for recycling. 

In the case of plastic items (polyethylene and 
polypropylene), Braskem is  responsible for recycling, 
through the mechanical recycling unit operated by 
Valoren. The materials return to the chain as post-
consumer recycled resin, which can be used for the 
production of new products, thus closing the cycle of 
the circular economy.

Partnerships to prevent plastic waste disposal

Over the years, Braskem has joined various initiatives to understand, 
prevent and assist in the management of plastic waste. 

Blue Keepers: coordinated by the Global Compact Brazil, the project 
was developed to prevent plastic waste from escaping into rivers and 
oceans in a systemic and lasting way. We are one of the sponsors of the 
action, which focuses on waste management to generate impact in 
the short, medium, and long term through the fronts of diagnosis, so-
lutions, pilot projects and public management. In 2022, we presented 
the project's diagnosis at an event of the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), on Dialogues of Ocean 
Culture; we conducted research, with the National Confederation of 
Municipalities, on eco-barriers and eco-boats; and we have evolved 
with the collection of samples, through the Oceanography Institute of 
the University of São Paulo (USP), to build the first national inventory 
of types of waste that go to sea, considering priority cities.

Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW): an industry coalition that 
invests in projects and technologies to end plastic waste disposal in 
the environment, especially in the oceans. We make commitments 
on two fronts: Solution Accelerator Fund (investment of US$7.5 
million by 2023 in annual membership fees) and Member Directed 
Commitment (investment of US$15 million by 2023 – alliance 
members commit to investing directly in their own activities to deal 
with plastic waste, a goal Braskem has already met). In 2022, more 
than 30,000 tons of plastics were recovered in the initiative’s actions.

SER+ Program

The program aims to foster the development of the re-
cycling productive chain of solid urban waste in recycling 
cooperatives, through training, mentoring, and invest-
ment in equipment, PPE, infrastructure improvement 
works, and services in recycling cooperatives.

In 2022, we recovered 4.7 thousand tons through the 
program, which expanded its activities to the city of 
Duque de Caxias (RJ), benefiting 30 cooperatives and 
more than 900 cooperative members in distinct stages 
of maturity. In the year, the program recovered about 4.7 
thousand tons of plastic waste.

Recycling show

In 2022, we will take our commitment 
to sustainable development and 
circular economy to three major events: 
Rock In Rio, Lollapalooza and Popload 
Festival. These actions consisted 
of plastic waste collection stations 
where participants could exchange 
recyclable items for various gifts.

Popload Festival:  
+27,000 plastic items collected.

Lollapalooza Brazil:  
+129,000 plastic items collected.

Rock in Rio:  
+872,000 plastic items collected.

Zero waste in the park 
 
In 2022, we joined forces with Ibirapuera with the Zero Waste Braskem project to contribute to 
the goal of making it the most sustainable park in Latin America, making it zero landfill by 2030. 
The goal is to make the more than 18 million visitors aware of how to dispose of waste correctly, 
improve waste management in the park, and optimize recycling by means of signalized waste 
garbage cans and exchanging waste for discounts on products sold in the park.

We are also sponsors of sustainability actions at the São Paulo Museum of Art (Masp). In this 
partnership we encourage the museum to make improvements in its waste management. In 
the first six months of the partnership more than 10 tons of recyclable material was removed 
from the museum, which was sent to a cooperative for recycling.

Highlights from 2022

In 2022, we inaugurated Cazoolo, Brazil’s first packaging development 
center for the circular economy. The space, which is located in São 
Paulo (SP), is the result of an investment of R$20 million and functions 
as a packaging innovation hub. Its main goal is to design and develop 
improvements for the entire packaging journey – from conception to 
post-consumer. 

There we want to bring together all the links in the production chain, 
such as clients, brand owners, designers, startups and universities, so 
that they can create and co-create projects that aim at the complete 
circularity of their products, reducing environmental impacts and le-
veraging innovations with technology. 

The initiative has already started to reap good results, with packaging 
solutions developed and available for the market. This is the case of 
the Stand Up Pouch, a mono-material developed in partnership with 
Antilhas; the mono-material tube created in conjunction with C-Pack; 
and the mono-material solution in BOPP. 

Circular design

All projects developed in Cazoolo follow the 
concepts of Design for Environment (DfE)(1)  
and Life Cycle Analysis (LCA).(2)

The Cazoolo was 
recognized as an 
Initiative of the Year 
2022 in the Design 
ESG/Circular 
Economy category 
of the Brazil 
Design Awards and 
awarded in the 
Design category 
of the Design for 
a Better World 
award, organized 
by Centro 
Brasil Design.

Actions to increase plastic recovery

As a leader in polypropylene production in North America, we are com-
mitted to collaborating and strengthening recycling and circularity. It 
was with this goal that in 2020 we joined the Polypropylene Recycling 
Coalition, an initiative of The Recycling Partnership. 

In 2022, the How2Recycle North American packaging recyclability la-
beling program upgraded the eligibility of rigid polypropylene (PP) tubs, 
bottles, jugs, and jars from "check locally" to "widely recyclable" in the 
United States. This was achieved by several years of improving polypro-
pylene sortation capabilities at material recovery facilities through a 
structured granting program, administered by TRP. As a result, our cli-
ents can remain confident in communicating PP recyclability on their 
products and packages.

Also in 2022, we rejoined the American Chemistry Council's Plastics 
Division to work across the industry on improving the recovery of plastic 
packaging.  We also continued our participation as members and part 
of the Executive Advisory Board of Cyclyx, an innovative consortium 
working to increase plastic recovery rates and supply feedstock to recy-
cling projects.

At Braskem, we have a Health, Safety, Environment, 
Quality and Productivity Policy. One of its parameters 
is the monitoring of hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste. This is done based on local regulations and 
site-specific quality procedures. 

Waste management efficiency, designed to increase 
company eco-efficiency, reduce waste treatment 
costs and also prevent environmental liabilities, fol-
lows an order of priority: 

1. Non-generation 
 
2. Reduction 
 
3. Reuse 
 
4. Waste treatment 
 
5. Final destination

In 2022, the intensity of waste generation was 3.04 
kg/t, an increase of 25% compared to 2021, due to 
lower production in the year, accounting for waste 
from environmental liabilities and the maintenance 
stoppage in Rio Grande do Sul.

procedures in all our units. In 2022, the intensity 
of generation of liquid effluents was 1.21 m³/t, in 
line with the previous year. During the year we 
advanced with projects to optimize cooling water 
consumption, mitigating the negative effects of 
scheduled and unscheduled shutdowns, as well as 
equipment cleaning.

The improvement in the campaign to monitor emission sources and the 
standardization of atmospheric emission inventories led to a reduction 
in NOx, SOx and PM emissions, mainly at the crackers in Brazil and at 
Braskem Idesa. Due to the maintenance stoppage in Rio Grande do Sul, 
Brazil, there was a reduction in Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP), due to 
the cleaning of equipment, improving systems' burning and cleaning 
efficiency. For the other pollutants, the pattern was maintained in the 
volume of emissions, without significant impacts.

topics not only in the Braskem portfolio, but also 
throughout the production chain. 

In 2022, our fixed assets totaled R$37.8 billion and 
we had a productive capacity of 21.3 million tons  
of chemicals and plastic resins. In the recycled con-
tent resins segment, production capacity reached 
62,000 tons/year.

Performance, efficiency and productivity

Brazil

The average utilization rate of the petrochemical 
plants in Brazil decreased 3 pp compared to 2021, 
reaching 78%, due to scheduled maintenance stop-
pages at the Rio Grande do Sul petrochemical plant 
and PVC plant in Alagoas, the unavailability of raw 
materials at the Rio de Janeiro and ABC petrochem-
ical plants, in addition to the lower demand for resins 
and a fall in spreads in the international market. 

On the other hand, the volume of resin sales in the 
Brazilian market was in line with the previous year’s 
result due to the greater market share of resins and 
maintenance of local PE demand, which offset the 
decline in total demand for resins in the country. 
Resin exports in 2022 also remained in line with 2021. 

The sales of the main chemicals were lower (-6%) 
mainly due to the lower availability of products for 
sales given the lower utilization rate of the petro-
chemical plants in the year. Exports also decreased 
(-27%) due to lower demand in the foreign market.  
 
In PVC, the average utilization rate of the Alagoas and 
Bahia plants was 66%, 1 pp higher than 2021. Sales to-
taled 498 tons, 1% higher than the previous year.

United States and Europe

The utilization rate of US and European plants was 
80%, down 5 pp from 2021 due mainly to lower de-
mand in the regions and short unscheduled stoppages 
in the period.

Sales volume in the United States also declined by -9%, 
an amount which was also associated with lower de-
mand in the period associated with lower consumption, 
high inventory levels in the transformation chain, and 
the expectation of converters to lower prices in subse-
quent periods and high levels of PP imports into Europe.

Highlights from 2022

Mexico

The average utilization rate of the PE plants increased 7 pp compared to 
2021 due to the increased supply of ethane through the Fast Track solu-
tion. Sales, in turn, increased 20% due to increased availability of product 
for sale, given the higher utilization rate in the period, and higher demand 
for PE in the region.

Fast Track operations supplemented raw material supply with an average 
of 18,500 barrels per day of ethane imported from the United States, 
representing a 20.4% increase compared to 2021 and 74% utilization rate 
of this solution. Additionally, in August the Fast Track solution recorded 
a record supply, operating at an average of 27,200 barrels per day, due to 
investments that allowed an increase in the volume of imported ethane.

Transform for Value

Within the processes that drive our strategy and drive value for the company, one highlight is the Transform 
for Value global efficiency program. Its role is to coordinate and accelerate improvement initiatives in different 
areas, including competitiveness and productivity and energy. Thus we can prioritize applications aligned to our 
strategy by selecting those that adhere most to our business and sustainability commitments. 

Puerto Mexico Chemical Terminal

Braskem Idesa (BI) announced an agreement with the com-
pany Advario for the construction and operation of Puerto 
Mexico Chemical Terminal (TQPM), which will serve to import 
ethane in Veracruz. The transaction, which was completed in 
March 2023, with an estimated investment of US$400 mil-
lion, will have a 50% equity stake in TQPM for each company.

Construction began in July 2022 and has reached a 
physical progress to December of 26%. Operations 
are expected to start in the second half of 2024.

The purpose of the terminal is to complement Mexico's 
hydrocarbon supply and provide additional ethane for 
Braskem Idesa to operate at full capacity, increasing 
gas availability and the competitiveness of the en-
tire Mexican petrochemical and plastics industry.

Through Transform for Value we redesign our process structure, generating value for the company through 
process optimization (whether related to physical or intellectual assets), always focusing on the environmental, 
social and governance pillars for decision making.

Highlights from 2022

In 2022, the cumulative capture of these initiatives totaled about US$283 
million. The capture rate represents, mostly, a direct impact on the com-
pany’s EBITDA, which can occur in four ways: net revenue increase, vari-
able cost reduction, fixed cost reduction or DVGA reduction.

Importantly, approximately 1/3 of the value capture pace of US$353 mil-
lion/year can be associated with Digital Transformation initiatives, which 
make significant use of digital technologies in their scopes, such as auto-
mation and instrumentation, new software and systems, advanced ana-
lytics, machine learning, and cloud services, among others. 

In addition, other initiatives in more preliminary phases, such as plan-
ning or execution, under management of the areas that compose the 
program’s scope of operation have added to the pipeline’s potential ap-
proximately US$387 million/year to be captured in the coming years.

Braskem has remained focused on developing var-
ious projects in its main growth avenues, which are 
concentrated in existing business with a focus on 
productivity and competitiveness, of renewables 
and recycling.

In the Brazilian market, demand for PE, PP and PVC fell 
3% compared to 2021 mainly influenced by the decline 
in consumption, due to the rising interest rates.

In the United States, PP demand fell 6% compared 
to 2021, affected by high inventory levels in the 
transformation chain and fear of an economic re-
cession. The European market was also down 8% 
year-on-year, explained by lower consumer con-
fidence due to the region’s poor economic per-
formance and the impacts of high inventories on 
the transformation chain. In Mexico, PE demand 
increased from 2021 (+8%), explained by the con-
tinued recovery of the Mexican economy over 2022, 
especially in industrial sectors.

Sustainable Production Certifications 

We were the first Brazilian company to receive the 
International Sustainability and Carbon Certification 
for the use of alternative raw materials (ISCC Plus). 
This means that industrial units in the south and 
southeast regions can test and produce new poly-
mers derived from sustainable, credited and recog-
nized sources. Germany’s production plants and the 
Netherlands office also received this certification 
and in 2022 it was the time of the US facilities, where 
we have five certified plants. 

We also received Bonsucro certification which af-
firms the production and processing of raw mate-
rials in a socially and environmentally responsible 
manner at our industrial complex in Triunfo (RS). We 
became members of the Roundtable on Sustainable 
Biomaterials (RSB), an entity that promotes the de-
velopment of renewable and circular fuels and ma-
terials, with a special focus on the aviation sector. 
Through this partnership, we can help develop and 
discuss pathways to this market alongside airlines, 
aircraft manufacturers and other organizations. 

In addition, based on our initiatives with Ocean Clean 
Sweep, we have already earned the OCS Blue seal, 
awarded by Plastivida, licensor of Operation Clean 
Sweep® in Brazil. In 2022, we held the Good Practices 
Sharing Forum related to the OCS/Pellet Zero 
Program; 85 logistics and industrial leaders from all 
over Brazil attended. Our units in Mexico and in the 
United States are also certified by OCS.

We believe investing in advancing technology will increasingly be the 
central path in the pursuit of a more sustainable future. We see in-
novation as a strategic pillar, being present in all our investment deci-
sions to enable the transition process to the carbon neutral circular 
economy, based on the development of increasingly cleaner solutions. 

To measure the results on this front, we implemented an index two 
years ago that evaluates the sustainability of our projects in the 
fields of innovation and technology. Our goal is to have an index 
greater than 90% by 2030.

Highlights from 2022

At Braskem, innovation is a fundamental pillar to evolve with our long-term commitments. Our transfor-
mation through innovation began with the implementation of the Sustainability Index for all innovation 
projects and the creation of platforms that focus on circular and low-carbon solutions: performance ma-
terials, transformation of biomass into chemicals, recycling, next generation process, and conversion of 
CO₂e into chemicals.

The innovation platforms have established themselves and started to contribute with opportunities to de-
velop production processes and new molecules with reduced carbon emissions, mitigation, and reduction of 
safety risk regarding the use of chemicals and new raw materials with renewable or circular basis, strength-
ening Braskem's portfolio of innovation and technology projects.

Sustainable innovation

Sustainability Index

Since 2020, the Sustainability Index has integrated 
all Braskem’s innovation and technology projects, 
thus ensuring the alignment of each project with 
our sustainable development strategy. All initiatives 
undergo an assessment in the planning phase of 
aspects related to sustainability and the type of im-
pact (positive, negative or neutral). At the end, they 
receive an average grade. 

We ended 2022 with 179 projects in innovation 
and technology, with 131 assessed against the 
Sustainability Index and 111 with positive impact. This 
represents an 85% Sustainability Index. The posi-
tive impacts of these initiatives are related to: water 
and/or energy savings, chemical safety (process/
product), greenhouse gas emissions and circularity.

In the year, we also developed a method-
ology to map the sustainable impact of solu-
tions (Sustainable Solutions Mapping – SSM), 
i.e., the combined impact of the product in ap-
plication, impact of product production up to 
Braskem’s gate, and the impact of product use 
after Braskem’s gate until end-of-life. Braskem’s 
SSM methodology is based on four benchmarks: 

360 
members in I&T 
(+20% vs. 2021). 

20   accelerated startups  
at Braskem Labs.

Highlights from 2022

We have experienced an era of accelerated change driven by new dig-
ital technologies, appropriately called the Digital Age. From modern-
day rideshare apps to the use of drones to deliver goods to our homes 
after we push a few buttons on our smartphones – digital technologies 
are fundamentally reshaping how we live, economies and markets, so-
ciety, politics and geopolitics, community and ethics, learning and work.

With the goal of making the company increasingly innovative, sustainable, 
adaptable and competitive in the context of the Digital Age, Braskem 
started a digital transformation program in 2018. The effort aims to 
equip company team members with a new generation of tools, which 
include innovative methodologies and digital technologies that enable 
us to operate smarter and safer, autonomous and more connected.

  

Over the last five years, the company has been investing in an orga-
nized and recurring way in new technologies – from preparing the 
necessary infrastructure to operating assets safely and reliably, to ini-
tiatives that reshape how we produce basic plastic and chemical resins. 
Other investments in new ventures (new business models originating 
internally) and disruptive innovation are underway and enhance our 
commitment to sustainable development, alongside startups with the 
same purpose.

In 2022, approximately R$35 million was directly allocated to the digital 
transformation product portfolio, which already has more than 25 initia-
tives and more than 70 digital products aimed at the industry 4.0, supply 
chain, commercial, research and development, among others.

Today, digital strategies are transforming practically the entire Braskem supply chain, 
generating estimated gains in the order of R$500 million per year – an amount that 
is part of the recurring gains of the Transform for Value program. Examples include:

Using data science to make better decisions in processes such as predictive 
maintenance, quality control, process optimization, demand forecasting, logis-
tics optimization, and operations planning. 

Implementing stand-alone systems for performing repetitive or high-risk activities.

Eliminating information silos, to connect people, systems and assets to maxi-
mize efficiency and productivity.

Using design and user experience best practices, to improve the customer experience.  

Braskem has created most of its digital tools internally, with development teams 
working through rapid feedback cycles, learning and adapting to changes in an 
agile way. Indeed, our experts have already developed around 25 different ma-
chine learning models used in over 400 applications in recent years. Today, the 
digital product development cycle, from idea to implementation of the new so-
lution, is about nine months, often enabling benefits to be captured quickly.

A key part of the digital transformation process has been in managing change, 
promoting the use of agile working methods, and acquiring skills associated with 
the development of digital solutions.

From 2018 to date, more than 3,000 members have had the opportunity to ex-
plore several complementary disciplines that foster innovative thinking, such as 
data science, agile, and design thinking.

Building internal startups
The company also diversifies its portfolio of investments in digital 
technologies through the creation of new business models. These new 
digital businesses, developed based on ideas generated within the 
company itself, have the mission of anticipating market changes that 
impact the company and the industry in general. More than half of the 
startups developed by 2022 are linked to the company's commitments 
to sustainable development.

Highlights from 2022

We believe that innovation – not only in our products and operations – 
but throughout our supply chain has the ability to generate a number 
of positive impacts in the pursuit of a more sustainable future. In this 
way, we seek to develop tools to prepare ourselves for the structural 
challenges that will enable the energy transition to a more sustainable, 
circular, and carbon-neutral economy.

Innovation in the supply chain

Oxygea Ventures

Braskem’s digital transformation led to the foundation of Oxygea 
Ventures, a corporate venture capital arm launched in 2022, that is de-
voted to leveraging the work of startups that operate in sustainable 
innovation and digital transformation.

The new company is strongly linked to meeting the public commitments 
we have made to reduce carbon emissions and increase our plastics re-
cycling rate. With Oxygea, we are incubating ideas and accelerating busi-
nesses. Four initiatives are already in the early stages. They were created 
within Braskem and will now continue as startups. In addition, the hub 
intends to select six more startups. 

Another goal of the company, which targets Brazil, the United States, 
Europe and Israel, is to operate as an enabler of connections between 
mentors, clients and suppliers, strengthening the entire ecosystem. In 
addition, Oxygea comes with the technological support, expertise and 
structure of Braskem where tests and validations can be carried out.

Braskem Labs

Since 2016, we have stimulated open innovation and our supply chain 
for chemistry and plastics, with Braskem Labs, a platform for the ac-
celeration of startups that generate positive social and environmental 
impact. These startups focus on: agribusiness, biotechnology, pack-
aging, infrastructure and construction, chemicals, mobility, and health.

Carried out in partnership with the accelerator Quintessa, its main goal 
is to encourage this ecosystem and seek solutions to Braskem’s busi-
ness challenges. Over the past six years, the platform has accelerated 
132 startups, of which 96% continue to operate.

In 2022, in addition to Brazilian startups, Braskem Labs expanded its 
borders by inviting entrepreneurs from Chile to be considered for se-
lection. The choice of country was based on the maturity of its inno-
vative ecosystem, which stand out in Latin America. Chile is also an 
important partner in the company’s business strategy. This initiative 
functioned as a pilot project to evaluate the possibility of Braskem 
Labs expanding to other countries.

capitals, showing how the company generates value 
and impacts its main stakeholders through its busi-
ness model. It also makes it possible to know the pil-
lars of our 2020-2030 sustainability strategy and its 
performance transversal to business, the material 
issues considered by Braskem, and the company’s 
strategy. Thus, the content gathers the entire ESG 
theme related to Braskem, in addition to the eco-
nomic and financial information for 2022.

The 2022 Integrated Annual Report is adherent to 
Resolution No. 14 of the Brazilian Securities and 
Exchange Commission (CVM), dated December 
9, 2020, which made the CPC Guideline No. 9 - 
Integrated Reporting, issued by the Accounting 
Pronouncements Committee (CPC), mandatory for 
publicly traded companies when deciding to pre-
pare and disclose the integrated report. Additionally, 
it determines that the integrated report should be 
subject to limited assurance by an independent au-
ditor registered with the CVM, in accordance with 
the standards issued by the Federal Accounting 
Council (CFC).

As a way of maintaining the conciseness of the docu-
ment, we highlight here part of the indicators and main-
tain the public data in its entirety in an  online center. 

Braskem’s governance agencies, including the Board 
of Directors, reviewed and approved the document 
prior to its publication. The Integrated Annual Re-
port 2022 also underwent external evaluation con-
ducted by KPMG.

GRI content summary

Highlights from 2022

We calculated the progress of our commitments on three levels: global, 
by commitment and by indicator.

Global progress

The global progress is the arithmetic average of the individual progress 
of each of the seven commitments (health and safety, economic and 
financial results, elimination of plastic waste, combating climate change, 
operational eco-efficiency, social responsibility and human rights, and 
sustainable innovation).

Progress by commitment

The progress of each commitment represents the arithmetic average of 
the achievement of the indicators.

Progress by indicator

The achievement of the indicator level considers some elements: base-
line, 2030 target, challenge size and current result.

Baseline: calculated as the average of the 2018, 2019, and 2020 
results, for indicators subject to industry volatility, or as the actual 
2020 result.

Indicators with baseline measured by three-year average: 
net debt/EBITDA, RepTrak Pulse with customers, Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index, absolute GHG emissions volume, renew-
able electricity, Water Security Index, bioproducts production 
capacity, Reptrak Pulse with communities, people benefited in 
communities, women in leadership, black people.

Indicators with baseline measured by actual 2020 result: 
Workplace Accident Rate (CAF + SAF), Tier 1 and 2 Accident Rate, 
occupational diseases, socio-environmental risks, sales of prod-
ucts with recycled content, recovered plastic waste, climate ad-
aptation and I&T Sustainability Index.

Methodology: calculation of the commitments for 2030
Target and challenge size: target defined considering industry challenges, and the challenge size is the dif-
ference between the target and the baseline.

Current result: calculated as the moving average of the last three years or the actual result of the reported 
fiscal year, according to the methodology applied in the calculation of the baseline.

The achievement of the indicators is calculated according to the formula: achievement = [(baseline - current 
result)/ (challenge size)] - 1.

An exception is the Total Shareholder Return indicator, where the baseline is calculated considering the 10-
year period 2011-2020, the current result also considers the last 10 years, and the achievement is calculated by 
simple variation (current result/2030 target - 1).
