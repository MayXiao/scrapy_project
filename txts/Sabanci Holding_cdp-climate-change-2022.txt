Climate emergency issues constitute an important part of Sabancı Holding's sustainability efforts, given its Group-wide long-term goal of being net zero emissions and
zero waste by 2050 at the latest. Such topics are brought to the agenda of BoD members through a variety of channels including the Corporate Governance,
Appointment and Remuneration Committee or the Board-level Sustainability Committee. Also, risk study results are evaluated periodically by the Holding BoD, Early
Detection Risk Committee and Risk Coordination Committee. Sustainability-risks, including those that are related to climate, are among the critical risks that are
assessed and monitored at the EDRC level. An example to such risks can be physical and transitional risks related to the climate emergency and their impact on our
Group activities. Transition to a low carbon economy provides many opportunities for Group companies. These are assessed at Sustainable Business Models Thematic
Task Force.

(C1.2a) Describe where in the organizational structure this/these position(s) and/or committees lie, what their associated responsibilities are, and how climate-
related issues are monitored (do not include the names of individuals).

  

CEO: The CEO of Sabancı Holding holds the ultimate responsibility for monitoring and assessment of sustainability-related risks and opportunities, including those that are
related to climate emergency, as well as the execution of Sustainability Roadmap. For instance, the CEO comments on the evaluation of sustainability risks across the Group
and suggests on actions to improve during the Risk Coordination Committee meetings. An example to such risks which the CEO commented on can be the impact of Carbon
Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) on emission-intensive sectors. ESG performance, including but not limited to those that are related to climate issues, are embedded
in senior management's performance goals at the rates of 10% for Group Presidents -15% for CEOs. 

Group President, Human Capital & Sustainability and Sustainability Leadership Committee: The Sustainability Leadership Committee, chaired by the Human Capital

and Sustainability Group President on the Executive Board, ensures that the Holding and Group companies are on the same page in terms of sustainability goals and actions.
The Committee is also responsible for monitoring the progress made toward the goals and actions included in the Group’s Sustainability Roadmap, and for monitoring the
efforts

to manage risks that may adversely affect Sabancı’s reputation and operations in ESG areas. It monitors international developments, public regulations and trends in
sustainability, and advises the Thematic Task Forces accordingly while encouraging the deployment of expertise and best practices among Group companies. The Chair of
the Committee informs the Holding Board Sustainability Committee every six months, receives their guidance and approval. With Full Members consisting of all relevant
Group Presidents, the Corporate Brand Management and Communications Department President, and the Director of Investor Relations, the Committee is also open to the
participation of the relevant stakeholders upon invitation. The Sustainability Director acts as the coordination unit. In 2021 the Committee had 3 meetings.

BoD & BoD level Sustainability Committees: The Sustainability Leadership Committee meets and reports directly to the CEO (who is also executive member of the board
of directors) on a quarterly basis. Sabancı Holding established a Board-level Sustainability Committee consisting of three independent BoD members in 2021 in coordination
with Sabancı Holding’s Human Capital and Sustainability Group Presidency, monitors the following activities which are under the responsibility of other Management functions
related with the Sustainability Leadership Committee. The Committee briefs the Board of Directors and makes suggestions as needed.  The Committee meets in ordinary
session at least twice a year. 

Early Detection of Risk Committee (EDRC): The Early Detection of Risk Committee operates to complete the early detection of all kinds of risks related to strategies,
operations, finances, compliance and similar risks that may endanger the existence, development and continuation of the Company, taking the necessary precautions and
managing the risks. The ERM system used includes identification and assessment of all risks including the critical and high-level priority risks of Sabancı Group companies,
and continuously measures the performance changes of these risks, as well as monitoring and reporting them. Risk study results are evaluated periodically by the Holding
BoD, EDRC and Risk Coordination Committee. Sustainability-risks, including those that are related to climate, are among the critical risks that are assessed and monitored at
the EDRC level. 

Thematic Task Forces, Sustainability Director, Sustainability Manager: Thematic Task Forces were established under the Sustainability Leadership Committee as a
support structure in the focus areas of the Sustainability Roadmap. Task Forces, consisting of experts from Group companies, are responsible for designing programs and
projects for the implementation of the action plan. Thematic Task Forces report their work to the Sustainability Leadership Committee through the Sustainability Directorate.

The Holding's Sustainability Directorate undertakes the coordination role for both the Thematic Task Forces and the Committee.  An example to the assessment and
monitoring role of Thematic Task Forces as well as Sustainability Director and Manager are their monitoring and assessment of progress on the implementation of climate-
related actions under the Sustainability Roadmap.  In 2021, the Climate Emergency Task Force has met 2 times, while the Sustainable Business Models and Human &
Society Task Forces have met 5 and 4 times respectively.

(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?

According to Sabancı Holding's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system, risks are categorized based on their nature under the clusters such as strategic risks, financial
risks, operational risks and compliance risks. Each cluster is then rated based on parameters such as 'impact', 'likelihood', 'vulnerability' and 'speed of onset'. The 'impact' is
determined based on multiple dimensions such as financial, operational, legal, reputational, H&S, human resources and environmental impact. The Holding's Early Detection
of Risk Committee (EDRC) convenes at least 6 times a year and evaluates the risks by considering their final risk scores and categories. Upon the suggestion of the EDRC,
the BoD decides on the mitigation plans on risks that are deemed as high or critical.

In principle, all mitigation actions are planned by the risk supervisors or department heads and assigned to a risk owner. Consequently, the action plan is conducted by the
risk owner. The Holding's related risk owner and risk supervisor as well as the Holding risk management teams re-evaluate the residual risk level following the completion of
mitigation actions.

Definition of substantive financial impact** (2021): As per the financial impact, the threshold for the highest risk level is >TL 315 million. 

Definition of substantive strategic impact (2021): If the cluster of a risk is identified as 'strategic' AND the risk is rated as High or Critical* on the basis of inherent risks;
then it is deemed to pose high strategic risks and prioritized to be reported to the EDRC.

*Following the calculation of final score based on impact, likelihood, vulnerability, speed of onset, the risks are categorized according to the following classification:

If the final score is:

· equals and higher than 3 than the risk is categories as “Critical”,

· equals to 2.6 and between 2.6 and 3 than the risk is categories as “High”,

· equals to 2 and between 2 and 2.6 than the risk is categories as “Medium”,

· equals and lower than 2 than the risk is categories as “Low”.

** Financial impact scores for 2021 are as follows and are revised on an annual basis:

1- No loss

2- Up to TL 90 million 

3- 90 million TL up to TL 175 million

4- 175 million TL up to TL 315 million 

5- More than TL 315 million

Description of process
The Group manages risk in line with its risk appetite through a combination of both quantitative and qualitative metrics. In line with the strategic and financial targets,
prioritized risks are handled in accordance with the following risk management strategies; risk avoidance, risk transfer, risk reduction and risk acceptance. The corporate
risk management framework includes subheadings such as determination and monitoring of risk mitigation activities. Group Risk operation results are evaluated periodically
by the Risk Coordination Committee at the Holding’s senior management level and through the Early Detection of Risk Committee (EDRC) at Board of Directors level.
Holding EDRC convenes at least 6 times a year and monitors the risks by considering their final risk scores and categories. Upon the suggestion of the EDRC, Holding BoD
decides on the mitigation plans on risks that are deemed as high or critical. In principle, all mitigation actions are planned by the risk supervisors or department heads and
assigned to a risk owner. Consequently, the action plan is conducted by the risk owner. The Holding's related risk owner and risk supervisor as well as the Holding risk
management teams re-evaluate the residual risk level following the completion of mitigation actions. Sabancı Holding and Group companies use the Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) system. This system includes identification and assessment of all risks including the critical and high-level priority risks of Sabancı Holding companies,
and continuously measures the performance changes of these risks, as well as monitoring and reporting them. We also identify emerging risks for the future (from 3 yrs up
to 20 yrs), assess their impact on business and determine the required mitigation actions. Sabancı Holding acts with the principle of "every risk may contain an opportunity"
and the risk teams coordinate with other functions such as Group Presidents responsible for main industries, investor relations, sustainability and the Group company
managers in order to make sure the Group embeds such opportunities in business plans. Under the ERM, sustainability risks (which are evaluated as part of the Holding's
strategic risks and which has a transversal impact across other risk groups) are defined as 'risk of failure to comply with sustainability requirements including environmental,
social and governance (climate change, carbon tax etc.)' and sub-categorized into different topics such as physical risks, compliance risks and transition risks. It is deemed
as a strategic risk as a whole with critical importance given its significant potential impact (e.g. financial impact of all 3 sub-categories collectively has the potential to exceed
TL 315 million threshold). Examples of physical risk drivers that are taken into consideration in energy and industry sectors are as follows: - Climate change and drought
leading to low water reservoir levels, disrupting electricity generation in hydro power plants - Extreme weather-driven irregularity in wind regimes, resulting in losses in
power generation via wind turbines Examples to transitional risk drivers that are taken into consideration in building materials sector are as follows - Extreme weather
events that disrupts the production of suppliers or logistics of raw materials and risk the continuity of production facilities Examples to compliance risk drivers that are taken
into consideration in building materials sector are as follows: - ESG-related lawsuits and loss of Social Licence to Operate - Loss of investors, market share and customers
Examples to transitional risk drivers that are taken into consideration in building materials sector are as follows: - Failure to comply with sustainability standards (e.g.
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism - CBAM) - Gaps to climate friendly operational baseline leading to higher cost of funding Definition of substantive financial impact**
(2021): As per the financial impact, the threshold for the highest risk level is > TL 310 million Definition of substantive strategic impact (2021): If the cluster of a risk is
identified as 'strategic' AND the risk is rated as High or Critical* on the basis of inherent risks; then it is deemed to pose high strategic risks and prioritized to be reported to
the EDRC. *Following the calculation of final score based on impact, likelihood, vulnerability, speed of onset, the risks are categorized according to the following
classification: If the final score is: · equals and higher than 3 than the risk is categories as “Critical”, · equals to 2.6 and between 2.6 and 3 than the risk is categories as
“High”, · equals to 2 and between 2 and 2.6 than the risk is categories as “Medium”, · equals and lower than 2 than the risk is categories as “Low”. ** Financial impact scores
are as follows: 1- No loss 2- Up to TL 90 million 3- 90 million TL up to TL 175 million 4- 175 million TL up to TL 315 million 5- More than TL 315 million The EDRC convened
6 times in 2021 and submitted risk assessments to the attention of the Board of Directors.

Please explain

Current
regulation

Relevant,
always
included

As of 2021, the only legal obligation directly related to GHG emissions in Turkey is the Regulation on Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of GHG Emissions, which is in force
since 2014 and applies to emission intensive sectors. Group Companies have been reporting their GHG emissions for their relevant facilities and to comply with the regulation the
companies have external verification. The MRV regulation is expected to form the basis for a future legally-binding carbon pricing mechanism which has the potential to impact Sabancı
Group companies in various ways, such as reduced revenues in energy intensive sectors in case of exceeding GHG thresholds/allocations. Compliance to MRV law and increasing the
internal capacity to monitor and manage GHG emissions is crucial for Sabancı Group in terms of ability to adapt future obligations. In order to mitigate the risk of non-compliance, Sabancı
Group takes a proactive approach in aligning with the developments on GHG-related regulations, through (1) undertaking emission reduction initiatives with the ultimate goal of becoming
net zero emissions by 2050, (2) increasing its internal capacity to monitor and manage GHG emissions with the use of digitalization and technology where appropriate & feasible and (3)
conducting R&D programs on efficient technologies.

Emerging
regulation

Relevant,

included

Turkey has signed Paris Agreement and declared the country will be Net Zero by 2053. In 2021 Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change has started to prepare a new
INDC to fulfil the Net Zero Commitment and plan to finalize it before COP27. Relevant governmental agencies in Turkey are also following up and working on the developments in Green
Deal and proposed a roadmap for Turkey within 2021. Government is also working on a Climate Law that aims to reduce the country’s impact on climate change and references the
temperature targets as laid out in the Paris Agreement. The Climate Law is aimed to be the main legal framework to achieve this target. The main planned mechanisms to reduce GHG
emissions are market-based mechanisms, with emission trading system (ETS) considered as the main mechanism. The draft Law also references strong and efficient financial incentives to
increase carbon sequestration, increasing ecologically rich areas, disseminating energy efficiency projects, using alternative fuels, switching to sustainable production and consumption
models in energy, transportation and waste, and especially development and innovation of technologies to reduce GHG emissions in energy-intensive sectors. The Ministry also has been
working on PMR Project (Partnership for Market Readiness) to define the best mechanism for carbon pricing that fits Turkey's sustainable development agenda. The PMR is still in pilot
phase, Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) may trigger the implementation of a national pricing mechanism in different forms such as carbon tax or ETS, which would bring
additional costs to sectors such as building materials and energy. The subject has been included and emphasized in the “Green Deal Action Plan” published by the Ministry of Commerce
in 2021. In order to prepare for such scenarios, Sabancı Group has taken a proactive approach and set itself a Group-wide net zero emissions target by 2050 at the latest. With this goal,
together with the implementation of its Sustainability Roadmap which includes a wide range of measures on the management of climate-related risks and opportunities, Sabancı Group
plans to stay ahead of such developments and mitigate potential risks associated to carbon pricing before they occur. The portfolio of Sabancı Group includes heavy industries which may

Technology and innovation have been positioned as our most essential enablers in the transformation journey, we began within the scope of “Sabancı of New Generation” and in fostering
sustainable business models. They play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon economy and circular economy models, bringing significant opportunities. The ratio of sustainability
linked R&D and innovation activities in Sabancı Group was 51% in 2021. We aim that 70% of our R&D and innovation expenses serve SDGs by 2025. We established the Corporate
Venture Capital Fund Sabancı Ventures to support entrepreneurship ecosystem in Turkey and to gain early access to technological innovations and developments, as well as to create
agile and technology-based growth platforms. We focus on investments in areas such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, new material technologies, sustainability, energy,
mobility, and cyber security. The fund size is $30 million. With SabancıDx, which is one of our most important investments to support digital transformation in the Group, we offer next-
generation digital solutions such as big data, advanced data analytics, cybersecurity, IoT, robotic workforce and artificial intelligence and support the expansion of the sustainable product
and service portfolio. SabancıDx meets all IT needs in line with the future goals of medium-sized and large companies, ranging from business consultancy to corporate-specific applications,
from operation to technical services, and from hardware to software. The DnA Platform of SabancıDx, which includes the employees of the companies under Sabancı Holding who work in
the field of advanced data analytics, has brought together 155 analytics projects. With the contribution of the DnA Platform to the productivity, profitability and the product quality of the
companies, Enerjisa Üretim A.Ş. focused its efforts on activities of researching hydrogen technologies, establishing a pilot electrolysis facility and conducting feasibility studies with
domestic universities have continued increasingly in 2021. Other Group companies also increased their efforts to develop or use new technologies in their operations.

Legal Relevant,

This risk type includes legal penalties, reputation loss or material damage that may arise from the failure to comply with or the violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations, sanctions,
codes of ethics or internal policies and directives. To support Group subsidiaries in efficiently managing compliance risks within the determined framework, instructional activities are carried
out by the Holding’s Legal, Risk and Compliance Group. At Sabancı Holding, we believe companies must go beyond compliance with the legislation and address health and safety, the
environment and human rights issues on a broader scale to comply with differing ethical expectations. Inability to meet such expectations would create loss of social license to operate,
reputation, investors, market share and customers beyond legal penalties. In line with this vision, Sabancı Group sets environmental standards beyond legal obligations, monitors its
performance in line with its targets and takes measures for improvement. To support Group companies in efficiently managing compliance risks within the determined framework,
instructional activities are carried out by the Holding’s Legal, Risk and Compliance Group.

Market Relevant,
always
included

Market risks are considered under transition risks that refer to changes in strategies, policies or investments to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to a lower carbon
economy. The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on minimizing the effects of the unpredictability of financial markets and their possible adverse effects on the Group’s
financial performance. The Group uses financial derivative instruments in order to hedge from various risks. Financial risk management is carried out within the context of policies approved
by their Board of Directors for each Group company. Of particular relevance to market related risks on climate change, the Group is proactively working to align with green transition making
use of technology, digitalization and innovation in its operations and financial decisions. The Group is also closely monitoring the developments in the field of sustainable finance and
enhancing its capacity to mitigate the risk of failure to access sustainable finance and to comply with the new standards that align the financial system with green transition. For instance,
while Akbank commits to provide sustainable loan financing of TL 200 billion and to increase the sustainable investment funds to TL 15 billion by 2030, the sustainable financing amounted
to TL 27 billion in 2021 according to unconsolidated management reporting. Aksigorta, the insurance company, launched two SDG linked product in 2021 and Agesa established
Sustainability Equity Pension Investment Fund in 2021. In the case of tire manufacturing, there is a risk of losing competitiveness and experiencing a drop in market share in case of delay
in developing and providing tires, which can meet customer demands on adapting to changing climate conditions or to other climate-related issues. Consequently, our Group company
Brisa aims to meet the growing demand for fuel-efficient tire and re-tread tire.

Reputation Relevant,
always
included

Sabancı Group sets environmental standards beyond legal obligations, monitors its performance in line with its targets and takes measures for improvement. For instance, in response to
climate emergency, Sabancı Group has taken a proactive approach and set itself a Group-wide net zero emissions target by 2050 at the latest. With this goal, together with the
implementation of its Sustainability Roadmap which includes a wide range of measures on the management of climate-related risks and opportunities, Sabancı Group plans to stay ahead
of such developments and mitigate potential risks associated to those that are reputational. As an example from our Group companies, in 2021, Enerjisa Enerji conducted a series of
climate-related videos and commercials to increase the awareness in Turkey on pollution and global warming, with the message that “no one can do everything, but everybody can do
something – join us in the combat to protect our planet for the generations to come”. The company was also recognized as a global thought leader by CBS that did extensive profiling on
Enerjisa Enerij’s management related to its future strategy, on green energy transition.

Acute
physical

Relevant,
always
included

Physical risks are diverse and are predominantly global risks. These include acute risks such as wildfires, hails, hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic risks such as extreme heat,
epidemics, pandemics, drought and access to water. Such risks are clustered under 'operational risks' and may lead to financial losses in case of infrastructure damage, service
interruption, increased operational expenses and the like. Management of acute physical risks vary among our Group companies given the nature of this risk and sectors that we operate
in. As an example to our Group companies, Enerjisa Enerji assesses the likelihood and impacts of acute physical risks such as storms, heavy snow falls, floods and wildfires. Based on
historical observations and trend analyses, the frequency of storms and other severe event-driven weather impacts are modelled and concluded to have an increasing impact on business.
The overhead lines are more exposed to the impacts of natural disasters compared to underground lines. To mitigate the impacts, the ratio of underground lines are increased from 19% in
2015 to 26% in 2021 in distribution regions. Heavy snowfalls and intense storm inhibits the repair fleet to reach the infrastructure causing the power interruption and thus increasing the
duration of blackouts. The risk is identified in the company’s risk register. Enerjisa Enerji has also developed a mitigation action, that transforms the tires of the maintenance fleet vehicles
to continuous tracks (like tanks) which increases the ability to reach the sites with unfavourable weather conditions. For direct operations, any extreme weather event such as extreme
drought will result in water stress or scarcity which bears a risk for some of Group companies like Brisa. There is a risk of disruption in supply chains caused by extreme weather events in
different regions (regions where para rubber tree grows for Brisa case). Like Brisa, many Group companies are developing supplier diversity plans in line with the strategy to prioritize local
suppliers and decreasing Scope 3 emissions as well as business continuity plans.

Chronic
physical

Physical risks are diverse and are predominantly global risks. These include acute risks such as wildfires, hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic risks such as extreme heat, epidemics,
pandemics, drought and access to water. Such risks are clustered under 'operational risks' and may lead to financial losses in case of infrastructure damage, service interruption,
increased operational expenses and the like. Management of chronic physical risks vary among our Group companies given the nature of this risk and sectors that we operate in. As an
example to our Group companies, Brisa's Izmit Production Facility is considered as being exposed to chronic physical risks as it is located in the flood plain of Akarca River and has
previously experienced flood related problems. The hydro-power plants are the ones most exposed to the changes in climate patterns. As per IPCC 5th assessment report rains will
decrease all over Turkey with medium confidence. It may cause generation loss due to decreased inflow to our hydro power plants. 43.60% of Enerjisa Uretim‘s installed capacity consists
of renewable sources (in which 37.50% hydro and 6.1% wind&solar) in 2021. The company currently has 1.35 GW of hydroelectric installed capacity. Enerjisa Üretim maps the transition to
green and low carbon energy by using different input parameters for scenario development with geographic, social & economic factors. The drought that hit the country in 2021 had a
major impact on the generation of hydro power generation of Enerjisa Üretim hydro plants. As a result of real-time monitoring, an early warning system has been established against
meteorological and hydrological risks that may occur in Enerjisa Üretim basins. On the other hand, water scarcity is taken into account as a chronic physical risk to Group’s building
material companies because of the vital role of water availability in cement/concrete production. Çimsa also conducts R&D activities for low water consuming products and looks for
decreasing the water footprint in its processes. In this regard, Çimsa strictly applies ISO 14046 - Water Management Standard in all manufacturing facilities and follows water consumption
rates to reduce water consumption levels.

Risk Management: Sabancı Holding and Group companies use the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system. During the
assessment process, the risks are categorized based on their nature under four clusters, i.e. financial, strategic (incl.
reputational and sustainability risks), operational and compliance. Each cluster is then rated based on parameters such as
'impact', 'likelihood', 'vulnerability' and 'speed of onset'.* The 'impact' is determined based on multiple dimensions such as
financial, operational, legal, reputational, H&S, human resources and environmental impact. Holding EDRC convenes at least 6
times a year and monitors the risks by considering their final risk scores and categories. Upon the suggestion of the EDRC,
Holding BoD decides on the mitigation plans on risks that are deemed as high or critical. In principle, all mitigation actions are
planned by the risk supervisors or department heads and assigned to a risk owner. Consequently, the action plan is conducted
by the risk owner. The Holding's related risk owner and risk supervisor as well as the Holding risk management teams re-
evaluate the residual risk level following the completion of mitigation actions. The Holding offers guidance for the Group
companies to be prepared for these risks and take precautions in their business models against any potential impact. Definition
of substantive financial impact** (2021): As per the financial impact, the threshold for the highest risk level is > TL 315 million
Definition of substantive strategic impact (2021): If the cluster of a risk is identified as 'strategic' AND the risk is rated as High or
Critical* on the basis of inherent risks; then it is deemed to pose high strategic risks and prioritized to be reported to the EDRC.
*Following the calculation of final score based on impact, likelihood, vulnerability, speed of onset, the risks are categorized
according to the following classification: If the final score is: · equals and higher than 3 than the risk is categories as “Critical”, ·
equals to 2.6 and between 2.6 and 3 than the risk is categories as “High”, · equals to 2 and between 2 and 2.6 than the risk is
categories as “Medium”, · equals and lower than 2 than the risk is categories as “Low”. ** Financial impact scores are as
follows: 1- No loss 2- Up to TL 90 million 3- 90 million TL up to TL 175 million 4- 175 million TL up to TL 315 million 5- More
than TL 315 million. The EDRC convened 6 times in 2021 and submitted risk assessments to the attention of the Board of
Directors. Strategic Portfolio Management: As a Holding company, the most material part of our value chain in terms of
environmental impact is our investments, i.e. the companies that we invest in our portfolio. Therefore, we pioneer and lead the
sectors that we operate in via (1) our 5-year Strategic Plan, where "pioneering in sustainability" is among the five strategic
directions and is part of our "Purpose" as the Group, (2) our Sustainability Roadmap, which is implemented by the entire Group,
(3) performance management in which sustainability is embedded at a rate of 10% in senior management performance goals ,
(4) our asset allocation strategy in which sustainability is among the key drivers. We make sure we capture the opportunities
and mitigate the risks through these 4 pillars in addition to our ERM system.

Sabancı Group acknowledges sustainability as fundamental principle in its investment and divestment decisions. In 2021, the Group further enhanced its strategic focus to
accelerate its growth and transformation towards a sustainable future. Every industry in which we operate comes with inherent risks and opportunities in terms of the
climate emergency. We adopt the integrated management of portfolio risks for the operations of Sabancı Holding and Group companies and make projections regarding the
impacts of the relevant risks. In the fight against the climate emergency, we focus on directly reducing GHG emissions, developing technologies that will support a
sustainable future, and investing in products and services that will promote these technologies. We also take into consideration physical risks our facilities and value chain
can face (employees, suppliers, etc.) and take actions accordingly. The Group set a target to be Net Zero by 2050 and all Group Companies focused their efforts to
decrease their energy use, emissions and started to prepare their transition plans. In 2021, Sabancı Holding also developed a Group wide Responsible Investment and Due
Diligence Policy to guide the capital allocation decisions of Sabancı Holding and to ensure the sustainability of the Group’s value chain. The Policy regulates the minimum
standards on the following subjects that will form the basis of the business areas in which the Holding operates and the value chains of the Group companies: ●
Environmental ● Social ● Ethics ● Governance ● Human rights The Policy aims to determine the basic principles for the above-listed issues in the investment portfolio of
the Holding, based on national and international standards and good practices, and to support the management of risks associated to these issues. As a conglomerate one
of the duties of Sabancı Holding is to guide the Group Companies on global trends as well as learning from them. It would be only possible if there is a share of knowledge,
know-how between the companies. The interaction is not just between Sabancı Holding and the Group companies bilaterally but as a whole and a synergy is created
between companies towards the same goals.

Sectoral and regional context for Holding companies operating in Turkey: As of today, the only legal obligation directly related to GHG emissions in Turkey is the Regulation
on Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of GHG Emissions, which is in force since 2015 and applies to emission intensive sectors. The MRV regulation is expected
to form the basis for a future legally-binding carbon pricing mechanism which has the potential to impact Sabancı Group companies in various ways, such as reduced
revenues in energy intensive sectors in case of exceeding GHG thresholds/allocation. Compliance to MRV law and increasing the internal capacity to monitor and manage
GHG emissions is crucial for Sabancı Group in terms of ability to adapt future obligations. Non-compliance to climate-related regulations may ultimately result in investor
exit from Sabancı Holding shares alongside with other impacts such as reputational impacts and legal penalties.

In order to mitigate the risk of non-compliance, Sabancı Group takes a proactive approach in aligning with the developments on GHG-related regulations, through (1)
undertaking emission reduction initiatives with the ultimate goal of becoming net zero emissions by 2050, (2) increasing its internal capacity to monitor and manage GHG
emissions with the use of digitalization and technology where appropriate & feasible and (3) conducting R&D programs on efficient technologies. In 2021, environmental
expenditures related to legal compliance has been nearly TL 20 million across all the Group companies (non-bank expenditures).

model as they will help us seize the opportunities in this field and implement leading practices. In order to gain early access to technological innovations and developments,
as well as to create agile and technology-based growth platforms, we established a corporate venture capital fund, namely 'Sabancı Ventures', through which we focus on
investments in areas such as IoT (Internet of Things), artificial intelligence, new material technologies, sustainability, energy, mobility, and cyber security. On the other

IEA NZE 2050 Scenario presents the type of transformation needed to achieve 2050 Net-Zero targets. As Sabancı Group has already committed publicly to reach
Net Zero by 2050, this scenario is selected to assess the transitional risks and opportunities. Time horizon: The analysis was conducted for medium to long time
horizons, to be able to grasp the possible transitional impacts of climate change on our operations. This scenario projects a major shift in the transport industry, using
electric vehicles and other technologies like hydrogen power cells. Fuel efficiency becomes a major issue which would also require more technological tires with even
lower rolling resistance. Carbon taxes and emission trading systems will be much more used globally, which means operational expenses will increase. EU has
already announced the inclusion of Maritime emissions in EU-ETS. Our group companies Brisa and Kordsa use this scenario for areas where their facilities are
located as well as where their customers are. (Our answers are business division or company specific; since Sabancı Group operates in many diverse sectors, in

based on the following assumptions to understand the potential financial impact of ETS on different sectors in Turkey. The model were based on the following scope
and assumptions (1) only the share of production exported to EU countries were affected; (2) 100% of the production in all emission-intensive sectors were affected
regardless of their exports to EU, assuming that Turkey becomes part of a wider carbon-tax/ETS mechanism, (3) Both scenarios cover Turkey operations.

The analyses extend to 2030 and then to 2050 by the assessment of long-term developments in energy sector. The strategic planning can be re-positioned due to
market developments over the next consecutive five years. Sabancı Group's goal to reach the net zero emission by 2050, will change the businesses direction much
earlier. Because it will require innovation with the rapid deployment of best available technologies economically achievable. The scenario analysis are studied by
various business departments. The biggest innovation opportunities for Enerjisa Üretim concern, hydrogen electrolysis, advanced batteries and carbon capture and
storage. In our pathway these technology areas will make real contributions to the reduction of CO2 emissions, between 2030 and 2050. Our first priority is to
increase the share of renewable power plants in our portfolio. We adapt new technologies that will reduce emissions in the coal power plant in the short term. In
addition, the hybrid system applications in thermal power plants have also been accelerated in 2020. In Tufanbeyli Coal Power Plant; as a result of the improvement
works carried out in the units, the PFC holding capability ratio was increased from 60% to 98%. With the hybrid power plant investments made in 2020, the
importance given to renewable power plants is supported. Test studies for wave and wind energy have also been initiated at the Bandırma Energy Base. Within the
scope of the Bandırma Energy Base activities, innovative project studies have been initiated in order to follow the advancing technology and to ensure the application
of appropriate technologies in our power plants within the framework of sustainability. In this framework, it is aimed that the activities of researching hydrogen

Yes Sabancı Group considers sustainability as an integral part of its mission and strategy. In 2020, we changed our Group’s purpose to “We unite Turkey and the World for a sustainable life
with leading enterprises”. Accordingly, as Sabancı Group, we see sustainability as a goal, not a tool. In addition to this, we have prepared a 5-year strategy plan in which we have
introduced 5 strategic directions that we believe will lead us to our Group’s purpose: Provide wider customer experience, Transform into an agile/global footprint, Pioneer in
sustainability, Lead in digital & material technologies, Adapt to Future of Work. We steadily support and strengthen these 5 strategic directions with our investments in technology and
digital. Within the scope of these 5 strategic directions, we shape our business areas and future objectives on the basis of the sustainable growth. We position sustainable business
areas such as e-mobility, advanced material technologies, renewable energy generation in our core business lines such as energy, industry and financial services as the next generation
growth area of Sabancı Group. Accordingly, one of the key drivers of our asset allocation strategy is ESG performance. We also developed our Sustainability Roadmap which applies
across all the Group companies for a 5 years time horizon with actions distributed to different time-scales, i.e. <12 months, 1-3 years, >3 years. The Roadmap is created (1) to better
identify climate-related opportunities and risks and (2) to address them in all our business lines. In line with that, in order to determine the Group's position in terms of seizing climate-
related opportunities, we conducted a group-wide study to understand key parameters of performance such as the share of sustainability-oriented R&D and the share of revenues from
products and services that contribute SDGs. For instance, 51% of our all R&D investments during the reporting period was sustainability oriented. Also, we created a sustainable product
& services taxonomy and identified that TL 7.7 billion of our combined net sales revenues during the reporting year were related to products and services that contribute SDGs. TL 2.6
billion is related with mitigation while TL 3.0 billion is related with transition. Sustainable products and services account for 5% of the total revenue.

technology and digital. As Sabancı Group, we divide our sustainability-related investments and products & services into categories such as (1) mitigation, (2) transition, (3) enablers and
(4) positive social impact. The 3rd category called 'enablers' cover products and services that create a positive environmental impact on customer operations or serve as inputs to
sustainable industries, i.e. downstream of our value chain. On top of that, our Roadmap includes actions to better identify and manage the impact of our supply chain. One of the Group
company Enerjisa, expects its suppliers to meet minimum standards of good ESG performance, carefully select the business partners and monitor their compliance with its principles
and policies. The company is willing to work with our suppliers to ensure that they comply with “Enerjisa Supplier Compliance Declaration” and their Environmental Policy, which
includes combatting climate change and reducing environmental impacts. Another Group Company Kordsa prepared a Kralij Matrix through which assess suppliers with purchasing
volume over 500,000 USD and these suppliers are classified using this matrix. In 2021 suppliers from various sectors (i.e. raw materials, service, transport, energy, packaging) were
included in this assessment. They assess these suppliers on a global scale based on economic, social and environmental aspects such as energy and emissions management. The
magnitude of this strategic impact is considered to be high as sustainable supply chain is a critical element of our business success.

Investment

Yes Within the scope of our 5 strategic directions, we shape our business areas and future objectives on the basis of the sustainable growth. We position sustainable business areas such
as e-mobility, advanced material technologies, renewable energy generation in our core business lines such as energy, industry and financial services as the next generation growth
area of Sabancı Group. Accordingly, one of the key drivers of our asset allocation strategy is ESG performance. We also developed our Sustainability Roadmap which applies across all
the Group companies for a 5 years time horizon with actions distributed to different time-scales, i.e. <12 months, 1-3 years, >3 years. The Roadmap is created (1) to better identify
climate-related opportunities and risks and (2) to address them in all our business lines. In line with that, in order to determine the Group's position in terms of seizing climate-related
opportunities, we conducted a group-wide study to understand key parameters of performance such as the share of sustainability-oriented R&D and the share of revenues from
products and services that contribute SDGs. For instance 51% of our all R&D investments during the reporting period was sustainability oriented. Also, we established a corporate
venture capital fund, i.e. Sabancı Ventures (fund size USD 30 million), to gain early access to technological innovations and developments, as well as to create agile and technology-
based growth platforms. We focus on investments in areas such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, new material technologies, sustainability, energy, mobility, and cyber
security. All of our Group Companies have accelerated their efforts on innovation. For instance; 60% of the R&D and innovation expenditures of Brisa are related to SDGs.

in our own operations and our customers’ operations. We believe our focus on circular economy practices bring competitive advantage not only in terms of resilience to supply chain
challenges, but also in terms of our commitment to net zero and meeting customer expectations. The environmental expenditures related to our existing operations were TL 34 million
during the reporting year. On the other hand, environmental investments were TL 476 million across all Sabancı Group operations.

Capital Allocation: At the Holding level, it affects our capital allocation decisions as one of the key drivers of our strategy is ESG performance, including climate-related risks and opportunities. In
line with that, in our 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, we defined our growth areas in sustainable businesses such as e-mobility, renewable energy and advanced material technologies, and our capital
allocation is determined accordingly. This approach is also embedded in investment decisions of our Group companies. For instance, Akbank commits to provide sustainable loan financing of TL
200 billion (in 2021 realized TL 27 billiion) and to increase the sustainable investment funds to TL15 billion by 2030. Akbank has introduced Green Foreign Trade, Transition to Low Carbon
Economy and Roof Solar Investment Credits for transition to low carbon economy. In the long term (2021-2050), we also set ourselves a Group-wide Net Zero Emissions and Zero Waste goals.
Therefore, our capital allocation decisions will continue to focus on ESG performance, especially to GHG-intensity, in the long run (2021-2050). CAPEX: At the Group level, in addition to KPIs to
monitor progress on long-term goals such as GHG intensity and the rate of waste recovery, we monitor CAPEX and OPEX under (1) sustainable investments in our growth areas,(including
mitigation, transition and enabler investments) (2) environmental expenditures and (3) sustainability-related R&D expenditures. During the reporting year, the total amount of all three categories
were TL 662 million. Revenues: On top of that, our combined total net sales revenues from products and services that contribute to SDGs have been TL 7.7 billion during the reporting year
(non-bank figures). Direct & Indirect costs: Due to investments related with our circular economy and low carbon technology investments we have saved nearly TL 116 million in 2021; utilizing
alternative fuels, energy efficiency measures, using less or alternative resources leads to increase in profit. Access to capital: Integration of climate-related risks and opportunities into business
brings advantage to different Group companies in terms of diversifying sources of finance, ensuring lower cost of debt (green loans, similar funding opportunities like Horizon Europe) and lower
cost of capital.

This target is related Group company Kordsa. This is a new target which replaces our previously announced Scope 3 target. As we have extended the scope of our scope 3
inventory we have also stopped monitoring the previous year's target. This target covers all GHG emissions from fuel and energy related activities and processing of sold
products. This target will be included in our SBTi submission. We are also working on a supplier engagement target for our Category 1 emissions from purchased goods
and services.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Category 3 emissions will be automatically reduced when we reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. Our clients are tire companies who are constantly working
on reducing their GHG emissions, their efforts will help reduce our GHG emissions as well. We are also working on a roadmap to further reduce these GHG emissions.

This target covers 100% of Brisa's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. The target was set in 2020, and aim to achieve 56% reduction from a 2020 base year until 2030.
This is equal to 5.6% annual linear reduction. In 2021 we have exceeded this linear reduction target and reduced our GHG emissions by 9.68%. This target was submitted
to and approved by SBTi. However, during the submission process, the Scope 2 accounting method was accidentally submitted as Location-based. We are currently
revising this target as market-based as we are planning to achieve some of this target using renewable energy attribute certificates. Bridgestone set a new Mid-term
Targets; Milestone 2030. Focused target: Reduce our absolute CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 30% by 2023 and aspire to reduce by 56% by 2030. Brisa has set
targets above Bridgestone’s global targets.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
We are planning to increase the share of renewable energy in our consumption. We will install our own 154 KV substation until the end of 2023. Between 2024 and 2029 we
have we have investment plans for Land and rooftop solar panels with a total capacity of 21.5 MW. Also an 8MW new cogen facility until 2030. We also plan to build a solar
based steam production facility in both of our plants until 2028. In 2021 we have exceeded this linear reduction target and reduced our GHG emissions by 9.68%. We
achieved this success through implementation of energy efficiency measures and purchasing of renewable energy attribute certificates.

88.21% of our base-year) was omitted from the scope of our target with the recommendation of SBTi as the use of tyres are part of indirect use phase emissions and is
optional to include in Scope 3 inventories. Therefore the given % and total values showing the target coverage in all Scope 3 categories are calculated using the Scope 3
emissions for all the non-optional Scope 3 categories.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
To reduce Scope 3 Category 4 emissions we have ongoing localization projects. To reduce Scope 3 Category 14 GHG emissions from franchises we have a plan to install
solar panels on 1 of the 18 locations. Scope 3 Category 3 emissions from fuel and energy related activities will be reduced via renewable investments planned which will
also reduce our Scope 2 GHG emissions. We are still working on the roadmap for reduction of our Category 1 GHG emissions

Sabancı Group, which Çimsa is a member of, has committed to expanding its circular business model practices on an end-to-end basis and reaching “Net Zero” greenhouse
gas emissions by 2050. This target covers all our Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. The baseline year for Scope 3 is defined as 2021 which is the first year the
Scope 3 emissions were verified by an independent third party. The following categories are calculated under Scope 3 emissions: Purchased goods and services, Fuel-
and-energy-related activities, Upstream transportation and distribution, and Downstream transportation and distribution.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Çimsa considers the management of Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions as a whole throughout the value chain as its main strategy. The
methodology developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) is used to
calculate our greenhouse gas emissions from production processes. While planning our carbon neutral journey, we determine the main levers at our disposal to cut all
types of emissions and we create our investment and action plans according to their potential to contribute to our targets. Alternative Fuel and Raw Materials: Çimsa
contributes to its environmental and carbon neutral targets by prioritizing the use of alternative fuels and alternative raw materials in its production processes. By replacing
carbon-intensive fuels with carbon-free biomass and non-fossil fuels, it also supports the waste management processes of various industries and reduces the environmental
impact of the waste. The rate of alternative fuel use at Çimsa reached 12.4% in 2021, marking an increase of 71% compared to the previous year. Energy Management and
Use of Green Energy: Increasing energy efficiency in production processes and reducing energy consumption is an area open to continuous improvement. Çimsa closely
follows technological developments in this regard. In 2021, energy efficiency projects brought savings of 34,764 TJ of thermal energy and 4,126 MWh of electricity for
Çimsa. Work on Decarbonized Raw Materials: One of the important issues in our journey to being carbon neutral is the reduction of CO2 emissions generated during
calcination, by using decarbonized raw materials. Our plan includes the testing of alternative raw materials through our raw material supply network along with R&D
activities. Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) Technologies: It is thought that carbon capture, use and storage technologies will reach a share of 30-50% in
the process of reaching the carbon neutral target. With the contribution of the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), which we are a member of, and Çimsa’s
other collaborations, we follow CCUS technologies and start-up projects around the world. We are working on joint projects within the Sabancı Group. Our R&D Unit
develops designs in our products which will allow carbon storage, by working on alternatives for capturing carbon dioxide in concrete with the “C-World” project.

Enerjisa Enerji targets to reduce the impacts from theft/loss emissions. Our investment program for improving the reliability and modernization of our grid network directly
impacts our Scope 2 emissions as we are responsible for emissions of grid losses as a distribution company. Previously, we have set our base emission figure based on
our financial reporting numbers, but we assessed setting the targets in line with EMRA (the regulator) reporting would be a better indicator as the actual EMRA numbers
sets a base for our long term planning. Therefore, we now set our target based on our 2021 EMRA reporting. We expect a 12% reduction in intensity of our emissions due
to the losses and theft in our power distribution by the end of our tariff period in 2025 compared to 2021.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Enerjisa Enerji invests in its grid to deal with theft and loss. Enerjisa utilizes significant amount of its CAPEX on monitoring and controlling systems such as SCADA and

Enerjisa Enerji has set a target to use 100% renewable electricity in its operations. This target was set in 2019 and first achieved in 2020. As part of our goal to reduce
energy indirect Scope 2 emissions, we procured 96.5% of electricity consumption from green energy for all Enerjisa through renewable energy certificates (I-REC) in 2021.
Total of 176 service buildings in the Başkent, İstanbul Anadolu Yakası and Toroslar regions now also use green energy via renewable energy certifications. Due to
unprecedented natural disasters in 2021, which interrupted the power supplies of some villages, Enerjisa had to use electricity that was not in its IREC scope in several
temporary office/mobilization areas established in those locations. Thus, Enerjisa’s target on achieving 100% renewable energy couldn’t be fully accomplished. Enerjisa
Enerji will continue to use 100% green energy in the future for its electricity consumption.

Dedicated budget for
low-carbon product
R&D

As Sabancı Group, we develop new products and services that reduce resource use and GHG emissions, enable transition to more sustainable technologies, facilitate the spread of these
technologies, and create a positive social impact. The ratio of sustainability-focused R&D expenditures across all Sabancı Group companies was 51% in 2020. As an example from our
Group companies, through Enerjisa Enerji’s Ivme Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program, Enerjisa R&D Department partner with start-ups and independent innovators in developing low-
carbon technologies and products. We dedicated TL 3 million CAPEX for R&D projects in 2021, and we forecast TL 17 million CAPEX until 2025. We currently provide 13 low carbon
services through Müşteri Çözümleri and we aim to improve in mid-term future.

Employee engagement In 2021, a total of 18,476 sustainability training hours were delivered. As an example, to such trainings, we implemented the X-TEND Online Development Program to analyse potential
scenarios and prepare the business and all Group employees both for today and the future. Within the scope of X-TEND, all employees received training for an hour under many subjects
including The Pandemic’s Impact on Sustainability. As an example to our Group companies, Enerjisa Enerji have a Sustainability section in our mobile application for employees (IKON), in
which sustainability ideas from our employees are collected. We use awareness boosting posters for our employees in the bathrooms, around light switches, trashcans etc. to encourage
them for saving energy. We design our advertisements highlighting climate change and share it with our employees before presenting it to the public. We also aim to increase coverage
Eşarj electric vehicle charging stations in our office locations which also increases employee motivation, awareness and therefore engagement in emission reduction activities.

Dedicated budget for
other emissions
reduction activities

We monitor sustainability investments in the following 3 categories: Mitigation Investments: Investments that reduce direct resource use or carbon emissions. The investment amount for
this area is approximately TL 149 million across all companies at Sabancı Group. Transition Investments: It refers to investments in products and services that can be considered as a
transition to more sustainable technologies, such as cement and rubber products produced using alternative raw materials and/or fuels. The investment amount for this area is
approximately TL 72 million across all companies at Sabancı Group. Enabler Investments: Refers to products that are not considered as direct resource/carbon emission reduction
activities, but that facilitate the dissemination of related technologies. The investment amount for this area is approximately TL 255 million across all companies at Sabancı Group. On top
of these, Sabancı Group companies implemented emission reduction programs that resulted in GHG savings of 120.168 tCO2e in 2021.

Compliance with
regulatory
requirements/standards

We conduct our operations in accordance with international standards such as the ISO14001:2015 Environmental Management System. We define our annual energy and natural source
consumption reduction targets based on the location-specific ISO 14001 Environmental Management System by effectively monitoring the electricity, water and fuel consumption in the
buildings. We have 100% coverage for ISO14001 certification at all Enerjisa Enerji locations. In 2021, Sabancı Group companies made an environmental expenditure of approximately TL
34 million. 42% of this amount is beyond legal compliance.

Dedicated budget for
energy efficiency

In 2021, Sabancı Group companies implemented energy efficiency programs which resulted in approximately 4.567 MWh of energy savings.

Internal
incentives/recognition
programs

Sabancı Holding holds Sabancı Golden Collar Awards, one of the most critical components of Recognition and Appreciation systems, with live broadcast to all Group companies. For
instance in 2021, a total of 153 projects competed in the Sabancı of New Generation: Innovation, Customer Experience, Lean Transformation & Continuous Development and
Digitalization. Best practices were rewarded with the votes of Group employees. In 2021, one of the categories is directly related to sustainability.

We consider single use plastic consumption and water use as mainstream parameters for the environmental performance of our Group companies (i.e. investments) which
is relatively feasible to track compared to other indirect emission sources. For that reason, we collect water and plastic data from all Group companies (i.e. Sabancı Holding
and its 13 group companies) and receive verification from a third party. The verified amount of single use plastic consumption in 2020 was 3,420 tons which equals to
10,657.7 tCO2e (DEFRA 2020 - Primary plastic use emission factor multiplied by weight of plastic). The verified amount of water use in 2020 is 10,051,448 m3 of water
which equals to 3,457.7 tCO2e (DEFRA 2020 - Tap water use emission factor multiplied by volume of water used). The sum of these 2 emission sources in this category is
14115.42 tCO2e. In 2021, the consumption of single-use plastics in 2021 is 2,724 tonnes, which equals 8,489.8 tCO2e (DEFRA 2021 - Primary plastic use emission factor
times the weight of the plastic). The amount of water usage confirmed in 2021 is 10.585.542,27 m3 of water. Equivalent to 1,577.2 tCO2e (DEFRA 2021 - Tap water use
emission factor times the volume of water used). The sum of these 2 emission sources in this category is 10,067.1 tCO2e. Compared to 2020, the total emission value
decreased by 28.7%. Last year, the amount of plastic tons was entered incorrectly. It has been revised this year and compared with the correct value.

Please explain
We consider waste generation as a mainstream parameter for the environmental performance of our Group companies (i.e. investees) which is relatively feasible to track
compared to other indirect emission sources. In the calculation of emissions arising from waste generation, recycling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste
as well as wastewater treatment are taken into account. The total Group-wide amount of non-hazardous and hazardous waste are 35,035 and 8,214 tons, respectively.
GHG emissions originating from our non-hazardous and hazardous waste are calculated as 3,836 and 746 tCO2e, respectively. In addition to those, our emissions
resulting from waste water is calculated as 1.605 tCO2e. The sum of emissions in this category is 6,187 tCO2e. As part of our circular economy efforts, the rate of water
we recovered/reused in 2021 was 22%, while the rate of waste we recycled/reused/recovered was 79%. Compared to 2020, the total emission value decreased by 19%.

We consider employee commuting as an important indicator of Scope 3 emissions within our Group companies (i.e. investees) which is relatively feasible to track compared
to other indirect emission sources. Among all companies in the Sabancı Group, we provide employee commuting for the wellbeing of our employees and also to decrease
the overall GHG emissions according to travel by car to business facilities. The amount of emissions originating from employee commuting (personnel service use by
employees) have been covered. In 2021, a total distance of 13,782,929 km is travelled in terms of employee commuting. The sum of emissions in business travel is
13567.85 tons of CO2e. Compared to 2020, the total emission value decreased by 76.08%.

Reason for change
In 2021, our Scope 1 + 2 emissions are 22,799,846 tCO2e and net sales revenues were 152,112,502,913 TL. As a result, our Scope 1 + 2 emissions per TL revenue
intensity was 0.000150 tCO2e/TL. In 2020 our scope1+2 emissions are 21,320,561 tCO2e and our combined net sales revenues were 103,532,685,696 TL. As a result, our
Scope 1 + 2 emissions per TL revenue intensity was 0.0002059 tCO2e/TL. This means a decrease of 27.2 % in this metric, which is due to increase in the net sales
revenues by 46.92 % while increase in the scope 1+2 emissions by 6.93 %. Overall, as the increase in the net sales revenue is higher than the increase in GHG emissions,
emissions/revenue figure has decreased.

Reason for change
In 2021, our Scope 1 + 2 emissions are 22,799,846 tCO2e and the number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) employee was 47,764. As a result, our Scope 1 + 2 emissions per
FTE employee intensity in 2021 is 477.344 tCO2e/FTE employee. In 2020, our Scope 1 + 2 emissions are 21,320,561 tCO2e and the number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE)
employee was 46,635. As a result, our Scope 1 + 2 emissions per FTE employee intensity in 2020 is 457.179 tCO2e/FTE employee. This means an increase of 4.41 % in
this metric, which is mainly due to the increased Scope 1 emissions in our building materials and energy group because of the change in production amount.

90785 Decreased 0.43 Our previous year gross Scope1&2 emissions are 21,320,561 tCO2e. Sabancı Group increased the amount of renewable energy usage in 2021 compared to
2020 from 164,781 MWh to 355,920 MWh. In other words, renewable energy usage increased by 116%, i.e. 191,139 MWh. In 2021, we purchased 191,795
MWh of renewable energy which resulted in a 87,458 tCO2e, generated 49,976 MWh of renewable electricity which equals to 22,789 tCO2e, and we harvested
114,148 MWh of waste heat which equals to 27,194 tCO2e. In 2020, we purchased renewable electricity which equals to 12,311 tCO2e reduction, generated
6,982 MWh renewable energy which equals 3,183 tCO2e and 130,801 MWh used waste heat which equals to 31,162 tCO2e. The GHG emissions change due
to usage of renewable electricity purchase, generation and waste heat = (87,458+22,789+27,194) - (12,311+3,183+31,162) = 90,785 tCO2e. The decrease of

(C11.1) Are any of your operations or activities regulated by a carbon pricing system (i.e. ETS, Cap & Trade or Carbon Tax)?
No, but we anticipate being regulated in the next three years

C11.1d

CDP Page  of 7863



(C11.1d) What is your strategy for complying with the systems you are regulated by or anticipate being regulated by?

  

Turkey pursues to establish a regulated emission trading system similar to EU-ETS and has been developing and adapting its regulatory framework towards adoption of an
Emission Trading System. Within 2012 Climate Change Department of the MoECCC has published the regulation on the Monitoring of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which is
very similar to EU-ETS MRV (Monitoring Report and Verification) system. Since 2018, more than 600 facilites representing 47% of Turkey’s total greenhouse gas emissions
submit their emission reports periodically to the MoECC, covering activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels, oil refining, iron and steel, ferrous and non-ferrous metal
production, primary aluminum production, mining industry, pulp and paper production, chemical industry and acid production. 

Within the scope of the process accelerated by Turkey’s becoming a party to the Paris Agreement as of October 6, 2021, the 2053 net zero emission target has been set. It is
of great importance that the carbon pricing implementation, which is an important instrument in greenhouse gas reduction and implemented in many countries around the
world, will be developed as a continuation of the preparatory activities carried out in our country regarding the matter by receiving the opinions and suggestions of all relevant
stakeholders. It is believed that the national emissions trading system, which will be designed in the light of the data in the infrastructure of the Monitoring, Reporting and
Verification (MRV) system, which has been maintained in our country since 2015, will be the most important part of the carbon pricing practice to be implemented in our
country.

In line with the Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanism to be initiated by the European Union by 2023, it is essential for Turkey to use appropriate carbon pricing instruments.
Among the actions within the scope of the EU Green Deal Action Plan, which was prepared on a national scale within the framework of the Presidential Circular No. 2021/15,
there are activities for Turkey’s transition to an appropriate carbon pricing mechanism and identifying our country's position on carbon pricing.

2022 has been a year with announced strong commitments towards establishment of a Turkish Emission Trading System. The Final Declaration of Climate Council 2022 (The
Climate Council is organized within the framework of the provisions of the Regulation on the Establishment of the Environment and Urbanization Council and Working Groups
and the Working Procedures and Principles, which entered into force once published in the Official Gazette dated 05/09/2012 and numbered 28402) concludes finalization of
Emission Trading System by 2024 (https://iklimsurasi.gov.tr/public/images/sonucbildirgesi.pdf). 

Sabancı Holding and its subsidiaries comply with the periodic monitoring reporting and verification obligations and is taking part and responsibility and involved and
contributed to the council process as part of the technical working groups and supports all activities towards establishment of a full trading system, which will help to reduce
carbon emissions within the holding group and nation-wide.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
86 % of Kordsa’s customers by sales volume are tire manufacturers with targets to reduce the rolling resistance of their products, which in turn will reduce the fossil fuel
consumption of vehicles and reduce their GHG emissions. Our products are one of the three main components of tires, and in order to reduce the rolling resistance of the
final product, our customers also need to have lighter fabrics in their tires. We constantly invest on R&D projects to contribute to the targets of our customers, with the aim
of developing products that will reduce the rolling resistance of the final product. Customer related Scope 3 emissions % are estimated according to share of tire-
reinforcement clients in our production volumes.

Impact of engagement, including measures of success
These engagement activities are seen as a major success, as we are able to reach our main tire customers and share the technologies and developments with them. We
are also receiving positive feedback from our customers regarding these innovation and R&D projects. Every year we run innovation meetings to discuss about emission
reduction technologies, with approximately % 86 of our customers; both tire manufacturers and composite customers.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
Enerjisa Enerji, one of Group companies is aware of our role in combating climate change, which is increasingly impacting our lives. The international and national
regulatory framework is also urging companies to take bold steps. Our goal is to decrease our direct and indirect GHG emissions in all processes. Hence, we track our
Scope 1-2-3 emissions and take actions to reduce our environmental impact. In addition to this, we are undertaking important steps in the procurement and sale of green
energy. In our retail business, electricity purchased and resold accounts for the largest share of our indirect emissions. Thus, we focus on reducing the carbon emissions
related with the electricity we buy and sell to our customers. We have started to use renewable energy in our direct operations and also to make Power Purchase
Agreements (PPAs) for direct renewable energy sourcing. In December 2020, for the first time, we signed a PPA in order to supply electricity directly from power plants that
generate electricity from renewable energy resources. As a result, we aim to provide green energy to our eligible customers. Additionally, our current PPA contracts are
only a year long. We are working on extending their horizon. We hope to attract more customers and direct more revenue to renewable energy investments by extending
the term of PPA contracts.

Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Enerjisa Enerji believes that renewable PPAs will be critical in supporting the shift from incentive based renewable investments to market driven renewable investments. In
2021, 962 GWh PPA were realized. We target to double the renewable PPA volume for electricity sold in liberalized market for 2022. Our reported customer related Scope
3 emissions constitute almost all of our Scope 3 emissions. In 2021, we target to secure volumes through PPAs for at least 3% of our liberalized sales for 2022. We are
currently planning the timeline for blockchain renewable energy certificates as a customer solution service.
