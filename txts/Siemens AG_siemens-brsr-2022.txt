Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 3Siemens Limited

Dear Readers, 

The world continues to change rapidly across multiple dimensions. We see megatrends such as climate 
change, glocalization, digitalization, demographic change, and urbanization requiring us to reassess 
established ways of doing things. At the same time, global unrest and disruptions may distract from 
tackling these megatrends with the required focus. We firmly believe that the answer to creating 
a sustainable future is technology. As an innovation leader focused on combining the real and the 
digital world, we are uniquely positioned to find solutions to these challenges and help drive the 
transformational needs of our times. 

Sustainability is at the heart of what we do at Siemens. We are a technology company with a portfolio  
designed to drive the digital and sustainable transformation of industry, infrastructure, energy and  
transportation. Through technology with purpose, we enable our customers and partners to accelerate 
their sustainable transformation and maximize contribution to planetary health. 

The Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) paves the way for companies in India 
towards greater ESG disclosures, while generating a positive impact on the established ways for doing 
business. Within the BRSR, we are disclosing not only the essential ‘own performance’ but also the 
performance of our ‘value chain’ across the leadership indicators of the BRSR. This is possible because 
we are committed to sustainability. This commitment is reflected in our DEGREE framework - a 360 
degree view of Siemens ESG priorities. DEGREE is based on six fields of action that drive sustainability – 
Decarbonization, Ethics, Governance, Resource efficiency, Equity, Employability. We are committed to 
decarbonization across our value chain. At Siemens, ethical business is non-negotiable. We have strong 
governance mechanisms in place and expect our partners to do business responsibly. We are conscious 
of the fact that resources on the planet are finite therefore we want to accelerate recycling and circular 
economy. Finally, it is people that make all the difference. We are very invested in our people and strive 
to ensure we have a diverse, equitable and resilient workforce to deliver on the challenges ahead of us. 

This is the decade of action and we are confident that through our people and partnerships we can 
multiply the impact of our solutions and pave way to a more resilient future: This is the time to step up 
and act.

  Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 

social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach 
to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format.

  Siemens AG globally undertook the materiality assessment in FY 2020-21. The assessment was based on 
external frameworks such as the UN Global Compact and the Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). 
The goal was to identify the key economic, ecological, and social topics for Siemens globally in accordance with 
the GRI Standards. To this end, relevant stakeholders were consulted, and the impact viewed from an outside-in 
perspective. inside-out impact (double materiality) were also considered. The exercise enabled us to prioritize the 
relevant sustainability topics and the same is listed in the table below:

 As a process to reclaim product Electrical and Electronic Waste (EEE) and plastic packaging for recycling the Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applied. Producer Responsible Organizations (PROs) are nominated for the collection of 
e-waste and plastic waste from customer and waste/s are recycled. Hazardous waste is sent either for incineration or 
to authorised recyclers depending on their nature. For example, paint, oil/varnish-soaked cotton waste, oil-soaked saw 
dust, oil filters are incinerated whereas batteries (pencil cell & lead acid batteries), non-ferrous scrap (insulated copper 
wire/Copper with PVC sheathing), used oil, etc are recycled. Some waste such as grinding sludge, asbestos is labelled 
appropriately and sent for landfill.

4.  Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.

 The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable for electronic waste and plastic waste generated by the 
Company. The waste is collected by the nominated PRO (Producer Responsible Organization) from the customer. The 
quarterly returns and annual returns are filed to CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board). 

 The waste collection is in line with the targets specified by CPCB in the authorisation granted to Siemens Ltd. Targets set 
by CPCB for EPR are met and reported to CPCB.

 b.  What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?

  As part of implementation of ISO standard, procedures for Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) have 
been established and implemented within the business units. HIRA is conducted for routine and non-routine 
activities. Work related hazards are identified by people involved in the operations, EHS officers and contractor 
representatives (wherever applicable). The identified hazards are recorded and control measures are discussed and 
defined as per hierarchy of controls. 

  The CAPA (Corrective And Preventive Action) tracker is implemented to proactively identify safety risks in high 
risk activities and implement engineering controls to mitigate the risks. A Cross Functional Team reviews high risk 
activity and implements engineering controls, as feasible to mitigate risks. Focused trainings are conducted on 
“Behavioral Based Safety” (BBS) to promote awareness amongst third party and contractor employees to adopt safe 
work practices. The outcome from the CAPA tracker are reviewed every month with Business Management.

 c.  Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)

  Yes, Siemens has established a robust system of reporting Unsafe Acts and Unsafe Conditions (UAUC), near misses 
and incident reporting. Workers are encouraged to report UAUC, near miss and incidents and to immediately 
remove themselves from such risks. UAUC are recorded in an EHS dashboard from project sites, factories and office 
locations. These are analysed as per Safety Essentials categories. Corrective and preventive actions are initiated to 
mitigate safety risks.

 d.  Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?

5.  Details on assessment of value chain partners: 
 New suppliers are required to undertake a Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessment (CRSA) as part of a binding 

qualification process, while existing suppliers are assessed every three years. The CRSA outlines what Sustainability 
means for Siemens. Based on an online questionnaire, Siemens decides if the partner fulfils the Siemens sustainability 
requirements. If not, the prospective supplier is required to set up development measures to be considered ‘Ready for 
Business’ (R4B).

 Apart from CRSA, External Sustainability Audits (ESA) intend to verify adherence to the requirements of the ‘Code 
of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers (based on UN global compact principles, ILO conventions, local law) and assess the 
sustainability performance of the supply chain. Siemens has appointed internationally recognized auditing companies 
which conduct on-site audits based on the universally valid principles of the Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers. The 
outcome is an in-depth assessment and report that enables Siemens and its suppliers to identify and manage potential 
sustainability risks.

 ESG risk assessment of downstream activities: Under the ESG Risk Framework adopted by Siemens in October 2020, 
the Company undertakes ESG risk assessment of opportunities that fall above a threshold as defined by individual 
businesses. Opportunities that fall in the criteria are assessed using the ESG Due Diligence tool. The opportunities’ risk 
assessment includes downstream counterparts assessment. The tool provides for mitigation measures that the Company 
is required to undertake before entering into a formal contract with the counterpart.

 Improvement measures agreed-upon with suppliers relate either to actual deviations from the Siemens Group Code 
of Conduct for Suppliers or to structural improvements in management systems and the lack of specific processes and 
guidelines implemented by the supplier.

 Agreed upon improvement measures:
 Health & Safety 
	 •	 Sufficient	number	of	first	aid	boxes	in	the	factory
	 •	 Installation	of	fire	alarm	in	all	areas
	 •	 Providing	appropriate	PPE	to	all	the	employees	at	free	of	cost	&	ensure	usage	of	the	same	while	working
 Working Conditions 
	 •	 Age	verification	process	for	recruiting	new	workers
	 •	 Employees	being	paid	in	line	with	legal	minimum	wages
	 •	 Applicable	benefits	like	PF,	ESI,	Leave	&	Bonus	are	extended	to	eligible	employees
 For monitoring purposes, audits can be repeated or follow-up audits can be performed by external audit service providers. 

It is also possible for the responsible purchasing departments at Siemens to agree on a series of improvement measures 
with the supplier. During this process, the Company remains committed to partnerships with suppliers and helps them 
to improve. However, if the problems continues or a supplier does not show a willingness to take necessary remedial 
action, the Company may choose to phase out that supplier.

5.  Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway to address significant risks / concerns arising from the 
assessments at Question 4 above.

 Whenever deviations from the principles of the Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers, and therefore also violations of 
the human rights principles defined in the Code are identified, the procurement team works with the supplier to clarify 
how lasting corrective action can be taken within a reasonable time frame. If all efforts to implement remedial actions 
remain unsuccessful, Siemens reserves the right to terminate the business relationship and phase out the supplier.
