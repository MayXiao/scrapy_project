2022 Sustainability Report
QBE INSURANCE GROUP LIMITED



Who we are

QBE Insurance Group Limited (QBE) is listed on 
the Australian Securities Exchange and headquartered 
in Sydney. We employ 12,479 people with 
operations in 27 countries. 

QBE is an international insurer and reinsurer offering 
a diverse portfolio of commercial, personal and specialty 
products, and risk management solutions. Our diverse 
product portfolio includes property, motor, crop, 
public/product liability, professional indemnity, workers’ 
compensation, energy, marine and aviation. We operate 
across three divisions: North America, Australia Pacific, 
and International (the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, 
Canada and through our Lloyd’s syndicates).

During 2022, we refined our sustainability focus areas 
through extensive internal consultation and analysis 
of the external landscape. We identified three areas 
of focus that will allow us to build on the foundational 
elements of the Sustainability Framework and clarify our 
sustainability objectives. We continue to evolve our action 
plans to deliver on our focus areas and further information 
can be found in our 2022 Annual Report and on page 8 
of this report.

About the cover

The cover shows the application 
of technology to farm management 
practices. In North America, we 
have developed technology to 
help farmers manage their crops 
through our Field Insights® crop 
management tool. Managing weather 
events, and gaining insights into 
the condition of their crops, are 
important ways farmers are using 
technology to maximise yield and 
reduce unpredictability. Technology 
can analyse historical and future 
weather data and monitor soil 
conditions to help determine optimal 
water usage, harvest times and other 
crop management requirements.

About this report

This Sustainability Report (Report) has been 
prepared with reference to the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) Standards. It discloses the 
sustainability topics affecting QBE (financial 
materiality) and our impacts on society and 
the environment (outward impact materiality). 
The results of our materiality assessment 
inform our sustainability focus areas, targets 
and initiatives, particularly our climate risks 
and opportunities. Our progress on the 2022 
sustainability scorecard is described in each 
of the Sustainability Framework chapters. This 
Report is for the period 1 January–31 December 
2022 and should be read in conjunction with the 
Sustainability Data Book (data book), Annual 
Report and website. Financial figures in this 
Report are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. 

The information in this Report has been collated 
and validated by subject matter experts across 
the business and is supported by evidence, where 
applicable, including by a verification process that 
records the information sources and consultation 
undertaken within QBE, or with external parties. 
The Report has been reviewed by senior 
management with the knowledge to validate the 

accuracy and completeness of the information 
provided. The Report has been approved by the 
Group Board. QBE also uses an independent 
assurance engagement to confirm that certain 
data sets have been prepared and presented 
appropriately, in all material aspects. 

In 2022, PwC conducted independent limited 
assurance over all metrics considered material 
to investors and other key stakeholders. Our 
engagement has been conducted in accordance 
with the Australian Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ASAE 3000) Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information and the 
Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ASAE 3410) Assurance Engagements on 
Greenhouse Gas Statements. 

The full limited assurance statement, which 
includes a summary of the specific reporting 
criteria used for each of the selected metrics, 
is available at the end of this report and in the 
data book.

Message from the Group Chief Executive Officer

In 2022, we have evolved our 
sustainability strategy to better 
support our ambition and purpose 
of enabling a more resilient future.

Sustainability focus 
across the business

Refreshing our 
sustainability strategy

It has never been more important for 
people, communities and businesses 
to build resilience in order to address 
the challenges we face now, and into 
the future. We hope to build resilience 
through integrating sustainability 
considerations into our business 
practices as we evolve and elevate our 
sustainability ambition. Our sustainability 
strategy refresh has enabled us to better 
focus our sustainability commitments 
and clarify the role that QBE can play 
in having a positive impact on our 
environment and society. Our three 
focus areas are resonating well with 
our people and provide opportunities 
to bring our enterprise together as we 
collaborate globally. 

We continue to progress our 
sustainability commitments and 
announced new targets and initiatives 
in our Half Year Report. These targets 
include expanding our operational 
net-zero 2030 target to include material 
Scope 3 emissions, engaging with large 
suppliers to set targets by 2025 and 
laying the foundation to publish one 
or more interim targets in accordance 
with the United Nations-convened 
Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) 
Target-Setting Protocol. 

Measuring our progress

In 2022, we published our sustainability 
scorecard, which was aligned to the 
topics we understand to be material 
to our stakeholders. I am pleased to 
say that we have met almost all our 
targets. In addition, we are proud to 
have won sustainability awards this 
year such as the Australian and New 
Zealand Institute of Insurance and 
Finance Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) Change Award 
in our home market. 

In 2023, we will reset our sustainability 
scorecard to align to our three focus 
areas and to consider the short to 
medium-term time horizon on our 
material targets. Our five priority 
sustainable development goals of No 
Poverty, Decent Work and Economic 
Growth, Reduced Inequalities, 
Sustainable Cities and Communities 
and Climate Action are aligned to our 
business activities, our Sustainability 
Framework and focus areas. 

Our priorities

Managing the risks and opportunities 
presented by a changing climate 
continues to be a key focus for us. 
QBE has been active in working with 
the NZIA and Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials to develop 

standards to measure insurance-
associated emissions that will allow us 
to individually set meaningful targets. 
Additionally, we are signatories to the 
Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance and 
a supporter of the Climate Change 
Roadmap Towards a Net-Zero and 
Resilient Future issued by the Insurance 
Council of Australia in our home market.

Inclusion of Diversity remains a 
core part of our culture. In 2022, 
we exceeded our target of 40% women 
on our Group Board. We furthered our 
commitment to women in leadership, 
pledging to HESTA’s 40:40 Vision and 
are on track to reach our target of 40% 
women in leadership by 2025. In 2023, 
we will implement new inclusion targets 
of belonging, based on ethnicity, 
disability, and LGBTIQ+ identification. 
We recognise that we operate in a 
competitive global market for talent and 
continue to focus on creating a positive 
and flexible workplace culture that 
attracts and retains people. As part 
of this, we continue to respond to 
feedback through Voice, our employee 
listening program, to build a workplace 
where people feel they belong.

Our approach to sustainability

Sustainability  
Framework

In 2016, we created our Sustainability 
Framework to help guide the key 
areas of our business activities 
with the potential to impact the 
economy, the environment and 
society. In 2019, we developed the 
sustainability scorecard that sits 
within the Sustainability Framework. 
This scorecard measures progress 
on commitments and initiatives 
in a consistent way. The framework 
commitments we make seek to 
build resilience in our business and, 
by extension, in our customers, 
by addressing the challenges 
of a changing world. 

  Please refer to the data book 
for how we performed in 2022.

Each year, we test our scorecard 
commitments through a materiality 
assessment. We do this with a view 
to aligning our priorities with 
stakeholder expectations and the 
industry landscape, to help us 
identify emerging issues for future 
consideration. As a result, our 
sustainability scorecard is regularly 
reviewed and updated, and we report 
publicly on our progress in our annual 
Sustainability Report. 

In 2022, we refreshed our 
sustainability strategy to focus on 
three key areas, these are outlined 
on page 8 of this Report. Our 
2023–25 scorecard is aligned to 
these new focus areas. These are 
described, along with our ambition, 
in the Annual Report. We are also 
a supporter of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).

Our approach to materiality focuses on how our business creates 
value for all stakeholders across the short, medium and longer‑term. 

In line with the GRI Standards, each year, we are 
required to review our material topics from the previous 
year to assess any changes in the impacts of those 
topics on the economy, the environment and society. 
QBE undertakes a full materiality assessment every 
two years, with a desktop review in interim years. 
In 2022, the desktop review included feedback from 
investors, risk assessments, peer benchmarking, 
and thought leadership from external sources. It also 
mapped to QBE’s strategic priorities and top risks.

  More information on our approach to our materiality 
and the full list of material topics assessment can be 
found on our website.

The priority material topics remain climate-focused, 
with an emphasis on how we manage our risks and 
opportunities related to climate change, especially in 
responsible underwriting and investments. We recognise 
that other important topics include the global competition 
for talent, protecting our customer and corporate data, 
and using technology to innovate, and improve our 
products and solutions. This year, the top 12 priority 
material topics globally have seen ‘ESG risk management’ 
and ‘Responsible investments’ overtake ‘Affordability and 
accessibility’ and ‘Leadership and talent’, as the spotlight 
falls on how businesses are responding to the challenges 
and opportunities presented by climate change.

As a leading global insurer and reinsurer, we have 
a significant role to play in managing the potential risk 
exposures and opportunities related to climate change 
across our value chain. We recognise that climate risk 
is multi-faceted, and includes physical risks, transition 
risks (e.g. policy, technology, market) and liability risks. 
We have the ability to help customers, partners and 
communities build resilience, and understand, and 
navigate, the changing risk landscape and the transition 
to a net-zero economy.

Aligned to SDGs  
1, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17

  Refer to Climate change section of the Annual Report 
and Climate risks and opportunities

Our Group Underwriting Standards outline our 
commitment to responsible underwriting and integrate 
current, and emerging, ESG considerations into our 
underwriting and pricing (including our models, 
decision-making processes and systems). This includes 
the implementation of QBE’s Environmental and Social 
Risk Framework in our underwriting and investment 
portfolio decision-making. There is an increased focus 
on responsible underwriting as the insurance sector 
collaborates to develop standards and protocols 
to effectively measure insurance-associated emissions 
and set targets. 

Aligned to SDGs:  
1, 8, 9, 13, 17

  Refer to Sustainable insurance

We embrace technology and innovation, 
including automation and digitisation, to improve 
customer service, experience and efficiency. 
We seek to embrace new technologies and the 
opportunities for new product development, 
including those spurred by COVID-19, which has 
seen rising consumer expectations for seamless 
digital transactions and greater personalisation. 
We also look for opportunities to improve existing 
services through iterative technical enhancements 
that seek to simplify and enhance the customer 
and supplier experience.

Aligned to SDGs:  
9, 10, 11, 12 

  Refer to Customer and community and 
Operational excellence

 

We are committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance across our global 
operations. This includes the Group Board providing 
guidance and oversight to support ethical behaviour, 
transparency and accountable decision-making. 
We seek to take all reasonable steps to minimise 
compliance risk – not only because it is required, but 
to continue to do the right thing by our stakeholders. 
This topic also incorporates the integration of robust, 
impartial and independent whistleblowing and 
grievance procedures into all operations.

Aligned to SDGs:  
8, 16, 17

  Refer to Governance and the 2022 Corporate 
governance statement

Building an organisational culture that supports and 
enables us to achieve our purpose, vision and strategy 
is a strategic priority for our business. Our Group Code 
of Ethics and Conduct supports our culture and helps 
guide employees to act ethically, promoting QBE's 
reputation and supporting our people to feel safe 
to speak up. Leadership is key to ensuring that ‘how’ 
people go about their work is seen as just as important 
as ‘what’ gets achieved. 

Aligned to SDGs  
3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16

  Refer to People and culture and our 2022 Annual Report

We continually work to integrate current and emerging 
ESG risks into our risk management framework and 
decision-making processes. Our Group ESG Risk 
Standard outlines the process we use to identify and 
manage ESG risks across the business. We also maintain 
an Environmental and Social (E&S) Risk Framework that 
underpins our underwriting and investment approach 
to several sensitive sectors including defence, energy, 
forestry, fishing and mining.

Aligned to SDGs:  
1, 8, 9, 13

  Refer to Sustainable insurance 

We are committed to respecting our customers’ 
privacy, protecting their personal data from misuse

As an international insurer and reinsurer, we see first‑hand the 
impacts of a changing climate on our customers, communities and 
partners. This is why we support an orderly and inclusive transition 
to a net‑zero emissions economy.

risks and opportunities

QBE’s ability to meet our net-zero commitments is related to the actions we take in relation to our own operations, 
our investments and our underwriting portfolios. Our success is reliant on many factors, including the development 
of new technology associated with carbon removal and emissions reduction. It also depends on the progress individuals, 
businesses and economies can make to transition to net zero collectively, particularly in developed countries with 
net-zero commitments. We seek to understand the climate science and the economic and social factors at play and QBE 
considers three spheres of influence in delivering on our commitments and driving change in the real economy:

Advocacy with a broad range of stakeholders to support 
resilient adaptation and emissions reduction

Engaging and partnering with our customers, 
investees,  suppliers and communities (including through 
QBE Foundation and QBE Ventures)

Driving change where we have control

We continue to reduce the direct impact of our operations on the climate. 
This year, we extended our commitment to net-zero emissions across our 
operations to include material Scope 3 (as well as Scope 1 and 2) emissions 
by 2030. In line with our commitment to the Climate Group’s RE100, 100% 
of our electricity came from renewable sources. 

 Further information can be found in our data book 
and the Operational excellence chapter.

Opportunities to impact our stakeholders

Our approach to responsible investing and underwriting is consistent with our 
signatory status to the United Nations Environment Programme — Finance 
Initiative’s Principles for Sustainable Insurance and the UN Principles for 
Responsible Investment. We are also signatories to the Net-Zero Asset Owner 
Alliance (NZAOA), Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), and a supporter of the 
Climate Change Roadmap Towards a Net-Zero and Resilient Future (Roadmap) 
of the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) in our home market.

In 2020, QBE became the first Australian-headquartered insurance company to 
become a member of the NZAOA, joining an international group of institutional 
investors committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net-zero 
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2050. In 2021, we established interim 
targets for 2025, in line with the Target Setting Protocol of the NZAOA and 
our commitment to transition our investment portfolios to net-zero emissions 
by 2050. In 2022, we invested in the data, systems and people required for, 
and made the expected progress against, these interim targets. 

In 2022, QBE became the first Australian-headquartered insurance company 
to become a member of the NZIA, committing to net-zero emissions across 
our underwriting portfolio by 2050. In 2022, QBE was a member of the working 
group developing the first Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for 
Insurance-Associated Emissions with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting 
Financials. In 2022, and in 2023, we have invested or are investing in the data, 
systems and people required to estimate and automate the measurement 
of insurance-associated emissions across our portfolio. This is key to informing 
the development of interim targets in line with the NZIA Target-Setting 
Protocol. We will then commence formal engagement with priority 
commercial customers. 

QBE creates value primarily through providing a wide range of insurance 
products, across many industry sectors and countries. When set, our NZIA 
targets will complement our initiatives to develop products and solutions 
to insure the transition. 

Our customers vary considerably, from large publicly listed entities, other 
insurance companies, non-listed entities, small-to-medium enterprises 
and individual consumers. To have an impact on the transition of the real 
economy to net zero, we recognise we have a role to play in engaging with our 
customers and insuring the transition. There are many approaches to achieving 
climate action and our positions, which include exclusions, are codified in the 
Environmental and Social Risk Framework in relation to sensitive sectors. 

In 2022, we also began considering how we can foster an orderly and inclusive 
transition through our supply chain. We extended our operational targets to 
include a commitment to formal engagement on net-zero progress with large 
suppliers, with the goal of setting targets for those large suppliers by 2025.

greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2050. In 2021, we established interim 
targets for 2025, in line with the Target Setting Protocol of the NZAOA and 
our commitment to transition our investment portfolios to net-zero emissions 
by 2050. In 2022, we invested in the data, systems and people required for, 
and made the expected progress against, these interim targets. 

In 2022, QBE became the first Australian-headquartered insurance company 
to become a member of the NZIA, committing to net-zero emissions across 
our underwriting portfolio by 2050. In 2022, QBE was a member of the working 
group developing the first Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for 
Insurance-Associated Emissions with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting 
Financials. In 2022, and in 2023, we have invested or are investing in the data, 
systems and people required to estimate and automate the measurement 
of insurance-associated emissions across our portfolio. This is key to informing 
the development of interim targets in line with the NZIA Target-Setting 
Protocol. We will then commence formal engagement with priority 
commercial customers. 

QBE creates value primarily through providing a wide range of insurance 
products, across many industry sectors and countries. When set, our NZIA 
targets will complement our initiatives to develop products and solutions 
to insure the transition. 

Our customers vary considerably, from large publicly listed entities, other 
insurance companies, non-listed entities, small-to-medium enterprises 
and individual consumers. To have an impact on the transition of the real 
economy to net zero, we recognise we have a role to play in engaging with our 
customers and insuring the transition. There are many approaches to achieving 
climate action and our positions, which include exclusions, are codified in the 
Environmental and Social Risk Framework in relation to sensitive sectors. 

In 2022, we also began considering how we can foster an orderly and inclusive 
transition through our supply chain. We extended our operational targets to 
include a commitment to formal engagement on net-zero progress with large 
suppliers, with the goal of setting targets for those large suppliers by 2025.

In 2022, we further embedded 
a strategy that is aligned 
to climate resilience and 
inclusion. Through the 
review of existing local 
partnerships, and the renewal 
of the Global Disaster Relief 
and Resilience Partnership 
with Red Cross and Save the 
Children, QBE seeks to support 
the communities in which 
we operate in alignment 
with our purpose.

We are committed to complying with the legislative 
requirements relevant across our operations and our internal 
policies such as our Group Environmental Policy, that sets 
out the global minimum standards for our management 
of environmental issues. We recognise there are important 
social implications associated with climate risk and the 
transition. Our Group Human Rights Policy outlines our 
commitment to respecting human rights and avoiding 
human rights harm wherever we operate. We are committed 
to adhering to internationally recognised human rights 
norms and principles to elevate the importance of dignity 
and equality for all our employees, customers, communities 
and suppliers. Our policies are regularly reviewed as part 
of our governance processes.

In 2022, we further embedded the refreshed QBE Foundation 
strategy that is aligned to climate resilience and inclusion. 
Through the review of existing local partnerships, and 
the renewal of our Global Disaster Relief and Resilience 
Partnership with Red Cross and Save the Children, QBE seeks 
to support the communities in which we operate in alignment 
with our purpose. Further information can be found in our 
Customer and community chapter. 

Influencing through industry advocacy

QBE also seeks to influence through advocacy, 
either directly or through industry alliances. 
Our actions have a focus on influencing the reduction 
of real-economy emissions and other material topics 
identified through our materiality assessment. 

QBE has played key roles on the ICA's Climate Change 
Action Committee (CCAC) that is focused on greater 
advocacy for more resilience to extreme weather, and 
for emissions reduction by the insurance industry, to help 
address insurance affordability and accessibility. The climate 
resilience series of technical reports developed by CCAC 
have underpinned successful advocacy for resilient 
investment from the Australian government in 2022. 
In advance of COP27, the release of the industry net-zero 
Roadmap was the culmination of broad engagement 
across ICA membership to increase literacy on the 
net-zero transition and implications for the Australian 
insurance sector. The development of this Roadmap 
informed the development of policy recommendations 
for the Australian Government to accelerate climate action 
alongside the Roadmap. 

Nature and biodiversity

Biodiversity loss has been identified as a key ESG risk 
theme for QBE and we are developing our understanding of 
nature-related risks and opportunities relevant to our business 
through our involvement in various industry forums. 

Our Environmental and Social Risk Framework outlines QBE’s 
approach to addressing key environmental and social risks 
across our underwriting and investment activities, including 
those relating to biodiversity and protected areas.

  For further information, see the Climate change section in the 
Annual Report.

QBE’s purpose is to enable a more resilient future. 
Integrating sustainability into our business is vital 
to achieving our purpose. 

In 2022, we successfully progressed our key sustainable insurance 
commitments associated with further embedding ESG risk management 
practices, collaborated with our stakeholders towards achieving our priority SDGs, 
and further addressed the risks and opportunities related to climate change. 

 See the Climate change section in the Annual Report.

Since 2018, our Group Underwriting Standards (GUS) have incorporated our 
responsible underwriting principles, reflecting our position on environmental 
and social risks. The Group Underwriting Committee (GUC), chaired by our 
Group Chief Underwriting Officer (GCUO), with membership from across the 
enterprise, oversees adherence to the GUS and corporate strategy. This role 
has oversight of our material sustainability topics through a position on the 
Environmental and Social Group Executive Committee sub-committee, 
Executive Risk Committee and ESG Risk Committee. The E&S Risk Framework 
outlines our approach to addressing key environmental and social risks across 
our underwriting and investment activities. Underwriting training was delivered 
throughout 2022 to further embed ESG risk management, and drive consistent 
application of the E&S Risk Framework’s sensitive sector positions. This training 
supports operational adherence to our commitments and policies, including 
the GUS, Group Environmental Policy, Group Human Rights Policy, and E&S 
Risk Framework. Our GCUO and Group Chief Risk Officer monitor our referral 
process, and preventative and detective controls. To date, there have been no 
known cases of non-adherence to the E&S Risk Framework. If a case is detected, 
QBE has effective processes to rectify this by working with impacted parties. 

Throughout 2022, we continued to build our capability to progress our 
own sustainable insurance strategies alongside our contribution to the 
development of the UN-convened NZIA’s industry guidance on measuring 
insurance-associated emissions, and its Target-Setting Protocol. We continue 
to evolve our internal sustainable insurance procedures, tools, data and 
metrics. We also actively contributed to industry consultation on developing 
sustainability-related standards including the International Sustainability 
Standards Board’s Exposure Draft IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of 
Sustainability-related Financial Information and IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures.

Since 2015, QBE has been a signatory 
to the United Nations Environment 
Programme — Finance Initiative’s 
Principles for Sustainable Insurance 
(PSI), a global framework to address 
ESG risks and opportunities.

We continue to integrate and embed 
the PSI’s four principles into how 
we deliver on our three sustainability

lens of priority topics most material 
to our stakeholders, working with our 
customers and partners for innovative,

working together with governments, 
regulators and other key stakeholders 
to promote widespread ESG action,

This focus area recognises that the transition is key 
to reducing the extreme weather risks that impact our 
customers, business, communities and economies. It also 
recognises that a successful transition takes the collective 
effort of governments, regulators, the finance sector, 
businesses, individuals and communities.

Our transition analysis highlights the importance of an orderly 
transition. One that:

• considers the broader risks to the economy and society; 

• attracts investment into renewable energy; and

• promotes resilience and adaptability 

to provide greater economic stability, business confidence, 
and lower risk of business failure. We believe that a thriving 
economy through the transition is a better outcome for all. 

We recognise the significance of an inclusive transition. 
One that considers the importance of the social implications 
and potential impacts, and that brings people and 
communities with us on the journey. The energy transition 
is likely to materially affect communities and businesses linked 
to non-renewable energy production, and it is important that 
they are not left behind. It is also critical to recognise that 
the physical risks of climate change will disproportionately 
impact developing and island nations and/or those individuals 
or communities within less secure socioeconomic groups. 
This is likely to have global economic, physical and food 
security, and migratory implications over time. Reducing 

inequality, ending poverty, and enabling decent work 
and economic growth and more sustainable cities and 
communities, are all SDGs aligned with our actions within 
this sustainability focus area.

Our net-zero focus provides a purpose-led reason to bring our 
enterprise together. Several projects this year have required 
cross-functional and enterprise-wide collaboration, involving 
the building of connection and the sharing of stories and 
ideas to foster greater innovation, consistency, and efficiency. 

These projects included:

• the net-zero insurance-associated emissions project 
to estimate our baseline emissions profile where 
a methodology was developed; and 

• the net-zero sprints held to consult on our sustainability 
strategy and define the net-zero opportunities.

In October, we again brought together cross-functional 
and enterprise-wide team members to share knowledge 
and expertise from existing investment and procurement 
engagement practices. This wider group will continue 
to participate in our Australia Pacific Large Supplier 
engagement pilot. This pilot is planned to continue into 
2023, and seeks to establish a consistent approach across 
the enterprise. We have had success in the past with piloting 
divisional projects before implementing enterprise-wide, 
and plan to continue with this approach in relation 
to sustainability-related opportunities. 

Enabling a resilient future 

At QBE, we're driven by our purpose of enabling a more resilient future. Integrating 
sustainability in our business will help us to achieve that future.

Major sustainability challenges, including climate change, human rights abuses, 
and biodiversity loss, can weaken resilience because they create new risks, or magnify 
existing ones, with potentially devastating consequences.

Integrating sustainability into how we do business means we are shifting the concept 
of “business as usual” to include consideration of material non-financial issues that 
reduce risk, and support our people, customers, society, and the environment.

We believe that progressing our sustainability commitments can enable QBE to attract 
and retain talent, customers, and capital, into the future. These factors are essential 
to maintaining QBE’s financial stability and, by extension, the stability of the insurance 
sector and the economies in which we live and work.

Sustainable insurance continued

Our vision is to be the most consistent, and innovative, risk partner. 
This sustainability strategy focus area enables our business to explore 
the opportunities arising from a range of sustainability challenges that 
we face today. 

Our ESG materiality assessment points to material issues that are of the 
highest priority to our business, and to our customers. In many cases, 
these issues deliver challenges that cannot be addressed by any individual 
organisation alone. We constantly seek ways to collaborate and partner 
with others, where our interests are aligned, to:

• create value for our customers, and our business;

• reduce and/or better manage risk; and

• contribute to sustainable development for greater resilience.

The nature of our partners across the insurance ecosystem is broad. 
This focus area encompasses a wide range of partnerships that extends beyond 
our brokers and intermediaries, to QBE Ventures, to partnerships across our 
supply chain, our capital and reinsurance providers, and our investors. Finding 
solutions to our priority material issues may extend beyond our insurance 
value chain to include our strategic partnerships through the QBE Foundation, 
and engagement with governments, regulators and other stakeholders.

While innovation is often linked to how we offer insurance to customers, 
it also plays a role in improving efficiencies across our business, and of those 
with which we work, to reduce our reliance on increasingly scarce resources. 
In 2023, our divisions will continue to explore, and identify, opportunities 
to grow our sustainable solutions, in relation to our products and services 
as well as our operations.

Green LMI

QBE seeks to enable a more resilient 
future through our partnerships, 
innovative offerings, and by 
investing in opportunities that make 
a positive community contribution. 
One way we are delivering on this 
commitment is through the launch 
of our first-to-market green benefit 
for Lenders Mortgage Insurance 
(LMI). This allows consumers who 
purchase, or refinance, a home with 
a green mortgage offered by one 
of our exclusive partners, to receive 
a 5% premium reduction on the 
LMI provided by QBE; enabling 
consumers to access better terms 
when buying, building or renovating, 
a sustainable home. Further, 100% 
of our green-benefit LMI premium 
is allocated to QBE’s Premiums4Good 
initiative, supporting social and 
environmental impact investments 
to make a real difference to the 
environments, and communities, 
in which we live and work.

Given the importance of ESG issues, we continue to embed 
ESG into our broader risk management approach. To help 
mitigate ESG-related risks across the enterprise, we set out 
a number of minimum standards that we adhere to in our 
Group Environmental Policy, Group Human Rights Policy, 
and E&S Risk Framework. 

Our approach

ESG risk sits within strategic risk in our Risk Management 
Strategy, and is governed by our ESG Risk Standard, which 
outlines our process for identifying and managing ESG 
risks across our business. The ESG Risk Committee, chaired 
by the Group Chief Risk Officer, oversees our approach to our 
priority ESG risks. For 2022, these included climate risks and 
opportunities, human rights and modern slavery, biodiversity 
and sustainable procurement. 

Our Board Risk & Capital Committee supports the Group 
Board, overseeing active risk management in line with our 
risk appetite, strategy and business plans. Further detail 
on our approach to climate risk management is available 
in the Annual Report. 

ESG risk training

This year, training modules were developed and rolled 
out Group-wide on ESG risk, human rights and climate 
change risk. These are voluntary, and available to all 
employees, with the aim of raising awareness of ESG risks, 
and QBE’s approach to identifying and managing them. 

Our Group Board and senior executives participate in regular 
training, including education sessions and deep dives, 
to enhance their awareness of, and capability surrounding, 
ESG issues, including climate-change risk.

ESG risk management

Collaborating with partners

We believe that our strong culture, and our focus 
on sustainability enables stronger collaboration and 
more consistent knowledge sharing across the enterprise. 
We consider that uplifting our people’s knowledge 
of sustainability, and what it means to their role, supports 
resilience, and enables the development of innovative, 
sustainable and impactful solutions.

Industry collaboration

QBE contributes to, or is a member of, multiple industry 
collaborative bodies. We are growing the sustainability 
capabilities of our people while contributing to progressive 

action, and advocacy, for a more sustainable insurance 
industry. We operate with strong awareness of antitrust 
principles, and the need to preserve competition.

In addition to our memberships within the United Nations 
initiatives discussed in this Report, we contribute to 
collaborative initiatives including the Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials (via NZIA), International Underwriting 
Association’s Climate Risk Committee and its new ESG 
Committee, Lloyd’s Market Association’s Sustainability 
Committee, ClimateWise Nature and Insurance Task Group, 
Insurance Council of Australia’s Climate Change Action 
Committee and Australian Sustainable Finance Institute.

Partnering on psychological first aid

QBE has partnered with Australian Red Cross to 
support its psychological first aid work in communities 
affected by disasters such as the 2019-2020 summer 
bushfires and the widespread 2022 floods. Recently, 
Red Cross ran special training sessions for QBE's Short 
Tail Claims leaders to help our people learn how to deal 
sensitively with customers facing catastrophic events 

and identify their challenges. The sessions equipped 
our people with the basic tools and knowledge to 
recognise and respond to people suffering from the 
impacts of disasters. They also received tips and 
support for their own well-being and resilience.

returns with the aim of benefitting the planet and the communities in which 
we operate. As a responsible global investor, we recognise that our decisions 
can have a positive or negative impact on the economy, the environment, 
and our communities.

QBE maintains a multi-asset, multi-currency portfolio, with most of the portfolio 
invested in fixed income. Our assets are managed by a mix of in-house portfolio 
managers, analysts, and external fund managers.

Our Investment Philosophy Framework is designed to deliver an investment 
outcome that facilitates the protection and growth of appropriate stakeholder 
value. The framework applies to all of our assets under management (AUM). 
It provides an overview of our commitment, and approach, to responsible 
investing including: 

• our approach to positive and negative screening;

• how we integrate ESG factors into our due diligence;

• how we conduct ongoing engagement with investees and external 
fund managers;

• our management of climate-related risks and opportunities; and

• how we provide appropriate transparency and reporting.

Impact and

Our Responsible Investments approach is captured across 
the four pillars outlined above and is underpinned by 
our Investment Philosophy Framework, the Impact and 
Responsible Investments guidelines, QBE’s Environmental 
and Social (E&S) Risk Framework, and our newly implemented 
Group Human Rights Policy, which all combine to inform 
the ESG factors in our investment decision-making processes 
and systems. Each pillar builds upon the previous one and 
our 2022 progress in these areas is outlined below.

Screening

As an organisation that helps people and businesses 
protect themselves from risk, maintaining an understanding 
of ESG issues enables QBE to manage risks and identify 
opportunities. Our E&S Risk Framework outlines our 
approach to screening, and exclusions, to address key 
E&S risks across our investment activities. All direct 
investments are subject to the E&S Risk Framework, which 
specifies detailed commitments and criteria for a range 
of sectors we have identified as higher risk, including:

• defence: controversial weapons and firearms; and 

• energy: coal, oil sands and Arctic drilling, oil, and gas. 

At the beginning of 2022, we fully implemented the E&S 
Risk Framework, which promotes informed decision-making 
consistent with QBE’s commitment to responsible investment. 

Our E&S Risk Framework is available on our website. 

ESG integration

We consider ESG integration approaches across all 
asset classes through the inclusion of material ESG 
factors into investment analysis and decision-making. 
This is a collaborative process across our entire 
Group Investments team.

In-house fixed income

Our fixed income portfolio represents 89% of our total 
investment assets, with investment grade corporate credit 
representing 50%. All issuers must be consistent with relevant 

criteria set out in our E&S Risk Framework, Group Sanctions 
Policy and Group Human Rights Policy. We integrate ESG into 
the credit analysis process through our internal, proprietary 
credit assessment framework that identifies suitability and 
eligibility for our portfolio. Screening for ESG performance 
includes a quantitative assessment using independent ESG 
ratings. Portfolio managers additionally undertake qualitative 
ESG analysis on each issuer. ESG factors are prioritised based 
on materiality considerations for the issuer and/or sector. 
This process was enhanced in 2022 to further incorporate 
material human rights considerations. Updated focus areas 
included policies, controversies, labour standards, and 
diversity, equity and inclusion, informed by data sourced 
from our third-party data provider. In 2023, we will continue 
to enhance our ESG integration capabilities across material 
topics for our portfolio, and the ongoing monitoring of issuers 
to identify material ESG developments.

Externally managed funds

We also invest across multiple asset classes utilising external 
fund managers, and are committed to ensuring they are 
aligned with QBE’s Responsible Investments approach. 
We are committed to a minimum of 90% of our external 
managers being PRI signatories. ESG considerations form 
an integral part of our manager selection, appointment, 
and monitoring processes. Building on the work completed 
in 2021, which saw us set a performance baseline for 
each manager, in 2022, we further enhanced our process 
by introducing additional asset class-specific due diligence 
questions. We conduct an annual ESG review of all 
existing managers, with additional engagement activities 
if material issues arise. As part of the implementation 
of our Group Human Rights Policy, we also incorporated 
additional human rights-focused questions for all external 
managers. We have been an investor member of the 
Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark since 2018. 
Our real estate portfolio’s year-on-year sustainability 
performance has continued to improve, and we are pleased 
that it has again received a 5-star rating, and top quintile 
performance recognition.

Impact investing 
in practice

In 2022, Premiums4Good 
invested in the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) 
Health Thematic Bond, which 
supports ADB member 
countries in their COVID-19 
pandemic response and efforts 
to achieve universal health 
coverage throughout Asia 
and the Pacific. Through this 
investment, working capital 
was directed to Bangladesh, 
which was severely impacted 
by the pandemic. To mitigate 
the risk of spread, it was 
important to implement 
and scale up Bangladesh’s 
national vaccination program. 
The ADB, through its Asia 
Pacific Vaccine Access Facility 
program, supported the 
Government of Bangladesh 
in its vaccination efforts.

The project will support the 
procurement of approximately 
113 million vaccine doses, 
which will be administered 
to more than 40 million 
Bangladeshis by 2024. The 
ADB is not only providing 
vaccine financing, but will also 
support administration and 
implementation of the project 
by working closely with the 
Bangladesh Government. 

The ADB has a vision for a 
prosperous, inclusive, resilient, 
and sustainable Asia and 
Pacific region, and QBE is 
proud to support its efforts.

Engagement

Engagement is our preferred method of effecting impactful change, and has 
continued to be a key focus area in 2022. We believe that having meaningful 
dialogue on key ESG considerations is a critical component of our responsibility 
as an asset owner, to seek to ensure sustainable financial outcomes. 

We engage with all our external fund managers and adopt targeted 
engagement with the top 20 highest emitters in our investment grade corporate 
credit portfolio. Our objective is to gain insight into these investees’ integration 
of material ESG issues. This allows us to understand our exposure to ESG risks 
and opportunities, and gives us the ability to influence real world outcomes.

In 2022, these key focus areas were:

• climate risks and opportunities;

• net-zero commitments and target setting;

• diversity, equity, and inclusion; and

• human rights: policies, controversies, modern slavery, and labour standard.

This approach allowed us to produce a quantitative indicator score of how our 
external fund managers are implementing responsible investment practices 
and approaching these key ESG areas. 

A key focus of our external fund manager reviews and discussions continues 
to be climate change. Positively, we saw increased ambition to transition 
their investment portfolios to net-zero emissions through bringing forward 
net-zero targets to an earlier date, increased resourcing, and further integration 
of emissions reduction considerations into key investment decisions.

For our top 20 highest emitters in our investment grade corporate credit 
portfolio, we tailored and enhanced our engagement approach in 2022 by 
identifying material areas of focus per issuer and directing targeted questions 
to each one to allow for more meaningful and relevant dialogue. 

This allows us to monitor and review our fixed income investments in relation 
to ESG considerations and better ensure the companies we invest in are 
working towards net zero 2050 alignment and targets, climate reporting 
in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and 
business viability plans for a net zero-aligned economy.

Our aim is for consistency in our engagement approach across our external 
managers and top 20 targeted investees. We first began engagement with 
the latter cohort in 2021. As dialogue progresses, we will look to mature 
our approach to tracking engagement progress across all our corporate 
credit issuers. 

Impact investing

Impact investments seek to generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns along 
with a positive, measurable, social and/or environmental benefit. Over the last 
seven years, QBE has sought to maintain leadership in impact investing, and 
to support its growth and development among our industry peers and other 
asset owners. An integral part of our approach to impact investments is our 
Premiums4Good initiative, outlined on the following page.

Premiums4Good is our innovative impact investing 
initiative that sees us invest everyday premiums to 
make a difference to communities across the globe. 

As a responsible institutional investor, we invest for impact while seeking 
an attractive risk-adjusted return. Premiums4Good supports our belief that 
we can deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and business value, while 
delivering a positive social and/or environmental impact.

Through Premiums4Good, we invest a portion of our customers’ premiums 
into impact investments with the intention of creating positive social and/or 
environmental outcomes, along with a financial return, at no extra cost to 
the customer. Investments are made across many asset classes including 
fixed income, equity, infrastructure, social bonds and real estate. From 
renewable energy initiatives to social services, and programs to support 
vulnerable people and communities – Premiums4Good helps us, together 
with our customers, to work toward a more resilient, equitable future.

Our aim is to scale our impact investments with integrity through good 
impact governance, investment selection, systems, and reporting. 
We classify all our impact investments as having 'moderate', 'high’, or 'deep' 
impact, informed by our involvement in the Impact Management Project 
and the Global Impact Investing Network. These classifications are made 
through an internal framework and confirmed by our external Classification 
of Social and Environmental Investments Committee, which is comprised 
of two QBE representatives and four independent impact experts.

Supporting and serving our customers, and the

Supporting vulnerable customers

To support our personal lines product insurance offering in Australia, we are 
focused on continuing to identify and support vulnerable customers. QBE 
completed its first foundational Financial Inclusion Action Plan (FIAP), which outlined 
29 initiatives aimed at improving financial inclusion, resilience and wellbeing for our 
customers, community partners, suppliers and employees, in 2021. In line with the 
FIAP program terms, our progress towards these initiatives has been independently 
reviewed and validated by EY, with a progress report published on the QBE website 
in the first quarter of 2022.

Throughout 2022, we remained part of the FIAP community with a focus 
on training our customer interfacing teams. We also provided refresher training 
to most customer-facing teams on supporting customers experiencing vulnerability. 
To do this, we partnered with Uniting, consultants that help businesses develop 
strategies to support vulnerable customers, to develop training to increase 
awareness of emerging trends in financial vulnerability, and appropriate responses. 
We continue to explore ways in which we can support our customers experiencing 
financial hardship and vulnerability. We remain committed to contributing 
to financial inclusion and resilience across Australian communities.

Our customers

While QBE is primarily an intermediated business, serving our customers 
through our partners, we do hold a direct relationship with many consumer and 
small-to-medium enterprise customers. We gather feedback from our partners and 
customers through mechanisms that differ across divisions. This provides us with 
important insights to explore how we can partner for innovative, sustainable and 
impactful solutions.

QBE Foundation

The QBE Foundation seeks to create strong, resilient 
and inclusive communities. We work in partnership 
with community organisations, with a focus on climate 
resilience and inclusion – two areas where we believe 
we can have the greatest impact.

The QBE Foundation invests in the community 
through funding, pro bono and in-kind support, 
including workplace volunteering and giving, 
community grants, and partnerships with charities 
and community organisations. 

We invest in communities globally, and our QBE 
Foundation operates locally in our Australia Pacific, 
International (including Europe and Asia) and North 
America divisions, as well as in Bermuda and in our 
Group Shared Services Centre in the Philippines. 
Each division works to bring our vision to life, 
through local partnerships, grants and employee 
engagement opportunities. 

As well as local partnerships, the QBE Foundation 
works to support our global Disaster Relief 
and Resilience Partnership with Red Cross 
and Save the Children.

This partnership is critical to our ability to support 
communities to prepare for, anticipate, respond 
to, and recover from, disasters. We also work with 
our partners to create strategic local initiatives that 
support climate resilience and/or inclusion priorities. 

In the first three years of our partnership, we:

• activated the partnership in 19 of our 27 countries 
of operation;

• reached over 490,000 people through the 
distribution of 46,955 relief items, cash support, 
and preparedness initiatives;

• supported our partners to deliver their programs 
and relief efforts through the deployment 
of $2.7 million in aid;

• invested $2 million in the Save the Children Impact 
Investment Fund; and

• were recognised as Highly Commended in the 2022 
Fundraising Institute Australia Awards ‘Best Strategic 
Partnership’ category and as a Finalist in the 2020 
Shared Value Awards ‘Shared Value Collaboration 
of the Year’ category.

On the United Nations’ International Day for Disaster 
Risk Reduction in October 2022, we relaunched 
the partnership, committing to a further three years 
of working together and increased funding. Over the 
next three years, we will grow our focus on climate risk 
adaptation and mitigation. 

QBE AcceliCITY Resilience Challenge 

Each year, QBE Foundation partners with Leading 
Cities to run the QBE AcceliCITY Resilience Challenge, 
a global competition seeking entrepreneurs whose 
ventures drive resiliency in cities. Employees have 
the opportunity to evaluate the entrants’ innovation 
and impact and vote in the People’s Choice Award. 
In 2022, Automedi won the challenge's grand prize 
of $100,000 to help bring its technology and services 
to the international market with the aim of building 
more sustainable societies. A UK-based manufacturing 
platform, Automedi is the world’s first decentralised 
circular microeconomy, converting plastic waste into 
community products at the point of use.

Customer and community continued

QBE is committed to the ongoing management of internal and external 
cyber threats to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our customer 
and corporate data. Our Cybersecurity Strategy seeks to ensure effective 
controls are in place across people, process, and technology, including proactive 
monitoring and response to known and emerging threats.

Our approach

QBE’s approach to cybersecurity is guided by our 
Cybersecurity Framework, which is aligned to the U.S. 
Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. Our 
framework seeks to help us continually improve our cyber 
risk identification, prevention, detection, response, and 
recovery capabilities. It sets out our operating model, security 
policies and standards, cyber risk culture, metrics and 
reporting, and risk identification and management processes. 

QBE employs a defence-in-depth approach to security 
coupled with proactive and reactive security controls 
to protect our environment. This includes threat intelligence, 
monitoring, vulnerability management and incident response. 
Our Global Security Operations Centre performs containment 
activities when malicious activity is detected. We have robust 
business recovery plans in place that are tested annually.

QBE has a rolling, three-year Cybersecurity Strategy designed 
to improve the security and resilience of QBE technology 
and business services against cyber threats or disruption. 
Importantly, the strategy is adaptive, to enable QBE to pivot 
activity in response to emerging threats. The strategy’s key drivers 
are technology modernisation, the evolving threat landscape 

(including criminal activity and techniques), internal and external 
risk assessments, and changes in the regulatory environment. 

QBE’s Cybersecurity Strategy is overseen by QBE’s Group Board. 
Division-specific activities are also reported to divisional Executive 
Management teams and Boards. QBE also conducts internal and 
external assessments on security control effectiveness to assist 
us to prioritise investment and areas of focus. 

QBE has a comprehensive cybersecurity capability, including 
security architecture and design, data security, cyber 
engineering, governance and assurance, identity and access 
management, and cyber safety awareness. These capabilities 
are delivered via a central, global function that enables 
strategic direction for, and common security goals with, 
our people, partners and regulators. Activity is delivered via 
divisionally based subject matter experts, who tailor solutions 
to meet local business requirements and regulations. 

QBE’s cybersecurity risk and compliance activities are aligned 
with the QBE Group Risk and Compliance Frameworks, which 
seek to ensure that cyber risks are consistently assessed, 
monitored and managed in line with wider enterprise risks 
and compliance obligations. 

Cybersecurity

Ransomware

Ransomware is a prevalent threat to organisations 
worldwide. While ransomware attacks are pervasive, 
there was a significant increase in their volume and 
sophistication globally as organisations moved to 
mass working-from-home arrangements in 2020 due 
to COVID-19. Research 1 indicates a 1,070% increase 
in ransomware attacks between July 2020 and 
June 2021. This trend continued throughout 2022. 

In response, QBE has dedicated programs focused 
on ransomware business resiliency. We prioritise 
application recoverability for core business processes 
across all technology dependencies. Internal and 
external assessments are regularly conducted 
to test controls.

08_Report/report-ransomware-survery.pdf

Culture and awareness

We invest in a comprehensive, multi-channel 
global awareness program to empower our people 
to understand cyber risks at work and at home. 
The program includes regular phishing simulations, 
which aim to mimic real-world, sophisticated phishing 
attacks, to train our people to recognise and report 
malicious emails (often the entry point of cyberattacks).

The program also encompasses online compliance 
training, face-to-face presentations, and cyber safety 
communications to assist our people to stay safe online 
and in their everyday business interactions. We also 
conduct tailored training for specific roles that have 
a heightened risk of being targeted by cybercriminals, 
given the nature of the information/access connected 
to the role. Key metrics used to measure secure 
behaviour, including phishing simulation results and 
compliance training completion rates, are reported 
to senior leaders and Group and divisional Boards.

QBE’s approach to cybersecurity is guided by our 
Cybersecurity Framework, which is aligned to the U.S. 
Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. Our 
framework seeks to help us continually improve our cyber 
risk identification, prevention, detection, response, and 
recovery capabilities. It sets out our operating model, security 
policies and standards, cyber risk culture, metrics and 
reporting, and risk identification and management processes. 

QBE employs a defence-in-depth approach to security 
coupled with proactive and reactive security controls 
to protect our environment. This includes threat intelligence, 
monitoring, vulnerability management and incident response. 
Our Global Security Operations Centre performs containment 
activities when malicious activity is detected. We have robust 
business recovery plans in place that are tested annually.

QBE has a rolling, three-year Cybersecurity Strategy designed 
to improve the security and resilience of QBE technology 
and business services against cyber threats or disruption. 
Importantly, the strategy is adaptive, to enable QBE to pivot 
activity in response to emerging threats. The strategy’s key drivers 
are technology modernisation, the evolving threat landscape 

(including criminal activity and techniques), internal and external 
risk assessments, and changes in the regulatory environment. 

QBE’s Cybersecurity Strategy is overseen by QBE’s Group Board. 
Division-specific activities are also reported to divisional Executive 
Management teams and Boards. QBE also conducts internal and 
external assessments on security control effectiveness to assist 
us to prioritise investment and areas of focus. 

QBE has a comprehensive cybersecurity capability, including 
security architecture and design, data security, cyber 
engineering, governance and assurance, identity and access 
management, and cyber safety awareness. These capabilities 
are delivered via a central, global function that enables 
strategic direction for, and common security goals with, 
our people, partners and regulators. Activity is delivered via 
divisionally based subject matter experts, who tailor solutions 
to meet local business requirements and regulations. 

QBE’s cybersecurity risk and compliance activities are aligned 
with the QBE Group Risk and Compliance Frameworks, which 
seek to ensure that cyber risks are consistently assessed, 
monitored and managed in line with wider enterprise risks 
and compliance obligations.

Ransomware

Ransomware is a prevalent threat to organisations 
worldwide. While ransomware attacks are pervasive, 
there was a significant increase in their volume and 
sophistication globally as organisations moved to 
mass working-from-home arrangements in 2020 due 
to COVID-19. Research 1 indicates a 1,070% increase 
in ransomware attacks between July 2020 and 
June 2021. This trend continued throughout 2022. 

In response, QBE has dedicated programs focused 
on ransomware business resiliency. We prioritise 
application recoverability for core business processes 
across all technology dependencies. Internal and 
external assessments are regularly conducted 
to test controls.

08_Report/report-ransomware-survery.pdf

Culture and awareness

We invest in a comprehensive, multi-channel 
global awareness program to empower our people 
to understand cyber risks at work and at home. 
The program includes regular phishing simulations, 
which aim to mimic real-world, sophisticated phishing 
attacks, to train our people to recognise and report 
malicious emails (often the entry point of cyberattacks).

The program also encompasses online compliance 
training, face-to-face presentations, and cyber safety 
communications to assist our people to stay safe online 
and in their everyday business interactions. We also 
conduct tailored training for specific roles that have 
a heightened risk of being targeted by cybercriminals, 
given the nature of the information/access connected 
to the role. Key metrics used to measure secure 
behaviour, including phishing simulation results and 
compliance training completion rates, are reported 
to senior leaders and Group and divisional Boards.

QBE Ventures

QBE Ventures is our venture 
development and investment arm, 
which invests in technology start-ups 
and venture funds that are aligned 
to QBE’s purpose of enabling a 
more resilient future. In October 
2022, QBE Ventures invested in an 
early-stage Australian-based tech 
firm, iluminr, whose award-winning 
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platform 
helps organisations identify and 
manage crises and threats through 
a set of cloud-based simulation, 
compliance, and response tools. 
Using gamification, automation and 
data insights, the platform provides 
microsimulations that enable 
companies to uplift their resilience 
against crises such as cyberattacks, 
supply chain disruptions, natural 
disasters, and COVID-related 
challenges. Since COVID-19, 
organisations have changed 
significantly, and iluminr helps them 
to prepare and respond to disruptions 
in a way that accommodates the new 
hybrid work environment.

Our customers and employees rely on technology 
to access, or deliver, our products and services. 
Our focus remains on delivering an environment 
that is stable, secure and sustainable as part of our 
overall approach to organisational resilience.

Throughout 2022, we have continued modernising our information technology 
(IT) systems, with ongoing upgrades to foundational capabilities and further 
investments in digitisation. Our technology priorities are aligned with divisional 
business strategies and form part of the overarching technology strategy 
overseen by QBE’s Group Board. A clear emphasis within this strategy is on 
keeping our IT current to mitigate against security and stability risks arising 
out of exposure to older technologies. We are also focused on automating 
operational processes – such as testing, deployment and security scanning 
– to improve our delivery speed, consistency and quality. 

To do this, QBE maintains divisionally aligned technology teams responsible 
for the technology assets of the local business, supported by shared services 
functions providing enterprise-wide capabilities such as service management, 
security services, networks, infrastructure support and workplace technologies. 
We use trusted third parties to provide a range of application development 
and management services. We leverage our Third-Party Risk Management 
Framework and related policies, such as our Group Material Outsourcing 
Policy, to govern these arrangements. We have increasingly invested in our 
own internal technology capability, for example, by establishing an automation 
‘centre of excellence’ in our Group Shared Services Centre, to provide a range 
of sourcing options to increase flexibility and resilience.

QBE’s technology teams operate in accordance with the IT Risk Management 
Framework (part of QBE’s overall Risk Management Strategy), with Minimum 
Control standards in place across the IT delivery life cycle, including 
expectations for ongoing disaster recovery and security testing. Adherence 
to control standards is tested annually through the Risk and Control 
Self-Assessment process to identify areas requiring improvement. Key Risk 
Indicators and Service Level Agreements are monitored monthly across both 
external partners and internal teams to ensure effective delivery of activities 
within our risk appetite and against stakeholder expectations.

Innovation and technology will continue to be central to QBE’s overall 
purpose and strategy. Increasing digitisation and automation of processes 
are fundamental to meeting customer and partner expectations, as well 
as supporting our overall organisational effectiveness. Digitisation relies 
on data, and we are investing in strengthening our approach to the acquisition, 
management and governance of data at both a divisional and Group 
level with the:

• establishment of a Group Data Office; and

• development of an overarching enterprise-wide data strategy to promote 
our effective use and control of data assets. 

This data team will play an important role in the insurance-associated emissions 
projects to meet our net-zero underwriting commitments.

Driving cultural change 

In 2022, we progressed the implementation of our Culture 
Blueprint to drive QBE towards our target culture and tracked 
our progress through our Culture Dashboard. 

In January, we launched our new organisational purpose: 
QBE – enabling a more resilient future. Throughout this 
year, we have focused on making the purpose tangible 
for our people, partners, and customers, and aligning what 
we do to our purpose. 

We continued to embed our QBE DNA behaviours through 
a refreshed employee incentive program and celebrated role 
models through our DNA Champions Award. 

In recognition of our Culture Transformation, we were 
awarded the Organisational Development Award at the 2022 
Australian HR Institute (AHRI) Awards.

Employee engagement

At QBE, we are committed to continually improving our 
employee experience, wellbeing, safety, and workplace 
environment. We strive for a culture that embraces diversity, 
seeks feedback, and encourages people to speak up. 

Voice, our employee listening program, provides 
an opportunity for our people to give feedback on their 
experience working at QBE through short, sharp, and 
frequent tailored Pulse surveys, putting meaningful data 
directly in the hands of our people leaders. Our listening 
approach gives us a deeper understanding of what is driving 
engagement, enabling us to focus on opportunities to take 
action, and giving us the ability to measure impact over time.

Our Engaged Employee Index was introduced in 2021, 
measuring how proud our people feel to work for QBE, their 
commitment, enthusiasm, feelings of being valued, and sense 
of accomplishment with their work, and whether they would 
recommend QBE as a great workplace. Please refer to the 
data book for our results.

Leadership and development

To support progress against our strategic agenda 
and embed our target state culture, we launched 
three new enterprise leadership groups: Growth 
Leaders Forum (GLF), Enterprise Talent Group (ETG) 
and Enterprise Leaders’ Network (ELN), investing 
in the development of our future leaders and 
mobilising them around our strategic priorities. 

The GLF and ETG are made up of leaders 
who demonstrate potential to take on broader 
and more complex roles. These groups have 
participated in cutting edge development 
interventions, opportunities for cross-divisional 
peer networking, as well as on-the-job experiences. 
The ELN brings together our GLF, ETG and 
all Level 1 and 2 leaders, equipping them to 
communicate and embed our strategy across 
the business, and bring our shared purpose and 
vision to life.

The creation of these groups has seen us 
strengthen our succession pipeline and bring 
the enterprise together through global peer 
learning groups.

People are at the heart of our business 
and bring their own diverse perspectives 
and lived experiences to work. Because 
we see the benefits that this rich 
diversity brings, Inclusion of Diversity 
(IoD) is a fundamental component of our 
QBE DNA – it is part of who we are and 
how we operate.

We believe that creating a workplace culture and influencing 
the external environment so that our people, customers, 
suppliers, and stakeholders feel included is essential to our 
success, now and into the future. This ambition aligns to our 
focus area 2 goals, helping to enable a sustainable and 
resilient workforce.

A refreshed approach 
to Inclusion of Diversity  

In early 2022, we launched our new approach to IoD. At QBE, 
we have a broad view of diversity that includes all the ways 
that people are visibly, and invisibly, different. We know that 
to realise the benefits of this, we must create an environment 
where everyone is, and feels that they are, included.

Our refreshed IoD policy sets out our expectations for 
how we interact with each other, and our aspiration to 
be a positive influence for inclusion of diversity beyond the 
boundaries of our organisation. To support our ambitions, 
we have continued to improve our approach to people data 
collection, consistency and quality, and we have developed 
new inclusion targets for 2023, going beyond gender to 
consider equality of belonging, based on ethnicity, disability, 
and LGBTIQ+ identification. Additionally, to maintain progress 
with women in leadership targets, and in line with our 40:40 
Vision pledge, a new target for 2027 will be introduced in 
2025 for an improvement from the 2025 baseline.

Talking to our people about inclusion   

To celebrate the launch of our refreshed policy and approach 
at QBE, we ran a series of IoD roundtable discussions through 
February and March, which over 700 people attended globally. 

In these sessions, we heard from our Group Executive 
Committee (GEC), senior leaders, and a world-renowned 
inclusion expert and thought leader, Professor Juliet Bourke, PhD. 
We explored our refreshed approach to IoD, the business case for 
inclusion, and heard practical advice on how to build inclusion. 

We used the powerful insights, shared by our people, to create a 
tip sheet on ways to build inclusion through everyday interactions.

Continued progress on  
gender equality    

In 2022, we continued to make headway towards our target 
of 40% women in leadership 1 across QBE, with an increase 
over last year from 35.9% to 38.6%. This year, QBE achieved 
our 2025 goal of 40% women on the Group Board early, 
reaching 44% with the appointment of Yasmin Allen 
in July 2022.

To further QBE’s commitment to gender diversity, in May 
2022, QBE became the first insurer to sign up to HESTA’s 
40:40 Vision, an initiative supporting diversity in executive 
leadership in ASX300 companies. We pledged to have 40% 
women, 40% men and 20% any gender on the GEC by 2030 
– something we already currently meet, with 45% women. 

To further our commitment to gender equality, our Group 
Chief Executive Officer joined our Australia Pacific Chief 
Executive Officer in becoming a member of the Champions 
of Change Coalition (CCC). The CCC is a globally recognised 
coalition – with members from major sectors of the economy 
including business, government, community, academic and 
not-for-profit organisations – for advancing diverse and more 
women in leadership, and furthering our progress toward 
building an inclusive and respectful workplace.

Beyond these commitments and actions, we continue 
to identify opportunities for further progress, and to develop 
targeted initiatives to address attraction, progression, and 
retention of women in leadership at QBE. 

Pay equity  

At QBE, we strongly believe in equal pay for equal work. 
We regularly assess pay equity in our workforce based 
on key drivers such as role, location, and performance, 
enabling us to identify areas for improvement, and giving 
us confidence that we have gender pay equity on a 
like-for-like basis. We recognise that some pay gaps remain 
at an individual level, and will continue to work to address any 
gaps through our ongoing annual salary review processes.

In Europe, the scope of our pay equity review now also 
includes both gender and ethnicity. We will continue our 
external ethnicity pay gap reporting beyond 2022, and have 
introduced ethnicity targets to support progress in this area.

Diversity in our supply chain 

QBE’s Supplier Sustainability Principles outline our desire 
to work with businesses reflecting the diverse nature 
of the communities we serve. This includes minority and 
First Nations businesses, disability and social enterprises 
and female-owned and/or led businesses.

Wellbeing 

In 2022, the world began to emerge from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. As our employees embraced 
the ‘new normal’, geo-political, social and 
environmental challenges contributed to further 
uncertainty and change. Wellbeing remains 
a priority at QBE, and we continue to seek to create 
a safe, supportive and engaging environment 
to enable a more positive and resilient future 
for our people.

Supporting our people’s resilience 

One swift action we took in response to the 
increasing inflationary pressures was to 
make an out-of-cycle pay increase of 3% for 
employees across the Group, excluding the 
most senior leaders.

Local offerings provided further wellbeing support 
to our people. In Australia, we launched Thriving 
at our Best, a refreshed holistic wellbeing program 
that encapsulates three focus areas – Healthy 
People, Healthy Teams and a Healthy Workplace. 
Europe’s new wellbeing strategy, At our Best, aims 
to create meaningful change in people’s lives 
by helping them to understand and tackle the 
systemic causes of stress and burnout.

Work, health and safety 

We maintain robust work, health and safety (WHS) 
controls across the business, with detailed risk 
assessment and control plans in place to mitigate 
WHS hazards. A Group policy governs our standards. 
Our WHS processes and resources are extensive, 
including ergonomic assessment, support, and equipment, 
as appropriate; workers' compensation personnel; 
psychological health initiatives; online mandatory training; 
regular site safety inspections; workplace incident, ’near 
miss’ and claims registers; first aid, mental health and 
domestic violence support training; and online counselling. 
WHS committees and working groups convene to share 
initiatives, trends and best practice, and update the Group 

Board on global WHS developments and risks.

91%
of new Australia Pacific 
suppliers comply 
with our Supplier 
Sustainability 
Principles
against our target of 90%

In 2022, we continued our objective to minimise 
the potential harmful impacts of our operations 
on the environment, and communities in which 
we operate, through our new supplier onboarding 
process and through progressing operational policies 
to reduce emissions. 

QBE aims to mitigate any potential adverse impacts arising from our operations 
by taking appropriate action, including the leveraging of our business relationships. 
Our Supplier Sustainability Principles (SSPs) set minimum expectations of our 
suppliers. We seek to engage suppliers and partners who share our commitment 
to sustainability, and who will work with us to achieve our objectives. In 2022, we 
continued our human rights due diligence approach to supplier modern slavery 
risk. As part of our process, suppliers flagged for medium and high modern slavery 
risk exposure are subject to additional questions and internal reviews of their 
responses, risk profile, and of their policies and practices.

As part of embedding our strategy, commitments and philosophy, we developed 
the Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) Policy, which outlines the approach 
for effectively managing risks related to the third parties with whom we work. 
The policy is fully aligned with our Third-Party Minimum Standard, which provides 
a consistent framework, or set of controls and metrics, to help manage our 
third-party relationships. The policy also provides clarity for relationship owners 
on their requirements for managing an external provider. The framework includes 
risk domains such as Information Security, Privacy, Modern Slavery, Financial 
Crime, Conduct Risk and Business Continuity. It provides clarity regarding relevant 
legislative and regulatory requirements applicable to QBE, and is expected 
to be applied to third parties we engage, at each stage of the TPRM life cycle. 
In 2022, we formed the TPRM Steering Committee, with responsibility for TPRM 
governance and oversight. The committee is also responsible for monitoring and 
horizon scanning for emerging legislation, reviewing the effectiveness of our TPRM

91%
of new Australia Pacific 
suppliers comply 
with our Supplier 
Sustainability 
Principles
against our target of 90%

In 2022, we continued our objective to minimise 
the potential harmful impacts of our operations 
on the environment, and communities in which 
we operate, through our new supplier onboarding 
process and through progressing operational policies 
to reduce emissions. 

QBE aims to mitigate any potential adverse impacts arising from our operations 
by taking appropriate action, including the leveraging of our business relationships. 
Our Supplier Sustainability Principles (SSPs) set minimum expectations of our 
suppliers. We seek to engage suppliers and partners who share our commitment 
to sustainability, and who will work with us to achieve our objectives. In 2022, we 
continued our human rights due diligence approach to supplier modern slavery 
risk. As part of our process, suppliers flagged for medium and high modern slavery 
risk exposure are subject to additional questions and internal reviews of their 
responses, risk profile, and of their policies and practices.

As part of embedding our strategy, commitments and philosophy, we developed 
the Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) Policy, which outlines the approach 
for effectively managing risks related to the third parties with whom we work. 
The policy is fully aligned with our Third-Party Minimum Standard, which provides 
a consistent framework, or set of controls and metrics, to help manage our 
third-party relationships. The policy also provides clarity for relationship owners 
on their requirements for managing an external provider. The framework includes 
risk domains such as Information Security, Privacy, Modern Slavery, Financial 
Crime, Conduct Risk and Business Continuity. It provides clarity regarding relevant 
legislative and regulatory requirements applicable to QBE, and is expected 
to be applied to third parties we engage, at each stage of the TPRM life cycle. 
In 2022, we formed the TPRM Steering Committee, with responsibility for TPRM 
governance and oversight. The committee is also responsible for monitoring and 
horizon scanning for emerging legislation, reviewing the effectiveness of our TPRM 
framework regularly and recommending amendments.

QBE is committed to a fair sourcing process that seeks 
to offer equal opportunities to third-party suppliers globally. 
We work with our suppliers to promote and uphold high 
sustainability standards in our supply chain by clearly 
communicating our environmental and social expectations. 
We encourage Inclusion of Diversity in our global supply 
chain. Our SSPs outline our desire to work with businesses 
reflecting the diverse nature of the people and communities 
we serve, including minority and First Nations businesses, 
disability and social enterprises, female-owned and/or led 
businesses, our community and global aid partners, and 
other not-for-profit organisations. 

QBE Australia Pacific

In Australia Pacific, our Indirect and Claims Procurement 
teams’ approach to sustainable procurement is underpinned 
by our Sustainable Procurement Strategy, launched in 
mid-2021 with alignment to the global TPRM framework and 
the Group Sustainability Strategy. In 2022, we continued our 
relationship with Supply Nation and focused on alignment 
with the SSPs for all new suppliers, achieving adherence 
of 91% against our goal of 90%. The scope of the SSPs 
is currently being increased to include New Zealand and 
Pacific operations. We are driving a greater focus on supplier 
diversity across the business by highlighting the benefit and 
positive social impact of spend, and looking at the best ways 
to track and measure this. Where possible and appropriate, 
we are introducing an ESG sourcing component to sourcing 
initiatives to drive focus and business engagement.

In 2023, we will be progressing sustainability conversations 
with the larger suppliers in our global supply chain. We will 
focus on their net-zero commitments and initiatives they have 
in place. Our approach will be one of collaboration to share 
our learnings from supplier discussions across categories 
and global divisions. 

QBE North America

North America (NA) Procurement is in the process of 
rolling out a more consistent approach to TPRM, taking 
into consideration risk domains in support of sustainability 
including modern slavery and conduct risk. The NA 
Procurement team established a licence with a supplier 
data provider that includes a module on ESG for use by our 
people. This information module will be evaluated in 2023 
to determine its relevance to QBE’s sustainability objectives. 

QBE International

In Europe (EO), our Claims teams have launched initiatives 
such as the introduction of loss adjuster panel contracts that 
include commitments to reduce CO2 emissions. They are also 
trialling with Sedgwick, a UK-based provider of technology-
enabled risk, benefits and integrated business solutions, 
to identify viability and cost implications of 'building back 
better’, improving resilience using post-disaster reconstruction 
and recovery methods. EO Indirect Procurement has been 
focused on implementing the SSPs into their sourcing 
process. We are currently making them a standard contractual 
requirement. This was launched in January 2023.

Operational excellence continued

We continue to drive improvements in operational performance 
with the goal of modernising our business to enhance customer 
experience and reduce complexity in our products and services.

QBE International

In 2022, QBE Asia won a total of three awards – two Digital 
Insurance Initiative of the Year awards and an Insurtech 
Initiative of the Year award at the Insurance Asia Awards. 
These awards are a recognition of our outstanding 
achievement in delivering exceptional value and operational 
excellence for our customers, business partners, employees 
and the community.

Our progress in two digital initiatives has elevated 
operational efficiency and sales productivity, while delivering 
a more seamless and personalised customer experience. 
Firstly, in Hong Kong and Singapore, QBE introduced a new 
end-to-end digital Interior Renovation Prestige product in 
August 2021. This product streamlines the administrative 
process to provide immediate issuance of online certificates 
of insurance to minimise delays in customer renovation 
works. The entire process is fast and effective, with 
built-in, easy-to-use features, allowing customers to access 
around-the-clock, one-stop-shop services. Secondly, as part of 
improving our operational efficiency, we launched a Renewal 
Pricing Strategies Solution, an optimisation and automation 
engine where technologies are uniquely configured in a way 
to enhance our pre-renewal process with data-driven and 
risk-adjusted insights. 

QBE North America

In North America, our new pricing platform has helped 
progress our sustainability agenda by driving impactful 
improvements for our teams, customers, and the community. 

It reduces the amount of key entry by underwriters, 
enables information lookups by linking to internal and 
external data sources, and reduces the amount of work 
our actuaries must do to monitor usage, performance and 
adherence to technical premium. This integration provides 
greater governance, offering a valuable, long-term solution 
that aims to increase monitoring of model performance 
and usage. It also allows for better tracking of sold premium 
to technical premium. The platform allows QBE to quickly 
and easily deploy new models to support our business 
in response to market changes, and for our program partners 
to connect to these models. The updated pricing platform 
has proven to be a valuable tool to support the success 
and sustainability of our business.

QBE Australia Pacific

In Australia Pacific, we have delivered the first iteration of 
our Claims Payments Automation initiative under our Claims 
Value Stream. This first iteration has automated the payment 
of certain supplier invoices for property claims, replacing 
manual processes. It reduces claim duration and saves our 
Claims teams significant effort, improving our responsiveness, 
our supplier relationships, and making QBE easier to do 
business with. Our Claims teams are close to deploying 
the second iteration of this initiative, which will expand the 
scope of automation for property claims. A third iteration will 
soon commence, with activities aimed at automating motor 
supplier invoice payments. We plan to further evolve and 
expand across multiple business lines and supplier types 
over the next two to three years.

Wherever we operate, we are committed to 
understanding and managing the direct, and 
indirect, environmental impacts of our operations 
to try to minimise them. 

Reducing our emissions

In 2022, we continued to deliver on our internal net-zero roadmap. We extended 
our 2030 commitment to net zero, for our global operations, to include material 
Scope 3 emissions (in addition to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions). 

This year our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 75% lower than in 2018 (our Scope 1 
and 2 emissions target base year). Our Scope 3 emissions have increased just 
4% since 2018 despite the inclusion of additional emissions sources such as those 
attributable to employee commuting, fuel and energy-related services (which 
includes upstream energy), capital goods and downstream leased assets. In 2022, 
relative to 2021, Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions have increased as we’ve reverted 
to a business-as-usual operating environment that included increased office 
occupancy, business travel and commuting. Our emissions data and measurement 
approach are described in our data book, and we will continue to improve the way 
we measure and capture our Scope 3 emissions as guided by appropriate practices, 
frameworks and standards.

Emissions from fuel use in fleet vehicles make up most of our Scope 1 emissions 
and, for United Kingdom-based employees, we have implemented an updated 
policy for our fleet vehicles, stipulating that we will only use hybrid and electric 
vehicles. Our Australian fleet is now made up of 49% hybrid vehicles and 
in North America, 87% of our fleet have RAM eTorque engines (a ‘mild hybrid’, 
fuel-efficient technology). 

Our Scope 2 emissions are a result of purchased electricity and heat across our 
operations. This year, 100% of our electricity use across QBE offices (excluding 
the Pacific Islands and Bermuda) was certified as renewable, supporting our RE100 
commitment to 100% renewable electricity by 2025. In our smaller operations 
in the Pacific Islands and Bermuda, where we are unable to source certified 
renewable electricity, we continued to implement energy efficiency opportunities 
during 2022 including LED lighting, appliance upgrades, and introducing sensors 
and timers for lights and air conditioning. We achieved our first 6 Star Green Star 
Interiors v1.3 rating for our new Parramatta office and have further optimised the 
office space we occupy in line with our new ways of working, releasing surplus 
floorspace in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and 
Hong Kong. 

We have maintained carbon neutrality3 for our defined inventory of emissions 
related to our global operations, as defined in our sustainability data book. 
This is achieved by offsetting our residual emissions with certified carbon credits 
generated from renewable energy and land fire abatement projects.

Industry excellence

We continue to be recognised for our focus on environmental sustainability. In 2022, 
we were recognised as the inaugural winner of the Excellence in Environmental, 
Social and Governance Change at the 2022 Australian Insurance Industry Awards, 
hosted by the Australian and New Zealand Institute of Insurance and Finance. 
Additionally, we were awarded Green Insurer of the Year for the third year 
running  by comparison site Finder.

QBE seeks to maintain a culture that rewards transparency, integrity, 
and performance. We believe this promotes the long-term sustainability 
and ongoing success of our business, and is critical to better stakeholder 
outcomes. We are committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance, conduct and compliance.

Our Group Board and management oversee our Group governance framework. 
Our Group Executive Committee (GEC) has executive accountability for corporate 
governance-related matters. Our Group Chief Compliance Officer leads our 
Group compliance function, providing independent assurance and oversight that 
compliance is managed appropriately across QBE. 

Our Group Code of Ethics and Conduct (Code) sets the professional standards 
we expect of everyone at QBE. We review our Code annually, seeking to ensure 
it remains current and effective in an ever-changing risk environment. It outlines 
expected standards of professionalism across the Group, emphasising our 
commitment to governance and accountability, and to our purpose and vision. 
QBE employees are required to complete mandatory training annually, including 
Code training, and 99.4% of employees completed their mandatory training by 
the due date in 2022. 

Breaches of our Code are taken seriously and are reviewed to determine if, 
and what, consequences should apply. Potential consequences can range from 
informal coaching and development to a formal warning, impacted remuneration, 
or termination of employment.

We define ‘conduct risk’ as the risk that actions by QBE (including inaction) result in 
unfair outcomes for our customers, communities or stakeholders or detriment to market 
integrity. Our Group Conduct Risk Policy sets our expectations for managing conduct 
risk across our business. Our Executive Risk Committee has oversight of conduct risk.

We believe that managing obligations and non-financial risks is critical to achieving 
better stakeholder outcomes. As part of our performance rating system, ME@QBE, 
employees now receive two performance ratings for what goals they achieve, and 
how they achieve them during their annual review.

Building trust with our stakeholders, and transparency in all 
our dealings, are important to us. We do this through public 
reporting, including via our:

• Annual and half-yearly reports;

• Financial Inclusion Action Plan progress updates;

• Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement; 

• Our climate-related financial disclosures prepared 
in accordance with the recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which 
track our exposure to climate risk;

• Annual CDP reporting; and

• Annual Sustainability Report. 

Responsibility for these disclosures is shared by functions 
across QBE but, ultimately, the Group Board is accountable 
for, and approves, all public reports. There are benchmarking 
disclosures associated with submissions such as S&P’s 
Corporate Sustainability Assessment and the CDP that 
are approved by the Group Chief Executive Officer. 

We have developed a Global Consequence Management 
Policy that provides a set of consistent principles for the 
treatment of conduct that falls below QBE standards. 
This will be rolled out during 2023 and into 2024. 

Tax transparency strategy

QBE supports the voluntary Australian Tax Transparency 
Code, a set of principles and minimum standards on 
public disclosure of tax information by medium and large 
businesses. We publish an annual Tax Transparency Report 
outlining our tax strategy and governance. We seek to 
comply with all applicable tax laws, regulations and disclosure 
requirements. We also seek to pay the amount that is legally 
required to be paid in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 
QBE supports the principle behind multilateral moves towards 
greater transparency within the corporate sector to increase 
community understanding of the corporate sector’s 
compliance with tax laws, and build public trust. 

The Group Board has oversight of tax governance through 
the Group’s tax risk framework, with local boards having 
oversight of divisional tax governance. Operationally, the 
Group Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the Group’s 
tax risk management and for ensuring the implementation 
of the framework. The Group Chief Financial Officer is assisted 
by the Group Head of Tax and divisional Chief Financial 
Officers to ensure that: 

• policies and procedures that support the framework are 
in place and are maintained and applied consistently across 
the Group; and 

• our tax teams have the skills and experience to appropriately 
implement the framework.

Reconciliation Action Plan

Consistent with our focus on greater First Nations 
inclusion, in 2022, we continued to progress our 
‘Innovate’ level Reconciliation Action Plan (2020–2022) 
(RAP). We remain committed to creating meaningful and 
respectful relationships with, and promoting sustainable 
opportunities for, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples, communities, organisations and businesses.

As a global organisation that was established 
in Australia, we seek to use our platform and sphere 
of influence to drive ongoing change, be active allies, 
and continue to show our respect through listening to, 
and learning from and about, the oldest living culture 
on earth. 

Our RAP Committee plays an active role in driving 
greater inclusion within QBE for Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander employees, customers, suppliers and 
community. We will launch our fourth RAP in 2023.

Privacy

We are committed to respecting the privacy of our customers, employees, 
and other stakeholders, the protection of their personal data from misuse 
or unauthorised disclosure, and compliance with privacy laws. 

QBE maintains a Global Privacy Framework that defines 
the core principles of our privacy program, and provides 
the foundation for how QBE seeks to comply with applicable 
privacy laws globally. This framework was reviewed and 
updated in 2022, and is summarised at Global Privacy 
Framework and Privacy Approach Summary. 

Our Global Privacy Framework is governed centrally through 
our Group Compliance team: the Group Privacy Officer 
reports to the Group Chief Compliance Officer who, in turn, 
reports to the Group Chief Risk Officer. Additional, divisional 
privacy programs are managed locally. 

We also have a Global Privacy Council that is chaired by the 
Group Privacy Officer. Its membership includes local divisional 
privacy officers or privacy compliance leads (or equivalent), 
Legal, IT-security and compliance personnel. The Global 
Privacy Council is an advisory, information-sharing and 
evaluation group that considers global (or multi-divisional) 
matters with high potential for, or actual, privacy implications. 
We consider and assess privacy risk locally and globally, 
including undertaking global privacy impact assessments 

via the Global Privacy Council for activities that involve 
multiple divisions with high, or potentially high, privacy risk. 

All QBE staff receive compliance training. This includes 
Information Security and Privacy training that is relevant 
to the employee’s role. The online training course content 
includes topics such as data protection; collection, storage 
and security of personal data; sensitive personal data; and 
dealing with data breaches.

We maintain a Group Personal Data Breach Standard that was 
reviewed and renewed in 2022. This outlines our procedures, 
including steps for responding to actual, or potential, QBE 
Group personal data breaches.

As part of continuous improvement, the QBE Group 
Privacy function was subject to an external review in 2022, 
resulting in improvements being implemented in relation 
to governance and privacy operations.

Our Group Privacy Policy is available on our website.

to the employee’s role. The online training course content 
includes topics such as data protection; collection, storage 
and security of personal data; sensitive personal data; and 
dealing with data breaches.

We maintain a Group Personal Data Breach Standard that was 
reviewed and renewed in 2022. This outlines our procedures, 
including steps for responding to actual, or potential, QBE 
Group personal data breaches.

As part of continuous improvement, the QBE Group 
Privacy function was subject to an external review in 2022, 
resulting in improvements being implemented in relation 
to governance and privacy operations.

Our Group Privacy Policy is available on our website.

Human rights and modern slavery

As a global insurer and reinsurer with diverse 
and complex operations and supply chains, 
we recognise that we have the potential to 
negatively impact human rights, causing harm 
to individuals and communities. Any actual, 
or potential, violation of human rights is likely 
to have multifaceted risk consequences, such as 
reputation, brand, financial, legal, regulatory and 
operational risk. QBE rejects any form of slavery 
and takes active measures to prevent modern 
slavery risk throughout our supply chain. 

In 2021, we released our Group Human Rights Policy, which outlines 
our guiding principles and helps to integrate human rights considerations 
into existing policies, procedures, frameworks and decision-making tools 
across our business.

The Group Board oversees human rights and modern slavery-related 
issues at QBE in line with our broader approach to sustainability. 
The Board received five updates in 2022 in relation to our action 
plan. Our Human Rights and Modern Slavery Action Plan will 
be delivered through enterprise-wide cross-functional collaboration 
with subject-matter experts across the business.

Group Conduct Reporting & Whistleblower Policy

Depending on the issue or their location, our people can report 
concerns to their manager, a senior manager or a relevant team, 
including People, Compliance, Legal, Risk or Procurement. The criteria for 
legal whistleblowing protections are jurisdiction dependent. Concerns can 
also be reported confidentially, including anonymously (where permitted), 
24/7/365 via phone or web to our QBE Ethics Hotline, a specialist 
third-party reporting service, supporting numerous languages, and 
available in most QBE locations. These channels are further supported 
by our Code, Group Conduct Reporting & Whistleblower Policy, and 
supporting documents. Concerns will be investigated in accordance 
with the requirements of the relevant whistleblowing protections and 
policy, where applicable. To the extent possible, reports will be kept 
confidential, and those who report will be kept updated. Where reports 
are substantiated, we will take appropriate action and document outcomes. 
QBE will not tolerate actual or threatened detrimental treatment, including 
retaliation, against anyone who has, or intends to, raise a concern. 

Human rights assessment 
as an employer 

In 2021, QBE assessed that 11 of 
31 countries where we have people 
located are considered to be medium-
risk to high-risk in relation to potential 
human rights issues. Five of these 
countries are deemed to be high-risk, 
and we used reputable sources to 
understand the potential human 
rights risks. The Group Sustainability 
and ESG Risk teams engaged with 
local teams to understand contexts 
and cultural sensitivities around 
a wide range of human rights 
topics. We designed a checklist 
of risk indicators to further assess 
human rights risk controls within our 
workforce management practices. 

Our assessment indicated that we 
have adequate and relevant controls 
in the form of local procedures, 
and processes in place to protect 
our employees’ rights wherever 
we operate. The process also 
highlighted areas of opportunities 
for reconsidering certain human 
rights at a country level, such as the 
relevance of the right of assembly or 
explicit acceptance of LGBTIQ+ rights. 
We will continue to engage with our 
local teams to strengthen existing 
controls and processes to protect 
our people.

Independent assurance report continued

Our responsibilities

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence 
we have obtained. 

Our engagement has been conducted in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements (ASAE 3000) 
Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and Australian Standard on 
Assurance Engagements (ASAE 3410) Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements. These standards require 
that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether anything has come to our attention 
to indicate that the Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria, for the Period. 
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included:

• Performing enquiry procedures with management to understand processes, systems and controls involved in the collection, 
measurement and presentation of the Subject Matter;

• Reconciling the Subject Matter with the QBE’s underlying records;

• Agreeing data sources back to source or third-party documentation on a sample basis;

• Undertaking analytical review procedures over data and obtaining explanations from management regarding unusual 
or unexpected amounts;

• Assessing the reasonableness of measurement methods, any material estimates, and assumptions described in the 
Reporting Criteria and used in preparing the Subject Matter; 

• Reperforming a sample of calculations performed by management in the measurement of the Reporting Criteria; and

• Reviewing the Group’s Reporting Criteria and testing its application in preparation of the Subject Matter.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, 
a reasonable assurance engagement and consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been 
performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion. 

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

Use of report

This report was prepared for the Directors of QBE. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this 
report to any persons or users other than the Directors of QBE, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.

Inherent limitations 

The Subject Matter reported by the Group needs to be read and understood together with the Criteria, which the Group 
is solely responsible for selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw 
to evaluate and measure the Subject Matter allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect 
comparability between entities and over time. 

Non-financial performance information is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given the 
characteristics of the underlying subject matter and the methods used for determining such information. The precision 
of different measurement techniques may also vary.

Because of the inherent limitations of any assurance engagement due to the selective testing of information examined, 
it is possible that fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be detected. A limited assurance engagement is not 
designed to detect all instances of non-compliance of the Subject Matter with the Criteria, as it is limited primarily to making 
enquiries of management and applying analytical procedures. The limited assurance conclusion expressed in this report has 
been formed on the above basis.

This report was prepared for the Directors of QBE. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this 
report to any persons or users other than the Directors of QBE, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.

Inherent limitations 

The Subject Matter reported by the Group needs to be read and understood together with the Criteria, which the Group 
is solely responsible for selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw

enquiries of management and applying analytical procedures. The limited assurance conclusion expressed in this report has 
been formed on the above basis.

Emphasis of matter – Estimation of ‘Total of selected Scope 3 emissions’ metric

The estimation of ‘Total of selected Scope 3 emissions’ reported by QBE relies on assumptions and available sources of primary, 
secondary and proxy data across different sources of Scope 3 emissions. We draw attention to the Reporting Criteria that 
describes these assumptions and data sources for different Scope 3 emissions sources along with the exclusion of Category 1: 
Supplier Emissions and Category 15: Investments from calculation of ‘Total of selected Scope 3 emissions’ metric.   

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Basis for qualified conclusion

During the course of our engagement, QBE made changes to the processes used to extract and aggregate data used 
in the preparation of the ‘Parental leave – return and retention’ metrics. These changes were made to improve management’s 
confidence that underlying data had been prepared on a consistent basis across geographies and in accordance with the 
Reporting Criteria. 

The timing of the changes to QBE’s processes meant that we were unable to undertake procedures that would provide 
us with sufficient and appropriate evidence to conclude on the ‘Parental leave – return and retention’ metrics as at the date 
of this limited assurance report. 

Qualified conclusion

Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, except for the matter disclosed in the Basis for Qualification 
paragraph above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter have not been prepared, 
in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria for the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022.
