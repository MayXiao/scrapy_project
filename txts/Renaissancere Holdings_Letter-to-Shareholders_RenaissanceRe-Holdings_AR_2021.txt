Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholders,
For us, 2021 was a year of abundant opportunity and strong 

growth. We set challenging objectives, excelled against them, 

and are a stronger company with a more resilient earnings 

stream. We achieved this due to:

• strong top-line growth, 

• robust capital management,

• solid expense management,

• improved profitability and efficiency in our underwriting 

portfolio,

• increased scale in our Capital Partners business, and 

• an investment portfolio positioned to benefit from a rising 

rate environment. 

These accomplishments are the direct result of a multi-year 

strategic journey that has positioned us to outperform in 2022 

and beyond. 

Ten years ago, we recognized that the reinsurance market was 

evolving rapidly. Investors were seeking yield, making capital 

increasingly more interested in reinsurance risk. We set out to 

build the capabilities and scale needed to generate superior 

returns in this changing marketplace. This meant diversifying 

both geographically and into traditional casualty lines. We 

began by forming our Lloyds’ syndicate, acquired Platinum 

and Tokio Millennium Re and accelerated the expansion of 

our Capital Partners business. This process culminated with 

our common equity capital raise in 2020, which afforded us 

the ability to lean into a dramatically improving reinsurance 

market. We did not hesitate. We have nearly tripled our net 

premiums written over the last three years, focusing on 

casualty, specialty and primary property excess & surplus 

(E&S) risks, all of which have experienced significant 

rate increases.

We knew that achieving this strategic imperative would 

require us to become more efficient. We set specific goals 

to increase our capital, investment and operating leverage – 

with a particular focus on managing expenses. In short, we 

transformed the profile of the Company to ensure that we 

could continue to maximize returns for our shareholders over 

the long term.

I. Our Performance in 2021

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

While we strategically outperformed in 2021, our financial 

performance in the year was impacted by the elevated 

frequency of natural catastrophe events, resulting in 

$2.9 billion in gross claims payments and a $962 million net 

negative impact1 to our financial results.

Against this backdrop, we reported a net loss attributable 

to our common shareholders of $73 million and operating 

income available to common shareholders of $82 million. 

Our return on average common equity was (1.1)% and our 

operating return on average common equity was 1.3%. Book 

value per common share decreased by 4.5% and our tangible 

book value per common share, plus change in accumulated 

dividends, decreased by 4%. In both cases, the decline was 

due in part to the repurchase of a substantial proportion of 

our shares at a multiple to book value. We believe that this 

will result in a long-term increase in earnings per share, and 

therefore benefit shareholders.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

We have built a Fortress Balance Sheet that provides us 

tremendous flexibility to create value for shareholders by 

actively managing how we deploy our capital. Our first 

preference is always to deploy any excess capital into 

profitable business opportunities, and second, to return the 

excess to our shareholders. We found ample opportunities in 

2021 to deploy capital into our business, and as a result we 

grew net premiums written by 45%. 

Thanks to strong rate improvements and improved capital 

efficiency in our underwriting portfolio, we were also able to 

return more than $1 billion of capital to shareholders through 

share repurchases. 

As part of a long-term strategy to minimize our cost of 

capital, we also issued $500 million of Series G Preference 

Shares with a fixed-for-life dividend of 4.20%, and used $275 

million of the proceeds to refinance our 5.375% Series E 

Preference Shares. We recognized an excellent opportunity 

to obtain permanent, fixed price capital at extremely attractive 

rates, and used the opportunity to bring down our overall 

cost of capital.

Finally, we paid common dividends of $68 million during the 

year and, despite the year’s catastrophe losses, increased our 

quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.

THREE DRIVERS OF PROFIT

Consistent with prior years, I would like to discuss our three 

drivers of profit, which are underwriting income, fee income 

and investment income.

Underwriting Income

Our first driver of profit is the income we earn on our core 

underwriting business. For the year, this was a loss of $109 

million, comprised of a loss of $186 million in our Property

quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.

THREE DRIVERS OF PROFIT

Consistent with prior years, I would like to discuss our three 

drivers of profit, which are underwriting income, fee income 

and investment income.

Underwriting Income

Our first driver of profit is the income we earn on our core 

underwriting business. For the year, this was a loss of $109 

million, comprised of a loss of $186 million in our Property 

segment offset by a gain of $77 million in our Casualty and 

Specialty segment.

The loss in the Property segment was driven by the year’s 

natural catastrophe events. Property catastrophe is a 

long-term business, and the cost of the returns that we are 

seeking is short-term volatility. Despite the year’s elevated 

losses, we remain confident in the risk we have assumed 

based on our strong modeling capabilities. Climate change 

increases uncertainty, which we address by sensitivity 

testing our portfolio and adjusting our models to maintain a 

conservative view of loss potential on both an occurrence and 

aggregate basis.

Even after adjusting for the effects of climate change and 

other factors such as inflation, we believe we are being 

paid well above our cost of capital to take catastrophe risk. 

The property market has enjoyed significant rate increases 

over the last 5 years. We are one of the most conservative 

and experienced modelers of climate change and natural 

catastrophe risk, which gives us considerable room to be 

wrong and still exceed our cost of capital. 

Our customers benefited from our protection this year, which 

is the nature of our business. Going forward, we believe 

there are many dynamics at play that should continue to 

drive increases in property rates and improve returns to 

shareholders, including:

• the poor performance of the industry over the last five years, 

especially in third-party capital, 

• the impact of social inflation, 

• the market’s increasing reluctance to accept volatility, 

• significantly reduced retro capacity, especially for higher 

frequency risk, and 

• increased cost of volatility that should raise primary 

insurers’ demand for hedges against their own volatility. 

We expect the net result of these various dynamics to be the 

reduced supply of, and increased demand for, the products 

that we sell, resulting in continuing increases in rates and 

growing profitability.

Our Casualty and Specialty segment had a strong year. We 

knowingly, and thoughtfully, began building our Casualty and 

Specialty business during a more challenging phase of the 

market with the intent that, by doing so, we could construct 

a portfolio with embedded options for growth. When the 

Casualty and Specialty market began to improve in 2019, we 

materially accelerated our growth, nearly tripling net premiums 

written over the last three years. 

We evaluate our Casualty and Specialty business over rolling 

ten-year periods. For the last few years, we have been writing

well-rated risk that we believe serves as the foundation for a 

strong portfolio with superior returns. We believe that we have 

timed this growth well and are excited about the improved 

profitability we are already beginning to see from a much 

larger portfolio in a much better market. 

Fee Income

Our second driver of profit is the fee income we earn on our 

Capital Partners business. For the year, management and 

performance fees totaled $129 million.

We successfully raised over $1.1 billion in capital across 

Upsilon, DaVinci, Vermeer and Medici in 2021 plus an 

additional $663 million for the January 1, 2022, renewal 

(with $468 million of the $1.8 billion total representing our 

co-investment alongside our partners). It was a challenging 

market to raise new funds, as third-party capital continued to 

experience fatigue due to a fifth consecutive year of elevated 

catastrophe losses and ongoing trapped collateral.

Our ability to raise significant funds in this environment was 

a testament to the deep experience of our Capital Partners 

team and the relationships we have built over more than 

20 years in this business. We offer a differentiated value 

proposition, with deep expertise and a commitment to share 

our investors’ risk.

In addition to the fee income it generates, our Capital 

Partners business increases our ability to optimize our 

Gross-to-Net strategy across all our balance sheets, 

enhancing Superior Risk Selection. This was evident at 

January 1, 2022, when we grew DaVinci by $500 million 

and increased the percentage of property catastrophe 

business we allocated to it. This was good for our customers, 

allowing us to continue to support their programs during a 

period of market dislocation; good for our third-party capital 

partners, who continue to benefit from our ability to access 

the best risk and build high quality efficient portfolios; and 

good for our shareholders, who will gain from increased 

fee income and optimized portfolio construction across all 

our vehicles.

Our Medici catastrophe bond fund continues to execute 

extremely well and had strong returns in 2021. Medici 

surpassed $1 billion in capital in the year, and we anticipate 

continued robust investor demand in 2022. Upsilon was 

affected by losses and trapped capital in 2021. At the 

January 1 renewal, we chose to restructure much of the 

aggregate and single limit programs typical of Upsilon to 

fit the appetite of our other vehicles, resulting in Upsilon 

deploying less than half the limit it did in 2021. 

Investment Income 

Our third driver of profit is investment income. We take a 

disciplined approach in building relatively conservative, 

well-structured portfolios with a focus on fixed income 

investments. As a result, our investment income over the 

last several years has been impacted by historically low 

interest rates. Looking forward, however, our investment 

portfolio is positioned to benefit from increasing interest 

rates. While rising rates would have an initial negative 

mark-to-market impact on our investment portfolio, due to 

our relatively low duration, we would expect to more than 

recoup these losses over time through reinvestment in higher 

yielding securities. 

CLIMATE CHANGE

Given the multiple weather-driven natural catastrophes the 

world experienced this year, climate change continues to be 

an important issue. The academic research as well as the 

recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th 

Assessment Report are aligning to a more unified view of how 

and when the climate is likely to change. We share the IPCC’s 

view, which is consistent with the way we reflect climate risk in 

our models. 

For almost two decades, we have invested heavily to 

understand the influence of climate change on the weather 

and its effect on the risk we take. RenaissanceRe Risk 

Sciences is the culmination of this investment. It provides 

us with a significant competitive advantage in assessing 

the impact of climate change, and allows us to continuously 

update our models to reflect the latest science.

But while climate change clearly drives weather, how much 

of the volatility experienced in the last few years is directly 

related to it? As with most real-world phenomena, the answer 

is a complex mix of interrelated causes. It is hard not to see 

the fingerprints of climate change when looking at the many 

record-breaking events of the last five years. But we also know 

that there are other environmental influences at work that 

result in alternating active and quiet periods for hurricanes 

and other climatic events. 

An equally important influence on recent volatility has been 

the impact of social inflation. As much as storms are getting 

stronger and more frequent, which we can model for, social 

inflation and outright fraud are also increasing loss costs in 

ways that are much more difficult to quantify. Building cost 

inflation – as well as the continuation of the social inflation we 

saw in Hurricane Irma in 2017 – are both playing a larger role 

in the cost of catastrophes in the United States and beyond. 

So, while we actively adjust our view of hurricane risk for the 

influence of climate change, we also reflect the impacts of 

social and building cost inflation when modeling and building 

our portfolios.

II. Purpose and ESG Strategy

PURPOSE, VISION AND MISSION

During 2021, we adopted a Purpose Statement and updated 

our Vision and Mission statements. Having a clear and 

concise understanding of our purpose, vision and mission 

is the foundation of our consistent strategic approach. Our 

purpose is quite literally why we exist, and by adopting a 

strategy clearly tailored to reflect this purpose, we are able to 

maximize our utility to stakeholders. 

While our purpose captures who we are, our vision and 

mission demonstrate how we are uniquely positioned to 

fulfill our purpose more effectively than our competitors. The 

aggregate of our purpose, vision and mission defines the 

value proposition that enables us to deliver superior returns 

for our shareholders. 

Purpose

Beginning with purpose – this is the answer to the question 

of “What is our value to the world?” For RenaissanceRe, our 

purpose is to “protect communities and enable prosperity.” 

Much is resident in this brief statement. At the most basic 

level, we provide protection against fortuitous losses, most 

notably from natural catastrophes, by assuming the largest 

and most difficult to insure risks in society. Shifting a risk from 

the vulnerable to the resilient has broad, macroeconomic 

benefits, as well as potentially facilitating the internalization 

of harmful negative externalities in those responsible for 

creating them. When catastrophic events occur, we provide 

the capital so insurers can pay claims to homeowners and 

other stakeholders to rebuild their houses and restore their 

communities. In addition, our products provide robust signals 

concerning risky behavior, which encourage safety and 

promote mitigation. 

Reinsurance also enables prosperity. It does this by 

encouraging a Pareto efficient allocation of capital for potential 

future losses. As I have explained in previous Letters to 

Shareholders, this is the ideal balance between undersaving 

and oversaving, which maximizes capital available for other 

productive purposes in society, while minimizing the risk 

of uninsured economic loss (which is the protection gap). 

The result is the Goldilocks scenario of an economy making 

the most of its resources (prosperity) while simultaneously 

preparing for potential disasters (protection). I passionately 

believe our purpose engenders great social utility and find it 

indispensable in guiding our strategy. 

Vision

Vision answers the question, “What is our longest-term 

goal as a firm?” Our vision is “to be the best underwriter.” 

We wanted a vision statement that was memorable, 

repeatable, and understandable, one that would resonate 

with our stakeholders, and most importantly with our 

employees. I believe our vision statement is at the same 

time aspirational and grounding; aspirational in that it is 

an enduring vision which requires constant maintenance; 

grounding in that it serves as a firm guidepost for day-to-

day decision making. In every choice at RenaissanceRe, 

a foundational consideration must be “Does this further 

our vision of being the best underwriter?” If not, why are we 

considering it?

portfolio is positioned to benefit from increasing interest 

rates. While rising rates would have an initial negative 

mark-to-market impact on our investment portfolio, due to 

our relatively low duration, we would expect to more than

Vision answers the question, “What is our longest-term 

goal as a firm?” Our vision is “to be the best underwriter.” 

We wanted a vision statement that was memorable, 

repeatable, and understandable, one that would resonate 

with our stakeholders, and most importantly with our 

employees. I believe our vision statement is at the same 

time aspirational and grounding; aspirational in that it is 

an enduring vision which requires constant maintenance; 

grounding in that it serves as a firm guidepost for day-to-

day decision making. In every choice at RenaissanceRe, 

a foundational consideration must be “Does this further 

our vision of being the best underwriter?” If not, why are we 

considering it?

Mission

Mission answers the question “What do we do on behalf 

of our customers and investors?” Our mission is “to match 

desirable risk with efficient capital.” This aligns neatly with 

our vision “to be the best underwriter,” as we believe that 

the best underwriter most effectively matches desirable 

risk with efficient capital. Our mission also bridges the gap 

between two important stakeholder groups: the purchasers 

of reinsurance and the providers of capital. It puts them 

on an even footing and reinforces the need to serve their 

interests equally. 

Our mission statement intentionally leads with desirable 

risk, which we believe should always be the starting point for 

the best underwriter. It is only after we have identified and 

quantified risk, and calculated its desirability, that we endeavor 

to match it with efficient capital. The inverse, beginning with 

capital against which one must then allocate risk, often results 

in sub-optimal returns to investors. 

The second half of our mission statement addresses 

efficient capital – which to us means the capital most readily 

able to bear a particular risk. We think of capital broadly. It 

encompasses our shareholders’ equity as well as the third-

party capital in our Capital Partners business. But it extends 

to our preferred equity, our debt, our credit facilities, and the 

retrocessional protection we purchase, including catastrophe 

bonds. Each of these play an important role in our capital 

structure and balancing them efficiently reduces our overall 

cost of capital, helping us approach Pareto optimality while 

simultaneously providing a strong platform for future growth. 

OUR ROLE IN FACILITATING CLIMATE TRANSITION

One important aspect of our purpose is the role we play in 

helping facilitate the world’s transition to a lower-carbon 

economy. Anthropogenic climate change is both an existential 

threat to the planet and an imminent risk to our industry, and 

we bear the responsibility of being part of the solution. 

As a reinsurance company, there are three primary means 

through which we can help effectuate transition to a 

lower-carbon world, which I have listed in order of complexity: 

• as an asset owner, 

• through our business operations, and 

• as an underwriter of risk. 

Our role as an asset owner is the least complex. As I 

will discuss further, we have made significant strides in 

decarbonizing our investment portfolio while also using it 

to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon world. Using our 

investment portfolio to promote a low-carbon future furthers 

our purpose of protecting communities and enabling 

prosperity, while also supporting our vision of being the 

best underwriter by helping reduce long-term climate risk to 

our business.

Letter to Shareholders



We are primarily invested in fixed income instruments, and 

also have limited exposure to equities, sometimes directly 

but also through our participation in funds. Our role as a 

direct equity investor is the most straightforward. As an owner, 

we have the responsibility to incentivize management to 

quantify their carbon footprint and have a strategy to reduce 

it. To be clear, this is a journey for many of these companies. 

They are working towards improving and showing progress, 

and we want to help them navigate the path. In my experience, 

one can most effectively influence a positive result by 

staying involved and working with management towards a 

cleaner future.

As a fixed income investor, we are not owners but we can still 

influence behavior. We achieve this by supporting the bonds 

of companies that are making the journey to a low carbon 

economy. This provides positive incentives in two ways. First, 

we provide financial support to companies transitioning to 

a more sustainable future. Second, merely by bidding for 

these bonds, we increase the supply of capital available for 

sustainable instruments, which should result in an overall 

lower cost of capital for their issuers. This process helps to 

internalize the true societal cost of the environmental actions 

of the issuer. 

The second role we play is with respect to our operational 

carbon footprint. Tracking and reporting this footprint is a 

positive first step, and we recognize our responsibility to 

manage the amount of carbon we emit and subsequently 

offset any residual amount. In 2021, we achieved this goal 

by supporting three innovative projects that reduce global 

emissions and increase community resilience. These were 

easy decisions for us, especially as we have focused our 

offsets on vulnerable communities, which aligns closely with 

our purpose, mission and vision. You can read more about 

these projects on our website.

This is not the end of our journey, but it shows our 

commitment to analyzing our operational sustainability and 

identifying opportunities to manage our impact. Importantly, 

we think of our carbon strategy as integral to our purpose, 

mission and vision and that integration with the foundational 

elements of our strategy will serve as a north star in guiding 

our ESG responsibilities in all that we do.

Finally, and most fundamentally, is our role as an assumer 

of risk. This is the most complicated area for us to navigate 

with respect to our ability to influence a cedant’s, and their 

underlying insured’s, journey to a lower carbon future. As 

a reinsurer, our customers are predominately insurance 

companies, and our role is limited to protecting the portfolios 

of risk that they choose to underwrite. 

Where we have direct influence, however, is in choosing the 

cedants we want to work with over time, considering the 

nature and risk of their insurance portfolios. Our purpose 

is to protect communities and enable prosperity. I believe 

we best achieve this through the active assumption of risk, 

which promotes the liquidity and capital necessary to enable 

the orderly transition of industries, businesses and society 

towards a lower-carbon future. 

By working with our customers and brokers to enhance their 

understanding of the risk of anthropogenic climate change, 

we can help them develop transition pathways as well as 

products that enable transition. Ultimately, some will transition 

more successfully and faster than others, and our goal is to 

support those that develop and consistently execute credible 

and measurable transition plans.  

ADVANCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND 
GOVERNANCE STRATEGY

Our purpose also drives our ESG Strategy, which focuses on 

three areas where our risk acumen intersects with our ability 

to make a meaningful impact on society:

1. Promoting Climate Resilience,

2. Closing the Protection Gap, and

3. Inducing Positive Societal Change.

In 2021, we made great progress against each of 

these priorities. 

Promoting Climate Resilience

We demonstrated our industry leadership position on climate 

resilience, adaptation and the transition to a low-carbon world 

through our participation at the United Nations 26th Climate 

Change Conference in Glasgow. We were active in several 

risk focused initiatives, including the “Building Resilience

We also looked inward for ways to reduce RenaissanceRe’s 

impact on the environment. This included calculating and 

offsetting our carbon footprint and reducing the carbon

Closing the Protection Gap

The protection gap is the difference between insured loss 

and economic loss and it is especially pronounced in 

underserved communities where insurance take up rates 

are low or coverage is not available. Global catastrophe-

related economic losses in 2021 were a stark reminder of this 

gap, with as little as a third of these economic losses being

covered by insurance. We play an active role in key industry 

partnerships to close the protection gap, such as through our 

leadership position in the IDF and participation in other public 

sector partnerships. 

Inducing Positive Societal Change

Our employees are our most valuable asset, and we are 

committed to maintaining a culture that supports each of them 

in their personal and professional journeys. During the year, 

we furthered our focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) 

through both internal action and external leadership. Our DEI 

Council, chaired by our Chief Underwriting Officer, continues 

to promote awareness of, and discussion around, important 

DEI topics through our global quarterly “DEI Spotlight Series” 

and local events. We were a global sponsor of the DiveIn 

Festival, which is a movement in the insurance sector to 

develop more inclusive workplaces and enable people to 

achieve their potential. We are also an ambassador for Race 

Action Through Leadership, which is a new, action-oriented 

initiative to improve the representation of ethnic minorities at 

all levels of the industry. 

Governance

We recently announced the nomination of Shyam Gidumal 

to our Board of Directors. Shyam will be a great addition 

and brings a wealth of experience enhancing operational 

efficiency and navigating digital transformation. I have 

every confidence that Shyam’s experience will contribute 

significantly to the Board’s stewardship of the organization on 

behalf of our shareholders and other stakeholders.

We also announce the planned retirement of Jean Hamilton 

from our Board of Directors in May 2022 after 17 years of 

service. Jean’s outstanding leadership and significant 

contributions, in particular in her capacity as former 

Chair of the Compensation and Corporate Governance 

Committee and more recently in her active role in advancing 

our ESG strategy, have been invaluable to me and my 

team. I would like to thank Jean for her many years of 

distinguished service.

is to protect communities and enable prosperity. I believe 

we best achieve this through the active assumption of risk, 

which promotes the liquidity and capital necessary to enable 

the orderly transition of industries, businesses and society 

towards a lower-carbon future. 

By working with our customers and brokers to enhance their 

understanding of the risk of anthropogenic climate change, 

we can help them develop transition pathways as well as 

products that enable transition. Ultimately, some will transition 

more successfully and faster than others, and our goal is to 

support those that develop and consistently execute credible 

and measurable transition plans.  

ADVANCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND 
GOVERNANCE STRATEGY

Our purpose also drives our ESG Strategy, which focuses on 

three areas where our risk acumen intersects with our ability 

to make a meaningful impact on society:

1. Promoting Climate Resilience,

2. Closing the Protection Gap, and

3. Inducing Positive Societal Change.

In 2021, we made great progress against each of 

these priorities. 

Promoting Climate Resilience

We demonstrated our industry leadership position on climate 

resilience, adaptation and the transition to a low-carbon world 

through our participation at the United Nations 26th Climate 

Change Conference in Glasgow. We were active in several 

risk focused initiatives, including the “Building Resilience 

in a Riskier World” event sponsored by the Insurance 

Development Forum (IDF), as well as the launch of the Global 

Risk Modelling Alliance. 

We also looked inward for ways to reduce RenaissanceRe’s 

impact on the environment. This included calculating and 

offsetting our carbon footprint and reducing the carbon 

intensity of our corporate credit and public equity portfolios by 

70% with negligible expected impact on the portfolio’s yield.2

IN CLOSING

In the nearly 30 years since we started RenaissanceRe, we 

have transformed from a property catastrophe reinsurer to a 

multiline, global reinsurer, with access to the best casualty, 

specialty and property risks. 

We are now at an inflection point in our evolution. We 

have built an organization that can succeed in an industry 

characterized by low interest rates, abundant third-party 

capital, social inflation, and climate change. Going forward, 

we are poised to benefit from higher interest rates and 

improved pricing for our products. Rate increases will help 

offset inflation and climate change. Excellent access to capital 

across multiple forms – traditional, managed third-party 

capital, and retrocessional protection – uniquely positions us 

for growing into new opportunities, while continuing to return 

capital to our shareholders. 

Looking forward to 2022, I believe that we will continue to 

benefit from the strong growth and portfolio optimization 

that we implemented in 2021, and that we have positioned 

ourselves for delivering long-term stakeholder value. 

Thank you to our employees for your efforts to continuously 

innovate and propel us forward, our customers for your 

longstanding partnership, and our shareholders for your 

continued support on our journey.

Sincerely, 

Kevin J. O’Donnell 

President and Chief Executive Officer
