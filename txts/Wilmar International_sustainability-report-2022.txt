Building on 16 years of sustainability disclosures since 
2007, we have been constantly enhancing our approach 
to disclosing relevant, timely and decision-useful 
information to our stakeholders. In 2022, we have 
evolved our approach to produce a data-driven and 
more accessible report that succinctly communicates 
our sustainability story, while also providing key 
disclosures on our sustainability performance. We 
continue to reference and apply a number of standards 
and frameworks to ensure our report is aligned with 
global best practices and provides consistent and 
comparable information to readers. In this regard, 
this year we have also reported in accordance with 
the updated GRI Universal Standards 2021, and the 
recently released sector standard, GRI 13: Agriculture, 
Aquaculture and Fishing Sectors 2022.

7Sustainability Report 2022  |  Wilmar International Limited6 Sustainability Report 2022  |  Wilmar International Limited

The world has faced a number of challenges in the 
past year, presenting both risks and opportunities 
for our businesses. The ongoing economic crisis, 
geopolitical instability and the increasing threat 
of climate change, remain some of the key issues 
impacting our stakeholders and operating environment. 
Confronted with these challenges, it is even more 
important that Wilmar remains committed to driving 
sustainability across our value chain as a strategic 
priority as we believe this is imperative to building a 
resilient business that will continue to create value for 
our stakeholders over the short, medium and long-term.

Since our last report, we have been improving and 
enhancing our approach to provide transparent, 
comparable and decision-useful information to our 
stakeholders. We appreciate that while there are 
a number of growing disclosure requirements, our 
stakeholders value succinct and focused information. 
Therefore beginning this year, we have revised our 
reporting approach to be more data-driven and 
streamlined, focusing on disclosure requirements 
and performance updates related to our material 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics. 
Cognisant of the importance of fully communicating 
our sustainability initiatives, we are also tapping on 
various other channels to add detail and colour to 
our ESG data disclosure, including our corporate 
website, sustainability dashboard, dedicated annual 
No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) 
Implementation Report and real-time communication 
channels such as newsletters and social media.  

Dear Stakeholders,

We are proud to present 
the 2022 edition of our 
Sustainability Report, which 
marks 16 years of sustainability 
disclosures by Wilmar.

In addition to the standards and frameworks we have 
previously referenced to guide our reporting, such 
as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB) Standards and Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, this 
Sustainability Report has adopted the newly updated 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021, 
including the new sector standard GRI 13: Agriculture, 
Aquaculture and Fishing Sectors 2022.  

We believe these improvements enhance our 
reporting to stakeholders, better meeting their 
needs and expectations. These standards are the 
most widely adopted for sustainability reporting 
globally and enhance the comparability and quality of 
ESG disclosures for our various stakeholder groups. 
Wilmar is committed to upholding accountability, 
transparency and engagement with our stakeholders 
as fundamental principles that guide our endeavours 
to foster sustainability across our businesses.

While we are proud of our achievements, we are 
cognisant that there is more work to be done and 
we continue to make progress on our sustainability 
commitments. Climate change impacts are already 
being felt across the world and the importance of 
climate action cannot be overstated. 

In 2022, we made significant strides in our commitment 
to mitigate climate change, signing up to the Science 
Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and committing to develop 
timebound plans to achieve near-term and net-zero 
emission reduction targets.

TAKING CLIMATE ACTION 

Despite what has been a challenging year, Wilmar maintained a 
strong financial performance. For FY2022, we reported a record 
net profit of US$2.40 billion, a 27.1% increase (FY2021: US$1.89 
billion) from the previous financial year. We credit our continued 
ability to do well, to the embracing of sustainability at the core of 
our business. At Wilmar, sustainability is embedded in the way we 
run our business, from the strategic decision-making at Board level, 
which is supported by the BSC, to the way we run our operations and 
source responsibly from our supply chain. The BSC is responsible for 
Wilmar’s ESG governance by formulating strategies, identifying risks 
and opportunities to determine the Group’s material ESG factors, 
evaluating our ESG performance and targets as well as monitoring 
the implementation of ESG-related policies and practices.

We are very pleased to see that our sustainability progress and 
performance have again been recognised by several global rating 
benchmarks and awards. In 2022, Wilmar retained its top position 
globally in the Sustainable Palm Oil Transparency Toolkit (SPOTT) 
assessment among 100 palm oil producers, processors and traders 
while our effort in protecting human rights was recognised by the 
Global Child Forum and the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark 
(CHRB). The Global Child Forum ranked Wilmar as the best performing 
company in its Food, Beverage and Personal Care benchmark, with 
the company scoring a perfect 10 for our effort in safeguarding 
children’s rights and well-being. CHRB, who evaluates how human 
rights and responses to serious allegations are systematised by 
companies through policies and processes, ranked Wilmar second 
globally and first in the East Asia and Pacific region. In addition, 
Wilmar maintained its inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Indices (DJSI) World Index, making 2022 the second consecutive year 
Wilmar remained on the DJSI World Index and our third straight year 
on the DJSI Asia Pacific Index. Wilmar also retained its position in 
the FTSE4Good Developed Index and FTSE4Good ASEAN 5 Index.
   
Wilmar’s sustainability track record and good standing have enhanced 
our ability to secure sustainable financing compared to the previous 
financial year. We secured more sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) this 
year, bringing the total amount of sustainable financing that we have 
secured to over US$2.20 billion as at the end of December 2022. 
Our sustainable financing includes facilities with DBS Bank Ltd., 
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, The Bank of East 
Asia, Limited, among others. The continued interest from banks to 
link sustainability to our borrowing provides a strong incentive for us 
to secure more of such loans and is a testament to the importance 
of sustainability in our business model and strategy.

At Wilmar, 
sustainability is 
embedded in the way 
we run our business, 
from the strategic 
decision-making at 
Board level, to the way 
we run our operations 
and source responsibly 
from our supply chain.

As part of this journey, we have established our Scope 1 
and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint for our baseline 
year of 2020, which has been externally audited in 
2022. We have also completed the mapping of the 
Group’s 2020 Scope 3 GHG footprint to complete our 
emissions profile for target setting.

We continue to make progress towards the commitment 
made at COP26 in Glasgow to develop a sectoral 
roadmap for enhanced supply chain action and at COP27 
in Sharm El Sheikh to follow through with this sectoral 
roadmap on a commodity-by-commodity basis.  We are 
actively engaging peers to participate in the palm oil 
sectoral roadmap to accelerate supply chain action and 
reduce emissions from our value chain. Please refer to 
the section on the Palm Oil Sector in this publication 
by the Tropical Forest Alliance for more information.

OUR COMMITMENT TO 
ATTAIN 90% TtP ACROSS

ACHIEVED ACROSS OUR 
GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN 
IN 2022

90%

98.7%

Since 2015, we have achieved 100% traceability 
to plantations (TtP) for all of the mills that we own 
across our global operations. In 2022, we committed 
to attaining 90% TtP across our global supply chain 
by 2023. We are pleased to note that as at end 2022, 
we have achieved over 80% TtP across our global 
supply chain. We have also achieved 98.7% traceability 
to palm oil mills across our global supply chain in 
2022. Traceability aids transparency and enhances 
our ability to monitor, engage and report against our 
goals and initiatives, while we strive for and maintain 
a deforestation and exploitation-free supply chain.  

Our ground-breaking No Deforestation, No Peat and 
No Exploitation (NDPE) commitment serves as a crucial 
foundation and blueprint for sustainable practices 
across our palm operations and supply chain. Our 
NDPE Policy was launched in 2013, making Wilmar the 
first in the industry to launch such a policy and apply 
it to our entire palm oil supply chain. Since then, we 
have been a leading voice in guiding and influencing 

the industry towards greater sustainability. One such 
example is our renewed partnership with the South 
East Asian Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP) 
on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for a 
five-year term.  This partnership seeks to advance 
and support best practices of oil palm plantations and 
conservation areas and will add to our overall ability 
to maintain our conservation areas, including their 
biodiversity viability.

In September 2021, we launched a dedicated NDPE 
Sugar Policy and the NDPE Sugar Initiative for our 
sugar supply chain. In 2022, our NDPE Sugar label 
made its debut on a customer’s retail package of table 
sugar, enhancing the visibility of sustainability within our 
sugar supply chain.  As one of the largest sugar traders 
in the world, we believe that we can make a positive 
impact by producing sugarcane in an environmentally 
sustainable manner that also benefits the livelihoods of 
people and communities involved in producing sugar.  

PROGRESS ON OUR 
SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS   

Beyond progress on environmental fronts, we also saw a marked 
improvement in our Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
performance. Wilmar places utmost importance on providing a safe 
and healthy workplace for its 100,000 strong workforce across the 
globe and OHS is a top area of concern for the Group. We always 
strive for zero fatalities and zero injuries. Every year, we look closely 
at how we can continue to improve in this area. This year, we saw 
our Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIR) performance improve with a drop 
of 18.7% and we also recorded a significant drop in the number of 
fatalities. While we are pleased to see that efforts to strengthen 
our OHS performance are showing results, this is an area where 
we recognise we need to do more and we will continue to work 
towards zero fatalities and safeguarding the health and well-being 
of our employees.

At Wilmar, we recognise that our success is the direct result of our 
employees’ dedication and hard work. To help our employees thrive, 
we constantly strive to foster a diverse and inclusive culture befitting 
our global workforce. A key focus area for us is the protection of 
women’s rights both in the office and out in the plantations. We began 
establishing women’s committees in our oil palm plantations in 2007 
to uphold our Women’s Charter. Since 2020, Women’s Working Groups 
(WoW) or Gender Committees have been established in 100% of 
our oil palm plantations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Ghana.  

At Wilmar, we recognise that our success is the 
direct result of our employees’ dedication and 
hard work.

IN 2022, OUR NDPE SUGAR LABEL MADE ITS DEBUT ON A 
CUSTOMER’S RETAIL PACKAGE OF TABLE SUGAR, ENHANCING THE 
VISIBILITY OF SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN OUR SUGAR SUPPLY CHAIN

NDPE SUGAR LABEL

Despite our strong performance and progress thus far, the year ahead 
remains challenging amid the current global context. We are committed 
to staying ahead of the curve and are proactively adapting to the 
continuously evolving ESG and sustainability landscape, including 
initiatives such as the European Green Deal which seeks to promote 
deforestation-free products. We are also committed to comply with 
the European Union’s regulations requiring companies to conduct 
due diligence to ensure that their supply chains are free from forced 
labour and other forms of modern slavery. In this regard, our NDPE 
priorities remain fundamental to meeting these mandates. In 2023, 
our focus will be on accelerating action to achieve the commitments 
and targets we have set. We will continue to partner and collaborate 
with industry players and across sectors to make this happen.

24 Sustainability Report 2022  |  Wilmar International Limited

As a global integrated agriculture and food company, 
we see embedding sustainability into our operations 
as crucial to securing the future of the Group and 
for creating shared values for our consumers, 
shareholders and stakeholders. We strive to leverage 
our resources and expertise to drive positive impacts 
wherever we operate.   

Our commitment to sustainability has 
never been more important. 2022 saw 
record-high inflation and increasing cost of 
living, alongside growing impacts of climate 
change. The current economic outlook is 
presenting unprecedented challenges to 
sustainable development globally. 

We review how the changing external 
context we are operating in shapes the 
material ESG topics for our business and 

stakeholders annually. As a result, we are 
continuously updating our policies and 
management of sustainability to ensure 
that our strategy and approach remain 
relevant to our stakeholders and resilient 
to evolving risks and opportunities.  

OUR APPROACH TO 
SUSTAINABILITY
2-23  

In 2022, we made progress across these four areas 
on several fronts, which are detailed throughout this 
Report. One key focus for us on the environmental 
front has been taking action on climate change. In 
October 2022, we signed up to the SBTi to cement 
our emission reduction targets and commitment made 
at COP26 to develop a sectoral roadmap for enhanced 
supply chain action consistent with a 1.5-degree Celsius 
pathway. To support these commitments, we are 
developing timebound strategies to achieve our near-
term and net-zero emission reduction targets. These 
efforts include assessing our Scope 3 emissions and 
formulating comprehensive plans to address and 
reduce them. Please see page 56 for more details on 
our Scope 3 disclosures.  

Our No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation 
(NDPE) Policy remains a crucial foundation and the 
blueprint for ensuring sustainable practices across 
our palm operations and supply chain. We have also 
extended this approach across our sugar business 
with the launch of a dedicated NDPE Sugar Policy  
in 2021 and NDPE Sugar Initiative in 2022 for our 
supply chain. For more on our policies and frameworks, 
please see our Sustainability Dashboard.

EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS AND RATINGS 

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 

External assessments and ratings are important to us as they help to benchmark our performance, identify potential 
gaps in our approach, and hold us accountable to our stakeholders. They also play a role in acknowledging our 
positive efforts, which further encourages us as it assures that we are on the right path.

Wilmar’s approach to sustainability is overseen by 
the Chairman and CEO, and the Board of Directors. 
They are supported by the BSC which works to 
formulate ESG strategies, identify ESG-related risks, 
evaluate ESG performance and targets and monitor 
the implementation of ESG-related policies and 
practices. The material topics and impacts identified 
through the stakeholder engagement process and 
materiality assessment were considered and approved 
by the Board. To ensure effective implementation of 
sustainability throughout the Group and that critical 
concerns are communicated to leadership, the BSC 
meets quarterly to review sustainability matters, and 

also receives periodic reporting and advisories from the 
Sustainability Management Team (SMT) with support 
from the Independent Sustainability Advisory Panel 
(ISAP). Sustainability risks and concerns are raised at 
each BSC meeting. These risks and concerns can range 
from standard operational matters to critical concerns 
– where “critical concerns” are defined as risks that 
have potential immediate and catastrophic impact to 
our business, operations and people.

Issues of critical concern are disclosed in our Annual 
Report’s Risk Management section on page 60.

Indonesia and Malaysia 
are home to some of the 
world’s richest biodiversity. 
They are also the two 
primary locations for our 
palm upstream operations. 
That is why we channel 
significant resources 
towards protecting and 
restoring HCS forests 
and HCV areas, together 
with other ecologically 
and culturally important 
lands and ensuring 
that our supply chain is 
deforestation-free.

IDENTIFYING AND CONSERVING 
HCS FOREST AND HCV AREAS 

Since introducing the NDPE Policy in 2013, we have upheld our 
commitment towards “No development on HCS forests or HCV 
areas”. We extended this commitment to our sugar operations 
with our NDPE Sugar Policy launched in 2021 which sets out 
similar commitments to prohibit the conversion of legally protected 
areas or HCV areas and preserve and enhance biodiversity and 
ecosystem services. 

The NDPE Policy requires all new oil palm land developments by 
Wilmar or our suppliers to identify HCV areas and HCS forests for 
protection using international best practices guidance from the: 

• RSPO Principles and Criteria (P&C)  
• High Conservation Value Resource Network (HCVRN) 
• High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach   

We have identified a number of wildlife species within our 
conservation areas, including birds and mammals from the IUCN 
Red List of Threatened Species. Consequently, all HCS forests 
and HCV areas identified within our palm oil operations to date 
are monitored and managed as conservation areas.  

To date, a total of 32,544 ha in Wilmar’s oil palm plantations are 
conservation areas. This includes 97 ha added to our conservation 
areas in 2022, mainly from our Sabah plantations. 

We also strive to promote mainstream biodiversity conservation 
across the plantation landscape and published “A Practical Guide 
to Conservation Area Monitoring” to support our suppliers in 
establishing monitoring systems to manage identified conservation 
areas.

CONSERVATION AREAS IN 
OUR SUGAR OPERATIONS 

We require all sugarcane plantation development 
activities to demonstrate that they do not involve HCV 
areas or areas that are internationally or nationally 
legally protected. Where protected areas and areas of 
ecological importance have not yet been identified, we 
encourage plantation owners to identify biodiversity 
resources and ecosystem services that may be impacted 
by their operations.  

As of December 2022, Wilmar has 834 ha of conservation 
areas in our sugarcane plantations. In Australia, we have 
identified and are conserving 675 ha of ‘endangered’ 

and ‘of concern’ vegetation. In India, we have planted 
close to 15,500 trees at the periphery of our mills and 
plants. Since starting this initiative in 2007 at Athani 
mill, we have increased the total number of trees 
planted to more than 135,000 trees and covering 159 
ha across our India operations. 

Recognising the important role played by our workers, as 
well as local and indigenous communities, we have also 
developed a range of programmes to raise awareness 
and build capacity to further strengthen our ongoing 
conservation efforts. 

CONSERVATION MONITORING 

In addition to SMART, we also collate details about our 
HCV management programmes, including restoration, 
signboard installations, marking poles, boreholes and 
socialisation efforts, on our internal HCV Management 

Implementation Dashboard. Through this dashboard, 
we can easily quantify the progress and success of our 
management plans for each plantation and identify 
areas for improvement.

Since adopting this system in 2015, we have logged more 
than 13,221 PATROLS, 27,728 FIELD PHOTOS and 14,795 
DIRECT AND INDIRECT2 wildlife sightings where 6,411 
LOGS WERE OF RTE SPECIES. 

2Indirect wildlife sightings include images from camera traps and spotting of footprints, among others 

Wilmar has used the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) since 2013 to monitor and 
patrol our protected landscapes as well as for data analysis. SMART provides four main data retrieval 
components, including:

CONSERVATION STORIES 

SICA is the largest conservation area in Wilmar’s 
operations in Malaysia, spanning a total of 
2,469 ha in the interiors of the Beluran District in 
Sabah. Located within our plantation’s concession 
boundary, the SICA project is an ongoing joint 
effort between Wilmar and our stakeholders, 
including the surrounding local communities, to 

protect and preserve the largely lowland mixed-
dipterocarp forest. The key components include 
biodiversity conservation, capacity building and 
community-based conservation approach. The 
initiative aims to develop SICA as a Biodiversity 
and Carbon Research Centre by 2030.  

SEKAR IMEJ CONSERVATION 
AREA (SICA) PROJECT 

MALAYSIA

Initiated by our Plantation Head of Malaysia, 
Mr Gurcharan Singh Sardar, the Conservation 
Recreational Landscape Project seeks to plant 
trees in spaces outside our designated riparian and 
conservation areas in Malaysia. This is one of the 
commitments we have made in our NDPE Policy to 
promote the “Go Green” approach. Teams from all 
our operating units, both plantations and mills, are 

involved in reforestation and greening projects around 
the housing complexes, vacant spaces and palm oil 
mills. Since 2020, a total of 30,138 trees from 89 
species have been planted in both Sabah and Sarawak. 
We are also working closely with government agencies 
such as Sabah Forest Department and Sarawak 
Forest Department to support the Greening Malaysia 
Programme and 100 Million Tree-Planting Campaign. 

CONSERVATION RECREATIONAL LANDSCAPE PROJECT (CRLP) 

CASE STUDY

To continue promoting best 
management practices in the 
plantation landscape. Key focus 
areas of the MoU include: 

• establishing research 
platforms to support 
scientific projects and 
experimental study 
plots relating to best 
management practices 
(BMP) of plantation and 
conservation areas  

• exploring the establishment 
of research-led 
programmes for forest and 
habitat restoration and 
rehabilitation.

Initial observations indicated forest quality to be in good 
condition. SEARPP concluded that SICA fulfils the basic criteria 
of the OECM survey and presented the findings to the Ministry 
of Energy and Natural Resources. 

The expedition, which involved scientists and researchers from 
SEARRP, Universiti Sains Malaysia and Universiti Malaysia Sabah 
as well as field guides from the local communities, aimed at 
studying and documenting the flora and fauna in the area as well 
as assessing forest quality and estimating carbon stocks in order to 
determine biodiversity and carbon baselines. The data will underpin 
and form recommendations for future research to support SICA’s 
management and restoration plans for the area.

AFRICA
CASE STUDY

Between February and September 2022, PT KSI released 
six siamangs, also known as gibbons (Symphalangus 
syndactylus), into its conservation area. Siamangs are 
known to be difficult to reintroduce to the wild. Widespread 
deforestation means that siamangs are increasingly 
susceptible to loss of habitat and food as well as illegal 
poaching.

As such, Wilmar spends a considerable amount of effort to 
ensure the successful reintroduction of siamangs into the 
wild. This includes conducting extensive surveys and post-
release monitoring. Patrol reports by our conservation team 
and members of the NGO, Kalaweit Indonesia Foundation, 
have shown that all siamangs are in good health and have 
successfully reproduced within our conservation area. 

Thanks in part to the collaboration and participation of our 
stakeholders, including the Nagari Talao and Nagari Sei 
Kunyit communities, the Natural Resources Conservation 
Agency, and the Kalaweit Indonesia Foundation, in December 
2022, a new siamang was born from one of the pairs that 
was released, increasing the total siamang population in the 
conservation area to 23 individuals. In 2019, we unfortunately 
lost one of our adult female siamang (Sharon Gy) due to 
injuries from a bee attack in the forest. The remaining 
siamangs are in good health so far.

African grey parrots, commonly called African 
greys, are native to rainforests of West and 
Central Africa which overlap oil palm production 
regions. Surveys at our operations in Ghana 
and Nigeria, Biase Plantations Limited and 
Eyop Industries Limited, have shown the 
continued presence of this species within our 
plantation areas despite it being extremely rare 
to find African greys in the wider neighbouring 
landscape.  

To model how oil palm plantation expansion 
would impact the habitats of African greys 
and develop parrot friendly practices in oil 
palm plantations, Biase Plantations Limited 
and Eyop Industries Limited are working with 
researchers from the Department of Zoology 
and Environmental Biology and University of 
Nigeria Nsukka to understand the activities of 
the parrot species in the area.   

Early results show that the restrictions on 
hunting within the plantations have played a 
significant role in the continued presence of 
African greys and other large frugivorous birds 
including threatened turacos and hornbills. The 
results from these surveys will help us develop 
tools to enhance African grey conservation 
within oil palm plantations in the region.

PEATLANDS

Peatlands play an important role in climate change. 
They store more carbon than all other soil types in 
the world combined but are highly prone to catching 
fire if drained or faced with dry conditions. Since 
launching our NDPE Policy, Wilmar has prohibited any 
new development on peat regardless of depth. Where 
feasible, we work with experts and communities to 
explore options for peatland restoration. 

Approximately 1,706 ha#, which is about 1% of the total 
planted area in our palm plantations across Indonesia 
and Malaysia, is classified as peat. To minimise peat 
subsidence and the release of carbon dioxide in these 
planted areas, we apply the BMP defined by peat 
experts and the RSPO. This includes putting measures 
in place to ensure water tables remain at optimal levels.

We encourage our suppliers to implement similar 
measures and published the “Best Management 
Practices Manual for Growers on Forest Conservation 
and Community Collaboration” to support them in 
managing conservation areas, including peatlands, in 
their estates.  

We also have 0.74 ha of peatlands in our conservation 
areas, located within our operations in Sumatra, 
Indonesia. In these areas, we participate and contribute 
towards peatland conservation targets and efforts 
under supervision and support by the Ministry of 
Environment and Forestry, as well as deforestation-
free supply chain initiatives and knowledge-sharing 
platforms by the Tropical Forest Alliance.

As the global demand for vegetable oil continues to 
grow, so do concerns about deforestation. As the 
most efficient oil crop in terms of land use3, we believe 
that palm oil has the greatest potential to meet this 
demand. Through ongoing efforts to improve our yield 

and extraction rate, we are continuously exploring 
opportunities to increase our palm oil production 
without expanding or developing new land areas. 
For more information on our R&D, please refer to the 
section on Innovation and Technology. 

FIRE AND HAZE 

MONITORING, DETECTION AND SUPPRESSION 

Wilmar adheres to a strict zero-burn policy. We deploy mechanical 
methods for land development and preparation. The method enables 
us to leave woody debris to decompose and subsequently feed the 
land with nutrients, reducing our reliance on inorganic fertilisers 
and decreasing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This policy 
also applies to our third-party suppliers.  

Wilmar has implemented a 24/7 fire monitoring system to alert 
us of fires in and around our concessions as well as protocols to 
prevent, monitor, suppress and report fires in all of our operating 
units globally. We supplement our monitoring efforts with community 
education, awareness campaigns and multi-stakeholder partnerships 
to entrench sustainable practices throughout the industry. 

We use satellite imagery to monitor fires within and up to five 
kilometres outside our boundaries. All hotspot notifications are 
verified on the ground as satellites may occasionally capture 
temperature fluctuations that are not necessarily fires.  

To improve the efficiency of our monitoring processes, we 
implemented an integrated fire monitoring platform to automatically 
capture and relay hotspot alerts to field managers. We supplement 
this platform with daily on-the-ground fire monitoring which has 
proven effective in detecting and suppressing fires even before 
detection by satellite. This monitoring platform supports our 
dashboard system which was developed in 2021 and is used to 
record, monitor and report the implementation of the fire monitoring.  
Initially deployed for use mainly in Indonesia where fire incidents 
are most prevalent, we have since expanded this monitoring 
programme to Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria.  

We also work closely with the RSPO in sharing fire-related data 
and verifying hotspot notifications through the RSPO Hotspot 
Monitoring Programme. Our response teams are immediately 
dispatched to extinguish fires when there are confirmed incidences.

We monitor fires within and surrounding all our palm operations to 
mitigate the risk of fires through prevention, early detection, quick 
suppression and reporting. We also monitor fires in our suppliers’ 
concessions via our Supplier Group Compliance Programme (SGCP). 
We immediately seek clarification upon receiving alerts from our 
monitoring platform through the media. For more information on 
SGCP and FFA, please refer to our Palm NDPE Implementation 
Annual Report 2022.

CONTROLLED BURNING IN 
BURDEKIN, AUSTRALIA

In the Burdekin region of 
Queensland, Australia, we 
use fire to remove leafy 
sugarcane which can obstruct 
waterflow and cause poor 
irrigation when harvested 
and left on the ground. 
We implement our robust 
fire standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) and 
ensure all applicable local 
laws and regulations are 
adhered to. In 2022, a total 
of 3,143 ha of plantations in 
our sugar operations were 
burnt using the controlled 
methods.

Our focus on addressing 
climate change concerns has 
been in our upstream palm 
oil and sugar operations, 
where there is the most 
significant impact. As the 
world transitions to a low-
carbon economy, we have 
expanded our mitigation 
efforts throughout our global 
business. We are in the process 
of developing comprehensive 
targets consistent with a 
1.5-degree Celsius pathway 
and aligned with the SBTi. 

In addition to our efforts to reduce our impact on the 
climate, we look to build resilience for our business and 
key stakeholders by continuing to act proactively on the 
evolving risks and opportunities relevant to our business.  

To assess our climate-related risks and opportunities, 
we conducted a recent scenario analysis in 2022 
based on a two-degree Celsius scenario over the 
short-term (two years), medium-term (two to 10 
years) and long-term (more than 10 years). The results 
of this assessment are summarised in the table on 
the following page and are being used to inform 
management and leadership discussions to ensure 
Wilmar’s strategy and business model remains resilient, 
competitive and able to fulfil market expectations.

MITIGATION

The food and agriculture sectors are especially 
vulnerable to climate change. Increasingly extreme 
weather patterns, including prolonged droughts or 
periods of heavy rainfall, can negatively affect crop 
yields. We therefore invest heavily in the R&D of palm 
seedlings that are resilient to extreme weather patterns. 
These seedlings are also sold to smallholders and 
smaller plantation companies to ensure the reliability 
and resilience of our future supply.  

As customers increasingly favour and look for responsibly 
and sustainably produced commodities, we also actively 
invest in R&D to identify environmental-friendly 
solutions. Examples include developing plant-based 
protein to reduce our reliance on animal-based proteins 
and producing soaps and detergents using vegetable-
based surfactants, which are more consumer and 
environmental-friendly.  

We are committed to progressively reducing GHG 
emissions from our operations while supporting global 
efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change. All 
our business segments are focused on reducing GHG 
emissions through various initiatives.  

Wilmar signed up to the SBTi in October 2022 and 
committed to setting both near-term and net-zero 
emission targets. Over the next 18 months, we will 
develop timebound plans outlining our strategy 
and approach to achieve our targets. We have 
already established our Scope 1 and 2 baselines and 
implemented measures to reduce these emissions, 
primarily through investments in operational efficiency 
and renewable energy. In preparation to undergo 
the target setting assessment, we have externally 
verified our Scope 1 and 2 baseline. Having recently 
completed mapping our Group-level Scope 3 emissions 
for baseline 2020, the next phase of our commitment 
will be to develop comprehensive plans to address 
and reduce them.

REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS IN OUR 
UPSTREAM PALM OIL OPERATIONS 

GHG emissions reduction in our palm oil business 
is primarily achieved by generating electricity from 
biomass, treating our palm oil mill effluent (POME), 
halting deforestation and employing best practices on 
cultivated peatland to reduce the carbon footprint of 
our palm oil operations.  

Methane capture is an important element of our strategy 
to reduce GHG emissions in our palm oil operations. 
The recovered biogas is used to generate energy while 
any excess is flared off to minimise leakage. To date, 
we have built 25 methane capture facilities in our 
Indonesia and Malaysia operations. With all methane 
capture plants in operation, we managed to avoid a 
total of 0.6 million tCO2e of GHG emissions in 2022. 

In addition to biogas, we generate electricity in our 
palm oil mills using biomass, including by-products 
from the milling process such as empty fruit bunches 
(EFB), palm kernel shells (PKS) and mesocarp fibre.

REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS IN 
OUR SUGAR OPERATIONS 

REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS 
IN OUR FACTORIES  

Our sugar operations in Australia and India make use 
of biomass to generate renewable electricity. Cane 
bagasse, a by-product of crushing sugarcane, is the main 
source of fuel powering our mills. We have adopted 
best management practices in fertiliser and chemical 
usage and ensure the efficient use of energy in our 
sugar operations.  

To date, we have deployed a number of energy and 
resource initiatives in our sugar plantations and refineries 

including reusing biomass and water where possible 
and employing efficient irrigation practices. For more 
information on these initiatives, see the Environmental 
Footprint of Operations section. 

In 2022, our sugar refineries have been developing 
an Energy and GHG Reduction Pathway towards a 
low-emissions future. This will guide our investments 
towards reducing our refineries’ footprints. 

Across our factory operations, we have continued to 
reduce our reliance on electricity from the grid and 
non-renewable sources.  

We continued to roll out rooftop solar installations at 
our remaining sites across Asia. To date, 66.2 MWp of 
rooftop solar panels are already in operation with an 
additional 105.8 MWp currently under construction or 
planned to be rolled out across our global operations. 
Although the majority of our solar projects are currently 
in China, Indonesia and Malaysia contribute significantly 
to our overall Group emissions due to our scale of 
operations there and thus our focus in 2023 will be 
on rolling out the solar programme in these countries.  

Recognising that a large portion of our emissions 
come from coal, we seek opportunities to replace coal 
with less polluting fuels. Our China subsidiary, Yihai 
Kerry Arawana (YKA), has decommissioned several 
coal boilers and switched to natural gas and biogas 
collected via treatment of wastewater and sewage. In 
2022, we collected a total of 11.16 million Nm3 biogas 
representing a total reduction of 8,558 MT of coal and 
0.2 million tCO2e. In China, Indonesia and Vietnam, 
we reuse rice husk, a by-product from rice milling to 
generate electricity and steam. In 2022, we collected 
a total of 345,602 MT of rice husks and produced four 
million GJ of renewable energy.  

Our refinery in Kunming, China, is the first Wilmar site, 
as well as the first in the oil and grain industry in China, 
to be certified as carbon neutral. This achievement 
was verified by the China Environmental United 
Certification Center. 

In Australia and New Zealand, we also invest in 
purchasing renewable energy certificates (RECs) to 
offset our energy usage where electricity requirements 
are greater than our renewable energy generation 
potential. Since mid-2021, our Australian subsidiary, 
Goodman Fielder, has achieved 100% renewable 
electricity across its operations using RECs. While we 
are not currently regulated by a carbon pricing system, 
in the scenario where our sites have requirements to 
meet future compliance thresholds such as China’s 
National Cap and Trade Programme, we will also look 
into purchasing carbon credits as a potential solution. 

Beyond the direct emissions benefits, we view renewable 
energy as a fundamental element of our broader 
net-zero ambition across our factories. We are thus 
exploring opportunities to move towards electrifying 
our operations to drive further emission reductions. 
In 2021, Goodman Fielder began running an electric 
truck trial and progressively replaced 22% of its leased 
sales vehicles with lower emission hybrid vehicles. 

As of 2022, we have replaced an additional 38%, 
representing a total of 139 vehicles across Australia 
and New Zealand, with hybrids. To further reduce

iWe are similarly committed to reducing climate impacts 
from our value chain and expect our suppliers to adopt 
climate change mitigation practices in line with our 
NDPE commitments. Following our pledge at COP26, 
we worked with several of our peers in the palm oil 
sector to develop a Palm Oil Sectoral Roadmap to 
aid in accelerating supply chain action and reducing 
emissions. In addition to our ongoing NDPE efforts, we 
will strive to engage with other industry players and 
advocate the recognition and adoption of this roadmap.

Since the implementation of the programme in 2019, 
we have reduced the number of delivery vehicles by 
51 trucks and distance travelled by 898,081km. This 
corresponds to a 17% decrease in the number of 
trucks and a 32% decrease in distance travelled. Work 
is underway to further optimise our network routes.

Goodman Fielder’s New Zealand operations have

OUR GHG EMISSIONS 
305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-4, 305-5 

Majority of our emissions come from our factories and 
upstream palm oil operations. In 2022, our total Scope 1 
and Scope 2 (market-based) GHG emissions4 were 15.1 
million tCO2e (2021: 14.0 million tCO2e), including 2.3 
million tCO2e (2021: 2.3 million tCO2e) due to land use 
change and peat oxidation. 

Our GHG emission intensity in 2022 was 150 kgCO2e per 
MT of product, excluding shipping (2021: 140 kgCO2e per 
MT of product). The increase was due to several projects 
(delayed due to COVID-19) which relied on non-renewable 
fuel sources starting operations in 2022. With a handful 
of similar projects that are commissioning this year, we 
foresee further potential increase in our emission intensity 
in the near future before reductions from our climate 

roadmap take effect. Our biogenic5 emissions were 11.8 
million tCO2e.  

We have set a target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity 
by 15% for all of our palm oil mills by 2023, against a 2016 
baseline of 0.82 tCO2e per MT CPO. This target applies 
to all our mills in Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria, 
regardless of RSPO certification status.  

Our GHG emissions intensity in 2022 was 0.68 kgCO2e 
per MT CPO, below our set target for 2023. This is the 
result of our continued efforts to increase use of biomass 
as fuel and operating our methane capture plants at 
maximum efficiency.

management, sequestration during land use change and CO2 emissions from biofuel combustion. As indicated in the Net-Zero Standard, 
energy generated from the combustion of biomass in certain cases is considered “carbon neutral” because combustion-related CO2 
emissions are balanced by CO2 that is sequestered during the growth of bioenergy feedstock.

The Environmental Policy sets out our commitment to minimising the environmental impact of all our 
operations. Complementing the policy, we have a series of environmental standards8 for our factories, palm 
oil mills and crushing plants. In 2021, to drive greater efficiencies across our global factories in energy, water 
and packaging, we launched the Industrial Sustainable Programme to identify opportunities for efficiency 
improvement and develop energy and water reduction targets.

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS 

302-1, 302-3, FB-AG-130A.1, FB-PF-130A.1 

We continue to implement programmes to reduce our energy consumption and drive operational efficiencies. 
We also generate and utilise renewable energy where possible to reduce our reliance on electricity from the 
grid and non-renewable sources and drive emission reductions. 

Our upstream operations mainly rely on energy generated from 
biomass, including EFB, PKS, mesocarp fibre and bagasse produced 
as by-product of the milling process, to power our palm oil and 
sugar mills. 

Wilmar’s sugar mills install cogeneration plants that generate 
electricity and produce heat for consumption simultaneously. While 
all mills generate electricity for internal use, some are explicitly 
designed to maximise renewable electricity generation for export 
purpose. To ensure a readily available source of renewable energy 
outside of the traditional crushing season, we stockpile surplus 
bagasse in specially designed pads at one of our mills.  In 2022, 
we exported a total of 510,940 MWh to the national grid from 
our mills in Australia and India. 

In our sugarcane plantations, a large amount of the energy is 
consumed by water pumps. To tackle this, we implemented a 
number of initiatives to lower energy consumption such as more 
focused irrigation scheduling, upgrading electric motors with 
more efficient ones, using variable speed drives to adjust pump 
flows and capital programmes to replace the pumping system 
with more efficient electric motors. 

The Wilmar Integrated Management System (WIMS), 
which follows the requirements of ISO 14001 and 
other relevant environmental standards, is used to 
monitor and improve our performance. It sets out 
a clear framework to ensure that we comply with all 
applicable environmental laws in the countries and 
regions where we operate. 

All environmental hazards, incidents and breaches 
identified are reported and investigated through 
our global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) 
reporting platform, Enablon. All significant incidents 
require a Critical Incident Investigation Report which 
involves a detailed investigation into the root causes 

and contributing factors. Short and long-term actions 
are then developed to prevent potential recurrence. 
For more information on WIMS and Enablon, please 
refer to the section on Employee Health, Safety and 
Well-being. 

To raise awareness of environmental issues and 
encourage employees to take action in protecting 
the environment, we conduct training at a local level 
for our employees. 

In 2022, there were no significant fines or non-monetary 
sanctions for non-compliance with environmental 
regulations.

ENERGY USE IN OUR FACTORIES GROUP ENERGY PERFORMANCE 

Our factories have adopted a wide range of 
technologies, including steam condensate recovery, 
waste heat recovery and stream residual pressure 
power generation, to reduce energy consumption and 
improve energy efficiency. As these initiatives drive 
GHG emissions reduction, they are also described in 
more detail in the Climate Change section.  

In 2022, we continued to deliver energy reduction 
initiatives across our operations in China with a 
focus on waste heat recovery and energy efficiency 
upgrades. Initiatives include installing cascading heat 

pumps for waste heat recovery and high efficiency 
magnetic levitation (MagLev) compressors as well as 
improving condensate recovery. These initiatives have 
the potential to generate savings of up to 1,400,000 
kWh of electricity and 140,000 MT of steam/condensate 
each year. As part of our commitment to a sectoral 
roadmap for enhanced supply chain action, we are 
developing comprehensive targets consistent with 
a 1.5-degree Celsius pathway and aligned with the 
SBTi. These targets will also be linked to our energy 
and water efficiency programmes.  

In 2022, we consumed 57,866,049 MWh of energy, of which 53% 
was from renewable sources. This is driven largely by our palm 
oil mills and sugar mills, where 99% of the energy consumed in 
2022 came from renewable sources.  

At the Group level, our energy intensity in 2022 was 0.57 MWh 
per MT product excluding shipping, which was slightly higher 
than 2021. This was mainly driven by an increased consumption of 
bagasse at our sugar mills due to a larger crop size coupled with 
a wet end to the harvesting season, resulting in more bagasse 
used to process the wetter crop to generate similar sugar yield.

WATER AND EFFLUENT MANAGEMENT 
IN OUR PALM OIL OPERATIONS 

Wilmar diligently tracks and monitors water metrics associated with usage and discharge across our operations. 
This includes managing water supply and use, particularly in water-stressed areas and ensuring we meet all 
discharge limits specified in local regulations. 

Wilmar uses a life cycle approach to manage water use 
in our oil palm plantations, considering water efficiencies 
starting from the design to the construction and running 
of our mills and plantations. We implement water 
efficiency measures for our most water-intensive mills 
as well as for our nursery irrigation and household use. 

We have been monitoring rainfall patterns at our oil 
palm plantations for more than 25 years. While we 
face less rainfall during weather phenomena such as 
El Niño, this is not substantial and water stress is not 
considered a significant risk for our oil palm plantations. 
To alleviate some of the impact of less rainfall during 
drier seasons, we continue to carry out land irrigation 
using palm oil mill effluent (POME).  

Effluent is treated prior to both land application and 
local waterway discharge. POME from FFB processing is 
treated via anaerobic and aerobic biological digestion. 
Palm oil refinery effluent (PORE) from the refining of 
CPO is treated using chemical processes to remove 
oil, grease and other inorganic substances, followed 
by aerobic biological digestion.

 We strive to meet all discharge limits specified by local 
regulations and have an ongoing target to maintain 
effluent discharge levels well within local thresholds 
for palm oil mills and refineries waterway discharge. 
For our upstream and downstream sites, we monitor 
biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) levels for both land application and 
river discharge#, as well as other parameters stated 
in the legislative permit. 

There were no significant fines or prosecutions related 
to incidents of non-compliance with discharge limits in 
2022. We target to reduce our water usage intensity 
for our palm oil mills to 1.2 m3/MT FFB processed for 
Indonesia and 1.3 m3/MT FFB processed for Malaysia, 
Ghana and Nigeria by 2023. In 2022, this target was 
achieved by our palm oil mills in Central Kalimantan, 
Sumatra and Nigeria with 1.04#, 0.93# and 1.16# m3/
MT FFB processed, respectively.

WATER AND EFFLUENT 
MANAGEMENT IN OUR
SUGAR OPERATIONS 

We aim to ensure that all water is efficiently used 
and applied in our irrigated plantations and regularly 
monitor net water consumed per unit mass of product 
for our sugarcane plantations and mills. In 2022, water 
consumption in our sugarcane plantations and mills 
were well within water usage limits. 

Based on World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct tool, 
some of our sugar mills and refineries in India and 
Australia are exposed to extremely high or high water 
stress risk. As we use water for cooling and boiling in 
our refineries, scarce water supplies have the potential 
to disrupt our sugar operations. Our main focus in 
these areas is therefore centred around applying a 
circular approach and reusing water where possible.  

Our sugarcane plantations are primarily rain and river 
fed and we reuse treated mill effluent to supplement 
any additional irrigation needs during the drought 
season.  

We have similarly implemented water stewardship 
initiatives in our refineries operating in extremely 
high or high water-stressed areas such as converting 
our refinery in Gujarat, India, into a zero-discharge 
facility where all water withdrawn is treated and 
reused in the operations, and returning all cooling/
vapour condensing water withdrawn by our refinery 
in Yarraville, Australia, back into the adjacent 
Maribyrnong River. 

WATER AND EFFLUENT 
MANAGEMENT IN OUR 
FACTORY OPERATIONS 

In order to identify all potentially relevant environmental 
risks for new plants or significant projects, we conduct 
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or similar 
assessment in line with local environmental requirements 
prior to any construction. Our assessment includes 
all water risks to the natural ecosystem and local 
communities relying on the water source for their 
livelihoods.  

We regularly track and monitor our water usage and 
discharge across all our factory operations on Enablon 
and collaborate with local authorities to ensure our 
operations are aligned with future water availability 
strategies. 

To reduce our impact in water-stressed areas, reject 
water is diverted for reuse in plant processes such 
as cooling and wastewater treatment that can utilise 
water with higher dissolved solid and impurity levels. 
This enables us to supplement our water needs while 
minimising the amount of water we withdraw. 

We have also taken steps to reduce the amount of 
effluent that we generate with more available for 
recycling. We are currently exploring the use of 
electricity to replace chemical solutions to prevent 
scaling and biological growth in water used in cooling 
towers. This initiative has been launched in three sites 
across New Zealand with a potential to be rolled out 
to other sites in the future.

GROUP WATER 
PERFORMANCE 

In 2022, our operations consumed a total of 84,432 ML of water. 
To reduce the amount of water needed to be withdrawn, a total 
of 7,443 ML of wastewater was recycled from our operations, 
which amounts to 5% of the water withdrawn for use. 

EFFLUENT TREATMENT PLANTS (ETPs)

Since 2020, we have focused on making progress in our internal 
management of effluent. We regularly conduct site audits to 
check on safety, SOPs and compliance-related issues specific to 
effluent treatment. Dedicated persons-in-charge (PIC) in each 
region have overall responsibility for ETPs and provide monthly 
update reports summarising the quality of treated effluent as well 
as the status of projects and other updates. This year, we began 
progressively deploying Production Information Management 
Systems throughout Wilmar’s global operations to monitor 
critical ETPs data online mainly driven by in-person restrictions 
as a result of COVID-19. 

We view wastewater recycling as an important element towards 
achieving our sustainability goals. In 2022, we expanded on our 
current wastewater recycling initiatives in Indonesia and China 
and invested an additional US$5.1 million to launch three new 
wastewater recycling programmes. These projects are expected 
to be completed in 2023.

Through an innovative waste recycling partnership and 
the recovery of organic materials for stockfeed, our 
Yoplait yoghurt site was similarly able to reduce their 
waste to landfill. 

Many of our ETPs in China also use sludge dryers 
to reduce the water content of sludge which in turn 
reduces the volume of sludge needed to be treated 
and disposed. In 2022, we saw a reduction of 64% of 
sludge generated from our ETPs.  

While biomass has the potential to be a cost-effective 
and readily available alternative to coal, the low bulk 
density of biomass makes it difficult to transport for 
use in other sites efficiently. We are therefore exploring 
other opportunities to better reuse our biomass.

We are committed to reducing the amount of waste that is produced 
across our operations. We strive to apply circular economy principles 
where possible and maximise the recovery, reuse and recycling 
of waste. 

Wilmar seeks to recover and reuse all waste produced by our 
upstream palm oil and sugar operations. A large proportion of 
our waste consists of biomass, including EFB, PKS and mesocarp 
fibre from our palm oil operations and bagasse, filter press mud, 
ash and dunder (vinasse) from our sugarcane operations, which 
is reused as fuel or fertiliser. Where waste, such as chemicals, 
cannot be recovered and reused, it is collected and disposed of 
by licensed contractors who manage the waste in accordance 
with local legislation. 

We apply the waste management hierarchy in our factory operations 
to minimise waste channelled to landfills. Goodman Fielder’s 
Pampas Pastry factory modified its production process to reduce 
the amount of waste generated by over 100 MT per year.

FOOD LOSS AND FOOD WASTE 

Wilmar is committed to tackling food loss and food 
waste at all stages of the value chain and has various 
programmes and initiatives in relevant parts of our 
business. We focus our efforts on our consumer product 
businesses, where we prioritise improving yield within 
our factories, reducing the volume of unsold products 
and finding higher value ‘upcycling’ opportunities.  

In 2022, Goodman Fielder diverted 32,086 MT of 
food waste from landfills by converting unsold bread 
and other waste collected from our bakeries and sales 
returns into breadcrumbs and feedstock. We also 
launched initiatives to address food waste at home, 
including introducing a range of half loaf bread products 
to help consumers better manage food portioning and 
our Pampas Pastry’s Re-Pie-Cling campaign, which 
encourages customers to reuse leftovers in new meals.  

We are similarly focused on finding ‘upcycling’ 
opportunities in our sugar refineries and sell excess 
molasses and damaged or rejected packaged sugar 
as feedstock.  

Goodman Fielder and Sugar Australia also donate 
and sell surplus and not-fit-for-sale food products 
that would otherwise be thrown out to our charity 
partner, Foodbank Australia. For more information 
on our partnership with Foodbank, please refer to 
the Economic and Community Contribution section.  

Outside of our own operations, Goodman Fielder is a 
founding signatory of the Australian Food Pact. The 
pact aims to tackle Australia’s food waste challenge 
and halve food waste by 2030 from a 2021 baseline. As 
part of our pledge to develop and share solutions, we 
served as a key industry stakeholder in the development 
of a bread and bakery sector action plan and a national 
behaviour change campaign on food waste in homes 
launched in 2022. This year also marked the submission 
of our first food waste report as a signatory of the 
pact. Our New Zealand business is also one of the 
founding signatories to Kai Commitment and is 
currently establishing a baseline for 2022. The operations 
in other countries are committed to developing their 
baselines for 2022.

CHEMICALS

The use of World Health Organisation (WHO) Class 1A 
and 1B pesticides as well as Stockholm and Rotterdam 
Convention pesticides is prohibited in both our own 
operations and those of our suppliers, except for 
specific circumstances that strictly follow WHO 
recommendations and guidelines. 

We work closely with our suppliers to reduce overall 
chemical use. In our palm oil operations, we provide 
training for smallholders on efficient pesticide use and 
application methods while in our sugarcane operations, 
we have programmes in place to facilitate farmers 
making the switch to organic fertilisers. 

We use chemicals in our agricultural operations to protect our crops against diseases and pests and to achieve 
high productivity. However, we try as much as possible to minimise the use of chemicals in our agricultural 
operations, including those of our suppliers.  

The use of chemicals is guided by SOPs to protect workers, communities and the environment from exposure 
to hazardous chemicals. We also implement mechanical and biological strategies to control pests.

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) PARAQUAT

The use of paraquat is strictly prohibited in our oil palm 
plantations and our suppliers’ plantations. Paraquat, on 
the other hand, is allowed by local laws in our sugarcane 
plantations due to a lack of viable environmentally 
safe alternatives. Unlike other residual chemicals used 
in sugarcane farming, paraquat binds tightly to and 
becomes inert in soil. It does not leach into water and is 
beneficial for use in our Australian sugarcane plantations 
located near marine environments, notably the Great 
Barrier Reef. We require all contractors handling 
paraquat to use personal protective equipment (PPE) and 
obtain specific licences. For any substance that poses 
a potential hazard to workers or the environment, risk 
assessments are carried out. Notably, in our operations 
in Australia, chemicals are applied using Precision 
Agriculture through the use of mechanised boom 
applicators controlled from within a climate-controlled 
vehicle fitted with proper air filters so there is no direct 
exposure to chemicals. 

Rats, which feed on oil palm fruit and flowers, are a 
major concern in oil palm plantations and can cause 
substantial yield losses. To minimise the impacts of 
conventional rodenticides, which can cause chemical 
pollution to the environment and disrupt plantation 
areas, we breed and release barn owls to control the 
rat population. Barn owls are natural predators that 
rely heavily on rats as their main food source, making 
them an effective solution to regulate uncontrolled 
rat populations. Through our IPM approach, we have 
been able to reduce the use of our chemical rat bait 
in our plantations.  

We also monitor the level of active ingredients per ha for 
our sugar operations that are covered by the Bonsucro 
Production Standard. This covers all applied agro-
chemicals, including pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, 
fungicides and ripeners. In 2022, the chemical usage at 
our Australia operation was 4.58kg active ingredient 
per ha, within the Bonsucro limit.

While packaging helps to 
reduce food waste in the 
process by maintaining the 
safety and quality of our 
products for a prolonged 
period, the packaging 
waste is directly responsible 
for a number of broad 
environmental issues 
including overcrowded 
landfills, GHG emissions 
and litter pollution.
This creates a unique challenge for our 
industry to develop sustainable solutions 
taking both food waste and material efficiency 
into consideration. We work closely with 
our R&D teams and the wider industry to 
develop packaging solutions that reduce use 
of materials and allow end-users to reuse or 
recycle the materials.

OUR APPROACH TO IMPROVING PACKAGING IS CENTRED AROUND THE 
FOLLOWING THREE OBJECTIVES: 

REDUCING 
THE OVERALL 
AMOUNT OF 
MATERIALS USED

IMPROVING 
THE MATERIALS 
TO INCREASE 
SUSTAINABILITY

ENSURING THE

OUR DATA-DRIVEN STRATEGY FOR 
SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING 

YKA’S PROGRESS 

PLASTIC

INCREASING MATERIAL EFFICIENCY 

In 2020, we launched a Global Packaging Data Questionnaire to 
collect and analyse data across our business units (BUs) to identify 
the most widely used types of plastic and high-priority countries 
and BUs where we should seek to increase material efficiency. 
Material efficiency refers to the amount of product packed in per 
MT of plastic. 

The analysis revealed that Wilmar consumed approximately 330,000 
MT of plastic in 2020 with PET, HDPE and PP making up 80% of 
our total plastic consumption. In order to reduce overall plastic 
consumption, we concentrate our efforts on lightweighting, 
focusing on these key materials plastics in countries where the 
material efficiency is low. Lightweighting is a packaging solution 
that involves redesigning packaging to use fewer materials while 
maintaining its functionality. 

Through the “Sustainable Packaging 2025 Plan”, YKA targets to reduce the use of packaging materials by 
15,000 MT compared against a 2020 baseline. Between 2021 and 2022, we carried out 28 initiatives aimed 
at lightweighting packaging, promoting the reuse and recycling of packaging materials and incorporate the 
use of recycled materials. As of December 2022, we reduced packaging waste by 6,419 MT, more than 40% 
of our target. 

We actively engage with our supply chain partners to 
improve the integrity of our packaging which in turn 
reduces the amount of material needed to ensure the 
safety and quality of our products.  

In 2022, together with ExxonMobil and other supply 
chain partners, we developed a polyethylene (PE) 
film that is 11% thinner than conventional PE film 
while maintaining strength and durability. This high-
performance PE film, which has replaced conventional 
PE film in our rice grain packaging, has led to an annual 
reduction of 350 MT of PE plastic used as well as 1,130 
GJ of energy and 40,000 MT of water used upstream 
each year.  

We also developed high-performance stretch film with 
our supply chain partners that reduced the amount of 
film used to wrap and secure pallets by 50%. Pilots in 
several of our factories have led to a reduction in 27 
MT of stretch film used each year. Following the success 
of these pilots, we plan to roll out this solution across 
our entire operations in 2023. 

In addition to reducing the amount of plastic that we 
use, we are also committed to promoting the reuse and 
recycling of plastics. As such we use recycled materials 
in our feed raw material packaging representing 15,000 
MT less of plastic disposed and 36,000 MT less of coal 
used upstream annually.  

Finding a compromise between reducing plastic packaging and 
ensuring product safety and quality remains a key challenge. 
Lightweight packaging is more prone to tears and collapse, especially 
across long distances and certain markets perceive heavier-weight 
packaging with higher quality products.  

Therefore, we strive to balance these objectives through R&D and 
further research. Once we find this ‘sweet spot’, we plan to roll out 
our findings across the business, enabling us to generate greater 
returns on our plastic reduction in the future. 

Despite the challenges, our lightweighting trials have shown 
promising results thus far. We have had success in lightweighting 
plastic bottles and pouches in several markets with no incidents 
of leakage during handling and transportation. While trials are still 
ongoing, COVID-19 has unfortunately delayed many of our projects. 

SUSTAINABLE 
PACKAGING ACTIVITIES 

As local regulations and customer preferences are often distinct, each country drives its own packaging solutions 
and strategies for sustainable packaging. We have made significant progress with sustainable packaging across 
our businesses. 

MATERIALS USED 

In 2022, Wilmar used a total of 1,146,868 MT of materials for packaging (plastic and non-plastic) across our 
business operations, of which 75% were made from renewable materials. 

In recognition of our efforts to promote sustainable packaging, our 
“less plastic rice packaging solution” was awarded the Technology 
Innovation Award at the 2022 Packaging Innovation and Sustainable 
Development Awards. Our recycled feed raw material packaging 
was similarly awarded the Recycling Scheme Award at the Blue Star 
Sustainable Development Packaging Competition.

PAPER

We use more than 80% recycled content in our cardboard 
shipping boxes. This is a significant achievement for 
us as shipping boxes represent a significant portion 
of Goodman Fielder’s overall packaging consumption.  

We overhaul our 
packaging to 
consume less plastic, 
increase recycled 
content and improve 
recyclability.  

Across Australia and New Zealand, we have also 
converted all our bread tags from polystyrene plastic 
to cardboard. This change has led to a reduction in 
300 million items of plastic produced and 120 MT 
of polystyrene plastic used each year. To ensure we 
keep our plastic bags and packaging out of landfills, 
Goodman Fielder and New Zealand Sugar are part 

of the New Zealand Soft Plastic Recycling Scheme 
of which Goodman Fielder is a founding partner. The 
programme provides logistic solutions to facilitate 
the collection and recycling of soft plastics. In 2022, 
we helped facilitate the collection of 6.7 MT of soft 
plastic, equivalent to more than one million units of 
bread bags and dairy wraps.  

WONDER RECYCLING 
REWARDS PROGRAMME 

To promote and educate schools about plastic recycling, 
Goodman Fielder enlists the help of over 400,000 
students across Australia to participate in collecting 
and recycling bread bags and other soft plastics. The 
Wonder Recycling Rewards Programme, now in its 
second year, shows students first-hand how something as 
simple as recycling bread bags can help reduce landfills.  

In 2022, a total of 266,000 bread bags, equivalent to 
12,000 kg of plastic, were diverted from landfills. The 
collected bread bags were sent to our recyclers and 
turned into play equipment and other products such as 
aggregate for concrete that can be used for sports fields. 

In recognition of our efforts to promote recycling, the 
Wonder Recycling Rewards Programme was recognised 
as the Campaign of the Year by Cartology and received 
the Environmental, Social and Governance Award by the 
Media Federation of Australia (MFA) in 2022.

Goodman Fielder has made significant progress towards sustainable packaging goals by using less material in packaging 
and from more sustainable sources.

GOODMAN FIELDER’S 
PROGRESS 

PLASTIC

Goodman Fielder’s sustainable packaging framework focuses on three 
pillars: using less material in packaging and from more sustainable 
sources, achieving the best functionality with the least impact and 
to actively drive the circular economy for used packaging. In 2022, 
we made significant progress towards our sustainable packaging 
goals and are on track to meet our 2025 targets. 

We overhaul our packaging to consume less plastic, increase 
recycled content and improve recyclability.  

In New Zealand, we use 30% recycled content HDPE plastic in 
our milk bottles, representing 250 MT of recycled plastic used 
instead of virgin plastic each year. To ensure our milk bottles 
can be recycled, we also remove the white resin colouring from 
our bottles. In Australia, we launch a range of mayonnaise 
bottles and jars made with 100% locally-sourced recycled 
PET reducing our use of virgin PET by 380 MT each year.

TEMPORARY WORKERS
2-8

Wilmar does not engage any non-guaranteed hours 
employees but hires temporary workers as they play 
an important role in fulfilling seasonal harvest needs or 
specialist timebound tasks in our upstream plantations.  

When sugarcane is in season, our sugar business hires 
temporary workers to meet the increased workforce 
needs in our sugarcane plantations and mills. In an 
effort to provide more work opportunities for our 
temporary workers, our sugar business has conducted 

trial initiatives with industries that have a complementary 
season. However, most of the temporary workers 
in our sugar operations have their own plantations 
to tend to or prefer to be on temporary contract 
employment, thus the initiative did not work out. 
Some of our temporary workers in our Indonesia 
palm oil operations are smallholders or small-scale 
entrepreneurs who also prefer the flexibility offered 
by temporary work arrangements.

Training between one to six months is 
conducted for all levels of employees, with 
additional specialist training tracks of two 
to three days for new managers, newly 
promoted managers, sales managers and 
other groups. To facilitate internal knowledge 
transfers, some of the courses were taught 
by directors or deputy directors with career 
mentors aiding the training. The training has 
been effective in increasing our talent pool. 
In 2022, the training enabled promotions of 
employees to qualified managers and for 
people to be posted to new projects across 
the country to contribute as leaders and 
department managers. 

Following this model, 70% of training is through “learning by doing”, 20% is 
from mentor guidance and self-learning and 10% is learning through training 
activities such as online courses and conferences. To meet our employees’ 
training and development aspirations and to achieve the 10% target, we provide 
online and offline courses on topics ranging from persuasive communication to 
project management. We also launched a competency-based training series for 
our marketing supervisors working in the field. We continue to pilot and roll out 
further internal virtual training. 

To promote a more conducive working and living environment, training 
initiatives for our employees in the plantations and mills focus on raising 
awareness of environmental protection and reducing environmental pollution.

offer better job opportunities, reduce our dependence on subcontractors, reduce 
turnover and better manage our skilled workforce.  

To inspire the next generation of employees, many of our markets offer different 
programmes to candidates at the start of their career, from internships and graduate 
programmes to apprenticeships and traineeships. We have also established several

E-LEARNING PLATFORM  

E-learning is invaluable in enabling inclusivity and access to 
training and development. It is also a tool that has enabled 
us to continue developing our people during the COVID-19 
pandemic. We continue to leverage e-learning, developing 
more e-learning courses for different employee levels that 
complement formal training, mentoring and on-the-job  
technical training. 

In 2021, we also implemented a new online learning management 
system, Litmos, where a wide range of topics including leadership 
development, communication skills and technical training have 
been made available.

In addition, we acknowledge the importance of ensuring that 
our workers’ performance and career development needs are 
well-recognised. Employees receive a formal performance review 
which allows development opportunities and relevant training to 
be identified, in line with the individual’s areas of responsibility 
and career aspirations.  

In 2022, 81% of our total workforce received performance and 
career development reviews.

RETAINING TALENT

To retain talent, we offer our people a wide range of 
internal opportunities so they can grow. As a company 
with large operations across the globe, we are able to 
offer attractive options for employees to gain exposure 
to different aspects of our business, from ‘plantation to 
plate’ and to different parts of the world, from Asia to 
Africa. Mature workers bring a wealth of experience. 
To retain employees who are nearing retirement, we 
provide various options including conversion to part-
time employment and flexible work arrangements, 
should they require it.  

We also provide gratuity payments to long-service 
employees who have contributed significantly to 
Wilmar’s performance. These payments go beyond 
legal requirements and take into account the employee’s 
length of service and performance. 

In 2022, 21% of our open positions were filled by 
internal candidates. Senior leadership and human 
resources work closely together on succession planning 
for key positions, evaluating bench strength and future 
potential.  

TRACKING EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 

To build an active and engaged workforce and foster 
an open feedback culture, Wilmar’s respective country 
operations regularly conduct employee engagement 
surveys. The survey is aimed at capturing our employees’ 
feedback and level of engagement. Survey responses 
complement our proactive efforts to optimise areas for 
improvement within the business practice and provide 
an effective avenue for us to understand and address 
critical feedback. 

In 2022, the surveys covered approximately 32% of 
the workforce, of which 98% responded that they 
are “actively engaged”, “engaged” or “somewhat 
engaged”. 

We believe our talent strategy has led Wilmar to 
maintain a high tenure amongst employees, averaging 
over 10 years. Total employee turnover rate in 2022 
was 13% and the voluntary employee turnover rate 
was 9%. Our total new employee hire rate in 2022 
was 11%.

TACKLING ROOT CAUSES OF LABOUR 
ISSUES IN OIL PALM PLANTATIONS

LIVING WAGE 

To better understand the systemic labour and human rights risks that could occur in our Indonesian oil palm 
plantations, Wilmar has been working with our technical partner and labour rights expert, Verité, since 2017. 
This partnership focuses on identifying the possible root causes of child labour, the link between work and pay 
practices and emerging labour issues.

Wilmar is committed to assessing and ensuring that 
all our employees, contractors and suppliers are paid 
a living wage. Our assessments are based on available 
living wage frameworks for the countries and regions we 
operate in, including the Global Living Wage Coalition, 
Wage Indicator Foundation, MIT Living Wage Calculator 
and RSPO Living Wage Benchmark. 

We similarly assess that our suppliers pay all their 
workers including contractors’ workers a living wage 
via our SRT. In countries and regions where universal 
benchmarks on what is considered a living wage are not 

available, our assessments focus on ensuring workers 
in our supply chain are paid at least minimum wage 
and have access to benefits such as non-mandatory 
savings schemes, healthcare, childcare and housing. 
For more information on the SRT and initiatives to 
ensure the payment of a living wage, please refer to 
our Palm NDPE Implementation Annual Report 2022.

We also provide free housing, facilities and benefits 
for employees who choose to stay on site at our oil 
palm plantations in remote areas. 

Wilmar prohibits all forms of forced, trafficked or 
bonded labour within our operations and supply chain. 
We do not retain identification documents nor personal 
belongings of employees and workers without their 
consent. Secure lockers are provided for workers to 
store their identification documents  and are accessible 
without restrictions.

Since launching our NDPE Policy in 2013, we have 
committed to ensuring ethical recruitment and zero 
recruitment fees extending from our “No Exploitation 
of People and Local Communities” commitment. In 
Malaysia and Indonesia, we recruit workers directly to 
mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labour 
in our palm oil operations. All recruitment fees and 
related costs are also borne by us. This commitment 
minimises the risk of forced labour occurring through 
contract misrepresentation and debt bondage brought 
about by excessive recruitment fees charged by 

agents – a common problem in the agricultural sector, 
especially when hiring foreign workers are involved.  In 
cases where we use recruitment agencies, it is only to 
support our documentation processes, only licensed 
and authorised agents will be utilised for such cases. 
In Nigeria and Ghana, we limit the use of contracted 
agents for logistical and administrative purposes only. 
To prevent the risk of exploitation, all salaries and 
remuneration are transacted directly between Wilmar 
and the workers.

We conduct regular internal audits including evaluations 
of human rights and labour practices throughout our 
upstream and downstream operations. These audits play 
a vital role in ensuring fundamental internal controls on 
compliance activities operate effectively and validating 
the effectiveness of ESG-related controls and activities 
to help us manage those risks and foster resilience.

OUR APPROACH INCLUDES:

ON-THE-GROUND ASSESSMENT

TRAINING

STRATEGY

ROLL OUT TO ALL 
INDONESIAN OPERATIONS

Through an initial 12-month programme at PT. Daya 
Labuhan Indah and PT. Perkebunan Milano in North 
Sumatra, Verité conducted on-the-ground assessments 
with the aim of building internal processes and 
competencies and developing sustainable solutions to 
recurring labour rights issues.

Training was provided to address the issues identified 
by Verité in their initial assessment and raise labour 
standards in our palm oil operations in Indonesia. 
Pending the roll-out of the programme, we plan to 
conduct similar trainings for high-level management 
across all our Indonesian operations, including 
Kalimantan. 

Following these assessments, we implemented a three-
year strategy to enhance our systems. This strategy was 
reviewed in 2020 with our teams at PT. Daya Labuhan 
Indah and PT. Perkebunan Milano, making significant 
progress in addressing a number of issues. Verité will 
carry out the final ground verification in Q2 2023. 

We aimed to launch the same programme throughout 
our Indonesian operations, including Kalimantan, but 
unfortunately this was delayed due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.

MODERN SLAVERY

Wilmar respects employees’ freedom of association. 
All employees have the right to form and join unions 
of their choice and to bargain collectively to negotiate 
work relations effectively, so that both employers and 
workers have an equal voice in negotiations and that 
the outcome is fair and equitable. Where the right to 
freedom of association and collective bargaining are 
restricted under law, the employer facilitates parallel 
means of independent and free association and 
bargaining for all such personnel. As at end December 
2022, 97% of our eligible employees worldwide are 
covered by collective bargaining agreements.

The forms of collective bargaining differ from 
country-to-country depending on local situations and 
legislation, as shown in the map here.

We are committed to protecting and safeguarding the rights and safety of children. Wilmar does not tolerate 
any form of child labour, exploitation or abuse. While we assess and monitor our entire operations with regard 
to children’s rights and safety, we pay close attention to our upstream oil palm plantations, where risks to 
children’s rights and safety are the greatest. 

CHILDREN’S RIGHTS AND SAFETY
408-1

ENSURING CHILD SAFETY 

EDUCATION AS A SOLUTION 
TO CHILD LABOUR

Child safety is a significant concern in our upstream 
palm operations. Many children live with their parents 
in workers’ housing and attend schools and crèches 
located in close proximity to our plantations which are 
exposed to inherent hazards. 

The Sustainability Department, independent of our 
plantation operations, carries out annual child safety 

assessments across our upstream palm operations 
in Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Ghana. These 
assessments help us identify and record any potential 
risks to children, if these risks are recurring issues and 
what programmes or interventions are being put in 
place to improve overall child safety.

Providing children with access to education is an important part of 
our strategy towards eliminating child labour. We build schools in 
all our oil palm plantations for our employees’ children to attend. 

In 2022, Wilmar supported 12,093 (89.5%#) children of compulsory 
school age in our oil palm plantations in their education. We 
monitor these figures through a census at each plantation. 

We also operate 154 crèches across our palm plantation operations. 
As of December 2022, 4,091 children, from newborns to four-year-
olds, of Wilmar employees benefitted from the crèches. In an effort 
to increase access to education across the communities where 
we operate, we also build and support schools in underprivileged 
regions and fund scholarships for deserving students. 

#EY has performed limited assurance procedures on these figures.

As part of our commitment to address children’s rights and safety in the palm oil industry, we worked with Business for Social 
Responsibility (BSR) and other consumer brand companies to develop and publish our Child Protection and Safeguarding 
Implementation Manual. The manual provides comprehensive and pragmatic guidance for our upstream palm oil operators to 
better understand the steps required to protect and safeguard children’s rights. 

To build capacity amongst our suppliers on bettering child protection within their operations, we organised a series of 
workshops to introduce our child protection policy and manual. In 2021, we began piloting the manual in selected oil palm 
plantations across selected supplier sites in Indonesia and Malaysia. The results of the pilot, which is still ongoing, will help 
us highlight areas of improvement and be used to further refine the manual. Key lessons learned will be shared with Wilmar’s 
supply base in both countries.

Initially developed for the Indonesian context, we are also developing a manual suitable for the Malaysian context.  
We are currently finalising the manual and aim to launch it in 2023.

Children living in rural palm oil communities are 
vulnerable to a number of risks due to poverty, social 
exclusion and limited access to government services. 
To guide the sector in improving the health, safety and 
education of children living in or near plantations, the 
Children in Plantation (CiP) Directory was published 
in collaboration with Earthworm Foundation, Archer 
Daniels Midland Company (ADM) and other consumer 
brand companies. Directed towards supporting 
children in rural Malaysia, the directory was the first 
publication of its kind in the country. The directory

education, community engagement, birth registration

Wilmar’s child safety programme in Australia, CANE 
TRAIN, aims to raise awareness of safety regulations 
in sugar mills and refineries for children living and 
attending schools in surrounding areas. The programme 
outlines what sugar production looks like and how to 
stay safe in these surroundings. With the help of our 
CANE TRAIN mascot “Sam the Wilmar Sugar Train”, 
children are taught the necessary precautions to stay 
safe and how to understand safety signs on display 
around the area.

INDIGENOUS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY RIGHTS
411-1

ENSURING FREE, PRIOR AND INFORMED 
CONSENT (FPIC)

Wilmar is committed to respecting and upholding the 
legal and customary land tenure rights and the individual 
rights of indigenous and local communities in line 
with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous People, the HCSA toolkit and RSPO P&C. 

We require FPIC from indigenous and local communities 
prior to any new planting to ensure local communities 
have clear and specific avenues to negotiate the 
conditions of any project. In land-related planning, 
participatory mapping involves affected communities 
and their representatives, relevant stakeholders and, 
where appropriate, supporting NGOs and independent 
experts. We will respond to any disputes or conflicts 
that arise in a timely and transparent manner following 
the steps stipulated in our Grievance Procedure and 
take action to remediate any adverse human rights 
impacts we have caused or contributed to. Further 
details on grievance raised can be found on our  
Sustainability Dashboard.

Wilmar also actively participates in the RSPO’s Human 
Rights Working Group (HRWG) and co-chairs the FPIC 
sub-group within the HRWG. The HRWG seeks to 
ensure the implementation of the RSPO P&C relevant 
to the protection of human rights while the sub-group 
explores practical solutions relating to the application 
of FPIC within the sector. Where feasible, we seek to 
support food security in local communities by helping 
farmers grow other crops and establish food production 
businesses. For example, in Ghana, we allocate areas of 
land for our workers to grow vegetables and supervise 
them to ensure safe and responsible agrochemical use 
and that other safety protocols are followed. Through 
this initiative, we have helped increase food security for 
most of our workers, enabling them to farm a variety 
of vegetables close to home and live a healthier and 
more balanced lifestyle. This in turn has also increased 
workers’ productivity on our plantations.

In 2020, Wilmar and local communities in the Pasaman Barat district of West Sumatra, Indonesia, 
concluded a longstanding land dispute related to a land acquisition issue in the 1990s. The conflict 
reflects the complexity of land use and ownership rights in Indonesia as well as many of the 
underlying factors influencing land conflicts in this region. 

Earthworm Foundation has supported Wilmar and the Maligi community to reach a resolution 
since 2018. Public reports were published by Earthworm Foundation detailing the resolution 
process and outcome, outlining our efforts to establish mutual trust and conductive discussion 
environments through intense consultation, dialogue and negotiation with the local people 
following the FPIC process in order to reach an agreement. 

The success of this negotiation has helped us further develop procedures to improve the 
effectiveness of our grievance handling process. One important lesson gained from this 
engagement was the need to engage directly with communities on the ground to understand first-
hand what their concerns and needs are. These efforts are in line with Wilmar’s wider efforts such 
as the update of our NDPE Policy in 2019 and introduction of our “No Exploitation Protocol”.

CAPACITY 
BUILDING

OUR HUMAN RIGHTS DUE 
DILIGENCE (HRDD) APPROACH

Providing human rights training for our employees 
and suppliers is an important component of our 
human rights commitment. 

We provide regular training for our internal 
sustainability teams to help them stay abreast of 
new developments in the palm oil sector. Topics 
include FPIC, ethical recruitment audits and 
managing forced labour risks.

Suppliers may demonstrate compliance with 
our human rights commitments through our 
NDPE Policy, specifically our “No Exploitation” 
commitments. As such, we provide regular training 
on topics such as implementing our Child Protection 
Policy, improving labour practices in the palm oil 
industry and labour standards for specific regions.  
Since 2015, we have conducted more than 40 
training sessions on human rights-related topics, 
with more than 600 suppliers participating globally.

The HRDD process is crucial for us as it provides a 
systematic approach to respecting human rights. 
We consider HRDD to be an ongoing process that 
regularly prompts us to evaluate our strategies and 
programmes. We also keep a close eye on legal 
changes and stakeholder demands to uphold our 
commitment to HRDD. 

Our HRDD approach is aligned with the UNGPs 
on Business and Human Rights, which includes the 
following elements: policy commitment; assessment 
of human rights impacts (actual and potential); 
integration of findings; tracking performance; 
communication about how we address impacts; 
and implementing processes for remediation.

DIVERSITY  
AND INCLUSION
3-3, 405-1, 405-2, 406-1

At Wilmar, we believe in creating 
a work environment that is 
diverse, non-discriminatory and 
provides equal opportunities. 

With a diverse global workforce, 
Wilmar continues to benefit from 
new and unique perspectives 
that have helped us serve our 
wide range of customers and 
consumers.

By sharing and celebrating our similarities and differences, 
we can empower our employees to be their best self at work. 
In particular, given the context of the traditionally male-
dominated industries we operate in, we understand and 
emphasise the importance of championing and supporting 
women in the workplace, recognising the crucial roles they 
play and enabling a fair and inclusive environment in which 
they can thrive.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION 
IN THE WORKPLACE 

At Wilmar, every Country Head and Business Head is accountable for ensuring that diverse and inclusive 
practices are implemented in our workplace. We have a number of policies supporting our approach.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITY POLICY BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY

Our Equal Opportunity Policy sets out our commitment 
to ensure all employees have the right to equal 
opportunities and treatment, regardless of race, colour, 
gender, age, social class, religion, sexual orientation, 
political views or disability. This commitment applies 
to all our Human Resources processes, including 
recruitment, promotions, training and development, 
and retirement.

In line with recommendations made by the Singapore 
Council for Board Diversity and the new SGX listing 
rules of 1 January 2022, Wilmar has adopted an 
updated Board Diversity Policy which includes 
quantitative gender diversity targets of increasing 
female representation on the Board to 25% by 2025 
and 30% by 2030. The policy continues to ensure that 
Directors are selected from a wide range of backgrounds 
with diverse skills, qualifications and relevant experience.

GENDER DIVERSITY 
IN OUR WORKFORCE 

In 2022, 24% of our total global employee 
headcount was female. Women also make up 
27% of all management positions. Regardless 
of gender, all employees and workers are paid 
equally based on their roles and experience. We 
recognise that our operations reside predominantly 
in traditionally male-dominated industries. As such, 
we are progressively working towards improving 
female representation at all levels of our workforce.

PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 

Wilmar currently employs 85 employees with disabilities 
across our global operations, which accounts for approximately 
0.07% of our total workforce. There was three turnover of 
employees with disabilities. In 2022, we had 16 new hires 
with disabilities.

To meet Wilmar’s needs for packaging materials, and in line with our dedication to alleviate 
employment issues for PWDs, Wilmar partnered with Shandong Yuanxin Lufeng Plastic Packaging 
to establish a packaging factory in Linyi. This packaging factory is positioned as a welfare enterprise 
and is dedicated to providing PWDs with employment opportunities. We are planning to hire more 
than 300 PWDs, consisting of 170 current staff from Yuanxin Lufeng Plastic Packaging and another 
130 PWDs from external recruitment. 

The new packaging factory will provide free and high-quality accommodation for the new hires. 
Couples who are both disabled are eligible to live together in a separate apartment. The construction 
of the new facilities, including office buildings and staff housing, are in strict adherence to accessibility 
standards for the disabled. A rehabilitation centre will also be built to offer a variety of rehabilitation, 
entertainment and fitness facilities for employees to use.

PROTECTING WOMEN’S RIGHTS 

Women are an important part of our workforce. Recognising that women have vulnerabilities and responsibilities, 
both in and outside the workplace, we are committed to providing the best possible means of support for them.

WOMEN’S WORKING GROUPS 
AND GENDER COMMITTEES 

WILMAR’S WOMEN’S CHARTER

We began establishing women’s committees in our 
oil palm plantations in 2007, regardless of RSPO 
certification status. Since 2020, Women’s Working 
Groups (WoW) or Gender Committees have been 
established in 100% of our oil palm plantations in 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Ghana and they 
play a critical role in helping to socialise our social-
related policies. Prior to that, we formed the Women’s 
Committee Steering Group in April 2019 to ensure 
consistency and alignment with the five key focus 
areas of the Wilmar Women’s Charter. 

In 2019, Wilmar launched our Women’s Charter which 
outlines our commitment to respecting women’s rights 
and ensuring their welfare. A number of other policies, 
including our Sexual Harassment, Violence and Abuse, 
and Reproductive Rights Policy support our Women’s 
Charter. 

The Charter takes account of the fact that Wilmar 
employs people to work in diverse environments, 
including our plantations, mills and offices. The Charter 
applies to our operations globally and is implemented 
through various initiatives that are suited to specific 
local environments. The Charter is implemented in 
our upstream oil palm plantations through the local 
Women’s Working Groups, which report directly to 
the plantation or mill management.

Improving the health and well-being of women at our oil palm 
plantations is one of our key priorities. An area of focus for us 
is maternal health. Through the efforts of our WoWs, we have 
launched several initiatives in our plantations such as:  

• Training, group sessions and meetings to raise 
awareness on topics including reproductive rights, 
birth control options and the importance of regular 
screenings for breast and cervical cancer 

• Equal access to health services 

• Maternal health cards that track women’s prenatal 
health indicators

PROTECTION AND CARE OF FEMALE HEALTH 

01

02

To help women better care for their children and families, we support them with:

CARE OF FAMILY LIFE AND WELFARE 

• Training, group sessions and meetings: 
Topics covered include childhood nutrition and 
awareness on child diseases like hand, foot and 
mouth disease 
 

• Childhood vaccinations: To help mothers 
understand the importance of childhood 
vaccinations – for example, to prevent the 
disease polio – we carry out health-related 
campaigns in conjunction with local hospitals 
and local health authorities 

• Childcare: Providing crèches are an important 
part of our efforts towards enhancing women’s 
welfare as they provide a safe place for children 
to be looked after while their mothers go to 
work. To improve the safety of our crèches, we 
introduced crèche registration and attendance 
records for children. The crèche records 
provide general information on the child, such 
as attendance and vaccination history, which 
our crèches will use to ensure children receive 
all mandatory immunisation

In Indonesia, we were engaged by the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (IPOA), the Ministry of Women 
and Children, Partnership for Action Against Child Labour and Agriculture Indonesia, UNICEF and other 
organisations, to provide input and perspectives on women workers and children rights. This led to the 
development of a handbook for children’s protection. This handbook includes best practices on how to 
protect children and is distributed to all plantation companies in Indonesia who are IPOA members.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT REPORTING  
AND HANDLING PROCEDURES

We believe in the importance of having robust processes for the reporting and 
handling of cases on sexual harassment. WoWs and Gender Committees have been 
set up as channels to receive and investigate any sexual harassment-related cases. 
Since 2019, we have strengthened this process by providing capacity building to 
explain what constitutes sexual harassment, to avoid receiving reported cases that 
do not constitute sexual harassment - a problem our WoW teams had encountered 
in the past as they were tasked to investigate all reported cases. Examples of such 
cases include incidents where parents objecting to their adult children’s consensual 
relationships or spouses raising cases of extra-marital affairs. 

To ensure the protection of children against child sexual abuse, Wilmar also 
introduced an initiative that educates children on understanding the extent of child 
sexual abuse, grooming practices, and what constitutes safe and unsafe interactions. 
With prior engagement with parents on the programme, and using local languages 
and dialects, the training included songs and quizzes to allow children to participate 
effectively. This initiative is one way in which Wilmar upholds its Child Protection 
Policy. This programme is being extended to Wilmar’s school partners in Malaysia in 
2023. For more information on this initiative, refer to our sustainability briefs.

PROTECTION FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE 

03

We are passionate about cultivating a 
diverse and equitable workplace and 
supporting worker representation. To 
ensure we constantly improve how we 
address issues related to diversity and 
inclusivity in Malaysia and Indonesia, our 
WoW management teams stay connected 
to provide feedback, raise awareness, 
exchange relevant knowledge and 
report issues on time. We also ensure 
female representation in all levels of our 
workforce. All our worker representation 
committees include at least one female 
member to represent the voice of female 
employees. We encourage all our women 
employees to apply for internal promotion 
and opportunities.

NON-DISCRIMINATORY, FAIR 
AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES 
AT WORK AND IN WORKER 
REPRESENTATION

04

In 2021, we launched in Malaysia a series of 
online training on gender-based violence, 
covering topics such as sexual violence, anti-
harassment, child sexual abuse and domestic 
violence. To carry out the training, we worked 
with Women’s Aid Organisation, a Malaysian-
based NGO that promotes women’s rights, 
specifically on addressing violence against 
women. Originally planned as face-to-face 
workshops, we had to adopt an online format 
due to the movement restriction order during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  

THREE WORKSHOPS HAVE BEEN 
CONDUCTED AS OF MARCH 2022, targeting 
different levels of management. The first 
workshop was conducted with management 
based in Malaysia (who are mostly male), 
focusing on what gender-based violence is and 
how to report cases. The second workshop 
was conducted with WoWs in our plantations 
in Sabah and Sarawak, educating them of an 
action plan in the instance of incidences involving 
gender-based violence, which includes how 
to speak to the accuser and so on. These two 

workshops received positive feedback from 
participants stating that they were now more 
confident to apply the knowledge to their daily 
line of work. The final face-to-face workshop for 
workers in Malaysia was held in March 2022. In 
the next phase, similar training will be conducted 
for plantation workers in Indonesia.  

Similarly, in Indonesia, we have conducted 
smaller scale training on sexual harassment and 
exploitation in plantations, educating plantation 
workers on topics such as the various forms of 
sexual harassment, emotional and psychological 
aspects of sexual harassment, child sexual 
exploitation and examples of sexual harassment 
in the plantations. We collaborated with the 
IPOA to conduct this training.  

In addition, we collaborated with Indonesian 
trade unions to create the manual “Protecting 
the Rights of Women Workers in Palm Oil 
Plantations”. The manual offers tools for palm oil 
companies to improve the working conditions for 
their female employees. 

TRAINING ON GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE IN 
MALAYSIA AND INDONESIA  

CASE STUDY

WoW ensures that we arrange regular training and 
education for the women in our plantations to support 
their personal and family life. For example, we held health 
and safety awareness talks for mothers at our learning 
centres17  to provide more information on pregnancy. 
In addition, pregnant workers are advised on postnatal 
information such as breastfeeding, breast care and how to 
care for their baby.

EHS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
403-1, 403-4, 403-8

WILMAR INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (WIMS) 

WIMS is our integrated EHS management system 
which was implemented in 2017 to minimise workplace 
health and safety risks. It is an overarching global 
system enabling us to have a common and consistent 
approach to EHS management which also:

• FOLLOWS internationally recognised 
standards, including ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 
45001:2018

• COVERS the entire Group and all our 
employees including contractors, despite EHS 
management systems being mandatory only 
in selected countries.

WIMS is regularly audited internally to improve our 
health and safety performance, usually annually or 
when there is a change in the standards we follow. 
The audit covers both employees’ and contractors’ 
performance in Wilmar EHS Programmes. 

In 2022, WIMS was revised and reissued to meet ISO 
14001 and 45001 requirements. The revision included 
identifying relevant internal and external stakeholders, 
issues, as well as risks and opportunities. Contractor 
Management, Procurement and Management of Change 
were also included to meet the standards requirement.

We continue to strive to improve WIMS, with the latest 
initiative being a thorough gap assessment tool that has 
been rolled out for sites to perform self-assessments 
to identify gaps within their own system, which will 
provide a baseline for the roll-out of the Corporate 
EHS Audit Programme in 2023. Workstreams will be 
formed, with champions identified from respective 
countries and regions to coach sites for the WIMS 
implementation. Additionally, we will continue to 
develop new guidelines and training materials to guide 
operations for implementation.

and 16.9% to ISO 45001. We aim to implement the same health and safety 
management level within the next three years across our remaining sites.

RISK ASSESSMENTS

To identify work-related hazards for all employees and 
workers, we engage trained personnel to carry out risk 
assessments that are aligned with national and ISO 
standards. The assessments then identify work-related 
hazards and enable our implementation of solutions 
to eliminate or minimise the hazards. Additionally, we 
also developed a systematic and documented process 
that evaluates risks related to routine and non-routine 
tasks. With Job Safety and Environmental Analysis 
standards and tools, our risk management framework 
is implemented at all sites to identify any EHS-related 
hazards. Wilmar uses the hierarchy of controls when 
identifying control measures.

RISK ASSESSMENTS
403-2, 403-3 

USING THE RESULTS 

Using the results of these assessments, we implement 
appropriate measures, such as engineering control 
solutions, to eliminate or minimise these identified 

EHS COMMITTEES

A Safety Leadership team for upstream and downstream 
operations was set up at the Group-level to set and 
review EHS policies, standards and performance. 
Best management practices and lessons learned are 
shared and cascaded to all downstream and upstream 
operations. Group EHS meetings are held on a quarterly 
basis.

To provide a platform for open communication between 
employees and management, we also established EHS 

Committees at either country or site-level with worker 
representatives. This helps us to address EHS issues 
affecting Wilmar’s workforce. The EHS Committee is also 
the platform for deliberating workplace safety policies, 
rules and procedures. The committee is responsible 
for investigating accidents when they occur, and the 
committee meets at least once every three months, 
though site EHS Committees may also meet as and 
when needed depending on the risk basis.

SAFETY MANAGEMENT POLICY & STANDARDS 

To further reduce the risk and severity of EHS hazards, Wilmar has developed several policies such as our High 
Risk Work Policy, Incident and Hazard Reporting Policy and Process Safety Management Policy, to lay out how 
we manage and address health and safety issues, as well as to ensure that we maintain compliance with all 
health and safety requirements. 

WE DEVELOPED SPOT 
AUDIT TOOLS FOR HIGH 
RISK WORK TO SUPPORT 
SITE-LEVEL INSPECTION 
AND ENSURE COMPLIANCE. 

Findings and remedial actions are 
recorded from audits and followed 
up to ensure improvements are 
implemented.

Workplace safety and health (WSH) has taken on increased 
importance and prominence, not only in Singapore, but globally 
wherever Wilmar operates. Relevant laws, practices and policies 
are designed to ensure all stakeholders, including employers 
and employees, have the responsibility of working towards an 
environment free of risks to health and safety and conducive 
to ensuring the continued productivity and efficiency of an 
organisation.

Following a concerning rise in workplace fatalities, the 
Singapore government introduced new measures to strengthen 
WSH practices. These new measures require top management, 
including directors of companies and those in charge of WSH 
matters, to ensure that proper risk assessments are conducted, 
safe work procedures are in place and employees are trained in 
and follow such work procedures. 

Wilmar’s Executive Directors have been designated as the 
contact point between Wilmar’s Health, Safety, Security & 
Environment Department and the Board of Directors to oversee 
the implementation of the Group’s WSH Policy and action 
plan, including the principles and measures set out in the new 
Code of Practice on Chief Executives’ and Board of Directors’ 
WSH duties which has been gazetted as an Approved Code of 
Practice by the Singapore government effective 31 October 
2022. To underscore the importance of WSH matters and to set 
the tone from the top, WSH matters are regularly discussed at 
Board meetings.

STRENGTHENING WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH

We consult workers on their needs and expectations, 
following which EHS policies are established, with 
objectives set and plans put in place to achieve a 
safer workplace.  To ensure all our operations abide by 
our policies, we implement a suite of EHS standards, 
guidelines, gap assessment tools and training materials, 
including the HRW Standard Gap Assessment. In 2022, 
we developed and revised EHS standards such as the 
Permit to Work (PTW), Wilmar Incident Notification, 
Reporting and Investigation Standard and Emergency 
Management. 

hazards. The results are used to continuously enhance 
our processes, including WIMS, risk controls and other 
SOPs, as well as to identify relevant training needs.

We also ensure that workers participate in risk 
assessments, near miss reporting and incident 
investigations related to their areas of expertise, 
including inviting workers to provide feedback on 
procurement and contractor services to improve our 
risk assessment and identification of hazards.  

In 2022, Wilmar’s HRW Campaign was launched 
through Enablon to assess our level of compliance 
and behaviours against HRW Standards. This self-
assessment serves as the baseline for the upcoming 
Corporate EHS Audit in 2023.

GLOBAL E-LEARNING PROGRAMME 

HEALTHCARE

Beyond having standards and systems in place, it is crucial for 
us to raise EHS awareness among our employees to prevent 
workplace accidents. One of the WIMS requirements is that all our 
workers attend relevant EHS training, especially those performing 
higher risk tasks. We conduct regular training and provide access 
to educational materials in native languages to ensure that our 
workers are up to date on requirements and best practices. 

Leveraging the e-learning system we built during the COVID-19 
pandemic, we continue to ensure that our employees and workers 
always have access to training materials and assessment tools that 
help them execute their roles safely and effectively. 

A total of 19 countries and regions from our global operations 
participate in the LMS and we continue to deploy our LMS across 
other countries and regions. In 2022, our LMS saw increased 
uptake, achieving 4,012 active users – 80% up from 2,226 users 
in 2021. We also added five new modules (or two courses) to the 
LMS, identified 20 LMS Champions and saw 86% of EHS courses 
completed. LMS now has 37 modules.

Wilmar has taken steps to review the quality and 
effectiveness of our current healthcare systems to ensure 
they are able to address the health issues faced by our 
workforce and provide emergency medical support 
when needed. We have also set up Plantation Health 
and Wellness Committees at country-level to improve 
our healthcare systems and services at plantations.

We pay very close attention to the accessibility of 
healthcare for our employees. In some of our operations, 
such as on our plantations, workers and their families 
have free access to on-site clinics. In facilities where we 
do not have clinics on-site, we establish an agreement 
with a nearby hospital to ensure medical treatment is 
available should the need arise. 

We provide health insurance for employees, with some 
covering family members, across most of our operations. 
Some of our operations also provide group personal 
accident insurance, offering employees added security 
should they have an accident and reducing the burden 
of medical expenses on them. 

Annual medical check-ups are also required in most 
of our operations. In some parts of the business and 
for certain roles, we also require workers to undergo 
ongoing medical assessments to ensure that they are 
fit to work and have not suffered any unintentional 
consequences from hazardous tasks.

HEALTH AND SAFETY INITIATIVES ACROSS THE GROUP

DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES

SITE-SPECIFIC INTERVENTION PROGRAMMES 

Leveraging digital technologies’ ability to enhance EHS 
management and performance, Wilmar has been developing our 
capabilities and can effectively capture EHS data and integrate 
information into wider organisational systems that help us 
identify trends and changes in EHS performance, behaviours 
and functions. We can also analyse the data to predict future 
performance or incidents.
 
The enhanced EHS risk management can lead to lower injury 
rates and improved working conditions and decision-making, 
including resource allocation decisions based on rigorous real-
time data. Improving our workforce’s capability to utilise the EHS 
technology can also result in stronger problem-solving skills that 
can innovatively address today’s and tomorrow’s challenges. 

Wilmar has been focusing on site-specific intervention 
programmes. Some examples include enhancing plantation 
harvesting SOPs, improving tools used and improving our 
worker’s understanding of risk and precaution measures when 
harvesting produce. 

Other programmes include Construction Safety Audit and 
Management Plan, Fall Protection Campaign and Worker 
Health and Well-being Programme in plantations.

Our sugar operations in Australia and New 
Zealand have in place EHS programmes 
within their operations. There are six 
elements in the programme:

• pre-employment health assessments
• health surveillance
• injury management
• drug abuse
• alcohol and fatigue management
• social programmes and preventative 

health assessments

Some of these programmes are required 
by various national and state legislations 
in Australia or New Zealand. Some 
programmes require assessing and 
monitoring of the above to be provided to 
our employees, and the scope goes beyond 
work-related safety, health and well-being 
programmes.

INCIDENT REPORTING AND INVESTIGATION STANDARD 

Wilmar also has in place an Incident Reporting and 
Investigation Standard that all sites are required to 
follow in the event of a work-related incident. The 
standard details how incidents are to be investigated 
and managed, as well as putting in place corrective 
and preventive actions. It also stipulates the process 
for reporting incidents, including on our global EHS 
reporting platform. 

Having focused on encouraging transparent reporting 
in 2021, Wilmar then worked on enhancing the quality 
of reporting, improving the granularity of details that 
can be received on serious injuries. Wilmar takes all 
incident reports seriously and proactively investigates 
each to identify the weaknesses and gaps in our system 
that need to be addressed. Our employees and workers 
can remove themselves from situations they believe 
may cause injuries and ill health and report these 
without fear of reprisal.

In October 2022, the Incident Notification, Reporting 
and Investigation 2.0 was published. The update includes 
a notification coverage. LTIR calculations are also defined 
to include the number of fatalities and permanent 
disabilities, other than lost time injuries. In addition, 
the definition of manhours was also documented to 
aid calculations.

To further improve EHS practices, we also launched 
the Serious Injury and Fatality Guidelines in 2022. 
This new initiative aims to get all sites to identify the 
possibility of having Level 4 or Level 5 incidents21 from 
near misses or other level incidents. Upon identification, 
investigations, corrective and preventative actions can 
then take place to eliminate incidents at Levels 4 and 5. 

To proactively prevent potential injuries and fatalities from 
occurring, instil a culture of safety, and increase safety 
awareness amongst employees, we have set targets to 
increase hazards18 and near misses19 reporting rate by 40% by 
2025 from a 2020 baseline. We also strive to achieve a closure 
rate of over 90% for cases registered in our EHS reporting 
platform.

Between 2021 and 2022, a total of 117,093 cases of near 
misses and hazards were reported, and we achieved a closure 
rate20 of 99% for all these cases, well exceeding our target. 
While we are encouraged by the achievement, we recognise 
that there is more to be done. We are committed to providing 
a safe working environment and will continue to take 
proactive action to mitigate risks where they arise.

OUR DIGITAL EHS REPORTING PLATFORM 

First introduced in 2016, Wilmar has been using the Enablon 
software to build our global EHS reporting platform which has 
since been rolled out to all sites where Wilmar has operational 
control. This platform enables us to collect, analyse, manage data 
and track EHS action plans. This has helped us to manage our 
EHS performance, ensure compliance with relevant laws, minimise 
risks and drive efficiencies. 

Upon upgrading the functionality and user experience of our EHS 
platform in 2021, we decided to focus this year on implementing 
12 new modules, optimising EHS data verification and reporting, 
and conducting an EHS assurance exercise, including a gap 
assessment and Group EHS Audit Programme. 

In 2022, we have approximately 4,200 users, with 12 new modules 
progressively deployed to support Wilmar’s respective country 
commitments.

GROUP EHS AUDIT PROGRAMME 

Plans are in motion to implement the Corporate EHS Audit Programme in 2023 and we have been preparing 
for this change by reviewing our audit protocols and training auditors. This audit programme will provide a 
systematic and standardised risk-based approach when conducting EHS audits across our businesses. The 
programme will also verify the effective implementation of Group EHS standards across site-level business 
activities and our conformance to legal requirements. Through the programme, we also look to benchmark 
best practices within the Group and eventually raise our overall EHS performance. 

Wilmar’s disclosures on reportable injuries include our operations 
in plantations, mills, factories, warehouses and others. 

In 2022, we regret to report that we had 10# work-related fatalities 
among our employees and contractors, with five# occurring in our 
factories, three# in our oil palm plantations and two# in our palm 
oil mills. We also recorded four# fatalities from our construction 
operations involving our contractors. The three most common 
causes of fatalities include falls from height, vehicle and construction 
activities. Any loss of life is deeply unacceptable to Wilmar. 

We are committed to eliminating fatalities in our operations. We 
will continue to strengthen our HRW Intervention Programmes and 
Contractor Safety Management to improve our safety performance 
and work towards zero incidents. Please see page 120-121 for 
details of the intervention programmes.

The Group recorded a reduction of 18.7% of Lost Time Injury Rate 
(LTIR) from 0.75 in 2021 to 0.61 in 2022, a marked improvement 
considering the increased level of reporting across our global 
operations. This improvement was mainly from site specific Lost 
Time Injury (LTI) Intervention Programmes in upstream Indonesia.

In 2022, 10,228 Lost Work Days (LWD) were recorded across 
employees and contractors, compared to 11,147 in 2021. Overall, 
our Lost Work Day Rate (LWDR) has decreased by 9% compared 
to 2021 mainly due to reduction in fatality and severity of the 
injuries as a result from the effective intervention programmes.

In the next few years, we will continue to focus on safety leadership 
and culture with the aim to move from compliance to commitment, 
including launching further safety leadership workshops for leaders 
and line managers to encourage understanding from a system 
thinking point of view of what it takes to build and maintain a 
strong safety culture. We will also roll out more behaviour safety 
programmes in different countries and regions.

WILMAR SUGAR AUSTRALIA 

• Wilmar Sugar Australia supports the national ‘R U OK?’ initiative through various efforts to raise 
mental health awareness amongst employees and workers. In 2022, we organised a Mental Health 
Week with information sessions daily on topics such as dealing with stress, fitness and eating 
well. To encourage individuals to have conversations about these topics, we offered vouchers for 
free coffee which can only be redeemed with another person. We also held a ‘Teal and Purple’ 
day which focused on domestic violence and suicide awareness. We also ran a programme called 
‘Green Apple Day’, which focuses on mental health and to identify if others are not OK.  

• In addition, we launched a 10-month resilience programme which included the development of a 
monthly wellness postcard issued to all employees, containing a QR code that provided staff with 
a list of useful resources related to mental and physical health. A small booklet, 12 Days of Mental 
Wellness, was also issued across all sites to help people deal with the stresses of Christmas. 

GOODMAN FIELDER

• In line with the ‘R U OK?’ initiative, Goodman Fielder in Australia continues to ran ‘Thrive Together’, 
a month-long initiative focused on employees’ emotional, social and physical well-being. In 2022, 
we created and executed a Goodman Fielder Australia Calendar which focused on employees’ 
emotional, social and physical well-being. Throughout the year, we held 27 initiatives across all sites 
in Australia with over 1,000 participants from our teams. These included International Women’s 
Day, R U OK? Day, Ramadhan, Safety Week, National Volunteer Week, Movember and International 
Food Stalls. We further support employees through a virtual hub of resources on the intranet with 
our Employee Assistance Programme partner, Benestar. This offers preventative services such as Life 
Coaching, Nutrition Advice and other services. It also provides access to crisis support resources 
and on-demand access to all virtual sessions. Benestar facilitates lunch and learn sessions for our 
employees that focus on topics such as mindfulness, physical well-being, work life balance, and 
others. Engagement across our sites has improved through these initiatives. We now have Site 
Cultural Champions at each site who lead and manage engagement initiatives which demonstrate 
this is a focus area for the business.  

NEW ZEALAND SUGAR 

The New Zealand Sugar Company (NZ Sugar) launched a well-being programme during Mental 
Health Awareness Week in New Zealand. With the theme of ‘Time to Korero’ (which means talk in 
Maori), the leadership team at NZ Sugar took the time to talk with each team member – remote 
and on-site – to check in on them, their family and how they are doing. This was done as part of 
our overall Well-being Framework with four elements; physical, mind, career and financial.

STRENGTHENING MENTAL HEALTH RESILIENCE 
IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND

CASE STUDY

In 2020, we launched Plantry which offers a range of 
frozen plant-based meals. Plantry’s purpose is to harness 
the power of plants to create food that is better for 
people and the planet. At our head office, a Plantry 
vending machine is made available for employees to enjoy 
a subsidised meal, encouraging them to swap familiar 
favourites for a plant-based alternative.

LAUNCHING A PLANT-BASED FOOD 
BRAND IN AUSTRALIA 

CASE STUDY

• As part of Goodman Fielder’s relationship with our Employee Assistance Provider, Benestar, 
MyCoach was introduced to provide employees and their families access to free, confidential 
coaching and to support all aspects of life - physical, mental, social, professional and financial. 
MyCoach sessions may be conducted face-to-face, via phone, video or live chat.

CASE STUDY

YKA provides free accommodation for 
employees in many of our factories. Dormitory 
rooms are equipped with desks, chairs, air-
conditioning and ensuite washrooms. Facilities 
include gymnasiums, badminton halls, nursing 
rooms, reading rooms and canteens. We also 
provide transportation by bus between the 
dormitory and the factory. These arrangements 
significantly reduce living costs and help to 
create good relationships amongst colleagues 
and better integrate them as part of the YKA 
team.

In addition, we organise several events, 
including games and other team bonding 
activities. An example was the “扬帆再启航，
阔步新征程” (which can be interpreted as “set 

sail again and embark on a new journey with 
great strides”) walking and cycling activity held 
during the launch of a new building. During 
the event, all participants took part in activities 
on the Huangpu Riverside Walkway. The 
event encouraged employees to embrace a 
healthier lifestyle and relax in a conducive and 
comfortable working environment. 

YKA has also created a number of unions and 
clubs, such as basketball, football, badminton 
and table tennis, for employees to connect, 
meet other colleagues and boost their physical 
activity after work. Events and sports leagues 
with external companies are organised annually 
to provide networking opportunities.

• AUSTRALIA: Goodman Fielder launched a 14-day Gut Health Challenge, designed to 
improve employees’ overall health, vitality and nutrient absorption. They received advice 
from Australia’s leading nutritional scientists and dieticians. 

• CHINA: The staff canteen provides dishes that meet our employees’ daily energy 
requirements. An inspection team also conducts regular checks to ensure the freshness and 
nutrition of the food.

• INDONESIA: During the COVID-19 pandemic, our Indonesian subsidiary provided nutritious 
menus in the company canteen to improve the immune system of employees. They were also 
able to access exercise classes and sporting facilities. We also provided training for children 
and their parents on how to cope with studying online during the pandemic.

• NEW ZEALAND: Employees receive fruit deliveries twice per week. They also have a gym, 
tennis court and exercise classes available for them to enjoy physical exercise.

• VIETNAM: Our employee health, safety and well-being programmes provide fresh milk for 
factory staff on night shift to help improve their health. Regular sports activities are also 
organised. 

The YKA office is equipped with breastfeeding and baby changing rooms for new 
mothers. Called ‘Mommy Huts’, these rooms can accommodate up to five female 
employees to breastfeed their babies and are equipped with tables and chairs, 
curtain partitions and refrigerators. 

The new mothers are also provided with regular items to support them. In our 
Singapore headquarters, ‘Lactation Rooms’ are available on every level of the 
office building to support female employees with their lactation needs.

VACCINATION EFFORTS IN  
OUR OIL PALM PLANTATIONS 

CASE STUDY

Our employees form the backbone of our 
operations and it is our responsibility to ensure 
good health and well-being of all our workers 
and their families. Consequently, Wilmar 
proactively collaborated with the local health 
authorities in Malaysia and Indonesia to set up 
vaccination centres at our plantation and mill 
operations to vaccinate all our employees and 
members of their families. 

Vaccinations were also offered to the local 
communities. Temporary centres were set up 
following stringent requirements and protocols 
whilst strictly observing SOPs. Furthermore, 
extra measures were taken to ensure safe 
distancing practices were followed and health 
screening was carried out prior to administering 
the vaccine. 

We completed the vaccination regime for 
our employees and their dependents in our 
Malaysian palm operations, with almost all of 
Wilmar’s employees being fully vaccinated. 
In 2022, we further rolled out booster 
dose vaccinations at our Malaysian sites. 
In Indonesia, Wilmar faced an uphill task 
to vaccinate 48,840 employees and their 
dependents. At the end of December 2022, 
88% are fully vaccinated with three vaccine 
doses under the vaccination regime and 97% 
received at least their first two doses.

Last year in Vietnam, we activated a COVID-19 Virtual Support Channel 
to assist employees who faced difficulties due to the pandemic. We also 
had a COVID-19 Virtual Treatment Assistance Centre for employees with 
COVID-19 who had limited access to medical facilities. The centre is 
supported by a group of doctors who perform online medical consultation 
and treatment for employees who tested positive. We launched an internal 
fundraising activity to support staff who are facing difficult circumstances 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Managers were called upon to donate 
and raise funds for this cause.

Goodman Fielder ran local vaccination campaigns – ‘Our Best Shot’ – 
showcasing personal anecdotes from employees and their reasons for 
vaccinating against COVID-19. The campaign highlighted more than 25 
stories from employees across various roles and countries and was used 
to increase vaccination coverage across critical operations and locations. 
Posters and communications collateral were created to encourage 
employees to vaccinate against COVID-19.

SUPPORTING SMALLHOLDERS

Smallholders play an important role in palm 
sustainability. They are set to manage 60% of oil 
palm plantations in Indonesia by 203025  but receive 
limited support from governments and organisations 
to improve the productivity, profitability and 
sustainability of their estates. 

While smallholders only make up a small portion 
of Wilmar’s FFB supply base, we recognise their 
increasing contribution to the global palm oil supply 
chains. In 2022, 100% of our scheme smallholders 
and 31% of our independent smallholders were 
supported by our capacity building programmes.

Our independent smallholder programmes are 
specific to each country and aim to address 
the unique challenges faced by farmers in their 
respective locations. While our programmes also 
help farmers achieve relevant certifications, this is 
not the main objective of our programmes.

OUR INDEPENDENT 
SMALLHOLDER PROGRAMMES

#EY has performed limited assurance procedures on these figures. There is currently no programme available specifically to support 
independent smallholders in Nigeria in 2022.

Our scheme smallholder programmes focus on providing 
training and support for farmers to improve sustainability 
practices, increase yield per ha and ultimately achieve 
certification under applicable national certifications 
schemes and RSPO. 

OUR SCHEME SMALLHOLDER 
PROGRAMMES INDONESIA

Scheme smallholder requirements 
are set by the government. 
Wilmar has a total planted area 
of 34,740 ha under government-
originated plasma schemes. We 
support these smallholders by 
helping them obtain legal land 
titles, financing, planting materials 
and training on good agricultural 
practices to enable them to 
eventually manage their own 
plantations and achieve ISPO and 
RSPO certifications.

NIGERIA

Wilmar’s Biase Plantation Ltd 
(BPL) launched its Pilot Outgrower 
Programme in October 2017 and 
commenced planting in 2018. Our 
initial pilot covered 150 ha of land 
and supported 43 farmers from 
the surrounding area to establish 
their own plantations. Based on the 
success of this pilot, BPL received 
support from the Central Bank of 
Nigeria to scale up this programme 
with a target of 6,000 ha to benefit 
an estimated 1,500 smallholders. 
As of 2022, about 500 ha of old or 
derelict smallholder plantations have 
been replanted with plans to scale up 
in 2023 to cover farmers who intend 
to establish new oil palm plantations.  

GHANA

Our subsidiary, Benso Oil Palm Plantation 
(BOPP), first established its smallholder scheme 
in 1994. The scheme provided 438 farmers 
from surrounding communities with 1,650 ha 
of area for planting as well as technical support 
to set up plantations and ensure they follow our 
sustainability commitments. To date, 500 ha have 
been replanted while other areas are due for 
replanting.  

Smallholders were also trained in best 
management practices for immature oil palm 
maintenance. Together with our smallholders, we 
achieved RSPO certification in 2014, becoming the 
first company in Ghana and the second in Africa to 
achieve this. 

Following the success of this scheme and requests 
from various community groups, we established 
the Adum Smallholder Programme in 2018. 
The programme has supported communities in 
the Adum area to develop 633 ha of their land 
into oil palm plantations. Under this programme, 

BOPP also provides training on additional 
livelihoods such as pig farming and bee keeping. 
This provides an alternative source of income for 
farmers which is especially important as oil palms 
take an average of four years to mature. Proceeds 
from the sales of these products have improved 
the livelihoods and nutrition of beneficiaries.

In 2022, BOPP secured a 10 million Euro facility 
from the Outgrower Value Chain Fund for the 
development of the Adum Smallholder Oil Palm 
Plantation and other sustainable smallholder 
projects. We target to plant 3,000 ha for 1,000 
smallholders in the next five years. 

Where land is not suitable for oil palm plantations, 
BOPP makes these available to persons living in 
our estates for farming food crops. BOPP also has 
a shop where all permanent workers can get a 
specified quota of free palm oil each month and 
purchase food items at ‘factory prices’ which are 
lower than market prices.

INDONESIA

Many of our smallholders in 
Indonesia face challenges 
surrounding lack of access to quality 
seedlings, limited knowledge of 
best practices, poor market access 
for selling FFB to mills directly and 
difficulties in obtaining legal land 
titles and certification. As such, our 
programmes focus on facilitating 
better access to high yield seedlings 
and high-quality fertilisers, training 
on sustainable agronomic practices, 
ISPO and RSPO certification support 
and the sale of FFB to our mills. 
To roll out this programme, we 
partnered with 11 co-operatives 
of independent smallholders in 
the provinces of Jambi, Riau, 
Kalimantan and Sumatra – with 
4,145# farmers participating in 
2022. Six co-operatives achieved 
ISPO certification in 2022, covering 
more than 5,400 ha of land.

MALAYSIA

We implemented smallholder 
programmes at three of our mills 
in Sabah and one mill in Sarawak. 
The programmes focus on capacity 
building and facilitating a fertiliser 
credit scheme to help farmers 
increase their yield, adopt more 
sustainable agriculture practices and 
ultimately achieve MSPO and RSPO 
certification. Although training and 
site visits were suspended in 2021 
due to COVID-19 restrictions, we 
resumed the programme in 2022 
with 69# of our smallholders taking 
part in this programme. 

GHANA

BOPP began working with Earthworm Foundation on 
their Rurality Project in 2015 and played a key role 
in providing agricultural training, planting materials 
and farming machinery to smallholders in Ghana. 

While our partnership with Earthworm Foundation 
concluded in 2019, we continue to support many 
of these initiatives with the support of BOPP 
Outside Purchased Fruits managers and estate 
surveyors. Since 2020, we have continued to conduct 
training sessions on BMP for smallholders, with 15# 
smallholders participating in the 2022 sessions. 
We also provide extension services to farmers by 

providing them with free mini excavators to construct 
drains in low-lying areas. Following the success of 
the Adum Smallholder Programme, Partnerships for 
Forests signed a new MoU with BOPP to provide 
£87,000 to support additional livelihood and forest 
protection initiatives for beneficiaries of the BOPP 
Catchment Area Projects (BCAP). BCAP supports 
independent smallholders within a 20-km radius from 
BOPP to cultivate oil palm. To date, we have planted 
184 ha and supported 58 farmers. We target to 
plant 500 ha by end of 2023.

SUSTAINABLE AND CLIMATE-SMART SUGARCANE

SUPPORTING SUGAR OUTGROWERS

We have similarly implemented training programmes for our sugar outgrowers covering good farming practices 
for land preparation, planting systems, cane nutrient requirements, fertiliser application, weed control and the 
safe handling and application of chemicals.

Farmers were introduced and trained on IPM 
methods, including light trap installations and bio-
fungicides to reduce the spread of root grubs and 
trichocards application to eliminate ESB. 

We supported 100 farmers in installing biodigesters 
to promote and institute biogas as a low-cost and 
clean alternative to biomass. Apart from supplying 
green energy, it also generates nutrient-rich organic 
bio-slurry that can be used in place of chemical 
fertilisers.

Evaluating soil nutrient status is key for better yield 
and reducing the cost of cultivation. To address this, 
we are establishing a soil testing lab in Athani to 
ensure the right dosage of chemical fertilisers and 
micronutrients is used for achieving higher cane 
productivity while avoiding the application of excess 
nutrients. Four weather stations have been installed 
at strategic locations to collect relevant weather 
data for circulation to farmers to better prepare 
themselves during the season.

This year, we established new protocols to socialise to 
farmers on the benefits and importance of clean cane 
harvesting. We conducted training at all mill locations 
on field safety and conducted a training programme 
for all mechanised cane harvesting contractors. We 
also launched a road safety awareness campaign 
across all units of SRSL and as part of this campaign 
provided transport vendors with reflectors. 

We provided training and demonstrations for 
farmers on good agronomic practices such as cane 
trash mulching, green manuring and intercropping. 
We also supported farmers by providing waste 
decomposers and green manuring seeds.

To prevent the spread of Lumpy skin disease, an 
infectious disease in cattle caused by the Neethling 
virus, we conducted a vaccination camp for cane-
carrying bullocks at our Munoli unit.

Since 2017, Wilmar has worked with Shree Renuka 
Sugars Limited (SRSL), Solidaridad Asia and Coca-
Cola Foundation to support SRSL sugarcane 
outgrowers in India to adopt sustainable and climate-
smart sugarcane farming. In 2022, we provided 
training and capacity building on a number of topics 
including:

• early shoot borer (ESB) and root grub 
control measures

• reducing dependence on chemical 
fertilisers

• environment-friendly technologies

YKA, our subsidiary, launched the Yihai Kerry 
Education Aid Programme in 2017 to improve 
the conditions of schools and education levels in 
underprivileged regions of China.

We only support schools in deprived areas with 
urgent needs that do not receive sufficient 
government support to maximize our impact. We 
have funded the construction of 38 schools in 

China to date, with more than 17,500 students 
currently studying in these schools. YKA’s 
engineering and technical teams are involved in 
all aspects of planning, design and construction 
to ensure the quality of these schools Additionally, 
a team of employee volunteers actively works 
with the principal and teachers of each school to 
discuss the school curriculum.

YIHAI KERRY EDUCATION AID PROGRAMME

HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

FOOD SECURITY

We strive to support and ensure the health and well-
being of our communities by continuing to provide 
access to healthcare services and medical attention. 
Wilmar builds on-site clinics and sponsors mobile 
clinics to provide free healthcare services to remote 
communities with limited access to basic healthcare. 
The suite of medical treatments includes immunisations, 
circumcision surgeries and cataract surgeries among 
others. 

We also work with the Arawana Charity Foundation in 
China to improve the living and rehabilitation conditions 
of vulnerable groups such as the elderly and disabled. 
This includes purchasing medical equipment for disabled 
children’s rehabilitation centres and constructing 
orphanages and nursing homes for the elderly.

We continue to support our local charity partners in 
Australia and New Zealand through food donations 
and sales of goods from our consumer businesses. 

Goodman Fielder donates more than a million meals 
annually through donations of surplus bread and other 
products to our partners Eat Up Australia, Foodbank 
Australia, Auckland Mission and The Salvation Army. 
Our staff also volunteer with Foodbank Australia to 
help prepare hampers and distribute food.

Wilmar Sugar similarly donates packaged sugar not fit 
for sale due to issues such as packaging defects but 
are still safe for human consumption to local charity 
partners. We also sell our products to Foodbank Australia 
at wholesale prices when they request it. 

Our support of Eat Up is part of our commitment to children’s nutrition

It is estimated that over one in five Australian 
children experienced food insecurity in the last 
12 months. To ensure that vulnerable children 
in our communities are having their basic 
nutritional needs met, Goodman Fielder has 
worked with Eat Up Australia since 2018 to 
provide meals to children in need across the 
country.

In 2022, we continued to donate loaves of our 
Wonder brand of bread to help Eat Up provide 
more than one million lunches to children. We 
have also partnered with other organisations 
to create a new service that provides healthy 
lunches for children at no cost.

Using machine learning methods, our research teams at 
YKA and WIL@NUS have uncovered fatty acid patterns 
unique to 10 different plant oil types and their intra-
variability. This enables us to tackle risks related to 
fraudulent oil adulteration and intentional mislabelling 
of edible oils, which may threaten food safety and 
endanger public health. Our method enables us to 
control product quality, which determines the fair price 
of purchased oils and allows accurate labelling for the 
benefit of health-conscious consumers.  

OPTIMISING FACTORY 
PROCESSES

As part of its commitment to sustainable development, YKA is pushing the boundaries of scientific 
and technological innovation, developing new methods that enable a circular economy within the 
production of rice. Rice husk, a rice-processing waste, is used to generate electricity and steam, 
thereby reducing GHG emissions while also reducing waste generation. YKA also uses rice husk ash 
to produce silica and activated carbon, which are used to replace similar high energy consumption, 
high pollution and high emission production processes and raw materials, thereby reducing the 
disposal of waste.  

Wilmar is also looking to reduce waste by improving the amount of rice consumption. With the goal 
of meeting demands for fresh, delicious, high-quality rice, YKA pioneered a “six-step fine control 
technology” (六步鲜米精控技术) for our rice production. The technology involves temperature 
controls on storage and drying, and provides accurate timings for harvest of different rice varieties 
in different regions. It also includes precise and rapid detection of the purity of rice cultivars and 
the presence of any insect eggs.      

Such technologies improve the production, storage, milling and packaging of fresh rice. YKA is now 
in the process of resolving technical issues to eventually scale the technologies up to YKA’s entire 
rice production industrial chain. This six-step fine control technology received the highest score in 
an expert project evaluation by the Chinese Cereals and Oils Association in 2022.

Wilmar has been making progress in the field of cloning, which involves using 
tissue culture to produce large quantities of selected plants that meet specific 
criteria such as yield performance and other parameters.

In 2022, Wilmar established a new oil palm clonal laboratory in Central 
Kalimantan. This clonal laboratory is scaling up production to reach a capacity 
of 500,000 clonal palms per year by 2026 and will support our replanting 
programme in our Central Kalimantan Project plantation. The clones are 
expected to improve yields by as much as 30%. In parallel, Wilmar continues 
to make improvements to conventional breeding methods in Sumatra.

As part of our own plant breeding programme in Wilmar Sugar Australia, 
we are trialling the use of Genomic Selection technology using Single 
Nucleotide Polymorphism chips to identify ‘super’ parents that contain 
additive traits to assist in improving cane yields and sugar content of their 
progeny. We believe that this process will also reduce the ‘end-to-end’ 
time from first selection to the final distribution of new clonal material for 
commercial planting.  

In collaboration with Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL), we conducted 
research on using genetic screening to shorten the palm breeding cycle. 
We are currently field testing selected genetic markers against FFB yields in 
sampled palms that were supplied by our plantation in Palembang, Indonesia. 
If found to be successful, this research may enable us to halve the breeding 
process time compared to conventional methods.

The TLL team also found that drought tolerant oil palm trees could be 
selected at the seedling stage via bioinformatic analysis of RNA sequencing 
data. They also found a few DNA markers associated with Ganoderma 
resistance and are currently testing them.

STUDYING FOOD SCIENCE TO UNDERSTAND 
THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF VARIOUS INGREDIENTS 

PLANT-BASED 
ALTERNATIVE PROTEIN 

Meeting the needs of a growing global population with limited natural 
resources and in the face of climate change, is a major challenge for 
sustainable development. Between 2009 and 2050, the global population is 
expected to increase by 34% and protein demand is expected to increase by 
50% to 70%. Wilmar sees this as both a challenge and a business opportunity, 
and has been driving innovation on plant-based protein products as an 
alternative to animal meat.  

Plant-based protein products can aid sustainable development through GHG 
emissions reduction and mitigating negative impacts on health caused by a 
high intake of meat. Today, Wilmar has over 50 plant-based protein products 
across categories such as replacements for chicken, pork, lamb and fish which 
can be found all over the world. Through the use of diverse plant ingredients 
and proprietary technology, improving the flavour or texture of plant-based 
protein products while reducing overall cost continues to be a focus for further 
exploration as Wilmar actively develops more products to suit various market 
needs. Key developments in this area include:  

• Wilmar has developed its own Soy Protein Concentration which 
reduces water waste during manufacturing and helps obtain a meat-
like feel and texture  

• Textured Vegetable Proteins provide a fibrous structure with the 
desired texture, binding ability and chewiness. By using restructure 
processing, the mixture of textured protein and fat tissue mimics the 
tastes of different kinds of meat`  

• Beyond this, our R&D team is continuing to develop a variety of plant-
based Chinese dishes and flavours by working with a culinary institute

CASE STUDYWIL@NUS 

YKA R&D CENTRE 

The laboratory is hosted by the Yong Loo Lin School of 
Medicine and combines the world-class expertise of Wilmar 
and NUS to drive innovation in food technology for better 
health and develop efficient and cost-effective sustainable 
biochemicals.  

WIL@NUS completed a significant clinical trial in 2021 and 
published the results in the Journal of Nutrition on the 
identification of food ingredients that contribute to healthy 
living and aging.  

In 2022, a clinical trial on developing meals for women with 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was conducted and the results 
reported in the United States National Institutes of Health 
clinical trial registry (ID NCT05259475).  

YKA R&D Centre pledged over US$15.72 million (or 
approximately US$1.5 million per year for 10 years) to support 
scientific research and development. In collaboration with the 
Chinese Nutrition Society, we built a health innovation platform 
– the National Nutrition Science Research Grant – which funds 
research on the nutritional status, requirements and interventions 
of specific populations and regions. The research aims to develop 
more targeted products for consumers, which would improve 
health outcomes and reduce medical expenses.  

Latest developments include YKA’s cooperation with the Chinese 
Nutrition Society which has been carried out for the fourth year. 
Although the first phase of the research programme was slightly 
delayed due to COVID-19, the initial results are now available:  

• the intervention of plant protein on sarcopenia in 
nursing homes found that 30 grams of plant protein 
supplementation could significantly increase muscle 
strength and leg circumference, without increasing uric 
acid and other problems  

• positive health effects from blending oils were found in 
studies on vegetarians and people with dyslipidaemia  

The second and third phases of the research programme have 
also been supported by the Chinese Nutrition Society in the 
bidding process. Together with the development of our central 
kitchens, we will continue to focus on providing more convenient 
and nutritious meals for students, the elderly and other groups.

several publications and with ongoing clinical trials to develop meals that are palatable and suitable 
for individuals at risk of specific health problems. 

COLLABORATION WITH WIL@NUS FOCUSING ON HUMAN NUTRITION, FOOD 
INTERVENTIONS AND BIOPROCESSING 

YKA PLEDGED US$15.72 MILLION (RMB 100 MILLION) OVER 10 YEARS to support scientific 
research and development specifically targeting people with diabetes, the elderly and patients 
with cardiovascular diseases. YKA is also enhancing the nutritional value of products ranging from 
rice, noodles, grains and oil by ensuring that nutrients of ingredients are retained in the food 
manufacturing process. Successful developments include:  

We developed and patented a process that allows rice bran oil to retain most 
of its minor nutrients. Rice bran oil is a popular oil in China because of its health 
benefits, including zero trans fatty acid composition and high vitamin E and 
phytosterol content. We also promote our range of healthier oils, such as flax 
seed oil and olive oil.

These were developed in line with market needs.

HEALTH STAR RATING

Goodman Fielder, under its 
Meadow Fresh brand, launched a 
new range of yoghurt for children 
in New Zealand that was the first in 
the market to have a 5-star health 
rating.

PLANT-BASED MEALS AND MEAL SOLUTIONS BY PLANTRY

Goodman Fielder has continued to expand the range of plant-based meals and meal 
solutions under the Plantry brand. These products do not contain any artificial flavourings 
and colours. Certain products have been re-formulated with lower sodium content.

FOOD PRODUCTS FOR THE ELDERLY

MEDIUM CHAIN 
FATTY ACID EDIBLE OIL

YKA has developed suitable food products for the elderly by investigating various food 
ingredients on their biological performance. We produce whole grain food with high 
nutritional value, such as whole wheat flour, brown rice and soba noodles, that is known 
to be able to raise blood glucose levels more slowly and are beneficial to the elderly. In 
addition, YKA has developed alternative products for people with allergies. 

In 2022, YKA launched a structural 
oil, the medium chain fatty acid 
edible oil. Medium chain fatty acid’s 
metabolic rate is 10 times that of 
long chain fatty acids of ordinary

inhibiting fat accumulation, helping 
with weight loss. Six national 
invention patents have since been 
obtained for the medium chain 
fatty acid edible oil, including one 
for “prevention of fatty liver caused 
by obesity”.  

YKA DEVELOPED 
FORMULA 641

YKA also developed Formula 641, 
a scientific staple food based on the 
core recommendations of the “Dietary 
Guidelines for Chinese Residents”, 
China’s food-based dietary guideline. 
After extensive research, a new product 
was developed with rice, whole grains, 
beans and tubers in an approximate ratio 
of 6:4:1. With the scientific matching of 
glutinous rice, japonica rice, black rice, 
purple potato, oats, buckwheat rice, red 
beans, red quinoa, brown rice and nine 
other kinds of grains, the formula is low-
fat and improves cooking quality while 
saving time and effort.

OUR COMMITMENT TO 
MARKETING AND LABELLING

Product marketing and labelling provide relevant 
information on the health, safety, origin, sustainability 
and responsible use of products, helping consumers 
make informed purchasing decisions. Wilmar 
approaches responsible marketing and product 
labelling based on the countries and regions where 
the product is sold and the specific regulatory context 
that applies in that circumstance. 

Wilmar remains open to receiving feedback about its 
marketing and labelling practices and is committed to 
addressing any negative impacts through preventative 
or mitigating actions. Along with due diligence 
processes in place, our receptiveness to feedback 
also ensures that Wilmar can continue to effectively 
provide responsible marketing and labelling.

Jointly managed by several departments, including marketing, R&D, product safety and legal, we 
execute our commitment based on certain key principles, including:  

Goodman Fielder has robust internal procedures, systems and processes that ensure regulatory 
compliance with the strict product marketing and labelling legislation in Australia and New Zealand.  

• Our internal regulatory and legal teams across international markets provide day-to-day 
support to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and codes. Any communication that 
targets consumers directly will go through a strict approval process across key functions, 
including legal. 

• Our internal experts conduct risk assessments and all marketing, advertising, labelling and 
artwork claims are also approved by our experts to ensure compliance with advertising and 
other relevant industry standards, including country of origin requirements and front of 
pack labelling schemes, such as the Health Star Rating. Our internal experts also provide 
insights through competitor reviews and marketplace monitoring.  

• External expertise is brought in as and when necessary to provide opinions around product 
classification, labelling or marketing claims.

Our products are enjoyed by a wide variety of consumers, including children. Wilmar is committed 
to upholding product safety and responsibility via responsible marketing and labelling to children, 
taking great care to ensure that the marketing of our products follow the appropriate guidance, 
including New Zealand’s Children and Young People’s Advertising Code and the Australian Food 
and Beverages Advertising Code.  

In 2021, Goodman Fielder’s marketing approach, including to children, was reviewed as part of the 
relaunch of their nutrition policy. The nutrition policy is still being further developed and will be 
relaunched in 2023.   

Similarly, YKA product labels follow a regulatory review process for labelling, advertising and 
communications.  

• Several departments including marketing, R&D, product safety and legal ensure robust 
compliance with national product labelling standards, as well as market standards for new 
and existing products.  

• Our in-house design department works alongside marketing to develop product design, 
packaging and communications.   

• Approved communications are shared on a central internal platform to ensure consistent 
use by various marketing teams and factories. 

 
• YKA also has a centralised feedback mechanism to address enquiries from consumers and 

regulators in a timely fashion.

As a leader in the agribusiness sector, Wilmar seeks to constantly adapt and stay relevant to regulatory and 
industry developments. In addition, we also seek to participate and contribute our knowledge and practice to 
government and industry bodies to help shape regulatory initiatives and guidance that better aid consumers 
and the development of the sector. Examples of some of the key bodies in which we participate and contribute 
to are listed below. 

As part of our efforts to promote sustainable packaging 
and a circular economy, Goodman Fielder uses on-
pack labelling to explain packaging recycling options 
to consumers. Goodman Fielder has adopted the 
Australasian Recycling Label (ARL) and updated labels 
to align with ARL. These labels are currently displayed 
on over 100 products with the plan to have the ARL 
displayed on 100% of retail products by 2025 in line with 
Goodman Fielder’s and Australian Packaging Covenant 
Organisation’s packaging commitments. The roll-out 
of the ARL was accelerated in 2022 in light of other 
regulatory changes that required packaging artwork 
to be updated. 

YKA continues to prioritise the use of recyclable packaging 
materials, focusing on using paper, small amounts of 
ink and using recyclable and reusable plastic wherever 
possible. Today, YKA uses over 90% of recyclable 
packaging materials and looks to continue improving 
on this achievement.

PARTICIPATING IN REGULATORY AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS

ENCOURAGING RECYCLING 
ACROSS RETAIL PACKAGING  

For Wilmar Sugar, products that are used as ingredients 
in the manufacturing of consumer and food service 
goods are labelled in accordance with the Globally 
Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling 
of Chemicals (GHS). We engage external consultants 
to classify products and prepare safety data sheets 
in accordance with the GHS. Products that are sold 
as ingredients meet relevant requirements, including 

those of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, 
Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme, 
Australia Food and Grocery Council and Food Standards 
Australia or New Zealand, depending on the end use 
of the product. We also manufacture products that are 
identified to have potential health risks – such as vinegar 
and bulk oils – in line with the relevant requirements.

BONSUCRO SMARTCANE 

As an active member of RSPO, we are committed to the RSPO certification process and have 
developed a time-bound plan to have all our mills and their supply bases certified against the RSPO 
P&C. More information about our progress on RSPO certification can be found on the RSPO website 
and details on our progress against time-bound targets can be found in our Summary of Progress. 
As of year-end 2022, 95% of our refineries are certified against the RSPO Supply Chain Certification 
Standard and can deliver palm oil products under the Segregated and Mass Balance supply chain 
models. Around 10% of all palm oil products transacted by Wilmar globally are RSPO-certified.

We also support schemes and independent smallholders in our supply chain by including them in our 
certification efforts. For more information on how we work with smallholders and their certification 
status, see the section on Economic and Community Contribution.

Bonsucro, established in 2008, is a global 
sustainability standard and certification 
organisation for sugarcane products. Wilmar 
became a member of Bonsucro in 2014. 
Of our planted areas in Australia, 56% 
are certified in compliance with Bonsucro 
Production Standards, with three raw 
sugar mills certified. We also have certified 
downstream operations in Australia, New 
Zealand and Singapore in line with the 
Bonsucro Chain of Custody certification. 

MSPO 
MSPO, endorsed by the Malaysian government 
in 2013, is the national certification scheme 
for oil palm plantations, including smallholders 
and oil processing facilities in Malaysia. Wilmar 
began implementing the MSPO certification 
programme at our Malaysia operations in 2016 
and successfully certified 100% of our Malaysian 
palm oil mills and plantations in 2020. 

Smartcane BMP is an industry-led initiative 
available to all sugarcane growers across 
the state of Queensland in Australia. Our 
Burdekin plantations were first accredited 
in 2015, and we now have 100% of our 
Wilmar-owned plantations accredited. 

ISCC 
The ISCC is an international certification system covering all kinds of bio-based feedstocks and 
renewables catering to energy, food, feed and chemicals sectors. Wilmar is a member of the ISCC 
association and has been an active user of the system since 2011 to facilitate trade to the renewable 
energy market in the European Union (EU). Achieving ISCC certification enables delivery of products 
compliant with the sustainability criteria laid down by the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive. 

ISPO 
ISPO is a mandatory certification programme 
for all oil palm growers and millers 
operating in Indonesia to address social 
and environmental issues in the oil palm 
industry and improve the competitiveness 
of Indonesian palm oil in the global market. 
Wilmar began implementing the ISPO 
certification at our Indonesia operations 
in 2013. Currently, 10 Wilmar-owned palm 
oil mills and plantations, as well as five 
independent mills are certified.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED 
ORGANISMS (GMOs)

Wilmar does not grow or produce genetically modified 
(GM) crops. We also do not use GMOs in our palm 
and sugar production process. We recognise that 
consumer views on GMOs, as well as the global 
regulatory landscape – in terms of the authorisation 
of GM crops and the provision of information to the 
consumer – will differ across geographies. Therefore, 
our approach to the use of GM ingredients will vary 
across our different businesses and product lines. For 
example, Goodman Fielder’s policy is to avoid GM 
ingredients wherever possible and we do not use 
GM ingredients in any of our retail branded consumer 

products. On the other hand, it is getting increasingly 
difficult to source ingredients that are unequivocally 
guaranteed to be GM-free. YKA relies on imported 
GM soybeans and rapeseeds for processing and will 
handle GM crops.  

Where we do use GM crops, we ensure a comprehensive 
management system is in place across our value chain. 
We strictly adhere to regulatory requirements, including 
labelling requirements for our GMO products. For 
example, in China, we follow all the relevant regulations 
regarding GMO including the following:

ENHANCING PRODUCT QUALITY 
ACROSS DIFFERENT SEGMENTS  

ANIMAL FEED SAFETY
ENSURING THE PRODUCTION OF SAFE FOOD THROUGH 
FOOD SAFETY CERTIFICATIONS

STRIVING FOR ZERO 
FOOD SAFETY INCIDENTS

Wilmar upholds animal feed safety through relevant 
product safety management systems. Majority of animal 
feed products follow the GMP+ certification scheme, 
with most of our GMP+ certified feed production plants 
located in Southeast Asian countries. 

Picking up from 2021’s post-COVID-19 plans, in 2022, 
Wilmar made progress in certifying the production 
of Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD29) and shea nut 
expeller as animal feed and products in Ghana. We 
are also in the process of qualifying the production of 
PFAD in Ivory Coast. Meanwhile, one factory in China is 
certified under FAMI-QS, a Belgium-based feed safety 
management system scheme. In addition, factories 
that ship animal feed to Australia are also certified by 
the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Services for 
both feed safety and biosecurity standards.

This year, we worked with AIB to develop feed safety 
according to GMP inspection standards. The scheme 
is ready for a pilot run in 2023 where we will learn to 
further refine our practices to meet GMP standards. 

416-2

We aim to certify 100% of our food factories above 5,000 sqm to a food safety certification scheme 
accredited by the GFSI by 2024.  

These certification schemes are: 

• Food Safety System Certification 22000 
• United Kingdom: British Retail Consortium Global Standard for Food Safety
• United States: Safe Quality Food 

 
To ensure a robust food safety system, we have also engaged AIB International (AIB), an expert in food 
safety system implementation, to inspect our factories for GMP and other food safety pre-requisites.

The target was for AIB to inspect 100% of 
Wilmar’s food and food ingredient manufacturing 
facilities. In 2022, AIB conducted 251 of the 267 
originally planned inpections, while the Group 
Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QAQC) 
Department conducted three site inspections. 
The remaining planned inspections could not be 
conducted as the facilities were being renovated 
and therefore not operational.

As part of our strategy to ensure that relevant 
standards are truly embedded into everyday 
practices, factories which are more matured 
in their GMP are requested to undergo 
unannounced AIB inspections. 69% of the 
254 inspections conducted in 2022 were 
unannounced. The move towards unannounced 
inspections helps to ensure that relevant 
standards are truly embedded into everyday 
factory practices.

ANNUAL INSPECTION
UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS

There were ZERO RECALLS issued 
for food safety reasons in 2022

There were NO INCIDENCES OF

management, milling, 
refining and transportation.

STRENGTHENING OUR 
PROGRAMME
416-1

Wilmar continues to improve and strengthen our product quality and safety 
programmes. Beyond assessments, Wilmar focuses on strengthening its 
programmes through three main areas:

01

02

03

CONTINUE EXPANDING AIB INSPECTIONS to more factories and 
encourage more factories TO UNDERGO UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS. 
This is to embed GMP into the working culture of factories. 

REVAMPING HAZARD ANALYSIS CRITICAL CONTROL POINTS (HACCP) 
IMPLEMENTATION in factories through ongoing coaching and conducting 
reviews with selected factories.

INCREASING FACTORY RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES TO CONDUCT 
GMP SELF-INSPECTION. We aim to train all factory staff in GMP 
requirements. We are also putting in place programmes for selected internal 
GMP auditors from different countries and regions to be trained by Group 
QAQC auditors. Once fully trained, internal GMP auditors can train more 
auditors in their respective countries and regions.

Our Supplier Guidelines outline the basic principles 
that we expect all our suppliers to uphold. They cover 
topics such as legal compliance and business integrity, 
labour and human rights, environmental protection, 
product quality and safety and reporting violations 
or misconduct. In turn, our suppliers are expected 
to communicate and implement the principles in our 
Supplier Guidelines throughout their own supply 
chains. 

We have an extensive responsible sourcing programme 
to help our suppliers build capacity and meet the 
standards set out in our Supplier Guidelines. With 
strong roots in palm oil and sugar, we are particularly 
focused on the responsible sourcing of these two 
commodities through knowledge-sharing and on-
the-ground interventions.

ENSURING SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES 
BY OUR PALM SUPPLIERS

Our first NDPE Policy was launched in 2013, and later updated in 2019 
to reflect the commitments, policies and procedures that were adopted 
since the initial policy. 

Wilmar was the first in the industry to launch an NDPE Policy applicable 
across our entire supply chain. Some key elements of our policy are our 
support for smallholders, a deforestation cut-off date, recovery plan 
requirements, a suspend first approach, enhanced health and safety 
responsibilities, more robust grievance mechanisms and more transparent 
public reporting.  

Through our policy, we seek to drive positive change and support sustainable 
development throughout the palm oil supply chain.

ENSURING SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES 
BY OUR SUGAR SUPPLIER

Sustainability has always been part of our sugar 
businesses. In 2021, we enhanced our approach 
to driving sustainability in our sugar supply chain 
by introducing our No Deforestation, No People 
Exploitation Sugar (NDPE Sugar) Policy. The NDPE 
Sugar Policy builds on the same approach as our original 
NDPE Policy and sets out similar commitments to protect 
forests, people and communities, while promoting 
progress in operational efficiencies and best practice.  

Our policy similarly extends beyond our own operations 
to include joint ventures and third-party suppliers in 
the sugar supply chain. Peat is excluded from our 
sugar programme as it is not a material sustainability 
issue in the sugar industry. More information on our 
NDPE Sugar Policy can be found on our Sustainability 
Dashboard. 

Following the publication of the policy, the NDPE 
Sugar Initiative was launched in 2022 where one of 
the main objectives is to engage with our suppliers 
to ensure effective implementation of this policy. As 
implementing change and covering all our suppliers 
will take time, we emphasise on improving agricultural 

and sustainability practices through engagement and 
knowledge sharing. Through this approach, we aim to 
enable transformation across a wider production base 
while delivering on the most material sustainability 
concerns of global customers. 

Wilmar has adopted a progressive phased approach 
in implementing this programme and have set clear 
milestones to drive progress and acknowledge 
achievements along our journey. The first phase 
of implementation is focused on onboarding our 
refineries and rolling out the SRT to our key mill 
suppliers in Australia, Thailand and India. We have 
progressively socialised the programme requirements 
and expectations to these entities and their customers.  

Following the pilot launch of the SRT, we engaged with 
suppliers to better understand their responses and 
further refined the questionnaire based on feedback 
received. As of December 2022, all our refineries are 
part of the NDPE Sugar Initiative with phased roll-
out to our mill suppliers in the Latin America region 
scheduled for 2023.

Wilmar has introduced our NDPE Sugar Policy to drive sustainability in our sugar supply chain

ESTABLISHING A SUSTAINABLE 
SUGAR SUPPLY CHAIN 

In December 2022, Gula Prai, the flagship 
product of MSM Malaysia Holdings Berhad 
(MSM), became the first product to claim their 
achievement of Milestone 1 for Wilmar’s NDPE 
Sugar Initiative. Achieving Milestone 1, which 
requires sugar refineries to have traceability 
systems in place which allow them to provide 
regular and transparent mill lists, means that 
the raw sugar used in Gula Prai products is now 
traceable to mill. New consumer packaging 
launched in 2022 now includes the NDPE Sugar 
logo and appropriate on-pack claim.  
 
The announcement followed the signing of an 
agreement between MSM and Wilmar Sugar in 
2021 to collaborate on enabling sustainable raw 
sugar sourcing within their joint supply chain.  

This initiative has enabled MSM to establish 
raw sugar traceability and monitor suppliers’ 
performance to ensure they meet MSM’s ESG 
commitments in food production. Through 
the collaboration, both companies will have 
the ability to foster the protection of the 
environment, labour and communities within 
the sugar sector as well as address growing 
demand for sustainably sourced products.

COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING 
ON WILMAR’S CORPORATE POLICIES 

WILMAR’S TAX POLICY  

2-23 

207-1  

Wilmar’s corporate policies are communicated to 
all employees of the Group including the Board of 
Directors. To ensure compliance with these policies, 
all employees, including part-time employees and 
contractors, also receive training and specific guidance, 
either as part of their on-boarding or as regular 
ongoing refresher training. Training is conducted via 
e-learning applications developed by Wilmar’s HR and 
IT Departments, where attendance and results of the 
training can be monitored. 

Wilmar’s corporate policies are also communicated to 
our business partners and other entities we engage 
with. To ensure availability of information, the policies 
can be accessed online on Wilmar’s website and through 
the Company’s intranet. Through Wilmar’s SRT, we 
can also measure the compliance of our subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and third-party suppliers with policies 
such as the NDPE Policy. Where necessary, physical 
engagements are conducted with those who were 
assessed as having higher risks. 

Wilmar’s Tax Policy sets the direction on how all companies within the Group are to conduct their tax affairs 
and manage their tax risks. 

RAISING AND REPORTING CONCERNS  
2-25, 2-26, 205-3, 2-27   

Wilmar has in place a Whistleblowing Policy which 
provides an avenue for employees and external parties 
to raise concerns about possible corporate improprieties 
and receive feedback with the assurance that they 

will be protected from reprisal or victimisation. The 
Whistleblowing Policy ensures that arrangements 
are in place for independent investigations of alleged 
improprieties and for appropriate follow-up actions.

PUBLIC POLICY  
415-1 

Wilmar does not make any direct or indirect 
contributions to political parties, political associations 
and political candidates. Wilmar recognises employees’ 
rights to participate in political processes as individuals. 
Any engagement by employees in political activities 
must be in compliance with our Code of Conduct and 
other relevant Group policies. 

As a responsible corporate citizen, Wilmar often takes 
a position on issues of public policy that could impact 
our business. The Group may engage in efforts that may 
have an impact on legislation or government policy. All 
such lobbying efforts are conducted in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations. Our subsidiary, Wilmar 
Europe Trading B.V. (WET), engaged Europtimum to 
represent our position on various sustainability policy 
issues within the European Union. Fees amounting to 
US$94,287 and US$80,878 were paid to Europtimum 
in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Such amounts were 
split equally between WET and Olenex Sàrl (Olenex). 
Olenex is a joint venture between Wilmar and ADM.

Through Europtimum, we engaged with the European 
Commission on its proposal for a regulation on 
deforestation-free products, as well as its proposal 
for a directive on sustainable corporate governance. 
We expressed general support for both proposals and 
provided input to share practical insights on commodity 
flows, highlight the potential risks of the proposals and 
offer solutions. We also provided feedback, directly 
and via an industry organisation, Fediol, on the biofuels 
elements of the European Commission’s “Fit for 55” 
package, which aims to help the European Union 
achieve its goal of reducing GHG emissions by 55% 
in 2030 (compared to 1990 levels).  

Wilmar is a member of several sustainability-related 
trade associations, multi-stakeholder initiatives and 
tax-exempt groups.  

In 2022, the Indonesia Competition Commission, locally known as the 
Komisi Pengawas Persaingan Usaha (KPPU), alleged that 27 Indonesian 
companies, including five Indonesian subsidiaries of the Wilmar Group, 
were involved in monopolistic and unfair business competition practices 
with respect to sales of packed cooking oil in Indonesia and were accused 
of violating laws relating to price fixing and withholding of packed cooking 
oil from the Indonesian market. Wilmar respects the examination process 
conducted by the KPPU and will cooperate with the KPPU. 

In 2022, there were no reported incidents of corruption cases involving 
Wilmar or our employees. There were also no significant incidents of non-
compliance with any relevant environmental and socio-economic laws or 
regulations in our operations.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
2-9 

Establishing an appropriate governance structure, controls and oversight of 
our business is essential to safeguard the interests of all our stakeholders. 
We also recognise the importance of a diverse Board, comprising Directors 
with the appropriate and right balance of skills, knowledge, experience 
and perspective who can contribute effectively to the strategy and 
sustainable development of Wilmar. Guided by our Board Diversity 
Policy, the Nominating Committee’s (NC) selection of candidates takes 
into account the principles presented in our Board Diversity Policy, which 
require the NC to consider opportunities to increase the proportion of 
members from different areas of expertise, nationalities, ethnicities, gender 
and age groups over time when selecting and making recommendation 
to the Board on suitable candidates. 

To ensure that our Board is continuously equipped with 
the knowledge and skills to effectively contribute in 
their roles as Directors, we provide various trainings 
and briefings. On an ongoing basis, Directors are 
provided with opportunities to develop and refresh their 
skills and knowledge. Directors are also encouraged 
to participate in seminars, conferences and training 
programmes which are relevant to their roles as 
Directors. In 2022, specifically related to sustainability, 
our Board of Directors, as well as some members of our 

Senior Management, attended the following training 
sessions conducted by our Sustainability Department: 

• ESG analysis and reporting 
• Climate change and GHG emissions

In 2022, Directors completed a requisite sustainability 
training module, prescribed by SGX, to equip themselves 
with basic knowledge on sustainability matters.

PROTECTING DATA PRIVACY

Wilmar aims to ensure that we comply with all 
relevant data protection regulations in countries 
and regions where we operate, including the General 
Data Protection Regulation in Europe, Personal 
Information Protection Law in China and the Personal 
Data Protection Act in Singapore. Wilmar’s Internal 
Privacy Policy addresses how employees must handle 
data in accordance with these regulations. Externally, 
the Wilmar Group Privacy Policy outlines how we 
collect personal data; how and for what purposes we 
may use it; and to whom such data may be disclosed 
to. This policy also includes important information 
regarding individuals’ rights with respect to the 
processing of personal data. 

IMPLEMENTING CYBERSECURITY MEASURES 

We follow industry leading cybersecurity frameworks 
such as the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology Cybersecurity Framework and ISO/IEC 
27001:2013 to prevent, detect and respond to cyber-
attacks efficiently. We also keep up with industry 
leading practices to reinforce our cyber resiliency 
by ensuring high availability and recoverability of

MATERIALITY
3-1, 3-2 

A comprehensive materiality 
assessment covering key 
business segments was 
conducted in 2020 and 
reviewed again in 2021 and 
2022. Both the materiality 
assessment and subsequent 
reviews of material ESG 
topics were conducted and 
supported by an independent 
consultancy specialising in 
sustainability.  
The materiality assessment aimed to identify 
Wilmar’s impact, both positive and negative, 
through a thorough stakeholder engagement 
process that determined the ESG topics that were 
most relevant and impactful to our stakeholders. 
The insights gathered from the assessment reflect 
our ESG impacts and informs our ongoing strategy 
to ensure our business can continue to achieve 
long-term success and value-creation.  

In 2022, these material ESG topics were reviewed again against latest sectoral trends, stakeholder feedback 
and our business objectives. The topics were evaluated to remain highly relevant, and no changes were 
made to the list of material topics.

IN DETERMINING THE MATERIAL ESG TOPICS, WE REFERENCED

CRITERIA APPLIED BY WILMAR

WILMAR’S RESPONSIBILITY

In preparing the report, Wilmar applied the criterion of “Accuracy” as defined by GRI and specific criteria 
determined by Wilmar as being relevant for its sustainability performance. Such Criteria were specifically 
designed for sustainability performance; as a result, the subject matter information may not be suitable for 
another purpose.

Wilmar’s management is responsible for selecting Criteria, and for presenting the Subject Matter Information in 
accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining 
internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of 
the subject matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

EY’S RESPONSIBILITY

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Subject Matter Information based on the 
evidence we have obtained.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements 
Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’) and the terms of reference for this 
engagement as agreed with Wilmar on 19 November 2021.



207Sustainability Report 2022  |  Wilmar International Limited206 Sustainability Report 2022  |  Wilmar International Limited

Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement 
vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than 
for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, 
the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that 
would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed. Our procedures were 
designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on 
which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the 
evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable 
level of assurance.

Although we considered the effectiveness of 
management’s internal controls when determining the
nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance 
engagement was not designed to provide assurance 
on internal controls. Our procedures did not include 
testing controls or performing procedures relating to
checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT 
systems.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making 
enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing 
the Subject Matter Information and related information, 
and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURES PERFORMED

OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL

We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, and have the 
required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.

EY also applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform 
Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements, and 
accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements.

Our procedures included:

1. Inquiries with Wilmar’s Sustainability team to:
a. Understand principal business operations,
b. Appreciate key sustainability issues and 

developments,
c. Map out information flow for sustainability 

reporting and the relevant controls, and
d. Identify data providers with their 

responsibilities 

2. Virtual interviews with and sought clarifications 
from employees and Management in 
Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana, Nigeria 
and South Africa (e.g. Sustainability team, 
Environmental Health and Safety team, Estate 
Managers, Mill Managers, Factory Managers) 
to understand key sustainability issues related 
to the selected indicators, collection processes 
and accuracy of reporting

3. Conducting walk-through of systems and 
processes for data aggregation and reporting 
with relevant personnel to understand the 
quality of checks and control mechanisms, and 
assess and test the controls in relation to the 
concerned subject matters

CONCLUSION

RESTRICTED USE

Based on our procedures and the evidence obtained, 
we are not aware of any material modifications that 
should be made to the Subject Matter Information 
dated 29 May 2023 for the year ended 31 December 
2022 for the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 
December 2022, in order for it to be in accordance 
with the Criteria.

This report is intended solely for the information and 
use of Wilmar and is not intended to be and should not 
be used by anyone other than those specified parties.

methods to verify assumptions, estimations 
and computations made by Management in 
relation to the concerned subject matters

6. Checking data and statements had been 
correctly transcribed from corporate systems 
and / or supporting evidence, in relation to 
concerned subject matters

7. Obtaining of relevant certifications and reports 
in relation to the concerned Subject Matters 
Information in the Report

We also performed such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances.

Those standards require that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, 
in all material respects, the Subject Matter is presented 
in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The 
nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected 
depend on our judgment, including an assessment of 
the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.

We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance 
conclusions. Our review was limited to the information 
on the select indicators set out within the Sustainability 

Report and accompanying Base Data Tables for the year 
ended 31 December 2022 and our responsibility does 
not include:

• Any work in respect of sustainability 
information published elsewhere in Wilmar’s 
annual report, website and other publications,

• Sustainability information prior to 1 January 
2022 and subsequent to 31 December 2022,

ALIGNING WITH THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
FROM THE TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED 
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD) 

Wilmar regularly assesses climate-related risks through 
the Group-wide Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
process. Identified risks are assessed through a risk 
matrix with five levels of likelihood and consequence. 
Risks identified as having substantial financial or 
strategic impacts33 are shared with the Sustainability 
Department for further assessment and development 
of mitigation and adaptation measures with relevant 
teams. The implementation and monitoring of these 
strategies are delegated to the respective departments 
and team leads.  

We conduct qualitative scenario analysis to assess the 
potential impact of climate change on our company. 
Our main focus is our upstream operations and supply 
chain, which could be adversely affected if the global 
temperature exceeds two degrees Celsius.

For downstream operations, various initiatives have 
been implemented to assess and manage climate-
related risks and opportunities through the Industrial 
Sustainability Programme which was rolled out in 2021. 
Examples include initiatives that assess and manage 
performance against energy and water targets across 
factories to explore potential reduction opportunities. 

Climate-related risk management is incorporated 
into Wilmar’s sustainability strategy, overseen by 
the BSC, which reviews the Group’s sustainability 
and ESG matters, including climate-related risks and 
opportunities. These reviews cover the overall risk 
management guidelines, policies and systems to 
determine the identified risks’ potential financial or 
strategic impact. 

The BSC receives support from on-site and regional 
operational sustainability teams supported by an 
Independent Sustainability Advisory Panel (ISAP) at 
the corporate level. These teams are responsible for 
monitoring and reporting updates and actions taken 
on respective risks to the BSC on a quarterly basis. 

To ensure robust oversight and management over 
climate-related risks and opportunities, BSC regularly 
reviews performance against the metrics and targets

     would have to have a potential annual impact (costs/benefits) exceeding US$5 million

TFCD’S KEY PILLARS WILMAR’S APPROACH

GOVERNANCE

Wilmar’s Chairman and CEO is responsible for the oversight of the Group’s 
NDPE Policy which covers climate-related issues. He is supported 
by Wilmar’s BSC.

To ensure robust oversight and management over climate-related risks and 
opportunities, the BSC and Board of Directors receive quarterly updates on 
the following: 

• PHYSICAL RISKS from climate change. For example, where data exists, 
Wilmar considers the 25-year rainfall/temperature cycle at plantation 
operations to assess any potential water risks. Where risks may cause 
material impact, the issue is brought up to the BSC for review and 
decision-making.

• TRANSITION RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES. For example, regulatory 
and policy changes in countries and regions where Wilmar operates and 
matters relating to our reputation and stakeholder expectations 
on climate-related topics.

• WILMAR’S PERFORMANCE AGAINST OUR COMMITMENTS AND 
THE TARGETS TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS. An example of a key 
action taken by the Board this year was to approve Wilmar’s net-zero 
commitments.

These updates inform decision-making as the Board reviews and guide the 
Group’s business strategy and financial planning. 

To enhance the Board’s capabilities on climate-related issues, Wilmar’s 
Directors attended mandatory training which was required by the SGX 
for directors of SGX-listed companies. Additionally, in July 2022, Wilmar 
conducted in-house training on climate matters with the Board of Directors. 
This training was conducted by the Sustainability and the Industrial 
Sustainability Departments.

For more information on the profile of our Directors, please refer to our 
Annual Report 2022.

STRATEGY

• Wilmar regularly conducts qualitative scenario analysis to identify 
the possible impacts climate change can have on the Group, focusing 
mainly on upstream operations and our supply chain which are more 
susceptible to negative impacts if global temperature increase exceeds 
two degrees Celsius.

• Our internal risk assessments have identified relevant climate change 
risks and opportunities, which informed our sustainability strategy and 
the initiatives we focus on in our upstream and downstream operations

• Wilmar signed up to the SBTi and committed to setting both near-term 
and net-zero emission targets. Over the next 18 months, we will develop 
timebound plans outlining our strategy and approach to achieve 
our targets.

TFCD’S KEY PILLARS WILMAR’S APPROACH

STRATEGY

• We have already established our Scope 1 and 2 emissions baselines 
and implemented measures to reduce these emissions, primarily 
through investments in operational efficiency and renewable energy. 
Having recently completed mapping our Group-level Scope 3 emissions 
for baseline 2020, the next phase of our commitment will be to develop 
comprehensive plans to address and reduce them.

For more information, please refer to the Climate Change Mitigation 
section in this report. 

• To manage physical and transition risks, Wilmar takes a long-term 
holistic approach to sustainability that is fully integrated into our 
business model. 

• We invested heavily in the R&D of palm seedlings that are resilient to 
extreme weather patterns. These seedlings are also sold to smallholders 
and smaller plantation companies to ensure the reliability and resilience 
of our future suppliers. 

• We are also actively investing in the R&D of environmentally friendly 
solutions to address the growing demand for sustainable products. 

• As customers increasingly favour and shift towards responsibly and 
sustainably produced commodities, our sustainability approaches have 
allowed us to remain competitive and fulfil market expectations. 

For more information, please refer to the Climate Change Adaptation section 
and the Innovation and Technology section.

RISK MANAGEMENT

• Climate-related risks are assessed on a regular basis through Wilmar’s 
Group-wide ERM process.

• Wilmar’s BSC regularly reviews all ESG matters, including climate 
change. These reviews cover the overall risk management guidelines, 
policies and systems to determine the potential financial or strategic 
impact of the risks identified.

For more information, please refer to the Climate-related Risk and 
Opportunities section. 

METRIC AND TARGETS

• In 2022, our total Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions were 
15.1 million tCO2e (including land use change and peat emissions).

• Our GHG emissions intensity for 2022 was 150 kgCO2e per MT of 
products (excluding shipping). 

• The Scope 3 GHG emissions for baseline year 2020 was 155.8 million 
tCO2e. 

• We aim to reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 15% for all our palm 
oil mills by 2023, against our 2016 baseline of 0.82 tCO2e/MT CPO. 

• In 2021, our sugar refineries began mapping an Energy and Greenhouse 
Gas Reduction Pathway towards a low-emission future. 

• Goodman Fielder is committed to using 100% renewable electricity by 
2025 and achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2040. 

• YKA pledges to achieve 200 MWp total installed solar photovoltaic 
power generation on rooftop by 2030 and strives to achieve net-zero 
emission by 2050.

• We signed up to SBTi and are committing to develop timebound plans 
to achieve near-term and net-zero emission reduction targets.
