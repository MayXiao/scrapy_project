Chair message

Transforming AMP  
Purpose led and 
customer focused

I am pleased to present the AMP Limited Annual 
report for 2022. 
It has been a year of substantial progress as we transform 
AMP into a customer-focused and purpose-led business. 
The strength and reliability of AMP has proved to be 
important as we supported our customers and the 
community through another challenging period, marked 
by rising interest rates and cost of living, ongoing impacts 
of the pandemic, and damaging floods in many parts 
of Australia. 

I’m proud of the role AMP plays during these times, 
reflecting our founding purpose more than 170 years ago 
to be a sure friend in uncertain times. Our refreshed purpose 
statement today – helping people create their tomorrow 
– continues our legacy to support and build the financial 
wellbeing of Australians and New Zealanders.

The transformation of AMP continues at pace, and the 
achievements of 2022 are reflected in the delivery of focused 
strategic initiatives in retirement and banking, and stable 
financial performance across the business. An improvement 
in AMP’s share price, increasing 30.2 per cent in 2022, 
is a positive sign the actions we’re taking are rebuilding and 
transforming AMP for the benefit of all our stakeholders.

Financial performance
In 2022, AMP delivered an underlying net profit of 
$184 million supported by strong growth in AMP Bank, 
continued momentum in the Platforms business and 
a significant reduction in losses in our Advice business 
as we reshape it for the future. 

This net profit is lower than the $280 million of 2021, 
however is in line with our expectations reflecting 
the challenging economic environment, as well as 
management’s long-term strategic repricing of products and 
services to remain competitive, helping to retain and attract 
customers. AMP’s statutory net profit for the year was 
$387 million, which includes the gain from the sale of the 
AMP Capital infrastructure debt platform in February 2022. 

Our business units delivered resilient performances in 
challenging markets. AMP Bank’s residential mortgage book 
grew by $2.0 billion, supported by our focus on competitive 
rates and faster loan approval times for customers and 
mortgage brokers, in addition to a loan book acquisition.

Transforming AMP  
Purpose led and

I am pleased to present the AMP Limited Annual

The North platform has continued to win more cashflows 
from independent financial advisers, a key growth market, 
increasing 31 per cent on FY 21 to $1.7 billion.

The Advice business has been materially reshaped, reflected 
in losses in the business improving by $78 million. There 
is more work to do for Advice to operate as a standalone, 
sustainable business but the progress is pleasing.

The Master Trust and New Zealand businesses continue 
to perform in line with our expectations, contributing 
$55 million and $32 million, respectively, to underlying 
net profit. 

  Further detail on performance in 2022 is included in 
the Business review section of this report. 

Return of capital and dividends
AMP remains well-capitalised and has a strong balance 
sheet, which enabled us in August 2022 to confirm 
a return of capital to shareholders of $1.1 billion subject 
to completion of the AMP Capital transactions, and any 
required shareholder and regulatory approvals. This included 
the immediate commencement of a $350 million on-market 
share buyback, of which $267 million is already complete.

As part of our commitment around capital returns, AMP 
will return a further $400 million via a FY 22 final dividend 
of 2.5 cents per share, franked at 20%, and other capital 
management initiatives in 2023. A further $350 million of 
capital management initiatives will be announced following 
completion of the remaining AMP Capital transaction.

Portfolio simplification
In November 2021, shortly after the appointment of CEO 
Alexis George, AMP articulated a clear strategy to continue 
to simplify its portfolio and reposition core businesses in 
wealth management and retail banking to better compete, 
whilst also exploring longer-term opportunities for growth. 

As part of the portfolio simplification, in April 2022 
we announced two agreements to sell the AMP Capital 
infrastructure and real estate businesses rather than pursue 
a demerger. The Board determined that the transactions 
would deliver greater value and certainty for shareholders, 
accelerate the realisation of that value, and provide stability 
for AMP Capital’s clients and employees.

The sale and transfer of the international infrastructure 
equity business to DigitalBridge completed in early February 
2023. AMP continues to work on the final steps to complete 
the transfer of the real estate and domestic infrastructure 
equity business, which will mark the full divestment of the 
separated AMP Capital business.

Governance
The AMP Limited Board remains committed to best-practice 
governance as we guide AMP through the next stage 
of its transformation. I would like to thank all AMP board 
directors and management for their dedication to this 
important challenge.

In addition to providing oversight of strategic and risk 
management matters, as a board we have continued 
to be actively engaged in AMP’s cultural transformation 
during 2022. I’m proud of the changes AMP has made 
in a relatively short space of time and I am very pleased 
by the energy and excitement I see across the organisation 
to continue fostering an inclusive and empowering culture.

Central to AMP’s cultural transformation was the launch 
of the organisation’s new purpose statement – helping 
people create their tomorrow – which is underpinned 
by five values that put the customer first and support a high 
performing, accountable and inclusive team. You’ll see the 
purpose and values referenced throughout this Annual report.

As Chair, I am very conscious of the critical need for the board 
to have the appropriate mix of skills and experience to provide 
quality oversight of AMP’s transformation while also retaining 
corporate knowledge. I’m very confident in the diverse range 
of experience and insights of AMP’s highly committed board.

In July 2022, we welcomed Andrew Best as an independent 
non-executive director to the AMP Limited Board, bringing 
more than three decades of domestic and international 
investment banking and financial markets experience. 
Andrew will stand for election at the AGM in March 2023. 

Community and sustainability 
Grounded in AMP’s purpose, the board is committed to creating 
a sustainable and more equitable future for all our stakeholders 
– one that has shared value for our customers and members, 
shareholders, employees, and the community and environment. 

Our approach is articulated through AMP’s sustainability 
framework, which is updated annually through a 
comprehensive consultation process to ensure we focus 
on the most material sustainability issues that impact our 
business and society. AMP’s sustainability performance 
is detailed in the annual Sustainability report, which is 
prepared in accordance with leading disclosure frameworks. 

In 2022, AMP continued to deliver strengthened performance 
across a range of external ESG benchmarks. This includes 
maintaining its ‘Prime’ rating by ISS ESG, which is only 
awarded to companies with ESG performance above sector 
specific thresholds. AMP is also now included in the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Australia Index, which represents the 
top 30% of the ASX 200 that lead the field in sustainability.

As part of our focus to support the financial wellbeing of 
Australians, through the AMP Foundation, we support a 
number of non-profit organisations that help disadvantaged 
Australians build financial security. Since its inception in 1992, 
the AMP Foundation has contributed more than $110 million 
in the Australian community to help create positive change. 
The AMP Foundation continues to grow as one of Australia’s 
largest, independently funded corporate foundations.

Looking forward 
We have now made significant strides in the simplification and 
stabilisation of AMP. Following completion of the remaining 
AMP Capital sale, we will enter the next era for AMP as a 
simpler, customer-focused, purpose-led wealth management 
and retail banking business in Australia and New Zealand. 

We remain committed to the continuous improvement 
of AMP’s financial performance and to delivering enduring 
value to shareholders and all stakeholders. On behalf of the 
AMP Limited Board, thank you for your ongoing support 
as we continue to transform AMP.

CEO update

Q&A with Alexis George

The journey to 
a simpler AMP 

Q:  When you look back on 2022, 
what are you most proud of? 

A: I am proud of what we have been able 
to achieve in 2022. Top of the list has been the 
renewed energy in the organisation, supported 
by AMP’s new purpose – helping people create 
their tomorrow. It reinforces how we put the 
customer at the centre of everything we do, 
and has galvanised our people around our 
purpose-led, customer-focused strategy. 

During the year, we strengthened the 
management and executive team with several 
new appointments. The team is well positioned 
to deliver on our transformative strategy and 
continue fostering a strong, accountable and 
inclusive culture.

The energy and focus across the organisation 
have helped us achieve key milestones in our 
three-year strategy to simplify AMP’s portfolio, 
reposition our core businesses in retail 
banking and wealth management to better 
compete, and begin exploring opportunities 
for long-term sustainable growth. 

Q:  How did AMP’s businesses perform?
A: We remain a profitable business with 
a strong balance sheet, delivering an underlying 
net profit after tax of A$184 million for the year. 
Our profit reflects the challenging economic 
environment we are facing, as well as strategic 
repricing in the wealth management businesses. 
While the Bank experienced good growth 
during the year, profits were impacted by the 
competitive environment from a funding and 
lending perspective. 

Our key growth businesses – AMP Bank and 
Platforms – continue to perform and reflect 
the investments we’re making in our offerings. 
AMP Bank grew its loan book at 1.8x system, 
through organic and inorganic growth, and our 
North platform is increasing the percentage 
of flows from the independent financial adviser 
market. We’ve made good progress in our 
financial advice business, with losses halved 
to A$68 million as we continue to reposition 
the business.

In our Master Trust superannuation 
offering, we have simplified our 
product set, reduced fees and 
significantly improved investment 
performance, however this sector 
continues to experience challenging 
operating conditions. Our New Zealand 
business continues to deliver 
a stable performance. 

It has been a challenging period for 
AMP Capital as the business prepared 
for the separation and transition 
to new owners. However, I’m proud 
of the way the teams have continued 
to deliver for our clients during this 
time. The imminent completion of 
the transactions will provide stability 
and certainty for all stakeholders. 

Q:  How is AMP growing 
its relationships with 
customers? 

A: AMP’s customer-focused strategy 
seeks to meet our customers’ needs 
around some of the key aspects of 
their financial wellbeing, particularly 
the important areas of home 
ownership and retirement savings. 

During the year AMP Bank helped 
9,290 customers to buy their 
own home, and we have invested 
in new digital capabilities to make 
the home loan approval process 
easier and quicker for customers 
and mortgage brokers. 

In Australian Wealth Management, 
we launched an innovative retirement 
solution on the North platform that 
provides the highest levels of lifetime 
income in the market. This gives 
retirees peace of mind around the 
‘fear of running out’ in retirement, and 
is another important way we support 
our customers in these critical areas 
of their financial wellbeing. 

Q:  How is AMP adapting 
to industry disruption?

A: Change is constant, so we must 
continually innovate to meet the 
changing needs of customers. 
This innovation mindset has 
enabled us to bring to market some 
exciting solutions that will support 

our customers around the two biggest 
assets most Australians will ever own 
– their home and their retirement 
savings. In 2022, as promised, 
we launched our digital mortgage, 
as well as a unique retirement 
income solution, demonstrating 
that we can be truly innovative. 

Financial advice continues to be 
a highly regulated and challenged 
industry. However with the recent 
Quality of Advice Review, I’m 
confident we’re heading in the right 
direction to make financial advice 
affordable and accessible for more 
Australians. We will continue to focus 
on ensuring that our model for advice 
is competitive and sustainable, as we 
know that people who receive quality 
advice have better financial outcomes. 

Q:  How is the simplification of 
the business progressing?

A: In November 2021 we set out 
a clear plan to simplify AMP’s business 
and I’m pleased to say that we are 
making good progress on delivering 
on that plan. 

Over the past 18 months, we agreed 
and completed a number of asset 
sales, including the AMP Capital 
business and the remaining stake in 
Resolution Life Australia, to simplify 
our portfolio. We completed the sale 
of the international infrastructure 
equity business to DigitalBridge in 
February 2023, and we have one 
outstanding regulatory approval 
required in China to complete the 
sale of the real estate and domestic 
infrastructure equity business 
to Dexus.

In August 2022 we announced 
a capital return of $1.1 billion to 
shareholders, and as part of that we 
have announced a FY 22 final dividend 
of 2.5 cents per share. Returning 
capital to shareholders remains one 
of our key strategic priorities for 2023. 

As we continue to execute on our 
strategic plan, I am pleased that 
our progress during 2022 has been 
reflected in more stability and 
growth in AMP’s share price. 

Q:  What’s your vision for AMP?
A: My vision is for AMP to be 
a purpose-driven and leading retail 
banking and wealth management 
business. Guided by our purpose, we 
see considerable opportunity to support 
customers in new and innovative 
ways around retirement. Our brand 
remains iconic and is intertwined with 
Australian history and I see this as 
being a strong differentiator for AMP. 
We have launched first-to-market 
retirement solutions, including our 
new lifetime income account, which 
gives us a strong foundation for future 
growth and the opportunity to be a 
leader in this space. 

Q:  What are your priorities 
for the coming year? 

A: The management team 
is committed to building on the 
foundations we’ve put in place 
during 2022, to build pride in AMP 
for our shareholders, employees, 
customers and the community. 

We are delivering on our strategy 
on the path to a new AMP, and 
have defined our priorities 
for the year ahead. We will 
be focused on returning capital 
to shareholders, growing IFA 
flows in our Platforms business, 
controlling costs, supporting new 
growth opportunities particularly 
through strategic partnerships, 
growing AMP Bank, and continuing 
to strengthen our culture and brand. 
These critical parts of our strategy 
will deliver a business that is robust, 
growing and delivers long-term 
value to shareholders. 

We are committed to delivering 
on AMP’s transformation, and 
I thank shareholders for their 
continued support as we execute 
on our strategy. I’m excited 
by what we will achieve in 2023.

AMP’s commitment to communities is about doing 
the right thing and investing in our communities 
for a more sustainable and equitable future.

AMP is committed to responsible investment. We believe that attention 
to environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations improves 
long-term financial outcomes and creates a sustainable and equitable 
future for everyone in our community.

Climate change presents a range of physical, financial and legal risks to our 
business, the investments we manage on behalf of our customers, and the 
wider community, and AMP manages these risks. This includes leveraging 
our influence as a global investor and how we reduce the impact of our 
business activities. 

Through its commitment to community investment, AMP creates value for 
communities through philanthropic activities and engages employees with 
fundraising and volunteering opportunities. 

Communities and environment

The AMP Foundation
The AMP Foundation is one 
of the nation’s oldest and 
largest corporate foundations. 
As the independently funded 
philanthropic arm of AMP, the 
Foundation has committed 
to investing in the wellbeing 
of individuals, families, 
communities and society. Since 
1992, the AMP has invested 
close to $110 million in the 
Australian community to help 
create positive change.

AMP seeks to leverage its purpose, culture, 
values and controls to build trust in AMP and the 
financial services sector. This includes ensuring our 
employees and advisers act ethically, and quickly 
resolve issues to a high professional standard.

AMP is committed to attracting, developing and retaining the skills 
and talent of our people and advisers, which is key to AMP’s ability to 
create value for customers and shareholders. This includes diversity and 
inclusion, health and wellbeing, and employee attraction and retention.

As part of AMP’s commitment to its partners and supply chains, 
we support our advice network and intermediary network in delivery 
of service excellence to customers. This includes how we manage 
our key service provider relationships and risks of modern slavery 
in our supply chain.

People and partners
Respect@Work website
AMP played a significant role 
in the development of the 
Respect@Work website, which 
is an initiative of the Australian 
Human Rights Commission 
(AHRC) and the Respect@Work 
Council. The online resource for 
Australian businesses was created 
in response to recommendations 
of the National Enquiry into 
Sexual Harassment in Australian 
workplaces. The Respect@Work 
website was launched in November 
2022 and is the first website of its 
kind in Australia.

  More information on AMP’s sustainability performance across these 
key focus areas is detailed in the 2022 Sustainability report.

Material risks

Managing 
our key risks

Enterprise risk management framework
Effective risk management is fundamental 
to understanding and responding to 
changes in our operating environment, 
enabling us to achieve our purpose and 
strategic objectives. Risk management 
is a responsibility of all AMP employees, 
and is reflected in many of our values 
– own it, be brave, do the right thing, 
and put customers first. 

AMP’s risk management framework 
provides the foundation for how risks are 
managed across AMP and enables AMP 
to meet its legislative and regulatory 
requirements, codes and ethical standards, 
as well as internal policies and procedures. 
It includes the following key components: 

 – Group strategy and business plans 
 – Risk management strategy 
 – Risk appetite statement 
 – Supporting policies and practices

By establishing the principles, requirements, 
roles and responsibilities for management 
of risk across AMP, the framework ensures 
all employees have clarity on how risks 
are to be managed to fulfil the obligations 
to key stakeholders, including customers, 
shareholders and regulators.

The risk appetite statement articulates the 
level of risk the board is willing to accept 
to ensure the effective delivery of AMP’s 
strategic objectives. There is clear alignment 
between AMP’s corporate strategy and 
the risk appetite of the AMP Limited Board, 
to ensure that decisions made are consistent 
with the nature and level of risk the board 
and management are willing to accept.

Risk is inherent to our business and AMP 
takes measured risks within our risk appetite 
to achieve our strategic objectives. AMP has 
a clear strategic plan to drive our business 
forward and an Enterprise Risk Management 
framework to identify, measure, control and 
report risks.

Business, employee and 
business partner conduct

The conduct of financial institutions continues to be 
an area of significant focus for the financial services 
industry, both globally and in Australia and New 
Zealand. AMP devotes significant effort to ensure that 
our business practices, management, staff or business 
partner behaviours adequately meet the expectations 
of regulators, customers and the broader community, 
and do not result in an adverse impact on our customer 
outcomes, AMP’s reputation, or our value proposition 
to customers.

Our Code of Conduct outlines how AMP seeks to conduct 
its business and how it expects board members, leaders 
employees and contractors to conduct themselves. 
The principles that define the high standards outline the 
behaviour and decision-making practices, including how 
we treat our employees, customers, business partners 
and shareholders. We are committed to ensuring the 
right culture is embedded in our everyday practices.

AMP embraces a safe and respectful work environment 
that encourages our people to report issues or concerns 
in the workplace. Directors, employees (current and 
former), contractors, service providers or any relative 
or dependents of any of these people can utilise 
AMP’s whistleblowing program to report conduct 
or unethical behaviours.

Climate change

AMP, its customers and its external suppliers may 
be adversely affected by physical and transition risks 
associated with climate change. These effects may 
directly impact AMP and its customers on a range 
of physical, financial and legal risks to our business, 
the investments we manage on behalf of our customers 
and the wider community.

Initiatives to mitigate or respond to adverse impacts 
of climate change may in turn impact market and asset 
prices, economic activity, and customer behaviour, 
particularly in geographic locations and industry 
sectors adversely affected by these changes.

AMP’s approach to managing climate-related risks and 
opportunities is detailed in AMP’s annual Sustainability 
report. It includes providing low carbon investment 
choices to customers, managing and disclosing 
investment risks, leveraging our influence as an investor, 
reducing our own operational impacts and supporting 
customers and communities where possible.

AMP provides annual performance disclosures aligned 
to key pillars of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, including 
through its Sustainability report and through 
investor led disclosures such as the CDP (formerly 
Carbon Disclosure Project). In 2022, AMP retained 
an A- Leadership rating (second highest rating available) 
in the annual CDP investor disclosure program, indicating 
leadership in our management of climate related risks 
and opportunities. AMP has been carbon neutral across 
its operations since 2013 to address the direct impacts 
of our business activities.

Key business challenges
AMP is focused on delivering its transformational strategy, 
and in doing so remains conscious of various challenges 
affecting the financial services industry. These include, but 
are not limited to, the following (listed in alphabetical order):

Material risks

Competitor and 
customer environment

The financial services industry, as 
well as the community in Australia 
and New Zealand more broadly, 
have faced various challenges 
throughout 2022, including natural 
disasters, economic uncertainty, and 
rising interest rates. Throughout 
the year AMP supported customers 
in a number of ways, including 
activating AMP’s disaster relief 
assistance program to provide 
support for customers affected 
by flooding. 

Customer expectations are evolving 
which is intensifying competition 
within banking and wealth 
management. Furthermore, as 
economic uncertainty prevails, it is 
affecting the performance of assets 
under management across the 
industry. AMP continues to adapt 
its capabilities and operating model 
in order to remain competitive and 
relevant to customers. 

In 2022, AMP continued to deliver 
on its strategy to reposition 
AMP as a simpler, purpose-led, 
customer-focused business in 
its core markets of banking and 
wealth management. Solid progress 
was made on this strategy during 
2022, with notable developments 
including the launch of AMP’s fully 
digital mortgage, and a first-to-
market retirement solution. 

Cyber security  
threats

Cyber risk remains a threat in 
a rapidly changing technological 
environment. AMP is committed 
to continually uplifting its cyber 
resilience through preventing, 
detecting, and responding to 
cyber incidents, in order to protect 
AMP’s reputation, assets and 
business operations.

AMP continues to invest in 
enhancing its cyber security 
capability so that it is both 
sustainable and commensurate 
to the threats faced. AMP’s Cyber 
Defence Centre, launched in 2021 
uses industry best practices, 
advanced technologies and 
intelligence sharing arrangements 
with Australian Government and 
industry entities to uplift AMP’s 
cyber defenses, enhance situational 
awareness and mitigate malicious 
threats. The AMP Cyber Team 
broadened its reach to include 
financial advisers with the creation 
of a dedicated cyber policy, 
improved training materials, and 
awareness campaigns, including 
presentations at Professional 
Development days. While AMP 
continues to demonstrate 
maturity uplifts against the 
National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) Cyber Security 
Framework and improve its overall 
control effectiveness, cyber security 
threats remain a key risk to the 
business given the evolving nature 
of the threat. 

Operational risk 
environment

Operational risk exposures for 
AMP relate to losses resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or 
from external events. These include, 
but are not limited to, information 
technology, human resources, 
internal and external fraud, money 
laundering and counter-terrorism 
financing, bribery and corruption. 
High operational risks are the result 
of a complex operating environment 
associated with legacy products, 
systems and, in some cases, manual 
controls. This environment will be 
further stressed by the other key 
business challenges included in 
this section.

Employee retention and key person 
risk are key operational risks for 
AMP, and these are currently 
elevated across financial services as 
a whole due to low unemployment 
and a competitive talent market. 
We are committed to mitigating 
operational risk by reducing 
operational complexity and 
strengthening risk management, 
internal controls and governance. 
We have completed all file reviews 
for our client remediation program 
and we continue reshaping the 
adviser network and simplifying 
superannuation products and 
investment options.

The AMP operational risk profile 
reflects these exposures and 
the financial statements of AMP 
contain certain provisions and 
contingent liability disclosures 
for these risks in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards.

Organisational 
change

Changes were made throughout 
the year to simplify the operating 
model of the ongoing business. 
In 2022, AMP announced the 
sale of AMP Capital’s real estate, 
domestic infrastructure equity 
and international infrastructure 
equity businesses. 

There is always a risk that 
business momentum is lost 
while organisational change is 
implemented. There is a risk that 
the extended period of change 
may have an adverse impact to 
employees causing a strain to deliver 
on our strategy and transformation 
initiatives. These risks will 
be mitigated by maintaining 
leadership and performance 
focus on the business.

AMP continues to invest in 
adopting new ways of working to 
drive efficiency and improve its 
practices to increase accountability 
and build on core strengths. 
We recognise that failure to 
execute appropriately on the 
implementation of these changes 
can increase the risks of disruption 
to AMP’s business operations.

Regulatory 
environment

AMP operates in multiple 
jurisdictions, and each of these 
jurisdictions has its own legislative 
and regulatory requirements, as 
well as anticipated upcoming 
changes to these requirements. 

AMP continues to respond and 
adjust its business processes for 
any changes. However, failure to 
adequately anticipate and respond 
to future regulatory changes could 
have a material adverse impact on 
the performance of its businesses 
and achieving its strategic 
objectives. AMP’s commitment to 
strengthening its risk management 
practices, its control environment 
and enhancing its compliance 
systems across its businesses, 
will address these legislative and 
regulatory requirements. AMP’s 
internal policies, frameworks 
and procedures seek to ensure 
any changes in our domestic 
and international regulatory 
obligations are complied with 
in each jurisdiction. Compliance, 
legal and regulatory risk that 
results in breaches is reported 
to AMP management committees 
and regulators. This is managed 
in accordance with internal policies.

Regulatory consultations and 
interactions are reported and 
monitored as part of AMP’s 
internal risk and compliance 
reporting process. AMP actively 
participates in these interactions 
and cooperates with all regulators 
to resolve such matters.

More information about 
our approach to these 
risks can be found on

Governance

The Board oversees AMP as it continues its transformation, 
building on its 174-year heritage of supporting customers 
to live financially well. This transformation is supported 
by AMP’s new purpose and values. 

In November 2021 AMP outlined its strategic path, with 
a streamlined portfolio and a customer-driven approach. 
This strategy is underpinned by four key enablers: purpose 
and culture; brand, reputation and environmental, 
social and governance; digital and data capability; 
and respect risk. 

As the Board oversees AMP’s progress against this 
strategy, the Board’s commitment to governance 
was demonstrated in a number of key areas in 2022: 

Purpose and values
AMP recommitted to being a purpose-led organisation. 
AMP’s new purpose statement “Helping people create 
their tomorrow” is AMP’s commitment to delivering value 
to all stakeholders. AMP’s values help bring this purpose 
to life and provide a simple and clear set of expectations 
for all employees.

Reshaping Board Committee structure and 
establishment of Advisory groups
As AMP’s transformation initiatives stabilised, and 
in line with stakeholder feedback, AMP completed a 
comprehensive review of its board committees structure 
resulting in the reduction of committee members for 
certain of its committees. 

AMP’s board also established two advisory groups for an 
initial six-month period to support and promote AMP’s 
key strategic enablers. These board advisory groups 
are tasked to conduct workshops and deep dives with 
management with their key focus on ESG & sustainability 
and technology transformation.

These changes were effected on 1 October 2022 and 
resulted in a further reduction in the total amount of 
fees paid to directors from that date, continuing the 
progressive reduction in aggregate director fees since 
2019 by a total of 40.4%. 

Board appointment 
AMP continued to ensure its board has a mix of 
skills, background and experience relevant to AMP’s 
continuing transformation, appointing Andrew Best 
as a new independent non-executive director in July 
2022 who brings to the board valuable insights in 
capital management, financial markets and mergers 
and acquisition.

to governance

Corporate Governance framework
AMP’s governance framework provides clear separation 
of the board’s oversight functions and the executive 
responsibilities and accountability of the CEO and AMP’s 
leadership team, the executive committee (ExCo). This 
framework is supported by internal policies, charters, 
standards and procedures which facilitate this separation 
of responsibilities. An overview of AMP’s corporate 
governance framework is depicted below.

Business review

Full year 2022 highlights 
During the year, AMP Bank has helped over 188,000 customers with their banking needs, 
and enabled over 9,290 Australians to purchase their own home. The bank’s residential 
mortgage book grew at 1.8x system, while maintaining strong credit quality. This was 
underpinned by ongoing service improvements to drive organic growth, as well as the 
acquisition of Nano’s residential mortgage book. The residential mortgage book grew by 
9% to $23.8 billion. Net interest margin (NIM) of 1.38% in FY 22, compared to 1.62% in 
FY 21, was primarily driven by mortgage margin compression and asset mix changes, and 
partially offset by favourable deposit margins. The second half of FY 22 saw NIM improve 
to 1.44% as funding demand and competition in the market normalised. AMP Bank’s NPAT 
(underlying) of $103 million reflects the competitive environment from a funding and 
lending perspective, as well as the benefit of the one-off loan impairment release in FY 21 
not repeated in FY 22. 

Operational highlights
AMP Bank continued to take a disciplined approach to growing its loan book, supported 
by improving service and turnaround times, and competitive pricing. AMP Bank also 
continued its strategic investment in technology, enhancing its offering to further digitise 
and automate the lending experience for brokers, advisers and customers. Continued 
investment in home loan processing technology improved customer cycle times to 
unconditional approval by 33%. Partnerships with innovative fintechs position AMP Bank 
to reach a broader direct-to-consumer base. AMP Bank partnered with Bricklet, a shared 
equity home platform, to enable more Australians to get into the property market earlier 
in life. A partnership with fintech platform Nano enables AMP Bank to offer fully digital 
mortgages, with unconditional approval in as little as 10 minutes.

AMP launches market-first 
retirement solution 
In 2022, AMP launched a market-first retirement solution, MyNorth Lifetime, 
an innovative new option for retirees that provides the peace of mind and 
certainty of higher income for life. Available through MyNorth, it delivers 
on a key strategic priority for AMP to help more Australians achieve a 
better-quality life throughout retirement. 

Customers and their financial advisers have complete control over investment 
choice and strategy, with access to North’s extensive investment menu. This 
ensures advisers can support their customer’s specific investment goals and 
retirement objectives, and make changes over time as circumstances change. 
This market-first retirement solution, MyNorth Lifetime, has won two awards 
at the annual Plan For Life (PFL) Longevity Cover Excellence Awards. MyNorth 
Lifetime won the Innovation award for longevity cover and MyNorth Deferred 
Lifetime Income won best Deferred Lifetime Investment Linked cover.

Australian Wealth Management includes three key businesses – Platforms, Master 
Trust and Advice. NPAT for the overall business was $50 million (FY 21: $89 million), 
reflecting strategic repricing in Platforms and Master Trust to attract and retain 
customers, as well as the impact of volatile investment markets partly offset 
by lower costs. 

Platforms 
AMP’s flagship platform, North, continued to generate solid inflows from both IFAs 
and aligned advisers, which follows strategic repricing initiatives and continued 
investment in the platform’s functionality. NPAT (underlying) of $66 million 
(FY 21: $123 million) was impacted by market volatility including losses on the 
North Guarantee product and planned strategic repricing. Controllable costs 
of $157 million (FY 21: $146 million) reflect the decision to increase spending 
to support future business growth. 

Overall Platforms AUM of $65.5 billion (FY 21: $71.1 billion) reflects volatile 
investment markets partly offset by cash inflows of $936 million (FY 21: $83 million). 
North AUM remained relatively stable at $61.3 billion, with volatile investment 
markets offset by net cash inflows of $5.7 billion.

Master Trust 
The Master Trust business continues its strategy of simplification, driving operational 
efficiency and reducing costs while improving investment performance, despite challenging 
operating conditions for this business. NPAT (underlying) of $55 million was impacted by the 
simplification initiatives completed in Q3 21, lower average AUM and the decision to deliver 
price reductions for members in the previous year to reset Master Trust’s competitive 
position in the market.

The focus on operational efficiency continued, with controllable costs falling to $192 million 
(FY 21: $216 million) driven by focused cost reduction activity and lower project costs, with 
the major simplification programs largely complete. 

Advice 
Strong progress was made on the transformation of Advice to a sustainable, standalone 
business, reducing NPAT losses by $78 million to $68 million. Costs were carefully managed, 
with controllable costs reducing by 25% to $138 million. Advice revenues of $56 million 
(FY 21: $58 million) were impacted by the sale of the employed business, and partially offset 
by higher licensee fees.

Full year 2022 highlights 
New Zealand Wealth Management (NZWM) provides customers with 
a variety of wealth management solutions, including KiwiSaver, corporate 
superannuation, retail investments, a wrap investment management 
platform and general insurance. In FY 22, NPAT of $32 million reflects 
volatile investment markets impacting average AUM, as well as the repricing 
of the KiwiSaver product. In FY 22, AUM based revenue was $92 million, 
with AUM at 31 December 2022 of $10.5 billion. NZWM continues to focus 
on simplifying its business, with costs controls resulting in controllable costs 
down 2.8% to $35 million. 

Operational highlights 
2022 was the first full year of NZWM’s index-based investment philosophy 
with a focus on sustainable investing. This approach has enabled NZWM 
to reduce the carbon footprint of its funds while also reducing fees for 
clients. While volatility in global financial markets is likely to continue 
to impact average AUM balances, NZWM is well positioned in the market.

Directors’ report
for the year ended 31 December 2022

Domestic Real Estate and Infrastructure Equity businesses
As announced on 9 January 2023, there remains an outstanding condition precedent for the completion of the sale of AMP Capital’s domestic real 
estate and infrastructure equity businesses to Dexus Funds Management Ltd (Dexus) under the current sale agreement. This relates to receiving 
approval from the applicable regulator in China for the transfer of AMP’s interest in China Life AMP Asset Management (CLAMP) out of the sale 
perimeter. AMP and Dexus have agreed to extend the date for satisfaction or waiver of conditions precedent to 28 February 2023. However, the base 
purchase price has been reduced by $25m to $225m, and the remaining potential funds under management (FUM) based earnout has been forfeited.

Potential revised transaction structure
AMP and Dexus have entered into a non-binding term sheet which contemplates a revised transaction structure with a two-stage 
completion process. If binding agreements are entered into, the revised transaction structure would allow for most legal entities (holding 
the majority of the AMP Capital domestic assets and management rights) as well as employees, to transfer to Dexus at first completion, 
prior to the satisfaction of the remaining condition precedent. The transfer of one remaining entity (which currently holds the interest 
in CLAMP) would occur at final completion following receipt of the necessary regulatory approval. This alternative transaction approach 
is being pursued alongside the existing initial transaction structure for maximum flexibility.

Divestment of equity interest in Resolution Life Australasia
On 3 November 2021, AMP Limited announced it had agreed to the divestment of its 19.13% equity interest in Resolution Life Australasia 
(RLA) for a consideration of $524m to Resolution Life Group. This transaction completed on 28 June 2022.

Review of operations and results
The profit attributable to shareholders of AMP Limited for the year ended 31 December 2022 was $387m (2021: loss of $252m). Basic 
earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2022 on a statutory basis was 12.0 cents (2021: (7.6) cents). On an underlying basis, 
earnings per share was 5.7 cents (2021: 8.4 cents). Key performance measures of the group were as follows:

 – 2022 NPAT (underlying) of $184m decreased 34% from $280m in 2021. This decrease largely reflects the impact of lower AMP Bank 
earnings (-33%) relative to 2021 reflecting lower net interest margin, as well as 2021 benefitting from a one-off credit loss provision 
release. Lower Australian Wealth Management earnings (-44%) reflecting strategic competitive repricing and market volatility, and 
lower New Zealand Wealth Management earnings (-18%) in a weaker market, also impacted NPAT.

 – 2022 NPAT (statutory) profit of $387m was favourably impacted by a ~$390m gain on the sale of the Infrastructure Debt platform, 
partly offset by $90m of separation costs, $68m of impairments, $61m of transformation costs, $25m of remediation and related 
costs and other one-off items.

 – Total AUM and administration of $149.1b in 2022 decreased by $22.8b (-13%) from 2021 due to negative investment market returns 
and net cash outflows.

 – Australian Wealth Management net cash outflows were $5.3b in 2022, compared to net cash outflows of $7.2b in 2021. This was 
largely attributable to lower outflows across both platforms and Master Trust and growth in inflows from Independent Financial 
Advisers (IFAs). 2022 net cash outflows also included $2.0b of regular pension payments to members (2021: $1.9b).

 – AMP Bank’s residential mortgage book increased by $2.0b (9%) to $23.8b driven by competitive pricing, ongoing service improvements  
and targeted growth in principal and interest loans across both owner-occupied and investment lending. This increase also included 
~$400m of loans acquired from Nano in December 2022. This represents 1.5x system growth or 1.81x system growth including Nano 
(based on December 2022 APRA data).

 – AMP’s controllable costs, excluding AMP Capital discontinued operations, of $791m were 6% lower than 2021 due to cost out 
benefits partly offset by structural cost increases.

 – AMP group cost to income ratio was 72.4% in 2022, up from 67.1% in 2021 due to lower revenues.
 – Underlying return on equity was 4.6% in 2022 (2021: 6.9%).
 – 2022 total eligible capital resources were $923m above regulatory and target capital requirements, up from $383m at 31 December 2021. 

Operating results by business area
The operating results of each business area for 2022 were as follows:
AMP Bank – NPAT of $103m decreased by $50m (33%) from 2021 predominantly driven by increased loan impairment expense 
(2021 included $26m release of credit loss provision related to the impact of COVID-19), reduction in net interest income $17m (4%) from 
2021, largely due to NIM compression in 1H22, and an increase in costs to support ongoing growth. 
Australian Wealth Management – NPAT fell from $89m in 2021 to $50m in 2022 primarily due to the impact of strategic competitive repricing 
in Master Trust and Platforms, lower revenue predominantly from investment market volatility and the impact of stressed and volatile markets 
on the North guarantee, partly offset by lower variable and controllable costs from cost reduction initiatives. 
New Zealand Wealth Management – NPAT of $32m in 2022 decreased $7m (2021: $39m) primarily due to a significant drop in global 
investment markets.
AMP Capital – Continuing operations NPAT of $41m was up 11% from $37m in 2021 due to higher contributions from joint venture investments.

Capital management and dividend
Equity and reserves of the AMP Group attributable to shareholders of AMP Limited was $4.2b at 31 December 2022 ($4.0b as at 31 December 
2021). AMP’s Group Surplus Capital as at 31 December 2022 is $923m ($383m at 31 December 2021). The board has resolved to declare a 2022 
final dividend of ~$75m (2.5cps) franked to 20%. The board continues to maintain a conservative approach to capital management to support 
the transformation of the business and maintain balance sheet strength. As announced in the half yearly results in August 2022, AMP intends 
to return a total of $1.1b of capital to shareholders as a result of previously announced business sales. Further capital returns beyond the 
$350m current on-market buyback are subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
Under its constitution, the company indemnifies, to the extent permitted by law, all current and former officers of the company (including

incurred in their capacity as an officer of the company. This indemnity is not extended to current or former employees of the AMP group 
against liability incurred in their capacity as an employee, unless approved by the AMP Limited Board.

During, and since the end of, the financial year ended 31 December 2022, the company maintained, and paid premiums for, directors’ and 
officers’ and company reimbursement insurance for the benefit of all of the officers of the AMP group (including each director, secretary 
and senior manager of the company) against certain liabilities as permitted by the Corporations Act 2001. The insurance policy prohibits 
disclosure of the nature of the liabilities covered, the amount of the premium payable and the limit of liability.

In addition, the company and each of the current and former directors, and a subsidiary of the company and each of the company secretaries, are parties 
to deeds of indemnity, insurance and access. Those deeds provide that:

 – these officers will have access to board papers and specified records of the company (and of certain other companies) for their period 
of office and for at least 10 (or, in some cases, seven) years after they cease to hold office (subject to certain conditions);

 – the company indemnifies the directors, and a subsidiary of the company indemnifies the secretaries, to the extent permitted by law, 
and to the extent and for the amount that the relevant officer is not otherwise entitled to be, and is not actually, indemnified 
by another person;

 – the indemnity covers liabilities (including legal costs) incurred by the relevant officer in their capacity as a current or former director 
or secretary of the company, or as a director or secretary of any AMP group company or an AMP representative to an external company; and

 – the company will maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance cover for the directors, to the extent permitted by law, for the period of their 
office and for at least 10 years after they cease to hold office.

INDEMNIFICATION OF AUDITORS
To the extent permitted by law, the company has agreed to indemnify its auditor, Ernst & Young, as part of the terms of its audit engagement 
agreement, against claims by third parties arising from the audit, other than where the claim is determined to have resulted from any 
negligent, wrongful or wilful act or omission by or of Ernst & Young. No payment has been made to indemnify Ernst & Young during or since 
the financial year ended 31 December 2022.

REMUNERATION DISCLOSURES

Dear fellow shareholder
Under the first full year of CEO Alexis George’s stewardship, the 2022 financial 
year has marked a significant turning point for AMP. The board firmly believes 
Alexis and the Executive Committee have developed a clear roadmap for the 
future growth of AMP and have successfully delivered against 2022 priorities.

Notable achievements during 2022
In the first quarter, the demerger of AMP Capital from AMP was well 
progressed. Following the completion of the sale of the Infrastructure Debt 
business to Ares in February 2022, the board made a decision in late April 
2022 to instead, deliver greater certainty for and value to AMP shareholders 
through asset sales to DigitalBridge and Dexus. The DigitalBridge transaction 
completed in February 2023.

Against this challenging backdrop, we delivered a number of strategically 
important outcomes in the context of AMP’s broader transformation 
objectives to become a leading wealth management and banking business 
in Australia and New Zealand. These include:

 – The simplification of AMP’s portfolio to five core businesses with clearly 
defined offerings in each.

 – Disciplined cost management has reduced costs by $54m down to $791m 
through simplification of operational structure.

 – Action was taken to reduce the prices of several of the Bank’s product 
offerings while the bank and platforms businesses launched innovative 
new solutions for customers, including a unique to market retirement 
income offer.

 – AMP’s new purpose – helping people create their tomorrow – and 
underpinning values were successfully introduced and have helped the 
business to take a more forward view anchored in the customer.

 – The full-year inclusion index of 75 points was achieved and buoyed 
by gender diversity targets met at the Board, Executive Management, 
Middle Management and AMP workforce more broadly.

The early response from key stakeholders to these initiatives is pleasing and 
supportive of AMP’s transformation strategy.

Shareholders
A strong indication of AMP’s turning point during 2022 is reflected in the 
company’s share price increase, delivering a 12-month total shareholder 
return of 30.2%, outperforming the S&P ASX 200 Financials. 

Customers
Improved outcomes for AMP’s brand and reputation were achieved with the 
AMP RepTrak score increasing three points from the prior year. The result is also 
the highest since the 2018 royal commission into the financial services industry. 
AMP’s net promoter score (NPS) was +23.

People
Since Alexis George took leadership of the business, employee engagement has been 
improving steadily and achieved the target score of 73 satisfaction. Participation 
in the voluntary survey was up to 79% compared with 65% a year before.

2022 Pay for Performance
The board determined the incentive pool after considering the AMP scorecard 
result of 68%, achievement of outcomes not represented on the scorecard, the 
economic and operating environment, shareholder value creation and applying 
a risk overview. After careful consideration the board exercised its discretion 
in determining the incentive pool funding of 70%. A further 15% has been 
awarded in cash and will be paid upon the commencement of the second tranche 
of capital expected to be returned to shareholders during 2023. 1 This equates 
to a possible total payout of 85% of target, of which 60% will be paid in cash 
and 40% delivered in share rights that vest over four years. It seeks to reward, 
retain and incentivise AMP’s key executives who have delivered on a significant 
number of strategically important outcomes that will underpin AMP’s growth. 
Recognising that they worked through the complexities of the sale of the AMP 
Capital business, while placing a priority on returning capital to shareholders 
and enhancing shareholder value.

In considering the role of the board in applying discretion and judgements on 
performance pay, the board remains cognisant of the balance of rewarding executive 
leadership and performance while being focused on shareholder outcomes.

During 2022, no long-term incentive awards were performance tested and 
therefore no long-term incentive (LTI) vested. A portion of the CEO sign on share 
rights vested.

Key Management Personnel (KMP)
As a result of the April 2022 agreements to sell the AMP Capital real estate and 
infrastructure businesses, and the subsequent simplified portfolio for AMP, the 
board determined that the current KMP designated roles include the CEO, Chief 
Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Executive Officer – Australian Wealth 
Management and Group Executive – AMP Bank. The Group General Counsel, 
Chief People Officer and AMP Capital CEO are no longer classified as KMP roles. 

After serving more than 20 years at AMP, CFO James Georgeson will depart 
AMP. Peter Fredricson was announced as CFO, commencing on 9 January 2023.

The AMP Capital CEO role will be made redundant in 2023 after the completion 
of the sales of the AMP Capital businesses.

Other remuneration outcomes
Sean O’Malley, Group Executive – AMP Bank, is the only Executive Committee 
member who has been awarded a fixed remuneration increase for 2023. 
Further detail is provided in section 5.3. 

In recognition of his contribution to AMP, James Georgeson will be treated as 
a good leaver for equity plan purposes and will retain his equity awards on foot 
in accordance with the plan terms including the original vesting and restriction 
periods of the relevant plan.

1 Excluding ordinary dividends declared in the normal course.

Looking to 2023
To enhance the effectiveness of executive 
remuneration, comply with APRA’s new 
remuneration Prudential Standard CPS 511 and 
meet the evolving expectations of stakeholders, 
the board undertook comprehensive 
consultation with APRA, shareholders and 
shareholder advisory service firms. The Board 
made several changes to the 2023 executive 
remuneration framework in response.

The appropriate balance was sought between 
financial and non-financial objectives in respect 
of total variable reward while maintaining 
a material weighting to non-financial 
measures overall. 

 – The weighting of financials within the LTI 
plan will no longer account for 100% and 
be based solely on relative TSR. Instead, 
financial measures will account for 70% 
(measured 35% on relative TSR and 35% 
on adjusted EPS growth) and 30% will 
be based on a non-financial measure 
(assessed on AMP’s reputation ranking 
against a peer group selected from 
RepTrak’s Benchmark 60 Index).

 – The LTI vesting period for the Executive 
Committee will be extended from four 
years to a total of six years for the CEO 
and five years for the other Executive 
Committee members. This will allow 
sufficient time to detect any potential risk 
or conduct issue that may subsequently 
present itself, providing the Board with 
the ability to apply malus or clawbacks 
if appropriate.

 – The financial weighting in the AMP 2023 
scorecard increased from 30% to 40%. 

 – The STI cash and equity mix has been set 
at 60:40 to balance the extension of deferral 
periods and counter the other changes made 
and ensure executives remain appropriately 
remunerated in a competitive market place 
for leadership talent. This change was also 
applied to 2022 outcomes.

 – The STI deferral remains unchanged for the 
CEO with 33.4% paid in year two and 33.3% 
paid in years three and four; however, for 
the other Executive Committee members, 
STI deferral periods have gone from 50% 
in year two and 50% in year three to mirror 
the CEO’s STI deferral periods.

On behalf of the board I would like to thank 
you for your continued support and invite you 
to read the full remuneration report in detail. 
We always appreciate and welcome feedback 
from our stakeholders.

1 Phil Pakes’ formal termination date was 1 May 2022. Termination payment details are included in Table 7.1 of this report. 

The board carried out a review of the Executive KMP to reflect the simplified go-forward business and the way Alexis George has been 
running the core business since the Board announced the sale of the AMP Capital businesses on 27 April 2022. Following that review, the 
board determined that the following roles as Executive KMP from that date: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive 
Officer, Australian Wealth Management, Chief Risk Officer, Group Executive AMP Bank.
Consequently, the following roles ceased as Executive KMP from 28 April 2022:

 – Group General Counsel and Chief People Officer: With the sale of AMP Capital businesses and simplification of AMP, these roles are 
now considered mostly advisory roles. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Group Executive Transformation & Managing Director 
NZ, who form part of the Executive Committee, are also not considered to be KMP for similar reasons. 

 – AMP Capital CEO: After deciding to sell the AMP Capital businesses, the board concluded that the primary accountability of the AMP 
Capital CEO is to execute and close out the AMP Capital sale processes in order to optimise value for shareholders. Therefore, the role 
is not considered to be KMP from the date the sales were announced. The AMP Capital’s CEO role will be made redundant in 2023 after 
the completion of the sales.

Peter Fredricson was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, effective 9 January 2023. This change has no impact on the 2022 remuneration 
disclosed in this report.

is not considered to be KMP from the date the sales were announced. The AMP Capital’s CEO role will be made redundant in 2023 after 
the completion of the sales.

Peter Fredricson was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, effective 9 January 2023. This change has no impact on the 2022 remuneration 
disclosed in this report.

1.2 2022 REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK

The following diagram illustrates the remuneration framework that applied in 2022 to the AMP Executive Committee, which includes the 
Executive KMP.

It is underpinned by the remuneration governance, risk management and consequence management frameworks and is subject to overall 
AMP Board discretion. The remuneration framework was developed to strengthen and simplify AMP’s overall approach to remuneration 
and work effectively within the context of AMP’s strategic transformation. With the variable pay and extensive deferral included in the 
awards, emphasis is placed on the shareholder experience and compliance with regulatory frameworks and guidelines, including the 
Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR). Effective from financial year 2023, the remuneration framework has been further 
enhanced to meet the requirements of APRA Prudential Standard CPS 511 (CPS 511) and strengthen the overall alignment with the 
interests of our stakeholders. Refer to Section 1.5 for further information.

1.4 ACTUAL REMUNERATION REALISED IN 2022

Under AMP’s remuneration framework in 2022, executives are eligible to receive a mix of fixed remuneration, STI (delivered 60% in cash 
and 40% deferred in share rights, aligned with the 2023 framework, see Section 1.5) and LTI (delivered 100% in performance rights). 

The table below sets out the actual remuneration received during 2022 for those executives who were deemed KMP as at 31 December 
2022 and the market value of any equity awarded in prior years (either as deferred STI and/or LTI) vesting during 2022. 

This information differs from the statutory remuneration table which presents remuneration in accordance with Australian Accounting 
Standards. Statutory disclosures are included in Section 7.1.

1 Fixed remuneration (FR) includes superannuation and salary sacrificed benefits and reflects the time in role during 2022. 

2 Cash STI paid during the relevant year is based on outcomes related to the applicable year’s performance and reflected for the relevant reporting period.  
Cash STI represents the portion of the total STI awarded to be paid as cash in March 2023. As outlined in Section 3.2, the board have decided to withhold a portion 
of the cash STI which will only be released upon the commencement of the second tranche of the capital return, therefore this amount has been excluded from 
this table. The remaining 40% of the STI award will be deferred in share rights in April 2023.

3 In 2021, James Georgeson received in October 2021 a cash payment as a part of the Portfolio Review retention awards granted in 2020. In 2021, the CEO Alexis 
George received sign-on cash to the value of $732,500 in December 2021. Full details of the sign-on awards are provided in the 2021 Remuneration Report.

4 The value of vested equity awards was calculated based on the units which vested multiplied by the five-day volume weighted average price (VWAP)  
up to and including the vesting date of each award. The amounts disclosed includes the portion of Alexis George’s sign-on awards that vested during 2022 
and 2021. 

5 No LTI equity awards were performance tested or vested during 2022 or 2021.

6 Other benefits may include non-monetary benefits and any related FBT exempt and FBT payable benefits, excluding salary sacrificed benefits.

7 The FR for Nicola Rimmer-Hollyman reflects her current KMP and prior non-KMP role.

1.5 LOOKING TO 2023

Executive Remuneration Framework for 2023
In 2021, APRA released the remuneration prudential standard CPS 511 which AMP is required to comply with from 1 January 2023. CPS 511 
is designed to heighten the governance requirements on entities’ remuneration arrangements in response to remuneration practices in the 
financial services industry that have been a factor driving poor consumer outcomes. 

In ensuring AMP complies with the new requirements, the Board has undertaken a comprehensive review of its approach to executive 
remuneration and governance. As a part of that process, we have extensively engaged with a broad range of stakeholders including APRA, 
shareholder advisory service firms and our largest shareholders (representing approximately 20% of issued capital). These meetings 
were held over the second half of 2022, to seek feedback and consider opportunities to further enhance the effectiveness of the KMP 
remuneration structure. Over the consultation period, 13 stakeholder meetings were held in total. 

Following the completion of that review and in line with the requirements of CPS 511, we made the following changes to the executive 
remuneration framework that applies to the CEO and Executive Committee (which includes the Executive KMP), effective 1 January 2023.

No change

1 The changes to the STI Award Mix and Deferral Period were also applied to 2022 outcomes.

CPS 511 sets out minimum deferral periods for specified roles, including the CEO and Senior Managers, which corresponds 
to AMP’s Executive Committee level. For the CEO, CPS 511 requires that at least 60% of the CEO’s total variable reward 
(ie. across STI and LTI) must be deferred over a minimum deferral period of six years, vesting no faster than on a pro-rata 
basis and only after four years. For Senior Managers (which is equivalent to AMP’s Executive Committee level), CPS 511 
requires at least 40% of the total variable reward be deferred over a minimum deferral period of five years, vesting 
no faster than on a pro-rata basis and only after four years. Having longer deferral periods reflects the length of time, 
risk and conduct issues can take to appear and crystallise. 

Rationale

The balance between cash and equity, and the vesting period of deferred remuneration, has been adjusted. In light of the other 
changes we have made to our framework (see LTI below), the cash and equity balance has been revised so that our remuneration 
framework remains market competitive and keeps our current executives engaged and motivated. With the final CPS 511 standard 
being released and confirmation of our approach to LTI, we have adjusted both the cash and equity mix, and the STI vesting periods 
to apply to remuneration that is deferred and granted from 1 January 2023 (ie. the STI changes were also applied to the 2022 
outcomes). These changes have been considered in totality with the other changes made.

Rationale

LTI metrics

Financial 100% Financial 70% 

CPS 511 requires that total variable reward must give material weight to non-financial measures. The Board considered a range 
of potential LTI measures and concluded that Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR), adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth 
and Reputation are appropriate measures for driving long term sustainable performance. The Board has selected these measures 
for the following reasons:

 – RTSR: The board considers RTSR to be an appropriate measure as it provides a robust measure of AMP management’s 
financial performance and returns for shareholders in comparison to other companies. Being a relative measure it 
normalises against the rise and fall of the market. The RTSR peer group has been expanded to cover S&P ASX200 Financials 
ex A-REITs, as the Board considers this a more appropriate peer group given the reduction in the size of the company post 
the sales of the AMP Capital businesses, our current market capitalisation and who we compete with in the financial 
services industry.

 – EPS Growth: In response to several stakeholders’ feedback regarding a long-term return measure, EPS has been introduced. 
The board are of the view that EPS Growth is an appropriate proxy for measuring intrinsic long-term shareholder value 
creation. In introducing EPS Growth, management are assessed on their direct financial contribution.

 – Reputation: The board is highly cognisant of the shareholder experience over recent years, which has been impacted 
by organisational instability, poor customer experiences and reputation related events, which have impacted on AMP’s 
reputation and share price. Rebuilding trust with our stakeholders and restoring the AMP brand remains paramount. The 
board has selected reputation as a measure for the LTI, measured using external data provided by RepTrak, an independent 
company that measures brand reputation and sentiment through surveying members of the community. This can include 
AMP customers, shareholders and employees at any given time. The RepTrak measure tracks corporate reputation across 
a broad range of areas, including scores for ESG performance, products and services, corporate citizenship, conduct, 
workplace, leadership and innovation. With risk and conduct being a key consideration under CPS 511, measuring our 
reputation provides an all encompassing measure of brand awareness, our contribution to society and shareholder wealth 
creation. RepTrak has been a part of the AMP Scorecard for STI purposes for the past couple of years and is measured 
on an absolute basis in the STI. 

In order to meet the requirements of a material weighting to non-financial measures in CPS 511, the board also included 
a RepTrak measure for LTI purposes, measured on a relative basis to track the long-term improvement in our score relative 
to the chosen comparator group. This ensures that management’s performance is measured on a basis that removes the 
impacts and/or influences of the market (ie. removing the likelihood of a scenario where favourable market factors benefit 
all market participants). Including RepTrak in both the STI and LTI ensures that management are focused on both absolute 
and relative performance.

In selecting the performance measures that apply to the LTI, the board also considered a broad range of metrics but ultimately 
determined that RTSR, adjusted EPS Growth and the recovery of our reputation and rebuilding trust with our shareholders, 
customers and the community is a key enabler to long-term sustainable business performance and shareholder value creation.

Targets

Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR)
35% of the 2023 LTI award will be determined based on AMP’s Compound Average Growth Rate (CAGR) in Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to a peer group of ASX 200 financial companies excluding A-REITs, as at 1 January 2023. 
RTSR performance is tested over a three-year performance period from 1 January 2023 through to 31 December 2025.

The performance rights will vest according to the following vesting schedule:

CAGR TSR performance Proportion of LTI grant vesting

AMP’s TSR ranking below the 50th percentile of the peer group 0%

AMP’s TSR ranking at the 50th percentile of the peer group 50%

AMP’s TSR ranking between the 50th and 75th  
percentile of the peer group

Straight-line vesting from 50% to 100%  
(rounded to nearest whole percentile)

AMP’s TSR ranking is at least at the 75th percentile of the peer group 100%

The board considers RTSR to be an appropriate measure as it provides a robust measure of AMP’s financial performance 
and returns for shareholders in comparison to other companies. Being a relative measure, it normalises against the rise 
and fall of the market. The RTSR peer group for the 2023 LTI award has been expanded to cover S&P ASX200 Financials 
excluding A-REITs. 

The peer group consists of the following organisations:

Peer group as at 1 January 2023 S&P ASX200 Financials excluding A-REITs

AMP Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Insignia Financial National Australia Bank QBE Insurance
ANZ Bank Challenger Insurance Australia Group Netwealth Group Steadfast 
ASX Commonwealth Bank Macquarie Group nib holdings Suncorp
AUB Group Credit Corp Group Magellan Financial Group Perpetual Virgin Money UK PLC

Bank of Queensland HUB24 Medibank Pinnacle Investment 
Management Westpac

The board considers this an appropriate peer group given the reduction in the size of the company upon completion 
of the sales of the AMP Capital businesses, our current market capitalisation, and our competitors in the financial 
services industry.

Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS)
35% of the 2023 LTI award will be determined based on AMP’s Compound Average Growth Rate (CAGR) in AMP’s Adjusted 
EPS. EPS is calculated by dividing the AMP’s adjusted net profit after tax for the relevant reporting period by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares of AMP during the period. The underlying net profit after tax may be adjusted by the 
board, where appropriate, to better reflect underlying performance and remove one-off gains and losses. EPS performance 
is tested over a three-year performance period from 1 January 2023 through to 31 December 2025. The performance rights 
will vest according to the following vesting schedule:

CAGR EPS performance Proportion of LTI grant vesting

AMP’s EPS below 4% per annum 0%

AMP’s EPS at 4% per annum 50%

AMP’s EPS from 4% to 8% per annum Straight-line vesting from 50% to 100%  
(rounded to nearest whole percentile)

AMP’s EPS above 8% per annum 100%

The targets are set based on market norms and expectations for EPS growth. The board are of the view that the targets 
set are robust, sufficiently challenging and in line with our shareholders’ interests and expectations.

Future 2023

1.5 LOOKING TO 2023 continued

Reputation
30% of the 2023 LTI award will be determined based on AMP’s RepTrak Score improvement relative to a subset of 15 
organisations positioned similarly to AMP in RepTrak’s Benchmark 60 Index, as at 1 January 2023. The RepTrak Benchmark 
60 index is a group of organisations RepTrak has been measuring consistently over a long period of time, selected based 
on revenue and market presence. AMP’s RepTrak performance will be tested over a three-year performance period from 1 
January 2023 through to 31 December 2025. As at 1 January 2023, the RepTrak score for AMP is 57.8 and will be used as the 
starting point for testing purposes.

The performance rights will vest according to the following vesting schedule:

RepTrak Score Improvement Proportion of LTI grant vesting

AMP’s RepTrak improvement below the 50th percentile of the peer group 0%

AMP’s RepTrak improvement at the 50th percentile of the peer group 50%

AMP’s RepTrak improvement ranking between the 50th and 75th 
percentile of the peer group

Straight-line vesting from 50% to 100%  
(rounded to nearest whole percentile)

AMP’s RepTrak improvement ranking above the 75th percentile 100%

The comparator group for measuring RepTrak improvement consists of the following organisations:

Peer Group Companies

AGL Energy Australian Taxation Office National Australia Bank Optus RioTinto

Alinta Commonwealth Bank NBNCo Origin Telstra

ANZ Bank Medibank Private News Corp Australia Reserve Bank of Australia Westpac

The selection of organisations that form the comparator group have been carefully considered. The board is of the view 
that a meaningful movement in reputation is best measured by how we perform against a comparator group that includes 
a reasonable representation of financial services organisations and organisations from across industries. This is in line with our 
aspiration to be a trusted brand and continue focusing on our contribution to society. Therefore, it is appropriate to compare our 
reputation against a broader set of organisations.

2023 scorecard
For 2023, we have listened to market feedback regarding increasing the weighting of financial objectives to 40% focused on profitability. 
In addition, we have sought to strike the right balance between financial and non-financial objectives, yet maintain a material weighting 
to non-financial measures in total variable reward as required by CPS 511. This is partly achieved by having an appropriate weighting 
of financial and non-financial measures in the 2023 scorecard. While the key result areas remain consistent for 2023, their respective 
weightings, along with the objectives and measures, have changed. The scorecard ensures clarity and alignment of collective goals and 
increases focus on the successful achievement of our critical objectives and financial outcomes.

SECTION REMUNERATION STRATEGY AND FRAMEWORK

2.1 REMUNERATION STRATEGY

The goal of the AMP remuneration strategy is to align performance, prudent risk management and reward outcomes. It is designed to support 
the attraction, retention and reward of high-performing talent required to deliver strong customer outcomes, sustained returns to shareholders 
and foster an environment where our employees can thrive. At the beginning of each year the board sets the scorecard for the year to support 
the achievement of the business strategy. The scorecard consists of five key strategic priorities as outlined below and the board determines 
the appropriate objectives, metrics and targets. Business unit scorecards are aligned to AMP priorities and performance is assessed on overall, 
business unit, team and individual goals. Outcomes awarded under our remuneration framework reflect both what our strategy seeks 
to deliver and how it is delivered, as performance assessment explicitly considers not only the strategic priorities delivered but also relies 
on the visible demonstration of our desired culture, purpose and values, and conduct expectations. The remuneration principles provide AMP 
with the flexibility to address the challenges in attracting and retaining talent, remaining competitive and differentiating for performance. 
These principles are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain fit for purpose and will be used by the board in annual assessments 
of the effectiveness of AMP’s remuneration strategy and framework.

2.2 REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK

Remuneration mix
A significant portion of total remuneration is deferred to reflect the need to balance the reward, retention and motivation of executives 
whilst aligning to shareholder experience and long-term value creation. By deferring variable reward, executives are held accountable 
(individually or collectively) over the long term as the board has the ability, if appropriate, to adjust past, present and future remuneration 
downwards through clawback and malus (refer to sections 4.2 and 4.3 for further information). The remuneration mix for the CEO and 
Executive Committee members (excluding the CRO) at maximum opportunity delivers 75% of total remuneration as variable reward 
and ‘at risk’ remuneration. The CRO’s remuneration mix is different to the other Executive Committee members in order to maintain the 
independence of the role and safeguard against any conflicts of interest in carrying out the risk control function across the organisation.

outcome

STI outcomes are determined with reference to the holistic performance of AMP and the AMP incentive pool, and 
Executive KMP individual performance and behaviours. The AMP incentive pool is determined by the Board based on:

 – A scorecard comprising financials, strategy, customer, people priorities and objectives that supports AMP’s risk 
management framework. 

 – Other outcomes including shareholder value creation.
 – Behaviour in line with AMP’s values, conduct and risk appetite.

The board considers both the achievement of the risk metrics as well as a risk overview when determining the 
incentive pool.

DELIVERY 60% of the STI award is delivered as cash and 40% is deferred into equity. 1

Deferred STI is delivered as conditional share rights that represents the right to receive a fully-paid ordinary AMP 
share for nil consideration subject to continued employment at the time of vesting.

FORFEITURE (MALUS) The board has the ability to adjust and lapse unvested equity (including downwards to zero) in a range 
of circumstances, such as protecting financial soundness or responding to unexpected or unintended 
consequences that were unforeseen (such as material risk management breaches, unexpected financial losses, 
reputational damage or regulatory non-compliance). Refer to section 4.3 for further information on how the 
board considers adjusting remuneration for material risk and conduct events.

3 The average STI received by Executive KMP excludes Shawn Johnson who is eligible for 1.2% of AMP Capital modified profit pro rated for time in role 
and does not represent a percentage of a STI opportunity. The average STI outcome is higher in 2022 than 2021, as this table reflects the KMP as at the 
reporting date and due to a smaller KMP cohort for 2022, the average is higher.

Strategy

Bank experienced good growth during 
the year, however in response to market 
conditions, we focused on sustainable 
growth rather than pursue a mortgage 
book growth target at the cost of 
profitability. 

Our North platform is increasing the 
percentage of cash flows from the 
independent financial adviser market 
and we have made good progress in our 
financial advice business, as we continue 
the repositioning of the business as a 
professional services provider to aligned 
financial advisers. 

As a result of our strengthened capital 
position, we commenced the return of 
$1.1b to shareholders. We completed 
$267m of an announced $350m 
on-market buy-backs, with further 
capital return to take place subject to 
shareholder and regulatory approval. 
In 2022, we continued to control costs 
and delivered against our three-year 
cost out transformation objective. 

Commence second tranche of 
capital return

macroeconomic environment, the continuing impacts of the pandemic and the decision to sell AMP Capital 
infrastructure and real estate businesses rather than pursue a demerger. The board determined an incentive 
pool of 70%. However, considering the results achieved under the CEO and Executive Committee’s stewardship, 
the board have applied discretion and awarded an additional 15% that will be withheld (against the cash 
portion of the STI) until the commencement of the second tranche of capital return.  This reflects the need 
to balance the reward, retention and motivation of employees whilst recognising and aligning to shareholder 
experience over the period. In arriving at a decision, the board especially considered progress on:

 – Shareholder value creation – AMP’s total 
shareholder return over the past 12 months 
was +30.2%.

 – Portfolio strategy – significant progress on 
simplifying the portfolio, repositioning our core 
businesses in wealth management and retail 
banking and progress in executing the AMP 
Capital divestment strategy.

 – Improving risk management and customer 
satisfaction, notwithstanding ongoing 
transformation and transactions.

 – Improving employee engagement to 73,

3.3 ADJUSTMENT PRINCIPLES

The board may, in its absolute discretion, adjust outcomes where an event occurs that means the targets of the relevant scorecard 
objective are no longer appropriate. Situations where this discretion to adjust can be applied include:

 – Material change to the strategic business plan.
 – Material regulatory or legislative change.
 – Material changes in external market or natural disasters.
 – Significant out of plan business development such as acquisitions and divestments.

Adjustments should reflect the holistic contribution of employees/Executive KMP and exclude significant costs or gains that were 
unforeseen, were not in the ordinary course of business or were not the direct result of Executive KMP efforts. For 2022, no adjustments 
were made to any of the outcomes for the metrics making up the 2022 scorecard. The board did exercise discretion in determining the pool, 
refer to section 3.2 for further information.

3.4 EXECUTIVE AND EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE AND CONTRIBUTION

For the Executive Committee, performance is assessed based on AMP and their business unit scorecards. In this way, an executive’s 
performance is aligned to both company and their individual business unit performance. Their individual performance, conduct and how 
they demonstrate the values is also considered when determining the individual STI outcome. For all other employees, their performance 
assessment reflects achievement against agreed goals and objectives set based on the AMP key result areas combined with consideration 
of risk management, values and conduct in line with the performance management process and Code of Conduct. An individual’s incentive 
opportunity and performance rating determine the portion of the incentive pool allocated to them.

3.5 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES AWARDED

the capital return.

SECTION REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE

4.1 GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

There are a number of remuneration governance and oversight processes in place at AMP, primarily exercised through the AMP Limited 
Board, subsidiary boards and the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee assists the various boards to fulfil their 
remuneration obligations by developing, monitoring and assessing remuneration strategy, policies and practices across AMP. Members 
of the Remuneration Committee are independent non-executive directors. More information on the role of the Remuneration Committee 
can be found in the corporate governance section of AMP’s website. The board believes that to make prudent remuneration decisions, 
it needs both a robust framework and the ability to exercise judgement. Therefore, the board has adopted a remuneration adjustment 
framework to guide the board in determining the appropriate remuneration outcomes. Refer to Section 4.3 for further information on the 
remuneration adjustment guideline. From time to time the Remuneration Committee may seek external guidance or benchmarking 
information from independent remuneration advisers. Any advice provided by external advisers is used as a guide and is not a substitute 
for consideration of all the issues by each non-executive director of the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee did 
not engage any independent remuneration advisers who provided remuneration recommendations, as defined in the Corporations Act. 
The following diagram outlines AMP’s remuneration governance framework.

REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

AMP SUBSIDIARY BOARDSAMP LIMITED BOARD

4.2 RISK MANAGEMENT IN REMUNERATION

The board has a range of mechanisms available to adjust remuneration and incentive outcomes to reflect behavioural, risk or compliance 
outcomes. The table below summarises the range of mechanisms available and their intended operation.

Risk assessment Risk and conduct outcomes Malus and clawback provisions Board discretion 

Enterprise and business unit levels All employees All incentive plans

The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) 
reports at each of the standing 
Remuneration Committee 
meetings, the overall 
assessment of risk management 
at the conclusion of the 
performance year as an input 
to the determination of the 
incentive pool.

At the conclusion of each 
performance year, the Chair 
of the Risk and Compliance 
Committee (who is also a member 
of the Remuneration Committee) 
provides an overview of the key 
issues considered by the Risk and 
Compliance Committee that are 
likely to be relevant to assessing 
the remuneration outcomes 
for the CEO and Executive 
Committee members by the 
Remuneration Committee. 

Employees’ risk 
management behaviour 
and conduct is specifically 
considered as part of their 
performance assessment 
and in the determination 
of remuneration outcomes.

The consequence 
management framework 
ensures that behaviour which 
does not meet expectations 
is actively and consistently 
managed, including 
adjustments to past, present 
and future remuneration 
if appropriate.

Allows the board to adjust and 
lapse (malus) unvested equity 
awards or reclaim (clawback) 
vested incentives in certain 
circumstances.

All deferred incentives are 
subject to a conduct and risk 
review before vesting.

This applies to current and 
former employees.

The board may 
apply its absolute 
discretion to adjust 
past, present and 
future remuneration, 
subject to the equity 
incentive plan rules 
governing the plan 
and in compliance 
with the relevant 
policies.

It does this in line with 
the remuneration 
adjustment 
framework to provide 
greater consistency 
in remuneration 
adjustments (refer 
to section 4.3 below).

The board exercises discretion to apply remuneration consequences to executives with overall accountability for matters arising 
in their business units with adverse risk, customer and/or reputational impacts. There is a standing agenda item at each Remuneration 
Committee for the CRO to present any risk related information the Committee should consider when making remuneration decisions. 
This also gives the Remuneration Committee an opportunity to make enquiries and have unfettered access to risk and internal audit 
executives. The Remuneration Committee considers both the achievement of the risk metrics as well as a risk overview when determining 
the incentive pool. Before every equity vesting event, management provides a report to the Committee to highlight if there is any reason, 
including risk considerations, why the Committee should exercise its discretion to lapse the unvested equity award.

AMP’s consequence management framework was strengthened in 2021 and again in 2022 to align with best practice management 
of sexual harassment, other misconduct matters, and due to the implementation of CPS 511. AMP has a Consequence Management 
Committee (CMC), which was established to ensure consistent management of workplace conduct matters and application of AMP’s 
Consequence Management policy. The CMC comprises the CEO, Chief People Officer and Chief Risk Officer as standing members. Statistics 
and insights on all conduct cases across AMP Limited are reported to the Risk and Compliance Committee on a biannual basis, following 
review by the CMC. Under the consequence management framework, all substantiated cases of misconduct require the application 
of a management and/or remuneration consequence. Where there is a recommendation from People & Culture (and as endorsed by the 
CMC) to apply malus or clawback of past remuneration as a part of the recommended remuneration consequence, submissions are made 
to the Remuneration Committee to exercise its discretion to lapse the unvested equity award.

During the year there were no conduct matters related to executives that needed to be taken into account in relation to 2022 performance. 
However, there were a number of conduct matters related to other employees that were substantiated and resulted in the application 
of formal consequences. At the time of this report, the annual remuneration review process is about to commence for employees (not 
including the Executive KMP), where conduct performance will be factored into any remuneration decisions.

While 2022 presented many challenges from a people perspective, including a competitive talent market and ongoing COVID related issues, 
total substantiated misconduct cases were lower in 2022 than the previous two years. This is a positive outcome and is largely driven by the 
work completed to uplift leadership training and enhanced communication of conduct expectations. Senior leadership continues to play 
an important role in setting the tone, driving cultural transformation and prioritising improvements to the level of support made available 
to employees as part of increased speak up channels.

However, there were a number of conduct matters related to other employees that were substantiated and resulted in the application 
of formal consequences. At the time of this report, the annual remuneration review process is about to commence for employees (not 
including the Executive KMP), where conduct performance will be factored into any remuneration decisions.

While 2022 presented many challenges from a people perspective, including a competitive talent market and ongoing COVID related issues, 
total substantiated misconduct cases were lower in 2022 than the previous two years. This is a positive outcome and is largely driven by the 
work completed to uplift leadership training and enhanced communication of conduct expectations. Senior leadership continues to play 
an important role in setting the tone, driving cultural transformation and prioritising improvements to the level of support made available 
to employees as part of increased speak up channels.

4.3 REMUNERATION ADJUSTMENT GUIDELINES

The board has adopted a remuneration adjustment framework to provide guidance in exercising discretion related to past, present and 
future remuneration and to provide greater consistency in remuneration adjustments. The framework is considered at each remuneration 
decision point to identify whether there have been any material conduct or risk events that have impacted on shareholder experience, 
the reputation of the company or led to disciplinary action from our regulators.

This tool is intended to help the AMP Board in making potential downward adjustments to variable remuneration. It is not intended to be used 
as a prescriptive or formulaic decision tree, as board judgement will always need to be applied according to the facts and circumstances 
of a particular situation. Whilst the framework is designed to deal with material risk and conduct events, the board can also exercise its 
discretion to apply positive adjustments if appropriate.

The following chart is an example of the types of qualitative and quantitative indicators the board may consider in exercising discretion 
in relation to material conduct and risk events.

SECTION EXECUTIVE SHAREHOLDINGS AND CONTRACTS

5.1 EXECUTIVE MINIMUM SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENTS

The relevant amount of AMP equity required to be held by the Executive Committee (which includes the Executive KMP) under minimum 
shareholding policy and the time to comply is as follows:

Category Fixed pay Timeframe Securities included to meet requirement

CEO 200% Executive KMP are expected to 
achieve the minimum shareholding 
requirement within a five-year period 
from commencement in their role 

AMP Limited shares: Ordinary AMP Limited 
shares registered in the Executive KMP’s name 
or a related party 
AMP share rights: Granted to executives through 
AMP’s employee share plans

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES AND 
SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENTS

6.1 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES

The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing Non-Executive Director (NED) fees for AMP Limited and its main subsidiaries. In 
reviewing these fees, the Remuneration Committee has regard to a range of factors including the complexity of AMP’s operations and those of 
its main subsidiaries, fees paid to board members of other Australian corporations of a similar size and complexity, and the responsibilities and 
workload requirements of each board and committee. The Remuneration Committee obtains market data and recommends any proposed fee 
changes to the AMP Limited Board for approval. 

The total amount of NED fees paid is capped at a maximum aggregate fee pool approved by shareholders. The current fee pool is $4.620m, 
which was approved by shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting (AGM). The total remuneration earned by AMP Limited NEDs during 
2022 was $2.264m, which represents 49.0% of the annual fee pool compared with 56.2% earned in 2021. This represents an overall 12.8% cost 
reduction in aggregate NED fee spend year on year. 

Between 1 January to 30 September 2022, all AMP non-executive directors continued to be members of each standing committee. This was 
to ensure that all non-executive directors were sufficiently well informed of the matters presented to the committees by management and 
advisers as AMP traversed significant and time-sensitive strategic and business transformation matters. A review of the board committee 
structure was conducted in mid-2022 and the board determined it was reasonable to reduce the number of members for each standing 
committee (other than the Nomination committee) as the transformation initiatives had stabilised. The changes were effected on 1 October 
2022 and these changes resulted in a further reduction in the total fees paid to directors from that date, continuing the progressive reduction 
in director fees since 2019 by a total of 40.4%. The current members and role of each standing committee as at the date of this statement are 
set out in the Corporate governance statement. 

As part of the committee structure review, AMP’s board established two advisory groups for an initial six-month period to support and 
promote AMP’s key strategic enablers. These advisory groups are tasked to conduct workshops and deep dives with management with their 
key focus on ESG & sustainability and technology transformation. The fee structure of the advisory groups is provided below.

6.2 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MINIMUM SHAREHOLDING

The minimum shareholding requirement (MSR) for NEDs is set out in AMP’s minimum shareholding policy. Under this policy, NEDs are 
required to accumulate and hold a minimum value of AMP shares to ensure their interests are closely aligned with the long term interests 
of AMP shareholders. For the purposes of determining whether the minimum shareholding has been met, the value of each share held 
by a NED will be the share price at the time the share was acquired. As at the date of this report, these minimum values are:

 – AMP Limited Chair: $561,000 – the equivalent of the AMP Limited Chair base fee.
 – Other AMP Limited NEDs: $204,000 – the equivalent of the AMP Limited NED base fee.

NEDs are ordinarily expected to achieve these levels within four years of their appointment, see Section 6.3. The policy expects NEDs to apply 
at least 25% of their base fee each year to acquire AMP shares until the MSR has been met. NEDs are also encouraged to increase their ownership 
over their tenure. Any such acquisition of AMP shares may only occur when permitted to do so in accordance with AMP’s Trading Policy. Between 
2019 and 2022, opportunities for NEDs to acquire shares during the trading windows in accordance with AMP’s Trading Policy were limited due 
to the on-going transactions, including the sale of AMP Life, portfolio review and sales of AMP Capital businesses. In 2022, NEDs have been able 
to increase their share ownership and have either met the MSR as at 31 December 2022, or are within the four-year period to achieve the MSR. 

6.3 SECURITIES HELD BY NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

The following table details the shareholdings and movements in those shareholdings in AMP Limited held directly, indirectly or beneficially 
by NEDs or their related parties during the year and as at 31 December 2022. For this purpose, a NED’s related parties are their close family 
members (as defined in the applicable accounting standard) and any entities over which the NED (or a close family member) has control, 
joint control or significant influence (whether direct or indirect).

Remuneration report
68

1 Cash salary is inclusive of base salary and short-term compensated absences, less superannuation deductions.

2 Cash STI for 2022 reflects 60% of STI award outcome for the performance year for Executive KMP. As outlined in Section 3.2, the Board have withheld a 
portion of the cash STI which will only be paid upon the commencement of the second tranche of the capital return. For a breakdown of these amounts, 
refer to the table 3.5.

3 Other short-term benefits include non-monetary benefits and any related FBT exempt benefits and FBT payable benefits, for example car parking and leasing 
arrangements, insurances, professional memberships and subscriptions, employee referral bonuses, vouchers and the net change in annual leave accrued.

4 The values in the table reflect the current year expense for all share rights and performance rights outstanding at any point during the year. It is based on 
the fair value of each award which takes into consideration a number of factors, including the likelihood of achieving market-based vesting conditions such 
as total shareholder return. The cost of the award is amortised over the vesting period and updated at each reporting period for changes in the number of 
instruments that are expected to vest. For James Georgeson, as a result of his employment ending with AMP, the share-based payment expense reflects 
the acceleration of amounts that were expected to be amortised in future periods. For Phil Pakes, the negative value is due to the reversal of previously 
recognised expenses for awards that have lapsed.

5 Other long-term benefits represent the net change in long service leave accrued.

6 The termination payment for Phil Pakes includes five months' notice.

7 The total in this table for 2021 of $12.770 million is different to the total for 2021 in the 2021 Remuneration Report as it does not include $7.605 million 
for Francesco De Ferrari (former Chief Executive Officer, AMP) and $4.979 million for Helen Livesey (former Group Executive, People and Corporate Affairs), 
reported in the 2021 Remuneration Report.

8 For David Cullen, Rebecca Nash, Shawn Johnson and Nicola Rimmer-Hollyman, the amounts disclosed in this table have been prorated to reflect their KMP period.

9 Shawn Johnson has points in AMP Capital carried interest arrangements. This is a form of performance fee funded by investors and standard market 
practice for closed end funds. No carried interest was realised and paid in 2022. 

10 After the release of the 2021 Remuneration Report, Phil Pakes resigned from AMP and forfeited his 2021 STI.

ROUNDING
In accordance with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Corporations Instrument 2016/191, amounts in this directors’ 
report and the accompanying financial report have been rounded off to the nearest million Australian dollars, unless stated otherwise.

NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Audit Committee has reviewed details of the amounts paid or payable to the auditor for non-audit services provided to the AMP 
group during the year ended 31 December 2022, by the company’s auditor, EY.

The directors are satisfied that the provision of those non-audit services by the auditor is compatible with the general standard 
of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and did not compromise the auditor independence requirements 
of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:

 – all non-audit assignments were approved by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), or his nominated delegate, or the Chair of the 
Audit Committee;

 – no non-audit assignments were carried out which were specifically excluded by the AMP Charter of Audit Independence; and
 – the proportion of non-audit fees to audit fees paid to EY, as disclosed in note 6.5 to the financial report is not considered significant 

enough to compromise EY’s independence or cause a perception of compromise.

Signed in accordance with a resolution of the directors.

ABOUT THIS REPORT 

This section outlines the structure of the AMP group, information useful to understand the 
AMP group’s financial report and the basis on which the financial report has been prepared.

(a) Understanding the AMP financial report
The AMP group (AMP) is comprised of AMP Limited (the parent), a holding company incorporated and domiciled in Australia, and the 
entities it controls (subsidiaries or controlled entities). The consolidated financial statements of AMP Limited include the financial 
information of its controlled entities.

The consolidated financial report:
 – is a general purpose financial report;
 – has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards, including 

Australian Accounting Interpretations adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board; 

 – is presented in Australian dollars with all values rounded to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated; 
 – has been prepared on a going concern basis generally using a historical cost basis; however where permitted under accounting 

standards a different basis may be used, including the fair value basis; 
 – presents assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated statement of financial position in decreasing order of liquidity and

and committed sponsor stakes in the platform for cash consideration expected to be approximately $94m (final consideration based 
on valuation at completion). The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. The results of this business have been classified as 
discontinued operations in the Consolidated income statement (refer to note 5.2) and its assets and liabilities have been separately 
classified as held for sale in the Consolidated statement of financial position. The gain or loss on disposal will be included in the results

ABOUT THIS REPORT 

This section outlines the structure of the AMP group, information useful to understand the 
AMP group’s financial report and the basis on which the financial report has been prepared.

(a) Understanding the AMP financial report
The AMP group (AMP) is comprised of AMP Limited (the parent), a holding company incorporated and domiciled in Australia, and the 
entities it controls (subsidiaries or controlled entities). The consolidated financial statements of AMP Limited include the financial 
information of its controlled entities.

The consolidated financial report:
 – is a general purpose financial report;
 – has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards, including 

Australian Accounting Interpretations adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board; 

 – is presented in Australian dollars with all values rounded to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated; 
 – has been prepared on a going concern basis generally using a historical cost basis; however where permitted under accounting 

standards a different basis may be used, including the fair value basis; 
 – presents assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated statement of financial position in decreasing order of liquidity and 

therefore does not distinguish between current and non-current items; 
 – presents reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current year’s presentation within the 

financial report, including restated comparative information to reflect the impact of discontinued operations as detailed in note 5.2.

AMP Limited is a for-profit entity and is limited by shares. The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 were authorised 
for issue on 16 February 2023 in accordance with a resolution of the directors.

Subsequent to that announcement, and as part of AMP’s divestment strategy, AMP announced a series of sales transactions, which 
includes AMP Capital’s private markets investment management business and other AMP Capital businesses (collectively AMP Capital 
businesses). The residual investments of AMP Capital (China Life AMP Management Company Ltd (CLAMP), Pacific Coast Capital Partners 
(PCCP) and certain seed and sponsor investments) will remain a part of the AMP group. These transactions and their impact on AMP’s 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 are as follows: 

 – On 11 February 2022, AMP completed the sale of its infrastructure debt platform to Ares Holdings LP. The results relating to the

(b) Basis of consolidation 
Entities are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the AMP group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that control ceases. Control exists where the AMP group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of controlled entities are consolidated into the AMP group financial statements, 
along with those attributable to the shareholders of the parent entity. All inter-company transactions are eliminated in full, including 
unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions.

The share of the net assets of controlled entities attributable to non-controlling interests is disclosed as a separate line item on the 
Consolidated statement of financial position. 

Materiality 
Information has only been included in the financial report to the extent that it has been considered material and relevant to the 
understanding of the financial statements. A disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example:

 – the amount in question is significant because of its size or nature;
 – it is important for understanding the results of the AMP group;
 – it helps explain the impact of significant changes in the AMP group; and/or
 – it relates to an aspect of the AMP group’s operations that is important to its future performance. 

(c) Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are contained in the notes to the financial statements 
to which they relate. All accounting policies have been consistently applied to the current year and comparative period, unless otherwise 
stated. Where an accounting policy relates to more than one note or where no note is provided, the accounting policies are set out below.

Interest, dividend and distribution income
Interest income measured at amortised cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement using the effective interest method. 
Revenue from dividends and distributions is recognised when the AMP group’s right to receive payment is established. 

Foreign currency transactions
Transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars (the functional currency) using 
the following applicable exchange rates: 

Foreign currency amount Applicable exchange rate

Transactions Date of transaction 

Monetary assets and liabilities Reporting date

Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value Date fair value is determined 

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign exchange transactions are recognised in the Consolidated income 
statement, except for qualifying cash flow hedges, which are deferred to equity.

On consolidation the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the following 
applicable exchange rates: 

Foreign currency amount Applicable exchange rate

Income and expenses Average exchange rate 

Assets and liabilities Reporting date 

Equity Historical date

Reserves Reporting date

Foreign exchange differences resulting from translation of foreign operations are initially recognised in the foreign currency translation 
reserve and subsequently transferred to the Consolidated income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.

1.1 SEGMENT PERFORMANCE CONTINUED

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Revenue from contracts with customers
For AMP, revenue from contracts with customers arises primarily from the provision of investment management and financial advisory 
services. Revenue is recognised when control of services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration which 
AMP is entitled to in exchange for the services provided. As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the service 
is provided, control is transferred over time. Accordingly, revenue is recognised over time. 

Fee rebates provided to customers are recognised as a reduction in fee revenue. 

Investment management and related fees
Fees are charged to customers in connection with the provision of investment management and other related services. These performance 
obligations are satisfied on an ongoing basis, usually daily, and revenue is recognised as the service is provided.

Financial advisory fees 
Financial advisory fees consist of fee-for-service revenue and commission income which are earned for providing customers with financial advice 
and performing related advisory services. These performance obligations are satisfied over time. Accordingly, revenue is recognised over time.

A substantial majority of the financial advisory fees received are paid to advisers. Financial advisory fees are presented gross of the related 
cost which is presented in Fees and commission expenses in the Consolidated income statement.

1.1 SEGMENT PERFORMANCE CONTINUED

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Revenue from contracts with customers
For AMP, revenue from contracts with customers arises primarily from the provision of investment management and financial advisory 
services. Revenue is recognised when control of services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration which 
AMP is entitled to in exchange for the services provided. As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the service 
is provided, control is transferred over time. Accordingly, revenue is recognised over time. 

Fee rebates provided to customers are recognised as a reduction in fee revenue. 

Investment management and related fees
Fees are charged to customers in connection with the provision of investment management and other related services. These performance 
obligations are satisfied on an ongoing basis, usually daily, and revenue is recognised as the service is provided.

Financial advisory fees 
Financial advisory fees consist of fee-for-service revenue and commission income which are earned for providing customers with financial advice 
and performing related advisory services. These performance obligations are satisfied over time. Accordingly, revenue is recognised over time.

A substantial majority of the financial advisory fees received are paid to advisers. Financial advisory fees are presented gross of the related 
cost which is presented in Fees and commission expenses in the Consolidated income statement.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Income tax expense
Income tax expense is the tax payable on taxable income for the current period based on the income tax rate for each jurisdiction 
and adjusted for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. These changes are attributable to:

 – temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their Consolidated statement of financial position 
carrying amounts;

 – unused tax losses; and
 – the impact of changes in the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from changes in tax rates or in the manner 

in which these balances are expected to be realised.

Adjustments to income tax expense are also made for any differences between the amounts paid, or expected to be paid, in relation 
to prior periods and the amounts provided for these periods at the start of the current period.

Any tax impact on income and expense items that are recognised directly in equity is also recognised directly in equity.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences and are measured at the tax rates which are expected to apply 
when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted for each jurisdiction 
at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to present value.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable 
amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

Tax consolidation
AMP Limited and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities are part of a tax-consolidated group, with AMP Limited being the head 
entity (the company). A tax funding agreement has been entered into by the head entity and the controlled entities in the tax-consolidated 
group and requires entities to fully compensate the company for current tax liabilities and to be fully compensated by the company for any 
current or deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses arising from external transactions occurring after 30 June 2003, the implementation 
date of the tax-consolidated group.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The AMP group is subject to taxes in Australia and other jurisdictions where it has operations. The application of tax law 
to the specific circumstances and transactions of the AMP group requires the exercise of judgement by management. 
The tax treatments adopted by management in preparing the financial statements may be impacted by changes 
in legislation and interpretations or be subject to challenge by tax authorities.

Judgement is also applied by management in setting assumptions used to forecast future profitability in order to determine 
the extent to which the recovery of carried forward tax losses and deductible temporary differences are probable for the 
purpose of meeting the criteria for recognition as deferred tax assets (DTAs). Future profitability may differ from forecasts 
which could impact management’s expectations in future periods with respect to the recoverability of DTAs and result 
in DTA impairments or reversals of prior DTA impairments.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Financial assets measured at amortised cost – loans and advances and debt securities
Loans and advances and debt securities are measured at amortised cost when both of the following conditions are met:

 – the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and
 – the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest 

on the principal amount outstanding. 

Financial assets measured at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of the financial asset. These assets are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. 

Loans and advances are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when 
AMP Bank provides money directly to a customer, including loans and advances to advisers, and with no intention of trading the financial 
asset. Loans and advances are initially recognised at fair value, including direct and incremental transaction costs relating to loan 
origination. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.

IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 
An allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) is recognised for financial assets not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are 
probability weighted estimates of credit losses and are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls discounted at the effective 
interest rate of the financial instrument. The key elements in the measurement of ECLs are as follows:

 – PD – the probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon.
 – EAD – the exposure at default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the 

exposure after the reporting date.
 – LGD – loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference 

between cash flows due to the group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive, including 
from the realisation of any collateral. 

The group estimates these elements using appropriate credit risk models taking into consideration a number of factors, including the 
internal and external credit ratings of the assets, nature and value of collateral and forward-looking macro-economic scenarios.

Other than ECL on trade receivables, where a simplified approach is taken, the group applies a three-stage approach to measure the ECLs 
as follows:

STAGE 1 (12-MONTH ECL)
The group collectively assesses and recognises a provision at an amount equal to 12-month ECL when financial assets are current and/or 
have had a good performance history and are of low credit risk. It includes financial assets where the credit risk has improved and the 
financial assets have been reclassified from Stage 2 or even Stage 3 based on improved performance observed over a predefined period 
of time. A financial asset is considered to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition 
of ‘investment grade’.

STAGE 2 (LIFETIME ECL – NOT CREDIT IMPAIRED)
The group collectively assesses and recognises a provision at an amount equal to lifetime ECL on financial assets where there has been 
a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but the financial assets are not credit impaired. 

The quantitative criteria used to determine a significant increase in credit risk is a series of relative and absolute thresholds. Financial 
assets that were 30 days past due at least once over the last six months are deemed to have significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition. For loans and advances, other risk factors like hardship, loan to value ratio (LVR) and loan to income ratio (LTI) are 
also considered in order to determine a significant increase in credit risk. 

STAGE 3 (LIFETIME ECL – CREDIT IMPAIRED)
The group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL on financial assets that are determined to be credit impaired 
based on objective evidence of impairment. Financial assets are classified as impaired when payment is 90 days past due or when there 
is no longer reasonable assurance that principal or interest will be collected in their entirety on a timely basis.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

Impairment 
The impairment provisions (individual and collective) are outputs of ECL models with a number of underlying assumptions 
regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered 
accounting estimates and judgements include:

 – the AMP group’s internal grading which assigns PDs to the individual grades;
 – the AMP group’s estimates of LGDs arising in the event of default;
 – the AMP group’s criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk;
 – development of ECL models, including the various formulas, choice of inputs and assumptions; and
 – determination of associations between macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings, to derive the 

economic inputs into the ECL models.

Future outcomes and macro-economic conditions which differ from management’s assumptions and estimates could 
result in changes to the timing and amount of credit losses to be recognised.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 

Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised at the date the AMP group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. At initial recognition, financial assets are classified as subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, fair value 
through other comprehensive income (OCI), and amortised cost. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends 
on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the group’s business model for managing them. 

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred. 
A transfer occurs when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are passed to an unrelated third party. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.

Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial assets measured on initial recognition as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised 
at fair value, determined as the purchase cost of the asset, exclusive of any transaction costs. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
in profit or loss. Any realised and unrealised gains or losses arising from subsequent measurement at fair value are recognised in profit 
or loss in the period in which they arise. 

Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss – debt securities
Debt securities can be irrevocably designated, at initial recognition, as measured at fair value through profit or loss where doing so would 
eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency or otherwise results in more relevant information. Fair value 
on initial recognition is determined as the purchase cost of the asset, exclusive of any transaction costs. Transactions costs are expensed 
as incurred in profit or loss. Subsequent measurement is determined with reference to the bid price at the reporting date. Any realised and 
unrealised gains or losses arising from subsequent measurement at fair value are recognised in the Consolidated income statement in the 
period in which they arise.

Financial assets measured at fair value through OCI – debt securities 
Debt securities are measured at fair value through OCI when both of the following conditions are met:

 – the instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets; and

 – the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding. 

Fair value through OCI instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair value 
recognised in OCI. Interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses or reversals are recognised in profit 
or loss in the same manner as for financial assets measured at amortised cost. The remaining fair value changes are recognised in OCI. 
The accumulated gains or losses recognised in OCI are recycled to profit and loss upon derecognition of the assets.

The group classifies debt securities held by AMP Bank under this category.

Financial assets measured at amortised cost – debt securities
Refer to note 2.1 for details.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value
Where available, quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments are used to determine fair value. Where there 
is no market price available for an instrument, a valuation technique is used. Management applies judgement in selecting 
valuation techniques and setting valuation assumptions and inputs. Further detail on the determination of fair value 
of financial instruments is set out in note 2.7.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. The cost represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. 

Capitalised costs
Costs are capitalised when the costs relate to the creation of an asset with expected future economic benefits which are capable of reliable 
measurement. Capitalised costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, commencing at the time 
the asset is first put into use or held ready for use, whichever is the earlier.

Value of in-force business
The value of in-force business represented the fair value of future business arising from existing contractual arrangements of a business 
acquired as part of a business combination. The value of in-force business was initially measured at fair value and was subsequently 
measured at fair value less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Distribution networks
Distribution networks such as customer lists, financial planner client servicing rights or other distribution-related rights, either acquired 
separately or through a business combination, are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at cost less amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the intangible asset. The estimated 
useful lives are generally: 

Item Useful life

Capitalised costs Up to 10 years 

Distribution networks 2 to 15 years

The useful life of each intangible asset is reviewed at the end of the period and, where necessary, adjusted to reflect current assessments. 

Impairment testing 
Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment. Other intangible assets 
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(cash-generating units or CGUs). An impairment loss is recognised when the CGU’s carrying amount exceeds the CGU’s recoverable 
amount. When applicable, an impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill and any remainder is then allocated to the other assets 
on a pro-rata basis.

Composition of goodwill 
The goodwill of $70m (2021: $149m) arose from historical acquisitions where the AMP group was the acquirer. Goodwill attributable to the

$m $m

New Zealand Wealth Management (NZWM) 70 70

The annual impairment assessment for NZWM resulted in significant headroom and there was no reasonably possible change to a key 
assumption used in the assessment that would result in an impairment at 31 December 2022. AMP Capital goodwill was transferred to assets 
held for sale in the Consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 considering the sale of AMP Capital. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Management applies judgement in selecting valuation techniques and setting valuation assumptions to determine the:

 – acquisition date fair value and estimated useful life of acquired intangible assets;
 – allocation of goodwill to CGUs and determining the recoverable amount of the CGUs; and
 – assessment of whether there are any impairment indicators for acquired intangibles and internally generated 

intangibles, where required, in determining the recoverable amount.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 

Receivables
Trade debtors, client register, sublease receivables, collateral and other receivables are measured at amortised cost, less an allowance for 
ECLs. Investment related receivables are financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for receivables. Therefore, the group does not track changes in credit risk 
but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The group has established a provision matrix that 
is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

2.7 FAIR VALUE INFORMATION CONTINUED

AMP’s methodology and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below:

Equity securities The fair value of equity securities is established using valuation techniques, including the use 
of recent arm’s length transactions, references to other instruments that are substantially the same, 
discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. 

Debt securities The fair value of listed debt securities reflects the bid price at the reporting date. Listed debt 
securities that are not frequently traded are valued by discounting estimated recoverable amounts.

The fair value of unlisted debt securities is estimated using interest rate yields obtainable on comparable 
listed investments. For debt securities with a maturity of less than 12 months, par value is considered 
a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Loans The estimated fair value of loans represents the discounted amount of estimated future cash 
flows expected to be received, based on the maturity profile of the loans. As the loans are unlisted, 
the discount rates applied are based on the yield curve appropriate to the remaining term of the 
loans. The loans may, from time to time, be measured at an amount in excess of fair value due 
to fluctuations on fixed rate loans. In these situations, as the fluctuations in fair value would not 
represent a permanent diminution and the carrying amounts of the loans are recorded at recoverable 
amounts after assessing impairment, it would not be appropriate to restate their carrying amount.

Unlisted managed 
investment schemes

The fair value of investments in unlisted managed investment schemes is determined on the basis 
of published redemption prices of those managed investment schemes at the reporting date. 

Derivative financial 
assets and liabilities

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives) 
is based on quoted market prices (current bid price or current offer price) at the reporting date. 
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (eg over-the-counter derivatives) 
is determined using valuation techniques. Valuation techniques include net present value techniques, 
option pricing models, discounted cash flow methods and comparison to quoted market prices or 
dealer quotes for similar instruments. The models use a number of inputs, including the credit quality 
of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, 
currency basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest rate curves and forward rate curves 
of the underlying instruments. Some derivatives contracts are significantly cash collateralised, thereby 
minimising both counterparty risk and the group’s own non-performance risk.

Corporate borrowings Borrowings comprise commercial paper, drawn liquidity facilities, various floating-rate and 
medium-term notes and subordinated debt. The estimated fair value of borrowings is determined 
with reference to quoted market prices. For borrowings where quoted market prices are not available, 
a discounted cash flow model is used, based on a current yield curve appropriate for the remaining 
term to maturity. For short-term borrowings, the par value is considered a reasonable approximation 
of the fair value.

AMP Bank deposits and 
other borrowings

The estimated fair value of deposits and other borrowings represents the discounted amount 
of estimated future cash flows expected to be paid based on the residual maturity of these liabilities. 
The discount rate applied is based on a current yield curve appropriate for similar types of deposits 
and borrowings at the reporting date.

Guarantee
liabilities

The fair value of the guarantee liabilities is determined as the net present value of future cash flows 
discounted using market rates. The future cash flows are determined using risk neutral stochastic 
projections based on assumptions such as mortality rate, lapse rate and asset class allocation/
correlation. The future cash flows comprise expected guarantee claims and hedging expenses net 
of expected fee revenue.

discounted using market rates. The future cash flows are determined using risk neutral stochastic 
projections based on assumptions such as mortality rate, lapse rate and asset class allocation/
correlation. The future cash flows comprise expected guarantee claims and hedging expenses net 
of expected fee revenue.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2022

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorised using the fair value hierarchy which reflects the significance of inputs 
into the determination of fair value as follows:

 – Level 1: the fair value is valued by reference to quoted prices and active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 – Level 2: the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset 

or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).
 – Level 3: the fair value is estimated using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the group determines whether 
transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

There have been no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the 2022 financial year. Transfers to and from Level 3 are 
shown in the Reconciliation of Level 3 values table later in this note.

Level 3 fair values 
For financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the valuation 
processes applied in valuing such assets was governed by valuation policies adopted by the AMP group, including the AMP Capital valuation 
policy. These policies outline the asset valuation methodologies and processes applied to measure non-exchange traded assets which 
have no regular market price, including investment property, infrastructure, private equity, alternative assets, and illiquid debt securities. 
All significant Level 3 assets were referred to the appropriate valuation committee who met at least every six months, or more frequently 
if required.

The following table shows the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 3 fair values of financial assets measured at fair value 
on a recurring basis, as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.

determining the impact on profit after tax and equity. The sensitivities disclosed are shown net of the offsetting impacts of derivatives held as economic 
hedges of the Guarantee liabilities.

SECTION CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

This section provides information relating to:
 – the AMP group’s capital management and equity and debt structure; and 
 –  exposure to financial risks – how the risks affect financial position and performance and how the risks are 

managed, including the use of derivative financial instruments
The capital structure of the AMP group consists of equity and debt. AMP determines the appropriate capital 
structure in order to finance the current and future activities of the AMP group and satisfy the requirements 
of the regulator. The directors review the group’s capital structure and dividend policy regularly and do so in the 
context of the group’s ability to satisfy minimum and target capital requirements.

1 Held by AMP Foundation.
2 In December of 2022, in accordance with section 258F of the Corporations Act 2001, the Board of Directors resolved to reduce AMP’s share capital by 

$4,931m, representing historic permanent losses recognised by the AMP group in prior reporting periods. Those losses arose from businesses in which AMP 
no longer operates, including UK demerger losses and losses relating to AMP’s wealth protection and mature businesses which were sold to Resolution 
Life in 2020. The adjustment to share capital has the effect of reducing AMP’s contributed equity and retained losses as disclosed on the Consolidated 
statement of changes in equity. The adjustment has no impact on the net assets, financial results, cash flows, and regulatory capital of the consolidated 
group or the company’s number of shares issued.

Holders of ordinary shares have the right to receive dividends as declared and, in the event of the winding up of the company, to participate 
in the proceeds from the sale of all surplus assets in proportion to the number of and amounts paid up on shares held. Fully paid ordinary 
shares carry the right to one vote per share. Ordinary shares have no par value.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Interest-bearing liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method. 

It is AMP’s policy to hedge currency and interest rate risk arising on issued bonds and subordinated debt. When fair value hedge accounting 
is applied, the carrying amounts of borrowings and subordinated debt are adjusted for changes in fair value related to the hedged risk for 
the period that the hedge relationship remains effective. Any changes in fair value for the period are recognised in the Consolidated income 
statement. In cash flow hedge relationships the borrowings are not revalued.

Finance costs include:
(i) borrowing costs: 

 – interest on bank overdrafts, borrowings and subordinated debt;
 – amortisation of discounts or premiums related to borrowings;

(ii) exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest 
costs; and

(iii) changes in the fair value of derivative hedges together with any change in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that are 
designated and qualify as fair value hedges, foreign exchange gains and losses and other financing-related amounts. Changes in the 
fair value of derivatives in effective cash flow hedges are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve. The accounting policy for 
derivatives is set out in note 3.4.

Finance costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.

3.3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The AMP Limited Board has overall responsibility for the risk management framework, including the approval of AMP’s strategic plan, 
risk management strategy and risk appetite. Specifically, financial risk arises from the holding of financial instruments and financial risk 
management (FRM) is an integral part of the AMP group’s enterprise risk management framework.

This note discloses financial risk in accordance with the categories in AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:
 – market risk;
 – liquidity and refinancing risk; and
 – credit risk.

These risks are managed in accordance with the board-approved risk appetite statement and the individual policies for each risk category and 
business approved by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) under delegation from the AMP Group Asset and Liability Committee (Group ALCO).

(a) Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of assets and liabilities, or future cash flows of a financial instrument, will fluctuate due 
to movements in the financial markets, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, property prices, credit spreads, 
commodity prices, market volatilities and other financial market variables. 

The following table provides information on significant market risk exposures for the AMP group, which could lead to an impact on the 
AMP group’s profit after tax and equity, and the management of those exposures.

Market risk Exposures 
Management of exposures and use 
of derivatives

Interest rate risk

The risk of an impact on the AMP group’s 
profit after tax and equity arising from 
fluctuations in the fair value or future 
cash flows of financial instruments due 
to changes in market interest rates.

Interest rate movements could result 
from changes in the absolute levels of 
interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, 
the margin between yield curves and the 
volatility of interest rates.

The AMP group’s long-term borrowings 
and subordinated debt.

Interest rate risk is managed by entering 
into interest rate swaps, which have the 
effect of converting borrowings from 
fixed to floating rate.

AMP Bank interest rate risk from 
mismatches in the repricing terms 
of assets and liabilities (term risk) and 
variable rate short-term repricing bases 
(basis risk).

AMP Bank uses natural offsets, interest 
rate swaps and basis swaps to hedge the 
mismatches within exposure limits. Group 
Treasury manages the exposure in AMP 
Bank by maintaining a net interest rate 
risk position within the limits delegated 
and approved by the AMP Bank Board. 

Currency risk

The risk of an impact on the AMP group’s 
profit after tax and equity arising from 
fluctuations of the fair value of a financial 
asset, liability or commitment due 
to changes in foreign exchange rates. 

Foreign currency denominated assets 
and liabilities.

Foreign equity accounted associates and 
capital invested in overseas operations.

Foreign exchange rate movements 
on specific cash flow transactions.

The AMP group uses swaps to hedge the 
interest rate risk and foreign currency 
risk on foreign currency denominated 
borrowings. The AMP group utilises 
various hedging instruments to hedge 
foreign currency risk arising from 
certain investments denominated 
in a foreign currency.

The AMP group hedges material foreign 
currency risk originated by receipts and 
payments once the value and timing 
of the expected cash flow is known.

In addition, the AMP group will at times 
pre-hedge any future (but not expected) 
foreign currency receipts and payments, 
subject to market conditions.

Equity price risk

The risk of an impact on the AMP group’s 
profit after tax and equity arising from 
fluctuations in the fair value or future 
cash flows of a financial instrument due 
to changes in equity prices.

Exposure for shareholders includes listed 
and unlisted shares, guarantee liabilities 
and participation in equity unit trusts.

Group Treasury may, with Group ALCO 
approval, use equity exposures or 
equity futures or options to hedge other 
enterprise-wide equity exposures.

Sensitivity analysis
The table below includes sensitivity analysis showing how the profit after tax and equity would have been impacted by changes in market 
risk variables. The analysis:

 – shows the direct impact of a reasonably possible change in market rates and is not intended to illustrate a remote, worst case stress 
test scenario; 

 – assumes that all underlying exposures and related hedges are included and the change in variable occurs at the reporting date; and
 – does not include the impact of any mitigating management actions over the period to the subsequent reporting date.

The categories of risks faced and methods used for deriving sensitivity information did not change from previous periods.

Risk Exposures
Management of exposures and use 
of derivatives

Credit risk

Credit default risk is the risk of financial 
or reputational loss due to a counterparty 
failing to meet their contractual 
commitments in full and on time.

Concentration of credit risk arises when 
a number of financial instruments 
or contracts are entered into with the 
same counterparty or where a number 
of counterparties are engaged in similar 
business activities that would cause their 
ability to meet contractual obligations 
to be similarly affected by changes 
in economic or other conditions.

Wholesale credit risk, arising from 
corporate investments held in relation 
to the management of liquidity.

Wholesale credit risk exposures arising 
from corporate investments made in 
relation to the management of liquidity 
(and related activities, including hedging 
financial risks) are managed by Group 
Treasury in accordance with the AMP 
Group Wholesale Counterparty Credit 
Risk Policy. This policy is reviewed and 
endorsed by the AMP Group ALCO and 
approved by the AMP Limited Board.  

Credit risk arising from its Australian 
banking activities which are limited 
to residential mortgage lending and 
practice finance loans to AMP advisers.

Wholesale credit risk exposures arising 
from investments made in relation to 
the management of liquidity within AMP 
Bank (and related activities, including 
hedging financial risks) are managed 
by Group Treasury in accordance with 
the AMP Bank Wholesale Counterparty 
Credit Risk Policy. This policy is reviewed 
and endorsed by the AMP Bank ALCO 
and approved by the AMP Bank Limited 
Board. Specific detail relating to the credit 
risk management of the AMP Bank loan 
portfolio is outlined below.

The AMP Group Wholesale Counterparty Credit Risk Policy sets out the assessment and determination of what constitutes credit 
concentration risk. The policy sets exposure limits based on each counterparty’s credit rating (unless special considerations are defined). 
Additional limits are set for the distribution of the total portfolio by credit rating bands. Compliance with this policy is monitored and 
exposures and breaches are reported to portfolio managers, senior management and the AMP Board Risk Committee through periodic 
financial risk management reports. 

Group Treasury also might enter into credit default swaps to hedge the concentration risk exposure against a specific issuer, or aggregated 
at the parent entity, when material exposures are over the authorised limit.

The exposures on interest-bearing securities and cash equivalents which impact AMP’s capital position are managed by Group Treasury 
within limits set by the AMP Group Wholesale Counterparty Credit Risk Policy. 

Impairment assessment

DEFINITION OF DEFAULT
AMP Bank considers a financial asset defaulted and hence Stage 3 impaired when payment is 90 days past due or when there is no longer 
reasonable assurance that principal or interest will be collected in their entirety on a timely basis.

AMP BANK’S INTERNAL RISK GRADING AND PD ESTIMATION PROCESS
AMP Bank’s credit risk management department runs expected credit loss models for the residential mortgage book as well as the practice 
finance loans. The Bank’s residential mortgage book is a portfolio with a low number of defaults. In recent times, the Bank’s residential 
mortgage book has grown significantly, and a larger history of default data has been captured. This has enabled the Bank to successfully 
develop its internal behavioural scorecards which have been used to replace the benchmark PDs in an endeavour to better risk rank order 
the portfolio by credit risk worthiness.

Internal risk grades for the residential mortgage book are as follows:

Internal credit rating grade Internal credit rating grade description

Performing Not in arrears in the past six months

Past due but not impaired Accounts in arrears but have not been past 90 days in the last six months

Impaired 90 days past due over the last six months

For practice finance loans a Probability of Default risk grade model is applied that includes weighted risk factors such as Interest Coverage 
Ratio, revenue growth, licence compliance rating, experience in business and arrears levels. Practices on watch-list are also downgraded. 
Credit judgement may be applied to arrive at the final risk grade. 

Internal risk grades for practice finance book are as follows:

Internal risk grade Internal risk grade description Broadly corresponds with Standard & Poor ratings of

A to H Sub-investment grade BB+ to CCC

I Impaired D

The Bank’s interbank and financial institutions exposures as well as exposures to interest-bearing securities are based on external credit 
rating of the counterparties as follows:

Internal risk grade description Broadly corresponds with Standard & Poor ratings of

Senior investment grade AAA to A-

Investment grade BBB+ to BBB-

Sub-investment grade BB+ up to but not including defaulted or impaired

EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT (EAD)
EAD is modelled by applying assumptions in relation to the amortisation of the loans based on scheduled principal and interest repayments 
except for Stage 3 loans.

LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT (LGD)
For the residential mortgage portfolio the key driver for the LGD calculation is the value of the underlying property, as in a foreclosure 
scenario the proceeds from the sale of a property are secured by the Bank to repay the loan. The value of the underlying residential property 
is captured via the LVR which factors both changes in loan balance and estimated value of the collateral using market data and indices. 
Both floor and haircuts are applied to provide for model risk.

For practice finance loans, the LGD is calculated via assumptions to the reduction in valuations of practices (being a multiple of their recurring 
cash flows) in the event of default, such as client run-off or deterioration in valuation due to compliance issues. In addition, haircuts are 
applied to cater for the volatility observed in the register values in the event of default but also general volatility in valuations over time.

GROUPING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (ECL) CALCULATION
Asset classes where the bank calculates ECL on an individual basis include all Stage 3 assets, and interbank and debt securities at FVOCI.

For all other asset classes ECL is calculated on a collective basis, taking into account risk factors for each loan and arriving at the ECL 
estimate and then aggregating the number for the relevant portfolio.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
The Bank’s ECL model incorporates a number of forward-looking macroeconomic factors (MEF) that are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
and approved by the Credit Risk Committee (CRC). The MEF include unemployment, property prices, ASX Index and Cash Rate.

At least three different scenarios with fixed weightings are used in the model. The weightings are reviewed on an annual basis.

The ECL is calculated as the probability weighted average of the provision calculated for each economic scenario.

MANAGEMENT OVERLAY
Management overlay is required to mitigate model risk and any systemic risk that is not recognised by the model.

The management overlays are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if required and presented to the CRC and Board Audit 
Committee (BAC) for sign off. 

WRITE-OFFS
Financial assets are written off either partially or in their entirety only when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Recovery actions 
can cease if they are determined as being no longer cost effective or in some situations, where the customers have filed for bankruptcy.

CREDIT RISK OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN AMP BANK (THE BANK)
The Bank is predominantly a lender for residential properties – both owner occupied and for investment. In every case the Bank completes 
a credit assessment, which includes cost of living allowance and requires valuation of the proposed security property. 

The Bank’s CRC and Board Risk Committee (BRC) oversee trends in lending exposures and compliance with the Risk Appetite Statement. 
The Bank secures its housing loans with mortgages over relevant properties and as a result, manages credit risk on its loans with conservative 
lending policies and particular focus on the LVR. The LVR is calculated by dividing the total loan amount outstanding by the lower of the Bank’s 
approved valuation amount or the purchase price. Loans with LVR greater than 80% are fully mortgage insured. Mortgage insurance is provided 
by Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia Ltd and QBE Lenders Mortgage Insurance Ltd who are both regulated by APRA. The Bank has strong 
relationships with both insurers and experienced minimal levels of historic claim rejections and reductions.

The average LVR at origination of AMP Bank’s loan portfolio for existing and new business is set out in the following table:

Existing 
business 

New

RENEGOTIATED LOANS
Where possible, the Bank seeks to restructure loans for borrowers seeking hardship relief rather than take possession of collateral. This 
may involve capitalising interest repayments for a period and increasing the repayment arrangement for the remaining term of the loan. 
Once the terms has been renegotiated, the loan is no longer considered past due or an impaired asset unless it was greater than 90 days 
in arrears in the previous six months or a specific provision has been raised for the loan. The Bank assisted customers by renegotiating 
$81m (2021: $239m) of loans during the year, of which none (2021: $150m) relates to hardship granted due to COVID-19, that otherwise 
would be past due or impaired.

COLLATERAL AND MASTER NETTING OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS
The AMP group obtains collateral and utilises netting agreements to mitigate credit risk exposures from certain counterparties.

(i) Derivative financial assets and liabilities
The credit risk of derivatives is managed in the context of the AMP group’s overall credit risk policies and includes the use of Credit Support 
Annexes to derivative agreements which facilitate the bilateral posting of collateral as well as the clearing of derivative positions on the 
London Clearing House.

Certain derivative assets and liabilities are subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, such as an International Swaps 
and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreement. In certain circumstances, for example when a credit event such as a default 
occurs, all outstanding transactions under an ISDA agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net 
amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.

An ISDA agreement does not automatically meet the criteria for offsetting in the Consolidated statement of financial position. This is because 
the AMP group, in most cases, does not have any current legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts.

If these netting arrangements were applied to the derivative portfolio, the derivative assets of $552m would be reduced by $87m to the 
net amount of $465m and derivative liabilities of $128m would be reduced by $87m to the net amount of $41m (2021: derivative assets 
of $334m would be reduced by $143m to the net amount of $191m and derivative liabilities of $185m would be reduced by $143m to the 
net amount of $42m).

(ii) Other collateral
The AMP group has collateral arrangements in place with some counterparties in addition to collateral deposits held with respect to repurchase 
agreements. The amount and type of collateral required by AMP Bank on housing loans depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the 
counterparty. Guidelines are in place covering the acceptability and valuation of each type of collateral.

AMP Bank holds collateral against its loans and advances primarily in the form of mortgage interests over property, other registered 
securities over assets and guarantees.

Management monitors the market value of collateral and will request additional collateral in accordance with the underlying agreement. 
In the event of customer default, AMP Bank can enforce any security held as collateral against the outstanding claim. Any loan security 
is usually held as mortgagee in possession while AMP Bank seeks to realise its value through the sale of property. Therefore, AMP Bank 
does not hold any real estate or other assets acquired through the repossession of collateral.

Collateral generally consists of 11am loans and deposits and is exchanged between the counterparties to reduce the exposure from the 
net fair value of derivative assets and liabilities between the counterparties. As at 31 December 2022 there was $133m (2021: $108m) 
of collateral deposits (due to other counterparties) and $108m (2021: $47m) of collateral loans (due from other counterparties) relating 
to derivative assets and liabilities.

3.4 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING

The group is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. To mitigate the risks the group uses derivative financial 
instruments, such as cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. When the group designates certain derivatives to be part of a hedging 
relationship, and they meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedges are classified as:

 – cash flow hedges;
 – fair value hedges; or 
 – net investment hedges.

Derivative financial instruments are held for risk and asset management purposes only and not for the purpose of speculation. Not all 
derivatives held are designated as hedging instruments. The group’s risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage risk 
is explained further in note 3.3.

The following table sets out the carrying amount of hedged items in fair value hedge relationships, and the accumulated amount

Derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges
The group is exposed to variability in future interest cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities which bear interest at fixed and variable 
rates. The group uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risks and many of the swaps are cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. 

Methods used to test hedge effectiveness and establish the hedge ratio include regression analysis and for some portfolio hedge 
relationships, a comparison to ensure the expected interest cash flows from the portfolio exceed those of the hedging instruments. 
The main potential source of hedge ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges is mismatches in the terms of hedged items and hedging 
instruments, for example the frequency and timing of when interest rates are reset.

During the year the AMP group recognised $nil (2021: $nil) due to ineffectiveness on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.

Derivative instruments accounted for as fair value hedges
Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities due to movements in exchange 
rates and interest rates. 

Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the overall changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument against the changes 
in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The main potential source of ineffectiveness on fair value hedges 
is currency basis spread, which is included in the valuation of the hedging instrument but excluded from the value of the hedged item.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
The group hedges its exposure to changes in exchange rates on the value of its foreign currency denominated strategic investments. 
Hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contract, primarily using the cumulative dollar 
offset method.

The AMP group recognised $nil (2021: $nil) due to the ineffective portion of hedges relating to strategic investments in foreign operations.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value exclusive of any transaction costs on the date a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. All derivatives are recognised as assets when 
their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from the change in fair value 
of derivatives, except those that qualify as effective cash flow hedges, are immediately recognised in the Consolidated income statement. 

Hedge accounting
AMP continues to apply the hedge accounting requirements under AASB 139 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised (including related tax impacts) in Other comprehensive 
income. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement. The balance of the cash flow hedge reserve 
in relation to each particular hedge is transferred to the Consolidated income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the 
criteria for hedge accounting. The cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast 
transaction is ultimately recognised in the Consolidated income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Consolidated income statement.

Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of fair value hedges are recognised in the Consolidated income statement, together with any changes in the fair 
value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. If a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
the cumulative gains and losses recognised on the hedged item will be amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item.

Net investment hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of net investment hedges is recognised (including related tax impacts) in Other 
comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement. The cumulative gain 
or loss existing in equity remains in equity until the foreign investment is disposed of.

3.5 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

AMP holds capital to protect customers, creditors and shareholders against unexpected losses. There are a number of ways AMP assesses 
the adequacy of its capital position. Primarily, AMP aims to:

 – maintain a sufficient surplus above minimum regulatory capital requirements (MRR) to reduce the risk of breaching MRR; and
 – maintain the AMP group’s credit rating.

These factors are balanced when forming AMP’s risk appetite as approved by the AMP Limited Board.

Calculation of capital resources
The AMP group’s eligible capital resources include ordinary equity and certain hybrid capital instruments. Adjustments to these amounts 
are made for intangibles, associate equity investments and other assets required to be removed by regulation. 

The table below shows the AMP group’s capital resources at reporting date:

2022 2021
$m $m

AMP statutory equity attributable to shareholders of AMP Limited 4,171 3,980 

Accounting mismatch and other adjustments 1 (94) (106)

AMP shareholder equity 4,077 3,874 

Goodwill and other intangibles 2 (289) (344)

Equity investments 3 (1,012) (1,607)

Other regulatory adjustments 4 (138) (6)

Subordinated bonds eligible as Level 3 capital  –  16 

Level 3 eligible capital 2,638 1,933 

Eligible hybrid capital resources 5 350 579 

Total eligible capital resources 2,988 2,512 

Minimum regulatory requirements (MRR) 1,366 1,316 

Target capital requirements 699 813 

Total capital requirements 2,065 2,129 

Surplus capital above target requirements 923 383 

1 Accounting mismatches and other adjustments primarily relate to the net assets of the AMP Foundation and surpluses recognised on any defined benefit plans.
2 Includes $91m of intangibles classified as Assets held for sale on the Consolidated statement of financial position (2021: $14m).
3 Equity investments relate to holdings of associate equity investment where AMP holds a minority interest. As at 31 December 2022, Global Infrastructure Fund 

Sponsor ($76m), Global Infrastructure Fund II ($122m), AMP Capital Core Property Fund ($30m) and other equity investments ($14m) are classified as assets held 
for sale (2021: Resolution Life NOHC ($509m) and AMP Capital Infrastructure Debt Fund V USD LP ($8m)).

4 Other regulatory adjustments relate to securitisation, deferred tax assets and other provisions for AMP Bank, deferred tax assets for Australian Wealth 
Management and include an adjustment for eligible seed and sponsor investment classified as equity investments in AMP Capital.

5 Eligible hybrid capital instruments are subordinated debt which is able to be included as eligible capital for the purpose of meeting minimum 
regulatory requirements.

Capital requirements
A number of the operating entities within the AMP group of companies are regulated and are required to meet MRR. In certain circumstances, 
APRA or other regulators may require AMP and other entities of the AMP group to hold a greater level of capital to support its business and/or 
restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid by them. Any such adjustments would be incorporated into the minimum regulatory 
requirements and monitored as part of the capital management policy. 

The principal minimum regulatory capital requirements for AMP’s businesses are:

Operating entity Minimum regulatory capital requirement

AMP Bank Limited (AMP Bank) Capital requirements as specified under the APRA ADI 
Prudential Standards

N. M. Superannuation Proprietary Limited Operational Risk Financial Requirements as specified under 
the APRA Superannuation Prudential Standards

Other ASIC regulated businesses Capital requirements under AFSL requirements 

The AMP group maintains capital targets reflecting their material risks (including financial risk, product risk and operational risk) and 
AMP’s risk appetite. The target capital requirement is a management guide to the level of excess capital that the AMP group seeks to carry 
to reduce the risk of breaching MRR.

AMP Limited and AMP Bank have Board-approved minimum capital levels above APRA requirements, with additional capital targets held 
above these amounts. Capital targets are also set for AMP Capital to cover risk associated with seed and sponsor capital investments and 
operational risk. Other components of AMP group’s capital targets include amounts relating to Group Office investments, defined benefit 
funds and other operational risks.

All of the AMP group regulated entities have at all times during the current and prior financial year complied with the externally imposed 
capital requirements to which they are subject.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Defined benefit plans
The AMP group recognises the net deficit or surplus position of each fund in the Consolidated statement of financial position. The deficit 
or surplus is measured as the difference between the fair value of the funds’ assets and the discounted defined benefit obligations of the 
funds, using discount rates determined with reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period.

After taking into account any contributions paid into the defined benefit funds during the period, movements in the net surplus or deficit 
of each fund, except actuarial gains and losses, are recognised in the Consolidated income statement. Actuarial gains and losses arising 
from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions over the period and the returns on plan assets are recognised 
(net of tax) directly in retained earnings through Other comprehensive income.

Contributions paid into defined benefit funds are recognised as reductions in the deficit. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

Defined benefit asset
The value of the group’s defined benefit obligations are outputs of actuarial models dependent on a number of underlying 
assumptions. Management applies judgement in selecting the assumptions used. Key assumptions include:

 – discount rate;
 – expected future salary increases;
 – pension indexation; 
 – mortality; and
 – life expectancy.

4.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

AMP has multiple employee share-based payment plans. Share-based payment plans help create alignment between employees 
participating in those plans (participants) and shareholders. Information on plans which AMP currently offers is provided below.

The following table shows the expense recorded for AMP share-based payment plans during the year: 

2022 2021
$'000 $'000

Plans currently offered

Performance rights 1 6,457  7,854 

Share rights and restricted shares - equity settled 4,259  9,143 

Share rights – cash settled 680  2,759 

Total share-based payments expense 11,396  19,756 

1 Non-market performance rights which were forfeited or where performance conditions were not met were reversed during the year.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Equity-settled share-based payments 
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments is measured using their fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value 
calculation takes into consideration a number of factors, including the likelihood of achieving market-based vesting conditions such as total 
shareholder return (market conditions).

The cost of equity-settled share-based payments is recognised in the Consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding 
increase in the share-based payment reserve (SBP reserve) in equity, over the vesting period of the instrument. At each reporting date, the 
AMP group reviews its estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to vest and any changes to the cost are recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement and the SBP reserve, over the remaining vesting period.

Where the terms of an equity-settled share-based payment are modified and the expense increases as a result of the modification, 
the increase is recognised over the remaining vesting period. When a modification reduces the expense, there is no adjustment, and the 
pre-modification cost continues to be recognised.

Where an equity-settled award does not ultimately vest, expenses are not reversed; except for awards where vesting is conditional upon 
a non-market condition, in which case all expenses are reversed in the period in which the instrument lapses.

Cash-settled share-based payments 
Cash-settled share-based payments are recognised when the terms of the arrangement provide AMP group with the discretion to settle 
in cash or by issuing equity instruments and it has a present obligation to settle the arrangement in cash. A present obligation may occur 
where the past practice has set a precedence for future settlements in cash.

Cash-settled share-based payments are recognised, over the vesting period of the award, in the Consolidated income statement, together 
with a corresponding liability. The fair value is measured on initial recognition and re-measured at each reporting date up to and including 
the settlement date, with any changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated income statement. Similar to equity-settled awards, 
number of instruments expected to vest are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are recognised in the Consolidated income 
statement and corresponding liability. The fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques.

(a) Performance rights
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Committee members receive their long-term incentive (LTI) award in the form 
of performance rights. This is intended to ensure the interests of those executives, who are able to most directly influence company 
performance, are appropriately aligned with the interests of shareholders.

Plan Long-term Incentive Awards CEO Sign-on Performance Rights Award

Overview Performance rights give the participant the right 
to acquire one fully paid ordinary share in AMP 
Limited upon meeting specific performance 
hurdles. They are granted at no cost to the 
participant and carry no dividend or voting 
rights until they vest. This award may be settled 
through an equivalent cash payment, at the 
discretion of the board. 

As part of the CEO’s incentive package, 
performance rights were awarded on 
appointment. The performance rights give the 
CEO the right to acquire one fully paid ordinary 
share in AMP Limited (per right) upon meeting 
specific performance conditions, including 
hurdles that are subject to an absolute and 
relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure. 
The award was granted at no cost to the CEO 
and carries no dividend or voting rights. This 
award may be settled through an equivalent 
cash payment, at the discretion of the board.

Years granted 2019, 2021 and 2022. 2021.

Vesting conditions/period The vesting of performance rights is subject 
to the following gateways:
1.  Risk and Conduct Gateway – if a participant’s 

performance and conduct is not in line with 
AMP’s expectations, the board has discretion 
to amend the vesting outcome.

2.  Performance Gateway and Hurdle – The number 
of rights that vest under the award will be 
determined based on the Compound Annual 
Growth Rate (CAGR) or CAGR in the Company’s 
TSR relative to CAGR in TSR to the peer group 
of ASX100 financial companies (excluding 
A-REITs). 

The vesting period is typically between three 
and three-and-a-half years. A one year restriction 
period (holding lock) applies for LTI awards 
granted in 2021 and 2022.

The vesting of the CEO’s sign-on performance 
rights is subject to the following gateways:
1.  Absolute TSR – measures the CAGR in the 

Company’s TSR over the relevant Performance 
Period. 

2.  Relative TSR – measures the Company’s TSR 
performance relative to a peer group over the 
relevant Performance Period. The comparator 
group for the relative TSR performance hurdle 
will be an adjusted ASX100 Financials index. 

Each component was awarded in three tranches, 
of which one has already vested. The board will 
test the performance hurdles for the remaining 
two tranches on or around the 22 November 
2023 and 22 November 2024, respectively. If the 
performance hurdles are met, the rights vest and 
become exercisable. 

Unvested awards If a participant is terminated for cause or gives 
notice of resignation before the vesting date, all 
unvested rights will lapse or be forfeited, unless 
the Board determines otherwise. If a participant’s 
employment ends for any other reason, the 
unvested awards will remain on foot. For the 
2019 and 2022 LTI awards, a pro rata portion 
of rights are retained. All unreleased restricted 
shares allocated to the participant on vesting will 
remain on foot until the end of the restriction 
period, unless the participant is terminated for 
cause, in which case the awards are forfeited. 

Unvested awards are forfeited if the CEO 
voluntarily ceases employment or is dismissed 
for misconduct.

Valuation of performance rights 
The values for performance rights are based on valuations prepared by an independent external consultant. The valuations are 
based on the 10-day volume weighted average share price over the 10-day trading period prior to the start of the award’s valuation 
period. Assumptions regarding the dividend yield and volatility have been estimated based on AMP’s dividend yield and volatility over 
an appropriate period. 

In determining the share-based payments expense, the number of instruments expected to vest has been adjusted to reflect the number 
of employees expected to remain with AMP until the end of the performance period; this is revisited each reporting date. The following 
table shows the factors and range considered in determining the value of the performance rights granted during the last two years.

Valuation of share rights
The fair value of share rights has been calculated as at the grant date by external consultants using a discounted cash flow methodology. 
If relevant to the award, fair value has been discounted for the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period 
to which the participant is not entitled. For the purposes of the valuation, it is assumed share rights are exercised as soon as they have 
vested. Assumptions regarding the dividend yield have been estimated based on AMP’s dividend yield over an appropriate period. 

In determining the share-based payments expense, the number of instruments expected to vest has been adjusted to reflect the number 
of employees expected to remain with AMP until the end of the performance period. The following table shows the factors and range 
considered in determining the independent fair value of the share rights granted during the last two years:

SHARE RIGHTS
2022 2021

Closing share price on grant date $0.96 $1.07–$1.35

Contractual life (years) 0.9–3.9 0.3–4.0

5.2 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

(a) Sale of AMP Capital
AMP has announced a series of sales transactions which will result in AMP’s divestment of its AMP Capital businesses. AASB 5 Non‑current 
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (AASB 5) requires the income, expenses and cash flows of these businesses to be separately 
disclosed as discontinued operations. For the year ended 31 December 2022, discontinued operations represents the income, expenses and 
cash flows of:

 – AMP Capital’s infrastructure debt platform from 1 January 2022 to 11 February 2022;
 – AMP Capital’s GEFI business from 1 January 2022 to 28 March 2022;
 – AMP Capital’s real estate and domestic infrastructure equity business through to 31 December 2022; and 
 – AMP Capital’s international infrastructure equity business through to 31 December 2022.

In accordance with AASB 5, the comparative period results have been restated.

The residual assets of AMP Capital, principally its investments in CLAMP, PCCP and related seed and sponsor investments will remain a part 
of the AMP group. Accordingly, the related income, expenses and cash flows of these investments are included within continuing operations. 

(b) Profit or loss for the period from discontinued operations
The results of AMP Capital’s discontinued businesses included within AMP group’s Consolidated income statement are set out below, 
including comparative information.

Following the sale of AMP Capital, certain service arrangements will continue between AMP and those businesses. Where relevant, revenue 
and expenses attributable to continuing operations from such arrangements have been presented within continuing operations to reflect the 
ongoing nature of such arrangements. The result of the discontinued operations presented below have been adjusted for these arrangements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS:
The presentation of discontinued operations includes gains or losses recognised on the sale of AMP Capital businesses and 
incorporates management’s judgements in relation to:

 – determining whether the relevant group of assets meet the held for sale classification, including judgements applied 
in estimating the likely satisfaction of key condition precedents and estimating the timeframe transactions will 
complete within from the balance date, 

 – determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities held for sale, including the related impairment considerations, and
 – assumptions used to estimate purchase price adjustments, earn-outs, the allocation of goodwill, provisions for directly 

attributable separation costs yet to be incurred, warranties and indemnities under sale agreements and potential 
onerous contracts resulting from the separation.

5.3 INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES CONTINUED

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 

Investments in associates 
Investments in entities over which the AMP group has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting. The investment is measured at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the AMP group’s share of the 
associates’ net assets, less any impairment in value. The AMP group’s share of profit or loss of associates is included in the Consolidated 
income statement. Any dividend or distribution received from associates is accounted for as a reduction in carrying value of the associate. 

Any impairment is recognised in the Consolidated income statement when there is objective evidence a loss has been incurred. It is measured 
as the amount by which the carrying amount of the investment in entities exceeds the recoverable amount.

Transactions with other associates
The group provides investment management and banking services under general service level agreements with other associates as well 
as support to financial advice practices. 

Dividends were received from associates.

Transactions with investment entities
In conjunction with the establishment of new investment funds managed by AMP Capital or other group associates, the group, from time 
to time, invests seed and sponsor capital. The structure of the fund or the group’s level of ownership may result in the fund being treated 
as an associate of the group. See note 5.3 for details of the group’s associates. Management fees are earned by AMP or its associates for 
managing and administering these investment funds. 

All transactions between the group, its associates and the funds are on an arm’s length basis.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Short-term benefits – Liabilities arising in respect of salaries and wages and any other employee entitlements expected to be settled within 
12 months of the reporting date are measured at their nominal amounts.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
At inception, the AMP group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease. Such assessment involves the application of judgement 
as to whether:

 – the contract involves the use of an identified asset; 
 – the group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the asset; and 
 – the group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

It is AMP’s policy to separate non-lease components when recognising the lease liability.

The group recognises a Right of Use (ROU) asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The ROU asset is initially measured 
as the present value of future lease payments, plus initial direct costs and restoration costs of the underlying asset, less any lease incentives 
received. The ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. The ROU asset is tested 
for impairment if there is an indicator, and is adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. 

A lease liability is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments discounted using the group’s incremental borrowing rate. 
Lease payments generally include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index, eg CPI. A lease liability is remeasured 
when there is a change in future lease payments from a change in an index, or if the group’s assessment of whether an option will 
be exercised changes. 

Interest expense on lease liabilities is recognised within finance costs in the Consolidated income statement. 

The group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases where the lease term is less than or equal to 12 months. 
Payments for such leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The group recognises lease liabilities and corresponding ROU assets for all leases where the group is a lessee, except for 
short-term leases and leases where the underlying asset is of low value. Management applies judgement in identifying 
and measuring lease liabilities and assessing impairment indicators for ROU assets which includes:

 – assessing whether a contract contains a lease;
 – determining lease term and incremental borrowing rate;
 – separating lease and non-lease components;
 – assessing lease modification vis-a-vis new lease;
 – assessing the usage of ROU assets and the associated benefits.

2 Other provisions include provisions for onerous lease arrangements, deferred payments relating to purchase of client registers, make-good provisions 

relating to rental premises and other operational provisions. $nil (2021:$8m) is expected to be settled more than 12 months from the reporting date.

ACCOUNTING POLICY – RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:

 – the AMP group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
 – it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
 – a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation 
at the reporting date. For provisions other than employee entitlements, the discount rate used to determine the present value reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

A contingent liability is disclosed where a legal or constructive obligation is possible, but not probable; or where the obligation is probable 
but the financial impact of the event is unable to be reliably estimated.

From time to time the AMP group may incur obligations or suffer financial loss arising from litigation or contracts entered into in the 
normal course of business, including guarantees issued for performance obligations of controlled entities in the AMP group. Legal 
proceedings threatened against AMP may also, if filed, result in AMP incurring obligations or suffering financial loss. A contingent liability 
exists in relation to actual and likely potential legal proceedings.

Where it is determined that the disclosure of information in relation to a contingent liability can be expected to adversely prejudice the 
position of the AMP group (or its insurers) in a dispute, accounting standards allow AMP to not disclose such information. It is AMP’s policy 
that such information is not disclosed in this note.

Industry and regulatory compliance investigations
AMP is subject to review from time to time by regulators, both in Australia and offshore. In Australia, AMP’s principal regulators are APRA, 
ASIC, AUSTRAC and the ATO, although other government agencies may have jurisdiction depending on the circumstances. The reviews and 
investigations conducted by regulators may be industry-wide or specific to AMP and the outcomes of those reviews and investigations 
can vary and may lead, for example, to the imposition of penalties, disagreement with management’s position on judgemental matters 
including provisions and tax positions, variations or restrictions to licences, the compensation of clients, enforceable undertakings 
or recommendations and directions for AMP to enhance its control framework, governance and systems.

AMP regularly undertakes internal reviews, as part of ongoing monitoring and supervision activities, to determine, amongst other things, 
where clients or other stakeholders, including employees, may have been disadvantaged. In some instances, compensation has been paid 
and where the results of our reviews have reached the point that compensation is likely and can be reliably estimated then a provision has 
been raised. These provisions are judgemental and the actual compensation could vary from the amounts provided.

Litigation

SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTIONS
During May and June 2018, AMP Limited was served with five competing shareholder class actions; one filed in the Supreme Court of NSW 
and the others filed in the Federal Court of Australia. The actions follow the financial advice hearing block in the Royal Commission in April 
2018 and allege breaches by AMP Limited of its continuous disclosure obligations. Each action is on behalf of shareholders who acquired 
an interest in AMP Limited shares over a specified time period. Subsequently, the four proceedings commenced in the Federal Court 
of Australia were transferred to the Supreme Court of NSW. The Supreme Court of NSW determined that a consolidated class action (of two 
of the class actions) should continue, and the other three proceedings were permanently stayed. Following various appeals (including to the 
High Court of Australia), the consolidated class action continues. AMP Limited has filed its defence to the proceedings. The claims are yet 
to be quantified and participation has not been determined. Currently, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims, 
if any, upon AMP. AMP is defending these actions. 

SUPERANNUATION CLASS ACTIONS
During May and June 2019, certain subsidiaries of AMP Limited, namely, N.M. Superannuation Proprietary Limited (NM Super), AMP 
Superannuation Limited (AMP Super), NMMT Limited and AMP Services Limited (AMP Services), were served with two class actions in the 
Federal Court of Australia. The first of those class actions relates to the fees charged to members of certain of AMP superannuation 
funds. The second of those actions relates to the fees charged to members, and interest rates received and fees charged on cash-only 
fund options. The two proceedings were brought on behalf of certain superannuation clients and their beneficiaries. Subsequently, the 
Federal Court ordered that the two proceedings be consolidated into one class action. The AMP respondents have filed defences to the 
proceedings. The claims are yet to be quantified and participation has not been determined. Currently, it is not possible to determine the 
ultimate impact of these claims, if any, upon AMP. The proceedings are being defended.

FINANCIAL ADVISER CLASS ACTION
In July 2020, a subsidiary of AMP Limited, namely, AMP Financial Planning Pty Limited (AMPFP), was served with a class action in the Federal 
Court of Australia. The proceeding is brought on behalf of certain financial advisers who are or have been authorised by AMPFP. The claim 
relates to changes made by AMPFP to its Buyer of Last Resort policy in 2019. The claim is yet to be quantified and participation has not been 
determined. Currently, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this claim, if any, upon AMP. AMPFP has filed its defence to the 
proceedings, and AMPFP is confident in the actions it took in 2019 and is defending the proceeding accordingly. The trial of the proceeding 
was held during the course of October and November 2022, and the Court has reserved its decision. 

COMMISSIONS FOR ADVICE AND INSURANCE ADVICE CLASS ACTION
In July 2020, certain subsidiaries of AMP Limited, namely, AMPFP and Hillross Financial Services Limited (Hillross), were served with a class 
action in the Federal Court of Australia. The class action related to advice provided by some aligned financial advisers in respect of certain 
life and other insurance products. Subsequently, in August 2020, AMP Limited, and certain subsidiaries of AMP Limited, namely, AMPFP, 
Hillross and Charter Financial Planning Limited (Charter), were served with a class action in the Federal Court of Australia. The class action 
primarily related to the payment of commissions to some aligned financial advisers in respect of certain life insurance and other products 
and in respect of allegations of charging of fees where advice services were not provided. In December 2020, the Federal Court ordered that 
these two class actions be consolidated. The AMP respondents have filed a defence to the proceedings. The claim is yet to be quantified 
and participation has not been determined. Currently, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this claim, if any, upon AMP. 
The proceedings are being defended.

ASIC CIVIL PENALTY PROCEEDINGS IN RESPECT OF DECEASED CUSTOMERS
Certain subsidiaries of AMP Limited, namely, AMPFP, NM Super, AMP Super and AMP Services, are the subject of proceedings brought 
by ASIC on 26 May 2021. The proceedings allege contraventions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) and the Australian 
Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (ASIC Act) relating to the alleged charging and retention of insurance premiums and 
advice service fees following the death of members of superannuation funds in the period between 26 May 2015 and 31 August 2019. 
ASIC’s claim is in respect of 2,069 deceased members affected by the retention of premiums, and 27 deceased members affected by the 
retention of advice fees. AMP has completed remediation for customers identified as being affected by such instances.

ASIC is seeking declarations of contraventions of various sections of the Corporations Act and ASIC Act and orders for the payment of 
pecuniary penalties and other consequential orders. The AMP respondents filed a defence to the proceedings. A hearing to determine the 
quantum of penalties to be paid by the AMP defendants was held in December 2022, and the Court has reserved its decision. AMP’s best 
estimate of the likely penalties to be paid has been provided for as at 31 December 2022. The provision is judgemental and the actual 
penalty could vary from the amount provided.

ADDRESSING HISTORICAL MATTERS THROUGH REGULATOR ACTIONS
AMP has been working through a number of historical matters raised at the Royal Commission and elsewhere, and since 2018, has been 
taking action to strengthen assurance and operational controls, accountability and processes, improve compliance and risk management, 
and remediate impacted customers.

In 2021, AMP’s Superannuation Trustees (AMP Superannuation Limited and N.M. Superannuation Proprietary Limited) entered into 
an enforceable undertaking (EU) with APRA for historical matters in the Superannuation business. APRA has acknowledged that AMP has 
addressed and completed remediation for several matters, and at the completion of this EU, AMP envisages that all outstanding matters 
referred to APRA by the Financial Services Royal Commission will be concluded.

INDEMNITIES AND WARRANTIES TO RESOLUTION LIFE
Under the terms of the sale agreement for the sale of the wealth protection and mature businesses to Resolution Life Australia Pty 
Ltd (Resolution Life), AMP has given certain covenants, warranties and indemnities in favour of Resolution Life in connection with the 
transaction. Resolution Life has notified a number of potential breaches of these covenants. A breach of these covenants or warranties, 
or the triggering of an indemnity, may result in AMP being liable for some future payments to Resolution Life. Management’s best estimate 
of future payments for these indemnities and warranties has been recognised within these financial statements where they can be reliably 
estimated. There remain other indemnities and warranties for which no provision has been recognised and a contingent liability exists 
should such indemnities and warranties be called upon or where actual outcomes differ from management’s expectations. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The group recognises a provision where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the likely outcome. Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for management’s 
best estimates, however significant judgement is required to estimate likely outcomes and future cash flows. 
The judgemental nature of these items means that future amounts settled may be different from those provided for.

Report on the Financial Report for the Year Ended 31 December 2022

Qualified opinion
We have audited the financial report of AMP Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively the Group or AMP), which comprises 
the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies; and the directors’ declaration.

In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter described in the Basis for qualified opinion section of our report, the 
accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:
a. giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2022 and of their financial 

performance for the year ended on that date; and
b. complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.

Basis for qualified opinion
As disclosed in section 5.3 of the notes to the financial statements, the Company’s investment in China Life Pension Company (CLPC), 
a foreign associate accounted for using the equity method, is carried at $447 million on the consolidated statement of financial position 
at 31 December 2022. The Company’s share of CLPC’s post-tax net income of $47 million is included in the Company’s income for the year 
then ended. We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about the Company’s share of CLPC’s net income for the year and 
consequently the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in CLPC at 31 December 2022 to the extent this share of net income is 
included in the carrying amount, because the financial statements of CLPC are still in the process of being audited by CLPC’s auditor at the 
date of this report. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether any adjustments to these amounts were necessary.

Our opinion on the financial report for the year ended 31 December 2021 was similarly qualified. In the audit for the year ending 
31 December 2022, we were able to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to support the Company’s share of CLPC’s net income that 
was recorded in 2021 and consequently the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in CLPC as at 31 December 2021 to the extent 
it was impacted by this amount.

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional 
and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of 
the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matter described in the Basis for qualified opinion, 
we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. For each matter below, 
our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, 
including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures 
performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.

Report on the Financial Report for the Year Ended 31 December 2022

Qualified opinion
We have audited the financial report of AMP Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively the Group or AMP), which comprises 
the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies; and the directors’ declaration.

In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter described in the Basis for qualified opinion section of our report, the 
accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:
a. giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2022 and of their financial 

performance for the year ended on that date; and
b. complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.

Basis for qualified opinion
As disclosed in section 5.3 of the notes to the financial statements, the Company’s investment in China Life Pension Company (CLPC), 
a foreign associate accounted for using the equity method, is carried at $447 million on the consolidated statement of financial position 
at 31 December 2022. The Company’s share of CLPC’s post-tax net income of $47 million is included in the Company’s income for the year 
then ended. We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about the Company’s share of CLPC’s net income for the year and 
consequently the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in CLPC at 31 December 2022 to the extent this share of net income is 
included in the carrying amount, because the financial statements of CLPC are still in the process of being audited by CLPC’s auditor at the 
date of this report. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether any adjustments to these amounts were necessary.

Our opinion on the financial report for the year ended 31 December 2021 was similarly qualified. In the audit for the year ending 
31 December 2022, we were able to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to support the Company’s share of CLPC’s net income that 
was recorded in 2021 and consequently the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in CLPC as at 31 December 2021 to the extent 
it was impacted by this amount.

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional 
and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.

CREDIT PROVISIONS
Financial report reference: Section 2.1: Loans and advances, Section 3.3 Financial Risk Management

Why significant How our audit addressed the matter

As disclosed in section 2.1, the Group has loans and advances at 
31 December 2022, against which provisions for expected credit 
losses are required to be recorded in accordance with Australian 
Accounting standards.

This was a key audit matter due to the value of the provisions, 
and the degree of judgment and estimation uncertainty 
associated with the provision calculation.

Key areas of judgment included:
 – the application of the impairment requirements of AASB 9 

Financial Instruments within the Group’s expected credit 
loss methodology;

 – the identification of exposures with a significant 
deterioration in credit risk;

 – assumptions used in the expected credit loss model (for 
exposures assessed on an individual or collective basis); and

 – the incorporation of forward-looking information to reflect 
current and anticipated future external factors, including 
economic scenarios adopted and the probability weighting 
determined for each scenario.

Our audit procedures included the following:

 – We assessed the methodology of the Group’s expected 
credit loss model and its underlying methodology against 
the requirements of AASB 9.

 – We assessed the following for exposures evaluated 
on a collective basis and associated overlays:

 – significant modelling and forward-looking 
macroeconomic assumptions;

 – the basis for and data used to determine the provision 
at 31 December 2022; and

 – we involved our actuarial specialists to test the 
mathematical accuracy of the model and to assess 
key assumptions.

 – We examined a sample of exposures assessed on an 
individual basis by:

 – assessing the reasonableness and timeliness of internal 
credit quality assessments based on the borrowers’ 
particular circumstances; and

 – evaluating the associated provisions by assessing the 
reasonableness of key inputs into the calculation, with 
particular focus on collateral values, work out strategies 
and the value and timing of recoveries.

 – We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the 
notes to the financial statements.

PROVISIONS, IMPAIRMENT & CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Financial report reference: 6.3 Right of use assets and lease liabilities, 6.4 Provisions and contingent liabilities

Why significant How our audit addressed the matter

As disclosed in section 6.3 and 6.4, the Group has recorded 
provisions, impairment charges and disclosed contingent 
liabilities as follows:

 – provisions for client remediation and compliance matters;
 – impairment of right of use assets;
 – provisions for onerous lease contracts; and
 – contingent liability disclosures in relation to existing 

class actions, ASIC civil penalty proceedings, industry 
and regulatory matters and indemnities and warranties 
to Resolution Life.

These were considered key audit matters due to the judgment 
required to determine reasonable estimates.

Key areas of judgment included:
 – the decision as to whether to recognise a provision and/or 

disclose a contingent liability, including whether there was 
a present obligation as a result of past events and whether 
sufficient information existed to allow a provision to be 
reliably measured; and

 – key assumptions used to determine provisions and 
impairment charges, including:

 – the estimates of compensation amounts and costs 
required to complete the remediation programs and

 – vacancy periods, discount rate and sub-lease rental 
estimate increases for onerous lease provisions and 
right of use impairment.

Our audit procedures included the following:

 – We held discussions with management, reviewed Board 
of Directors and Board committee minutes, reviewed 
correspondence with regulators and attended Board Audit 
Committee and Board Risk and Compliance Committee 
meetings to understand key regulatory, compliance and 
legal matters.

 – We assessed the Group’s key assumptions used to determine 
provisions and impairment charges, which included 
benchmarking vacancy periods and rental estimates and the 
assessment of the reasonableness of useful lives. 

 – For those matters where the Group determined that either 
a present obligation as a result of a past event did not exist, 
or where a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation could not be made and for which no provisions 
have been recognised, we assessed the basis for the 
conclusions.

 – We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the 
notes to the financial statements.

TAXATION
Financial report reference: Section 1.4: Taxes

Why significant How our audit addressed the matter

As presented in the consolidated statement of financial position 
and Section 1.4, the Group has significant tax balances as 
at 31 December 2022, being a current tax asset of $76 million, 
a current tax liability of $57 million, a deferred tax asset of $556 
million, and a deferred tax liability of $5 million. 

Due to the complexity and high level of judgment required in the 
following areas, we considered this to be a key audit matter:

 – the tax consequences of recent changes to the entities 
within the AMP Limited tax consolidated group;

 – estimating future taxable income and assessing the 
recoverability of tax losses and other deferred tax assets in 
future years; and

 – the adequacy of provisioning and assessing the recoverability 
of current tax.

Our audit procedures included the following:

 – We involved our tax specialists to assess the application of 
tax laws and regulations in the determination of the Group’s 
tax balances, including the Group’s assessment of the impact 
of entities leaving and joining the tax consolidated group on 
the determination of tax balances.

 – We examined the Group’s deferred tax asset recoverability 
assessment and evaluated the reasonableness of key 
assumptions, including: 

 – analysing the Group’s growth and other key assumptions 
and reviewing tax adjustments made to the Group’s 
profit forecasts to determine future taxable income; and

 – reviewing and assessing the Group’s analysis to 
determine the period over which deferred tax assets 
attributable to tax losses are forecast to be utilised.

 – We considered management’s assessment of the 
recoverability of current tax assets including the underlying 
tax principles applied and management forecasts.

 – We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the 
notes to the financial statements.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Why significant How our audit addressed the matter

 – A significant part of the Group’s operations and financial 
reporting processes are primarily reliant on IT systems for the 
processing and recording of a high volume of transactions.

 – The group-wide IT environment is complex in terms of 
the scale and nature of IT systems relied upon. IT General 
Controls (ITGCs) support the continuous operation of the 
automated and other IT dependent controls within the 
business processes related to financial reporting. Effective 
ITGCs are required to ensure that IT applications process 
business data as expected and that changes are made in 
an appropriate manner.

 – A fundamental component of these IT systems and controls 
is ensuring that risks relating to inappropriate user access 
management, unauthorised program changes and IT 
operating protocols are addressed.

 –  During our audit planning, we identified User Access 
Management including IT privileged access controls for 
applications that are critical to financial reporting is of 
a heightened risk and therefore this is considered to be 
a key audit matter.

 – We focused our audit procedures on those IT systems and 
controls that are significant to the Group’s financial reporting 
process.

 – We involved our IT specialists to assist with audit procedures 
over IT systems and controls.

 – We assessed the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of the Group’s IT controls, including those 
related to user access management, change and operating 
management and data integrity.

 – Where we identified design and/or operating deficiencies 
in the IT control environment, our procedures included the 
following:

 – we assessed the integrity and reliability of the systems 
and data related to financial reporting; and

 – where automated procedures were supported by 
systems with identified deficiencies, we assessed 
compensating or mitigating controls that were not 
reliant on the IT control environment. This involved 
varying the nature, timing and extent of audit 
procedures performed.

Information Other than the Financial Report and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s 2022 
Annual Report other than the financial report and our auditor’s report thereon. 

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. 

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report
The directors of the Group are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with 
Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 – Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 – Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. 

 – Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the directors.

 – Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 

 – Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial 
report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 – Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group 
to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. 
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated to the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
report of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

producing operating assets) attributed to business units (including Group Office). The return on AMP Bank

to the working capital requirements of the business unit.

market adjustment has been abolished, with reported investment income now reflecting actual, rather than 
forecast, investment returns.

Performance right A form of executive remuneration designed to reward long-term performance. Selected executives are 
granted performance rights. Each performance right is a right to acquire one AMP share after a performance 
period if a specific performance hurdle is met.

Practice finance loans Business loans provided to AMP aligned financial advisers, which are secured by a General Security Agreement 
over the adviser’s business assets, including the client servicing rights, or other assets. Commercial lending 
credit policy, process and rates apply to these loans.
