Investing in growth 
Innovating for sustainability

Why have we embarked on our largest 
capital expenditure program ever?

Because we believe the world’s need for affordable, 
reliable, and sustainable energy will continue to grow, 

and we plan to grow our lower carbon intensity 
crude oil production with it.

Because increasing our gas production will meet 
growing domestic demand, expanding our 
liquids-to-chemicals capabilities de-risks our 
Upstream production, and using innovation 
and technology helps us find potential new 

pathways to a lower-carbon future.

And because we support a practical, stable 
and inclusive energy transition.

Achieving record-setting 
performance and positioning 
ourselves for the future

Dear Shareholders, 
2022 brought a strong recovery in crude oil 
prices, but also ongoing uncertainty in the global 
economy. Within this context Aramco remained 
steadfast in its purpose: to provide energy 
security to our customers while also doing our 
part to support a more practical, stable and 
inclusive energy transition.

I am immensely proud to report that in 2022 
Aramco achieved a record-setting financial 
performance as a listed company. Our net 
income for the year was SAR 604.0 billion  
($161.1 billion). This result allowed the Company 
to strengthen its balance sheet as we embarked 
on our largest ever capital spending program. 
Following this financial performance, the  
Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend 
of SAR 73.2 billion ($19.5 billion) for the fourth 
quarter of 2022, which raises the quarterly 
dividend by 4.0% compared to the previous 
quarter. This aligns with our dividend policy 
aiming to deliver a sustainable and progressive 
dividend. The Board has also recommended 
granting eligible shareholders one new additional 
bonus share for every 10 shares they hold.

These results are a testament to the character 
and dedication of our people, who have 
consistently shown they can generate value 
through changing market conditions. Increasing 
our cash dividend and recommending to grant 
bonus shares to eligible shareholders demonstrates 
our commitment to deliver value to our investors. 

Strength, stability, solutions
We recognize that our results in 2022 were due 
in part to higher oil prices that were driven by  
a number of factors including global demand, 
geopolitical events, and long-term underinvestment 
in our industry. 

This reality supports our Upstream strategy to 
focus on large-scale investment in new production, 
including growing our gas business and raising 
our crude oil Maximum Sustainable Capacity from 
12.0 to 13.0 mmbpd. With energy demand expected 
to keep rising and planned industry investments 
failing to offset natural oil field depletion rates,  
we believe that extra capacity will be important  
to the global energy mix in the years ahead. 

“ The future will most certainly favor the 
lowest-cost, least carbon-intensive 
producers, and Aramco is exceptionally  
well-placed in this respect.”

Chairman’s message



At the same time, we are continuing to build  
our Downstream business into a world-class 
operation. In 2022 we progressed with refining 
and chemicals projects in Saudi Arabia and Asia, 
while also expanding our presence in Europe.

Aramco’s Downstream strategy reflects our  
belief that a significant share of future oil 
demand will come from petrochemicals, not  
least from products which are essential inputs  
for the energy transition. We estimate, for 
example, that eight to 11 tons of chemical 
products are required to produce one megawatt  
of renewable energy, on average. Aramco, for  
its part, is preparing for this future by expanding 
the integration of our refining and chemicals 
facilities, and investing in large-scale liquids-to-
chemicals projects. 

Investing in the Kingdom’s economic 
development
In 2022 we continued to scale our investments  
in the Kingdom’s industrial economy, which  
each year grows more diversified and dynamic. 
The Company is targeting five strategic domains 
— sustainability, digital, industrial, manufacturing, 
and social innovation — all of which complement 
Aramco’s supply chain. Today we offer support 
to companies at every stage of the growth cycle, 
from start-ups to small- and medium-enterprises 
to companies with the potential to become Saudi 
national champions. In March 2023, we signed a 
framework agreement with the Kingdom’s Private 
Sector Partnership Reinforcement Program — 
known as Shareek — as we seek to foster new 
businesses and contribute to the Kingdom’s 
economic development. 

This strategy enhances Aramco’s supply chain 
resilience, helping to ensure that more of the 
products and services we rely on can be provided 
right on our doorstep. It is also creating jobs for 
our fellow citizens.

The future favors Aramco
The global energy transition is both a long-term 
challenge and opportunity to leverage Aramco’s 
strengths and capabilities to deliver increasingly 
sustainable energy solutions. This past year has 
also highlighted the scale and complexity of 
what is required to meet the energy security 
challenges of the future.

No single solution will address the challenge 
ahead. No single technology will provide the 
energy necessary to support a $100 trillion global 
economy. Leveraging our unique scale and 
resources, we are exploring multiple pathways  
to support our aspirations for a lower-carbon 
future for Aramco, including energy efficiency, 
carbon capture, utilization, and storage, carbon 
offsetting, and renewables. 

Ultimately, we believe the world will continue  
to need oil and gas for the foreseeable future. 
Indeed, the future will most certainly favor the 
lowest-cost, least carbon-intensive producers, and 
Aramco is exceptionally well-placed in this respect.

Supporting our customers, our partners 
and the nation to decarbonize
It makes sense for the Company to focus first  
on the greenhouse gas emissions we can directly 
influence — our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
from wholly-owned operated assets — while also 
supporting our customers’ efforts to decarbonize. 

This is why we continue to work closely with the 
automotive industry to develop lower-carbon 
synthetic fuels and high efficiency engines, and 
with the materials industry to develop solutions 
to complement steel and cement. For industries 
with hard-to-abate emissions, we plan to be a 
significant exporter of lower-carbon hydrogen 
which has the potential to assist with renewable 
energy storage. 2022 saw further work to 
develop this vital new market. 

We remain committed supporters of the Saudi 
Green Initiative (SGI) — a massive program of 
reforestation and clean energy deployment in 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — as well as the 
SGI’s regional counterpart, the Middle East Green 
Initiative. We strongly back the Kingdom’s aim to 
reach net-zero emissions by 2060 through the 
circular carbon economy approach, which is 
supported by our ambition to achieve net-zero 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2050 across wholly-owned operated assets. 

The foundation for Aramco’s success
I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute  
to the leadership of the Custodian of the  
Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz 
Al-Saud, and His Royal Highness Prince 
Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, 
Crown Prince and Prime Minister of the  
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Their vision for  
the future of the Kingdom is an inspiration  
and a guide to everyone at Aramco. I also  
want to thank the Kingdom’s Ministry of  
Energy for their continued support of Aramco.

Our success in 2022 would also not have  
been possible without our people — a brilliant 
team of skilled professionals who are deeply 
dedicated to their work and mission. 

Finally, my thanks go out to you, our 
shareholders, for continuing to place your  
trust in our great Company.

Creating value and  
delivering our strategy

Dear Shareholders, 
For Aramco, 2022 was a year with notable 
achievements on a number of significant fronts.

Financially, the Company recorded its highest 
annual profits as a listed company as global 
crude oil prices strengthened compared to the 
previous year. Operationally, we embarked on 
the largest capital expenditure program in 
Aramco’s history, driven by our growth strategy 
and net-zero ambition.

Geographically, we continued to broaden our 
Downstream portfolio with strategic investments, 
including in Asia and Europe. Meanwhile, locally 
we expanded our efforts to further strengthen 
our supply chain while simultaneously helping 
drive in-Kingdom economic growth.

Preserving upstream preeminence
While there are some who maintain that anyone 
still expanding their hydrocarbon production 
capacity is going to end up on the wrong side  
of history, we firmly believe we are on the right 
side of reality. The simple fact is that the world  
is expected to continue to need oil and gas for 
the foreseeable future — as a source of energy 
and also as foundational building blocks for 
countless everyday products. At the same time, 
we are aiming to significantly reduce oil and  
gas emissions.

Accordingly, in 2022 we continued to strengthen 
our crude oil production capabilities. This 
included ongoing work to raise our crude oil 
Maximum Sustainable Capacity by an additional 
one million barrels per day by 2027. We expect 
the Marjan and Berri offshore increments to 
come onstream in 2025.

Development of the Jafurah unconventional gas 
field continues, with initial production expected 
to commence in 2025, gradually increasing to  
2.0 bscfd by 2030. Meanwhile, the Hawiyah 
Unayzah Gas Reservoir Storage, the first 
underground natural gas storage project in the 
Kingdom, has commenced injection activities. 

“ We are strategically positioning Aramco 
to be a key player in a practical, stable 
and inclusive global energy transition.”

President and CEO’s message



The project aims to enable surplus natural gas  
to be reinjected into the reservoir during 
off-peak periods and reintroduced into the 
Master Gas System as demand increases.

During the year, our exploration activities 
resulted in the discovery of two unconventional 
gas fields in the Kingdom’s eastern region.

Expanding downstream integration
In 2022 we also made a number of important 
strides to enhance our global Downstream 
business in target geographies and markets. 

In Asia, Aramco and our S-OIL affiliate made a 
final investment decision to develop one of the 
world’s largest refinery-integrated petrochemical 
steam crackers in South Korea, which aligns with 
our strategy to maximize the crude-to-chemicals 
value chain. The project represents the first 
large-scale commercialization of our thermal 
crude-to-chemicals technology. We also 
announced our decision to participate in the 
development of a liquids-to-chemicals complex 
in northeast China.

In Europe, we closed transactions to acquire  
a 30% stake in a refinery in Poland, sole 
ownership of an associated wholesale business, 
and a 50% stake in a jet fuel marketing joint 
venture. Through these transactions we 
expanded our downstream European presence 
and increased our integrated refining and 
petrochemicals capacity.

In August 2022, we signed an equity purchase 
agreement for Valvoline’s global products 
business. This acquisition transaction, which  
is expected to complement Aramco’s own line  
of premium-branded lubricant products, closed 
in March 2023.

Here in the Kingdom, we have made a final 
investment decision with our partner, 
TotalEnergies, to construct a petrochemical 
complex in Jubail that seeks to convert internally 
produced refinery off-gases and naphtha into 
higher value chemicals. 

Aramco’s integration of SABIC continues to 
progress ahead of plan with synergies being 
realized in multiple areas. Our goal is to  
leverage the significant potential of our  
products to meet rising global demand for 
petrochemicals, which we believe will be critical 
to the materials transition required to support  
a lower-carbon future.

Advancing our net-zero ambition
We see the world’s shift towards a lower-carbon 
energy future as not only an obligation, but also 
an opportunity. Indeed, as one of the more 
reliable suppliers, lower-cost and lower carbon-
intensive producers of crude oil in the world, 
Aramco has a number of competitive advantages.

As part of our journey towards net-zero, Aramco 
announced the creation of a SAR 5.6 billion  
($1.5 billion) sustainability-focused venture 
capital fund that will be among the largest of  
its kind globally. In partnership with the Ministry 
of Energy, we signed a Joint Development 
Agreement to begin building one of the biggest 
carbon capture and storage hubs in the world.

In collaboration with SABIC Agri-Nutrients,  
we also delivered the world’s first accredited 
commercial shipment of lower-carbon blue 
ammonia. And we were one of the first ever 
purchasers of carbon credits in the regional 
Voluntary Carbon Market’s inaugural auction.

Localizing our supply chain
We continue to encourage the development of 
materials and manufacturing capabilities within 
the Kingdom as part of our ongoing efforts to 
improve the resiliency of Aramco’s supply chain 
and support national economic development.

In 2022 this included building on our iktva 
program as we entered into over 90 agreements 
to build long-term collaborative relationships 
with strategic local suppliers. In January 2023, 
we signed over 100 agreements and Memoranda 
of Understanding at the 7th edition of the iktva 
Forum and Exhibition to help advance a diverse, 
sustainable, and globally competitive industrial 
ecosystem. We embarked on a major expansion 
of our Namaat industrial investment program,  
as well as launching Taleed, a new program 
dedicated to accelerating the growth of small- 
and medium-enterprises in the Kingdom. We 
have also signed a framework agreement with 
the Kingdom’s Shareek program that will support 
our efforts to both localize our supply chain and 
expand domestic economic growth.

Additionally, to build local artificial intelligence 
(AI) technology capacity, Aramco and a private 
sector partner announced the establishment of  
a Global AI Corridor. Designed to develop and 
commercialize complex AI solutions, the Corridor 
will also train Saudi talent, support start-ups, and 
build a local AI ecosystem. 

Continuing to create value
In 2022, Aramco delivered an exceptional 
performance. The greatest reason for this success 
is the dedication and commitment of the men and 
women of Aramco. Each day they come to work 
united by the knowledge they are creating value 
for our shareholders and our customers, as well 
as contributing to the prosperity and progress of 
countries and communities around the world.

Looking ahead, we remain well-placed to adapt 
as required and respond as necessary to changing 
market conditions. As the actions and activities 
outlined in this Report suggest, we are strategically 
positioning Aramco to be a key player in a practical, 
stable and inclusive global energy transition.

One of the world’s largest integrated 
energy and chemicals companies
Overview
Aramco is one of the world’s largest  
integrated energy and chemicals companies. 
Aramco’s operating segments are Upstream  
and Downstream, which are supported by 
corporate activities. Aramco’s Upstream 
operations are primarily based in Saudi Arabia, 
while the Downstream business is global. 

In 2022, Aramco’s average hydrocarbon 
production was 13.6 mmboed, including total 
liquids of 11.5 mmbpd. As at December 31, 2022, 
based on the initial 40-year period and 20-year 
extension of the Concession, Aramco’s reserves 
stood at 258.8 billion boe, including 200.8 billion 
barrels of crude oil and condensate, 25.2 billion 
barrels of NGL, and 201.9 tscf of natural gas. In 
addition, as at December 31, 2022, Aramco had  
a gross refining capacity of 7.1 mmbpd and net 
chemicals production capacity of 56.31 million 
tons per year. 

Upstream
The Upstream segment’s activities consist of 
exploring for, developing, and producing  
crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGL.  
The Government determines the Kingdom’s 
maximum level of crude oil production in the 
exercise of its sovereign prerogative and requires 
Aramco to maintain Maximum Sustainable 
Capacity (MSC). As at December 31, 2022, 
Aramco’s MSC was maintained at 12.0 mmbpd of 
crude oil. Aramco’s principal fields are located in 
close proximity to each other within the Central 

and Eastern Provinces of the Kingdom.  
An extensive pipeline network connects 
Aramco’s fields, processing plants, and other 
facilities. The produced crude oil, condensate, 
natural gas and NGL travel through Aramco’s 
pipelines to multiple facilities for processing  
into refined and petrochemical products, or  
to domestic customers or export terminals.

Aramco is the exclusive supplier of natural gas  
in the Kingdom and its gas portfolio is rich in 
liquids, demonstrated by the production of both 
NGL and unblended condensate. Aramco owns 
and operates the Master Gas System (MGS), 
which is an extensive network of pipelines that 
connects its key gas production and processing 
sites throughout the Kingdom.

Aramco seeks to further expand its oil and  
gas reserves through new field discoveries,  
new reservoir additions in existing fields,  
and delineation and reassessment of existing 
reservoirs and fields.

Downstream
Aramco has a large and growing, strategically 
integrated global downstream business that 
provides opportunities to secure and de-risk 
liquids demand and capture incremental value 
from the hydrocarbon supply chain by selling  
to its dedicated system of domestic and 
international refineries and petrochemical plants. 
The Downstream segment’s activities consist  
of refining and petrochemicals, base oils and 

Aramco’s hydrocarbon 
reserves under the 
Concession agreement

Business overview



lubricants, retail operations, distribution,  
supply and trading, and power generation. 
Together, these support the Upstream and 
Downstream businesses by enabling optimization 
of crude oil sales and product placement through 
Aramco’s significant infrastructure network of 
pipelines and terminals, and to access shipping 
and logistics resources. 

Aramco’s downstream investments diversify its 
revenue and integrate its oil and gas operations 
to optimize value across the hydrocarbon chain, 
supporting crude oil and gas demand and 
facilitating the placement of its crude oil. Aramco 
also has an integrated petrochemicals business 
within its Downstream segment that produces 
basic chemicals, such as aromatics, olefins and 
polyolefins, as well as more complex products, 
such as polyols, isocyanates and synthetic rubber. 

Corporate
Aramco’s Upstream and Downstream segments, 
as well as the overall business, are supported  
by corporate activities. These include technical 
services essential to the success of Aramco’s core 
business, as well as human resources, finance, 
legal, corporate affairs and IT. The integrated 
corporate development organization optimizes 
Aramco’s asset portfolio by assessing and

Continued energy demand growth

Global
Despite geopolitical tensions, high inflation and 
sharply rising interest rates that formed strong 
economic headwinds, the global economy 
expanded by an estimated 3.1% in 2022, 
compared to 6.1% in 2021. Global GDP growth  
is expected to slow to a meager 1.5% in 2023  
as these headwinds are expected to continue  
into 2023.1

In 2022 worldwide oil demand is estimated to 
have increased by 2.5 mmbpd to 99.8 mmbpd, 
while global oil supply is estimated to have 
averaged 100.8 mmbpd.2 Despite this 
oversupplied position, the ICE Brent crude  
oil price averaged $99 per barrel in 2022, 
approximately 39.8% higher than the average  
of $71 per barrel in 2021, as market conditions  
in the first half of the year drove prices to  
a peak of $128 per barrel.

Domestic
The Kingdom’s GDP is estimated to have grown 
by 8.7% in 2022 compared to 3.9% growth in 
2021, driven by the continued economic recovery 
from the COVID-19 pandemic which fueled a 
15.4% growth in oil activities. Non-oil activities 
rose 5.4%, including Government services 
activities which grew 2.6%.3 

In line with robust economic performance, 
domestic energy demand grew by an estimated 
6.3% in 2022. Demand growth was particularly 
strong for the transportation sector, which 
witnessed a rise of about 9.2% largely on the back  
of continued recovery in international air travel.

Market overview



Aramco seeks to deliver value across four dimensions:

Profitability 
By reinforcing  
its competitive 
positions across  
its upstream and 
downstream 
activities.

Resilience 
Both operational and financial, 
enabling the Company to declare 
dividends on a regular basis with  
a view to building long-term

Strategy in action

the mandated MSC. The spare capacity afforded 
by maintaining an MSC provides operational 
flexibility to increase its production. While 
Aramco has a robust field maintenance 
philosophy that emphasizes the reliability  
of its upstream operations, the MSC provides  
an alternative supply option in the event of 
unplanned production outages. 

Aramco utilizes term agreements for selling 
crude oil to major consumers globally. These 
agreements provide supply predictability to 
customers by standardizing price and delivery 
terms to major regional demand centers.  
Aramco continues to invest in its sophisticated 
and extensive crude oil distribution and  
dispatch system, which maintains Aramco’s 
supply reliability. 

The Company also seeks to preserve its position 
as one of the world’s lowest upstream carbon 
intensive sources of crude oil production.

Gas
Aramco plans to further expand its gas business, 
including the development of its unconventional 
gas resources, increasing production and 
investing in additional infrastructure to meet  
the large and growing domestic demand for 
lower-cost energy. Domestic gas demand growth 
is driven by power generation, water desalination, 
petrochemical production, and other industrial 
consumption in the Kingdom. 

An important additional benefit of Aramco’s gas 
production is the significant NGL and condensate 
yields, which supplement crude oil production 
and provide feedstock to the refining and 
petrochemical industries.

Upstream preeminence

Oil
Aramco intends to maintain its position as the 
world’s largest crude oil company by production 
volume. Its reserves, operational capabilities and 
spare capacity allow it to increase production in 
response to demand. 

Notwithstanding the energy transition, global 
demand for crude oil is expected to continue to 
increase for many years to come. To meet this 
demand, new oil discoveries and developments 
will be needed to offset the natural decline in 
production from currently producing fields. 
Aramco believes there has been significant 
industry-wide underinvestment in crude oil 
exploration and production by other companies 
which could result in a supply gap in the mid- to 
long-term. Aramco intends to continue to invest 
in crude oil exploration and production through 
oil price cycles in order to meet this expected 
continued global demand growth, and believes 
that its low lifting costs, low capital intensity  
and lower upstream carbon intensity uniquely 
position it to benefit from these investments. 
Aramco believes that it produces crude oil with 
one of the lowest upstream carbon intensities, 
which positions it to benefit from continued 
pressure on the oil and gas industry to reduce  
the environmental impact of the industry’s 
operations. Through reliable and lower carbon 
intensity production, Aramco aims to support 
energy access and security through the  
energy transition.

The Company maintains its level of crude oil 
production by balancing production between 
maturing areas and newer production sources, 
tapping into new reservoirs when required to 
optimize the depletion rate of its fields. It also 
maintains its low-cost position due to the unique 
nature of the Kingdom’s geological formations, 
favorable onshore and shallow water offshore 
environments in which Aramco’s reservoirs are 
located, synergies from Aramco’s use of its large 
infrastructure and logistics networks, its low 
depletion rate operational model, and its scaled 
application of technology. 

Aramco seeks to maintain its position as one  
of the world’s most reliable crude oil suppliers. 
The Government determines the Kingdom’s 
maximum level of crude oil production in the 
exercise of its sovereign prerogative and requires 
Aramco to maintain an MSC in excess of its 
current production in accordance with the 
Hydrocarbons Law. 

In line with the Government’s mandate to 
increase crude oil MSC to 13.0 mmbpd, Aramco  
is proceeding with plans to gradually reach  

Aramco intends to gradually 
increase crude oil Maximum 
Sustainable Capacity from  
12.0 mmbpd to 13.0 mmbpd.

Strategy in action

Downstream integration

Aramco intends to continue the strategic 
integration of its Upstream and Downstream 
businesses to facilitate the placement of the 
Company’s crude oil in larger offtake volumes 
through a dedicated system of domestic and 
international wholly-owned and affiliated 
refineries, allowing it to capture additional  
value across the hydrocarbon chain, expand  
its sources of earnings, and provide resilience  
to oil price volatility. 

Aramco’s 70% equity interest in SABIC supports 
the significant expansion of Aramco’s downstream 
activities, particularly in its chemicals business, 
and provides additional opportunities for Aramco 
to supply mixed feedstock of crude oil, refinery 
products and gas to manufacture petrochemical 
products. Changing patterns of demand, 
including growth in chemicals demand and  
the long-term risk of decline in fuels demand,  
are driving the Company’s strategy to favor 
investments in facilities with high liquids-to-
chemicals conversion rates.

Geographically, Aramco intends to enhance both 
its domestic and global Downstream businesses 
in key high-growth geographies such as China, 
India and Southeast Asia, which are integral to 
Aramco’s existing business and future expansion 
strategy, as well as in other attractive markets. 
Aramco also intends to maintain its presence in 
key large countries, such as the United States, 
and in countries that rely on imported crude oil, 
such as Japan and South Korea.

Aramco continues to expand global recognition 
of its brands. One aspect of this strategy is to 
introduce its brands to existing domestic and 
international marketing businesses, including  
at retail service stations, and further develop its 
petrochemicals, base oil and lubricants brands. 
As new marketing activities are added to its 
business portfolio, Aramco intends to use its  
own brands to build recognition of its position  
in the global energy sector. 

Upstream crude oil production utilized  
by Aramco’s downstream operations

Aramco’s dedicated system of domestic and international refineries 
provide secure demand for Upstream crude production.

Aramco aims to grow its business sustainably  
by leveraging technology and innovation to 
lower its climate impact. The Company intends  
to maintain its position amongst the leaders  
in upstream carbon intensity, with one of  
the lowest carbon footprints per unit of 
hydrocarbons produced.

Lower-carbon initiatives

Key enablers

Aramco’s strategy for lower carbon intensity 
energy, which seeks to address climate-related 
risks and opportunities, aims to de-risk its 
businesses and maintain competitiveness and 
differentiation in carbon-constrained scenarios.

The strategy has two main dimensions: lower the 
net carbon emissions of the Company’s operations 
over time with the ambition to achieve net-zero 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 
across wholly-owned operated assets by 2050; 
and develop lower-carbon products and solutions 
across the energy, chemicals, and materials space.
• Lowering the Company’s own net carbon 

emissions calls for managing, reducing, and 
balancing carbon emissions across operations 
through a raft of measures that span efficiency 
gains, renewable power, carbon capture, utilization, 
and storage, and multiple offset initiatives. 

• Developing lower-carbon products and 
solutions aims primarily to sustain and diversify 
demand for oil and gas through competitive 
technologies and selective business initiatives. 
These include blue hydrogen and ammonia, 
lower-carbon fuels, and gas to complement 
renewables in the domestic energy mix and to 
reduce liquids-burning in power generation. 
These initiatives are expected to help the 
Company participate in the growing market for 
lower-carbon products and solutions. Aramco  
is pursuing offering carbon capture and storage 
as a service to third parties, and is pursuing 
investments in renewables that align with its 
other lower-carbon initiatives.

People
Aramco recognizes the need to prepare its workforce  
of the future, thereby ensuring the Company’s capabilities 
match the requirements of its strategy. There are two key 
dimensions to this enabler:
• Enabling the Company’s growth ambitions by advancing 

technical and professional skills, developing commercial 
and leadership competencies, and supporting the 
progress of localization.

•  Making the Company more sustainable, with a focus  
on diversity and inclusion.

Technology
Aramco’s technology program aims to develop new solutions 
for its Upstream and Downstream businesses, and to help  
in diversifying its product portfolio and grow its business 
sustainably. An increasing share of its investment in 
technology and research and development addresses the 
sustainability objective. Such sustainability requires not only 
fast and large-scale deployment of existing solutions, such  
as renewable energy, carbon capture, utilization, and storage, 
and nature-based solutions, but also the creation and 
advancement of new lower-carbon solutions that aim  
to have both environmental and commercial potential. 

Strategy in action

Aramco  
is targeting the 

production of up to

11 million tons
of blue ammonia

Localization and the promotion 
of national champions

In addition to Aramco’s core businesses, the 
Company is seeking to foster new businesses  
that will increase the long-term reliability and 
competitiveness of the Company’s ecosystem, as 
well as contributing to the Kingdom’s economic 
development. This is key to ensuring Aramco’s 
long-term cost and productivity leadership, 
sustainability, and resilience. The objectives  
are two-fold: to localize the Company’s supply 
chain and promote national champions.

• Aramco aims to strengthen its supply chain 
through its localization efforts and utilizes  
the Kingdom’s Shareek program which 
provides a framework to incentivize in-
Kingdom investments. As part of this strategy, 
Aramco seeks to increase the use of in-
Kingdom suppliers of goods and services  
to 70.0% through its in-Kingdom Total Value 
Add (iktva) program.

• Through its Namaat industrial investment 
program, Aramco intends to drive continued 
growth and development of a resilient and 
sustainable domestic supply chain to 
strengthen and expand the in-Kingdom  
private sector.

• The Company’s Taleed program seeks to 
accelerate the growth of small- and medium-
enterprises (SMEs) across multiple sectors in the 
sustainability, digital, manufacturing, industrial, 
and social innovation domains.

Technology
Examples of the new solutions that Aramco believes will 
positively impact its business sustainability, and which  
are being actively pursued, include:
• Directly converting liquids to chemicals;
•  Producing hydrogen from hydrocarbons while capturing  

and storing associated emissions;
•  Expanding nonmetallic applications;
•  Accelerating large-scale deployment of carbon capture, 

utilization, and storage;
•  Enabling sustainable transport through more efficient 

engines and lower-carbon fuels; and
•  Accelerating technology-based offsetting solutions,  

such as direct air capture.

Portfolio optimization
Through portfolio optimization, Aramco seeks to unlock 
value, enhance its capital structure and reallocate capital  
to higher growth and return investments. Aramco has a 
comprehensive and disciplined internal approval process 
for capital expenditures, new projects and debt issuance.  
It analyzes future projects based on strategic, operational, 
commercial, and financial targets. Aramco’s unique 
reserves and resource base, operational flexibility, field 
management practices, and strong cash flow generation 
serve as a foundation for its low gearing and flexibility  
to allocate capital.

Strategy in action

Aramco intends to enhance both its domestic and global 
Downstream businesses in key high-growth geographies. 

In 2022, Aramco’s Malaysia-based investment in refining and 
petrochemical joint ventures with PETRONAS, collectively 
known as PRefChem, restarted operations and is ramping up 
gradually with a continued focus on safety and sustainability.

Capturing growth opportunities 
and generating long-term value

“ Aramco’s unprecedented financial results 
for 2022 reinforce our ability to generate 
consistent value for our shareholders 
across price cycles, while also providing 
energy supply stability to our customers.”

Dear Shareholders, 
In 2022, Aramco delivered exceptional  
financial results with unrivaled profitability 
despite continued economic uncertainty in the 
global economy.

The year itself was divided into two distinct parts 
for the energy market. In the first half, we saw 
upward pressure on energy prices driven by low 
crude and refined product inventories, as well as 
geopolitical events. In the second half of 2022, 
market conditions softened as global inflationary 
concerns impacted growth in crude oil demand. 

Throughout 2022, we continued our long-standing 
emphasis on maintaining a robust balance sheet, 
cash generating ability, prudent cash and debt 
management, as well as delivering exceptional 
shareholder returns. For the year ended 
December 31, 2022, Aramco posted record net 
income as a public company of SAR 604.0 billion 
($161.1 billion) and free cash flow of SAR 557.0 
billion ($148.5 billion). We generated strong 
capital returns with ROACE of 31.6%, and 
continued to strengthen our balance sheet  
as reflected by our gearing ratio improving to 
(7.9)% compared to 12.0% at the end of 2021. 

Following these results, the Board of Directors 
declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of  
SAR 73.2 billion ($19.5 billion), representing a 
4.0% increase compared to the previous quarter, 
as aligned with our dividend policy aiming to 
deliver a sustainable and progressive dividend. 
Additionally, the Board has recommended 
capitalizing SAR 15.0 billion ($4.0 billion) of 
retained earnings to support the distribution  
of bonus shares to eligible shareholders in the 
amount of one share for every 10 shares held. 

Supporting our growth ambitions
Aramco’s financial framework is designed to 
support our growth ambitions by providing 
significant flexibility to navigate through crude 
oil price cycles, while also creating long-term 
value for our shareholders.

CFO’s message



This framework continues to be supported by 
three main pillars, the first of which is the prudent 
optimization of Aramco’s capital structure in order 
to maintain a high investment-grade credit rating 
with sufficient capacity. During the year we 
strategically directed cash flow towards 
deleveraging our balance sheet, making partial 
prepayments totaling SAR 66.8 billion ($17.8 
billion) of the deferred consideration related  
to the SABIC acquisition, thereby reducing the 
principal amounts of the associated promissory 
notes. This resulted in savings of approximately 
SAR 8.3 billion ($2.2 billion).

The second pillar of our financial framework 
centers on continuing to diversify our funding 
sources and optimize funding costs to provide 
maximum optionality and execution flexibility. 
In 2022, this included signing a five-year 
agreement for SAR 37.5 billion ($10.0 billion) to 
replace certain unsecured revolving credit facilities.

The third and final pillar is maintaining our 
capital discipline and financial prudence through 
crude oil price cycles. We believe oil and gas  
will remain a key part of the energy mix over  
the longer term in order to satisfy the world’s 
need for affordable, reliable and stable energy. 
Accordingly, our capital expenditures in 2022 
increased by 18.0% to SAR 141.2 billion  
($37.6 billion) as we continued to make long-term 
investments across the hydrocarbon chain to 
further our growth ambitions.

These investments included expanding our 
downstream European presence with the closing 
of three landmark transactions with Polish 
refiner and fuel retailer PKN ORLEN. Aramco also 
signed an equity purchase agreement to acquire 
Valvoline Inc.’s global products business for  
SAR 9.9 billion ($2.65 billion) in the third quarter  
of 2022. This strategic acquisition, which closed 
in March 2023, is expected to complement 
Aramco’s line of premium-branded lubricant 
products and enhance our global base oils 
production capabilities. 

Investing in the energy transition
At the same time, we are investing in key energy 
transition-related solutions, including the 
development of cleaner fuel technologies, 
lower-carbon hydrogen, renewables, and  
carbon capture, utilization, and storage. 

These future-focused investments are already 
making progress. Aramco, through our SASREF 
and SABIC Agri-Nutrients subsidiaries, was 
granted the world’s first independent certification 
for production of blue ammonia and hydrogen in 
the third quarter of 2022, as well as collaborating 
on the world’s first commercial shipment of 
lower-carbon blue ammonia in the fourth 
quarter of 2022.

The SAR 5.6 billion ($1.5 billion) Sustainability 
Fund that we announced in 2022 is another 
example of our desire to invest in innovation.  

The Fund is being managed by Aramco Ventures, 
our venture capital arm, and will focus on 
making investments in innovative technologies 
that support our 2050 net-zero ambition. 

With petrochemicals positioned to provide 
essential inputs for the energy transition, we  
are also investing to grow our net chemicals 
production capacity and announcing expansion 
projects in the Kingdom and in Asia. Since the 
acquisition of SABIC, Aramco has sought to 
achieve synergies in procurement, supply chain, 
marketing, feedstock optimization, stream 
integration, operations, and maintenance. 
Aramco estimates that it has generated 
incremental EBITDA synergies of approximately 
SAR 8.1 billion ($2.15 billion) and is targeting  
the capture of approximately SAR 11.3 billion  
to SAR 15.0 billion ($3.0 billion to 4.0 billion)  
in annual recurring EBITDA synergies by 2025. 

Expanding our capital market presence
In the fourth quarter of 2022, two companies 
that Aramco holds interests in completed  
initial public offerings with listings on the  
Saudi Exchange.

The IPO of the Power and Water Utility Company 
for Jubail and Yanbu, known as Marafiq, resulted 
in Aramco’s effective equity ownership being 
reduced from 42.2% to 29.8%. Aramco received 
SAR 1.7 billion ($0.44 billion) from the sale of  
this portion of our stake in Marafiq. Our 
majority-owned base oil subsidiary, Luberef,  
also completed its IPO; however, no proceeds 
from this public offering were received as we 
retained our entire 70% stake.

Both IPOs reinforce our efforts to increase 
Aramco’s participation and presence in capital 
markets, expand our shareholder base, and 
provide existing and new investors with 
additional avenues to capture value that  
Aramco and its subsidiaries generate. 

Focusing on value creation
Aramco’s unprecedented financial results for 
2022 reinforce our ability to generate consistent 
value for our shareholders across price cycles, 
while providing energy supply stability  
to our customers. 

Our aim is to continue to deliver a sustainable 
and progressive dividend while focusing on 
long-term value creation. Going forward, 
continued agility, resilience, and fiscal discipline 
will remain the cornerstones of our financial 
approach as we continue to lay the foundation 
for Aramco to be a leading energy player as the 
world moves towards a lower-carbon future.

Strong global energy demand

The financial information of Aramco set forth 
below, as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and 
for the years then ended, has been derived 
without material adjustment from, and is 
qualified in its entirety by, the financial 
statements contained in Section 7: Consolidated 
financial statements. It should be read in 
conjunction with the financial statements, 
Section 4: Risk, and other financial data included 
elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Key factors affecting Aramco’s  
financial results
The following is a discussion of the most 
significant factors that have impacted Aramco’s 
financial position, results of operations, and cash 
flows for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Supply, demand, and prices for hydrocarbons, 
and refined and chemicals products
Aramco’s results of operations and cash flows are 
primarily driven by market prices and volumes 
sold of hydrocarbons, as well as refined and 
chemicals products. Global demand for petroleum 
products in 2022 increased as compared to 2021, 
resulting in higher prices for hydrocarbons,  
and improved margins for refined products.

In the Kingdom, the Government regulates  
the oil and gas industry and establishes the 
Kingdom’s maximum level of hydrocarbon 
production in the exercise of its sovereign 
prerogative. Accordingly, the Government may  
in its sole discretion increase or decrease the 
Kingdom’s maximum hydrocarbon production 
levels at any time based on its strategic energy 
security goals or for any other reason. Therefore, 
Aramco’s results of operations and cash flows 
may depend in part on these sovereign decisions 
with respect to production levels.

Portfolio and funding optimization 
The Company completed a SAR 58.1 billion  
($15.5 billion) energy infrastructure transaction  
in February 2022. The transaction involved the 
sale of a 49% equity interest in a newly formed 
subsidiary, Aramco Gas Pipelines Company 
(AGPC), to a consortium of investors led by 
BlackRock Real Assets and Hassana Investment 
Company. As part of the transaction, AGPC 
leased usage rights in Aramco’s gas pipelines 
network and leased them back to Aramco for  
a 20-year period. In return, AGPC will receive 
a tariff payable by Aramco for specified gas 
products that flow through the pipelines 
network. Under the terms of the transaction, 
Aramco will continue to retain full legal 
ownership and operational control of its gas 
pipelines network and the transaction does  
not impose any restrictions on Aramco’s gas 
production volumes. The transaction resulted  
in an increase in cash and cash equivalents  
and non-controlling interests.

With respect to the deferred consideration 
related to the SABIC acquisition, in January 2022 
Aramco made a partial prepayment of SAR 28.6 
billion ($7.6 billion), which reduced the principal 
amounts of two promissory notes by a total of 
SAR 30.0 billion ($8.0 billion). In addition, in  
June 2022 Aramco made a partial prepayment  
of SAR 38.2 billion ($10.2 billion), which reduced  
the principal amounts of two promissory notes 
by a total of SAR 45.0 billion ($12.0 billion). 
Further, Aramco paid an installment of SAR 33.8 
billion ($9.0 billion) due on April 7, 2022. These 
resulted in a decrease in total borrowings and 
cash and cash equivalents and a net gain of  
SAR 3.1 billion ($0.82 billion) during the year.

Financial performance



In April 2022, the Company entered into a new 
five-year agreement for unsecured revolving 
credit facilities amounting to SAR 37.5 billion 
($10.0 billion), to replace facilities that expired 
during the year. The new facilities are an 
aggregation of a USD denominated facilities  
of SAR 30.0 billion ($8.0 billion) and a SAR 
denominated Shari’a compliant Murabaha facility 
of SAR 7.5 billion ($2.0 billion). The Company has 
the option of up to two extensions, each for one 
year, and any advanced amounts will be used for 
general corporate and working capital purposes. 
As at December 31, 2022, no amounts have  
been drawn against these facilities. 

Bonus share distribution and Government  
share transfer
On May 12, 2022, at the Company’s 
Extraordinary General Assembly, the Board  
of Directors’ recommendation was approved  
to capitalize SAR 15.0 billion ($4.0 billion) of the 
Company’s retained earnings to support the 
distribution of bonus shares to shareholders,  
in the amount of one share for every 10 shares 
held. This resulted in an increase in Aramco’s 
issued ordinary shares from 200 billion to 220 
billion and a corresponding increase in share 
capital of SAR 15.0 billion ($4.0 billion). 

In February 2022, the Government transferred 
eight billion ordinary shares, or 4% of the 
Company’s share capital, to the PIF, the sovereign 
wealth fund of the Kingdom. Following the 
transfer, the Government remains the Company’s 
largest shareholder, retaining a 94.19% direct 
shareholding. This private transfer did not  
affect the Company’s total number of issued 
shares and does not have any impact on the 
Company’s operations, strategy, dividend 
distribution policy, or governance framework.

Financial results
Aramco’s strong earnings and cash flows in 2022 
reflect strong global energy demand, coupled 
with Aramco’s unique operational flexibility and 
low cost base.

Revenue and other income related to sales for 
the year ended December 31, 2022, were SAR 
2,266,373 ($604,366), compared to SAR 1,501,758 
($400,468), for the year ended December 31, 
2021. The increase of 50.9% was primarily driven 
by higher crude oil, refined and chemical 
products prices and stronger volumes sold.

Operating costs increased by SAR 392,456 
($104,655), or 53.8%, from SAR 729,840 
($194,624) to SAR 1,122,296 ($299,279), for the 
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, 
respectively. This was mainly due to an increase 
in production royalties largely attributable to 
higher average effective royalty rate, resulting 
from stronger crude oil prices, and higher sales 
volumes. Operating costs also rose due to 
increased purchases of crude oil, refined,  
and chemical products driven by higher  
prices and volumes. 

Income before income taxes and zakat increased 
by SAR 383,441 ($102,250), or 49.8%, which 
predominantly reflects the impact of higher 
crude oil prices and volumes sold, and stronger 
refining margins. This was partially offset by 
higher production royalties and an increase  
in total purchases.

Income taxes and zakat for the year ended 
December 31, 2022, was SAR 548,957 ($146,388), 
compared to SAR 357,125 ($95,234) in 2021.  
The increase was primarily driven by higher 
taxable income recorded in 2022.

Financial position
Total assets were SAR 2,492,924 ($664,780) as at 
December 31, 2022, compared to SAR 2,162,690 
($576,718), as at December 31, 2021. The 
movement was largely due to an increase in 
short-term investments, property, plant and 
equipment, inventories, and trade receivables. 
This was partially offset by a decrease in cash 
and cash equivalents balance.

The increase in short-term investments reflects 
greater allocation of funds from cash and cash 
equivalents to USD and SAR denominated term 
deposits with a maturity of more than 90 days.

The increase in property, plant and equipment 
reflects higher upstream capital expenditures  
in relation to drilling and development  
activities related to increasing crude oil MSC  
and gas projects.

The higher inventories balance is primarily due 
to an increase in crude and refined products 
inventories compared to the prior year, which is 
predominantly associated with higher product 
prices at year end.

The increase in trade receivables is mainly 
attributable to higher revenue associated with 
the impact of stronger sales prices and volumes 
at year-end.

The lower cash and cash equivalents balance is 
mainly due to an increased allocation to short-
term investments, higher cash paid for settlement 
of income, zakat and other taxes, and net 
repayment of borrowings. This was partially 
offset by higher earnings during the year.

Total liabilities were SAR 826,777 ($220,474) at 
December 31, 2022, compared to SAR 882,022 
($235,206), as at December 31, 2021. The 
decrease principally reflects the impact of 
reduction in borrowings during the current year, 
partially offset by higher deferred income tax 
liabilities, trade and other payables, and income 
taxes and zakat payable.

The reduction in borrowings was mainly driven 
by the payment of the deferred consideration 
related to the SABIC acquisition.

The increase in deferred income tax liabilities is 
mainly driven by changes in taxable temporary 
differences associated with property, plant and 
equipment, provisions, and post-employment 
benefit obligations. 

Trade and other payables increased primarily as  
a result of higher purchases reflecting the impact 
of an increase in product prices. Income taxes 
and zakat payable increased due to the impact  
of higher taxable income in 2022.

Non-controlling interests was SAR 217,231 
($57,928) at December 31, 2022, compared to  
SAR 167,411 ($44,643), at December 31, 2021.  
The increase was largely driven by the sale of 
equity interest in AGPC associated with Aramco’s 
gas pipeline transaction.

Non-IFRS measures reconciliations and definitions

This Annual Report includes certain non-IFRS 
financial measures (ROACE, free cash flow, 
gearing and EBIT) that Aramco uses to make 
informed decisions about its financial position, 
operating performance or liquidity. These 
non-IFRS financial measures have been included 
in this Report to facilitate a better understanding 
of Aramco’s historical trends of operation and 
financial position. 

Aramco uses non-IFRS financial measures as 
supplementary information to its IFRS-based 
operating performance and financial position. 
The non-IFRS financial measures are not defined 
by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS.  
The non-IFRS financial measures are not 
measurements of Aramco’s operating 
performance or liquidity under IFRS and should 
not be used instead of, or considered as 

alternatives to, any measures of performance  
or liquidity under IFRS. The non-IFRS financial 
measures relate to the reporting periods 
described in this Annual Report and are not 
intended to be predictive of future results. In 
addition, other companies, including those in 
Aramco’s industry, may calculate similarly titled 
non-IFRS financial measures differently from 
Aramco. Because companies do not necessarily 
calculate these non-IFRS financial measures  
in the same manner, Aramco’s presentation of 
such non-IFRS financial measures may not be 
comparable to other similarly titled non-IFRS 
financial measures used by other companies.  
As such, these measures should be read and 
interpreted in conjunction with the financial 
statements and other financial data included 
elsewhere in this Report.

financing-related cash outflows of SAR 88,162 
($23,510) primarily reflects higher repayment of 
borrowings largely attributable to the payment 
of deferred consideration related to the SABIC 
acquisition and the reduction in cash proceeds 
from borrowings. This was partially offset by 
cash received in connection with Aramco’s gas 
pipeline transaction.

Return on average capital employed (ROACE)

ROACE measures the efficiency of Aramco’s 
utilization of capital. Aramco defines ROACE as 
net income before finance costs, net of income 
taxes and zakat, as a percentage of average 
capital employed, calculated on a 12-month 
rolling basis. Average capital employed is the 
average of total borrowings plus total equity at 
the beginning and end of the applicable period. 
Aramco utilizes ROACE to evaluate management’s 
performance and demonstrate to its shareholders 
that capital has been used effectively. 

ROACE for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 
31.6%, compared to 24.4% in 2021. This increase 
was mainly attributable to higher earnings, 
primarily reflecting stronger crude oil prices and 
volumes sold, and improved refining margins.  
This was partially offset by higher average capital 
employed during the year due to an increase in 
total equity associated with higher earnings.

Free cash flow

Aramco uses free cash flow to evaluate its cash 
available for financing activities, including 
dividend payments. Aramco defines free cash 
flow as net cash provided by operating activities 
less capital expenditures. 

Free cash flow in 2022 was SAR 556,991 
($148,531), compared to SAR 402,956 ($107,455) 
in 2021, an increase of SAR 154,035 ($41,076), or 
38.2%. This was predominantly due to higher 
operating cash flows, largely driven by stronger 
crude oil prices and volumes sold, and improved 

refining margins. This was partially offset by 
higher cash paid for the settlement of income, 
zakat and other taxes, and an increase in 
upstream capital expenditures.

Gearing

Gearing is a measure of the degree to which 
Aramco’s operations are financed by debt and 
reflects available liquidity held in current and 
non-current investments and cash management 
instruments. Aramco defines gearing as the ratio 
of net (cash) / debt (total borrowings less cash  
and cash equivalents, short-term investments, 
investments in debt securities (current and 
non-current), and non-current cash investments)  
to total equity and net (cash) / debt. Management 
believes that gearing is widely used by analysts 
and investors in the oil and gas industry to indicate 
a company’s financial health and flexibility.

Aramco’s gearing ratio was (7.9)% as at December 
31, 2022, compared to 12.0% as at December 31, 
2021. The decrease in gearing reflects the impact 
of net cash position and higher total equity, 
predominantly driven by stronger earnings as  
a result of higher crude oil prices and volumes 
sold, and improved refining margins.

Earnings before interest, income taxes and zakat (EBIT)

Aramco defines EBIT as net income plus finance 
costs and income taxes and zakat, less finance 
income. Aramco believes EBIT provides useful 
information regarding its financial performance 
to analysts and investors.

EBIT for 2022 was SAR 1,149,419 ($306,512), 
compared to SAR 780,174 ($208,046) in 2021.  
This increase of SAR 369,245 ($98,466), or 47.3%, 
mainly represents the impact of stronger crude 
oil prices and volumes sold, and improved 
refining margins, partially offset by an increase 
in purchases and production royalties.

Upstream overview

The Upstream segment’s activities consist of 
exploring for, developing and producing crude 
oil, condensate, natural gas and NGL. Aramco 
manages the Kingdom’s unique reserves and 
resource base to optimize production and 
maximize long-term value pursuant to the 
Hydrocarbons Law, which mandates Aramco’s 
hydrocarbon operations, promotes long-term 
productivity of the Kingdom’s reservoirs and, 
supports the prudent stewardship of its 
hydrocarbon resources.

As set out in the Concession, Aramco has the 
exclusive right to explore, develop and produce 
the Kingdom’s hydrocarbon resources, except  
in the Excluded Areas, for an initial period of  
40 years, which will be extended by the 
Government for 20 years provided Aramco 
satisfies certain conditions commensurate with 
current operating practices. In addition, the 
Concession may be extended for an additional 
40 years beyond the prior 60-year period subject 
to Aramco and the Government agreeing to  
the terms of the extension. The provision of a 
specified term in the Concession impacts the 
calculation of Aramco’s reserves as compared  
to the Kingdom’s reserves in the fields Aramco 
operates. The Concession also requires  
Aramco to meet domestic demand for certain 
hydrocarbons, petroleum products and LPG 
through domestic production or imports. 

As at December 31, 2022, Aramco’s reserves 
under the Concession agreement were 258.8 
billion boe (2021: 253.6 billion boe), including 
200.8 billion barrels (2021: 196.9 billion barrels) 
of crude oil and condensate, 25.2 billion barrels 
(2021: 25.2 billion barrels) of NGL, and 201.9 tscf 
(2021: 194.5 tscf) of natural gas.

The Government determines the Kingdom’s 
maximum level of crude oil production in the 
exercise of its sovereign prerogative and requires 
Aramco to maintain Maximum Sustainable 
Capacity (MSC) in excess of its then current 
production in accordance with the Hydrocarbons 
Law. MSC was maintained at 12.0 mmbpd for the 
year ended December 31, 2022. In line with the 
Government’s mandate for MSC to be increased 
to 13.0 mmbpd, Aramco is proceeding with plans 
to reach the mandated MSC by 2027. The spare 
capacity afforded by maintaining an MSC 
provides operational flexibility to increase its 
production. It also uses this spare capacity as an 
alternative supply option in case of unplanned 
production outages and to maintain its 
production levels.

Upstream



In 2022, Aramco maintained its position as one  
of the world’s largest producers of crude oil  
and condensate with an average total daily 
hydrocarbon production of 13.6 mmboed  
(2021: 12.3 mmboed). For the year ended 
December 31, 2022, approximately 85% (2021: 
84%) of the aggregate hydrocarbon production 
consisted of liquids, which generally command  
a higher margin.

In 2022, Aramco also maintained its position  
as one of the lowest-cost producers globally.  
The average upstream lifting cost was SAR 11.44  
($3.05) per boe produced (2021: SAR 11.40 
($3.04)), while upstream capital expenditures 
averaged SAR 20.3 ($5.4) (2021: SAR 18.4 ($4.9)) 
per boe produced. This competitive advantage is 
a result of the Company’s robust fiscal discipline, 
its low depletion rate operational model, the 
unique nature of the Kingdom’s geological 
formations, favorable onshore and shallow  
water offshore environments in which Aramco’s 
reservoirs are located, synergies available from 
Aramco’s use of its large infrastructure and 
logistics networks, and its scaled application  
of technology. Given the quality of most of 
Aramco’s reservoirs and its operational model,  
it is possible to achieve high recovery factors 
while maintaining relatively low water cut  
levels for long periods of time.

Outlook for 2023

Aramco will continue its investments in future growth projects, 
including the MSC expansion to 13.0 mmbpd as well as growing  
its gas production capacity, to meet future demand growth.

Performance and achievements

 S Aramco offshore wellhead, Arabian Gulf

Upstream continues to invest in cutting-edge technologies and  
digital transformation programs. Aramco successfully deployed  
the Ghawar-1 supercomputer for reservoir simulation. The 
supercomputer is the second fastest in the MENA region after 
Aramco’s Dammam-7. It is expected to increase the number of 
completed simulation runs, enabling the Company to exploit  
more opportunities from its existing resources. 

The Manifa field development project was recognized as the 
Upstream Project of the Year at the 2022 Middle East Energy Awards. 
Aramco continues to show its leadership in both operational 
excellence and environmental protection through its careful 
development, management, and production of the Manifa field, 
which includes innovative solutions for protecting the fragile  
marine ecosystem.

Construction and engineering activities for the Marjan and Berri crude 
oil increments continue to progress, and are expected to add 
production capacity of 300 mbpd and 250 mbpd, respectively, by 2025.

Construction activities are continuing on the Dammam development 
project, which is expected to add 25 mbpd and 50 mbpd of crude  
oil by 2024 and 2027, respectively.

The Zuluf crude oil increment is in the engineering phase, and is 
expected to provide a central facility to process a total of 600 mbpd 
of crude oil from the Zuluf field by 2026. The facility will also be 
equipped to process associated gas, condensate, and produced water.

Overview
Aramco actively manages its prolific reserves 
base to maximize long-term value while 
optimizing ultimate recovery from its fields. 
Because of the size, number, and spare capacity 
of its fields, the Company is able to maintain its 
level of overall production by tapping into new 
reservoirs when required to improve long-term 
value through portfolio capacity optimization. 
Diversification of supply sources for crude oil 
from fresh reservoirs has the benefit of allowing 
lower depletion rates from existing fields and 
deferring costs for additional wells and facilities 
to handle higher total fluid displacement rates  
at such fields.

Aramco’s principal fields are located in close 
proximity to each other within the Central and 
Eastern Provinces of the Kingdom. Aramco 
believes that its portfolio includes the world’s 
largest discovered conventional onshore oil field 
(Ghawar) and largest discovered conventional 
offshore oil field (Safaniyah). The crude oil, 
condensate, natural gas and NGL that Aramco 
produces from its fields travel through the 
extensive network of pipelines to multiple 
facilities for processing into refined and 
petrochemical products, or to domestic 
customers or export terminals. In particular, 
Aramco’s East-West Pipeline is critical in linking 
oil production facilities in the Eastern Province 
with Yanbu’ on the west coast, and providing 
flexibility to export from the east and west coasts 
of the Kingdom. 

Aramco owns and operates the Abqaiq facility, 
which is its largest oil processing facility and the 
largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world. 
Aramco also operates four crude export 
terminals that contribute to its operational 
flexibility and supply reliability. In addition, 
Aramco has strategic international delivery 
points located in Rotterdam (the Netherlands), 
Sidi Kerir (Egypt), and Okinawa (Japan).

Aramco consistently produces five grades of 
Arabian crude oil: Arabian Super Light, Arabian 
Extra Light, Arabian Light, Arabian Medium, and 
Arabian Heavy. These crude grades and the wide 
range of blends that can be produced from them 
are compatible with most global refineries. In 
2022, Arabian Super Light, Arabian Extra Light 
and Arabian Light accounted for approximately 
68% (2021: 66%) of Aramco’s total crude oil 
production and were classified as premium 
grades. In 2022, Aramco’s Downstream business 
was the largest customer of the Upstream crude 
oil production, utilizing 44% (2021: 43%), while 
the remainder was sold to international and 
domestic third-party customers.

Performance and achievements

 S Hawiyah Gas Compression Plant, Saudi Arabia

The compression projects at the Haradh and Hawiyah fields have 
commenced commissioning activities and are expected to achieve  
full capacity in 2023.

The Hawiyah Gas Plant expansion, part of the Haradh gas increment 
program, has started commissioning activities and is expected to be 
onstream in 2023.

Construction at the Hawiyah Unayzah Gas Reservoir Storage is at an 
advanced stage and has commenced injection activities. It is the first 
underground natural gas storage project in the Kingdom and will 
enable surplus natural gas to be injected into the reservoir during 
off-peak periods. The program is designed to provide up to 2.0 bscfd 
of natural gas for reintroduction into the Kingdom’s MGS by 2024.

Construction continues at the Tanajib Gas Plant, part of the Marjan 
development program. Once completed, the project will add 2.6 
bscfd of additional processing capacity from Marjan, Safaniyah  
and Zuluf fields. The project is expected to be onstream by 2025.

Aramco progressed with design and initial construction activities  
of the Jafurah Gas Plant, part of the development of the Jafurah 
unconventional gas field that is expected to expand gas production 
and is a key component of Aramco’s unconventional gas program. 
The facility will be developed in two phases and is expected to have  
a raw gas processing capacity of 3.1 bscfd upon completion in 2027. 
The Jafurah field is expected to commence production in 2025 and 
will gradually increase natural gas deliveries to reach a sustainable 
rate of 2.0 bscfd by 2030, which is expected to provide feedstock for 
hydrogen and ammonia production and will help meet expected 
growing local energy demand. 

Overview
Aramco’s nonassociated gas fields vary widely  
in reservoir properties, depths, pressures and 
compositions. In general, the southern area 
around the Ghawar field has rich gas at 
moderate depths and permeability, while the 
northern offshore fields (Karan, Arabiyah and 
Hasbah) have leaner gas in deeper reservoirs 
with high permeability. Additionally, Aramco’s 
crude oil production provides a base load of 
associated gas, which is rich in liquids. 

Aramco’s primary natural gas processing and 
fractionation facilities are located in Ghawar and 
the northern and western areas of the Kingdom. 
The Company’s facilities are strategically located 
near its fields to reduce transportation and 
pipeline compression costs, as well as the time 
required to deliver gas products to market. As  
at December 31, 2022, the total conventional  
and unconventional raw gas processing capacity 
was 18.3 bscfd (2021: 18.3 bscfd), which primarily 
feeds into the Master Gas System (MGS), an 
extensive network of pipelines that connects 
Aramco’s key gas production and processing  
sites throughout the Kingdom. 

Pursuant to the Concession, Aramco is the 
exclusive supplier of natural gas in the Kingdom. 
Aramco sells natural gas to power generation 
plants primarily pursuant to long-term contracts 
and to customers in the Kingdom’s industrial 
sector. The supply of natural gas to domestic 
customers is regulated by the Law of Gas 
Supplies and Pricing (which is replaced by the 
Energy Supplies Law that became effective on 
March 7, 2023), and the prices paid by domestic 
customers are set by resolutions issued from time 
to time by the Council of Ministers. Aramco also 
exports a portion of its NGL production.

In 2022, Aramco’s average gas production was 
approximately 10.6 bscfd (2021: 10.1 bscfd) 
including both natural gas and ethane. The 
Company also achieved a historic single-day 
production record of 11.3 bscfd of natural gas.

Aramco continued to progress a number of  
major gas projects within the Kingdom to meet 
growing domestic demand.

Overview
Through Aramco’s exploration program, the 
Company continued its efforts to achieve the 
strategic objectives and associated targets of growing 
the Kingdom’s oil and nonassociated gas initially in 
place endowments. Aramco has historically replaced 
reserves on an organic basis through revisions of 
reserve estimates at existing fields and through 
delineation and exploration to identify new fields.  
As a result, the Kingdom’s estimated proved reserves 
at the largest oil fields operated by Aramco have 
increased since the time of original production. 
Aramco’s exploration program is aligned with 
strategic value drivers to maximize profitability and 
lower future finding and development costs through 
exploring for high-value premium crude and 
accelerating infrastructure-led gas exploration  
and delineation programs. 

Crude oil
The majority of Aramco’s current crude oil 
exploration activities are focused in the Eastern 
Province, with smaller scale of exploration 
activities in known hydrocarbon-bearing  
basins in the Rub’ al-Khali, Northwest, and 
Summan regions. Aramco places a strong 
emphasis on improving the operational 
performance of its drilling activities by applying 
innovative technologies and benchmarking  
of key metrics to identify trends and potential 
areas for enhancement. Aramco believes that  
its approach to drilling and development has  
led to high levels of well integrity. 

Natural gas
Aramco’s nonassociated gas exploration activities 
have yielded a number of major discoveries,  
with particular success in the Ghawar area and  
in deep reservoirs in the Arabian Gulf. Aramco  
has enjoyed high success rates in locating new 
reserves in known hydrocarbon-bearing basins 
adjacent to its existing fields and production 
infrastructure, allowing it to meet growing 
domestic demand at low cost, while also exploring 
in new basins with high potential. Aramco is 
looking to further expand its natural gas reserves 
through new field discoveries, new reservoir 
additions in existing fields, and the delineation 
and reassessment of existing reservoirs and fields.

Unconventional resources
Aramco, through its unconventional resource 
program, is assessing several areas within the 
Kingdom for their potential to deliver gas and 
associated liquids to help meet future domestic 
energy needs. The unconventional resource 
program consists of exploration activities, pilots, 
producing wells and production facilities, with 
the objective of developing unconventional gas 
resources in support of the Kingdom’s growing 
demand for gas, and to offset the use of crude  
oil for power generation.

Downstream overview

Mohammed Y. Al Qahtani 
Executive Vice President, Downstream

Aramco has a large and growing, strategically 
integrated global Downstream business.  
The Downstream segment’s activities consist  
of refining and petrochemicals, base oils and 
lubricants, retail operations, distribution, supply 
and trading, and power generation. These 
activities support Aramco’s Upstream and 
Downstream operations by enabling it to 
optimize crude oil sales and product placement 
through its significant infrastructure network of 
pipelines and terminals, and access to shipping 
and logistics resources.

The strategic integration of Aramco’s Upstream 
and Downstream segments provides 
opportunities for Aramco to secure and de-risk 
liquids demand and capture incremental value 
from the hydrocarbon supply chain by selling  
to its dedicated system of domestic and 
international refineries and petrochemical plants. 
In addition, the integration of Aramco’s refining 
and chemicals manufacturing assets provides  
an opportunity to capture additional value and 
continue to improve the balance of fuels and 
chemicals production. In 2022, the crude oil 
utilized by Aramco’s downstream operations 
accounted for 44% (2021: 43%) of the Company’s 
crude oil production.

Aramco’s downstream investments diversify its 
revenue and integrate its oil and gas operations 
to optimize value across the hydrocarbon chain, 
supporting crude oil and gas demand and 
facilitating the placement of its crude oil. 
Aramco’s net refining capacity was 4.1 mmbpd  
at December 31, 2022, (2021: 4.0 mmbpd),  
while the gross refining capacity at December 31, 
2022 was 7.1 mmbpd (2021: 6.8 mmbpd). 

Aramco also has an integrated petrochemicals 
business within its Downstream segment, which 
captures additional incremental value. Aramco’s 
chemicals business spans production of basic 
chemicals, such as aromatics, olefins and 
polyolefins, to more complex products, such  
as polyols, isocyanates, and synthetic rubber. 

In June 2020, SABIC, a globally diversified 
chemicals company with manufacturing in the 
Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Asia Pacific, 
became an integral member of the Aramco 
group. Aramco’s majority interest in SABIC 
increases the proportion of petrochemicals 
production in Aramco’s Downstream portfolio 
and supports its downstream growth ambitions. 
The chemicals business continues to grow 
through capacity expansions and new 
investments, and operates in over 50 countries 
with a net chemicals production capacity1 of  
56.3 million tons per year as at December 31, 
2022, (2021: 54.2 million tons per year).

Overview
Aramco operates one of the world’s largest 
refining businesses, with gross refining capacity 
of 7.1 mmbpd as at December 31, 2022, 
(December 31, 2021: 6.8 mmbpd), and net 
refining capacity of 4.1 mmbpd (December 31, 
2021: 4.0 mmbpd). Aramco’s refining operations 
are conducted in the Kingdom and internationally 
through wholly-owned and affiliated refineries. 
The refining operations allow Aramco to 
transform its crude oil and NGL into refined 
products for sale within the Kingdom and 
internationally.

Specifically, Aramco designs and configures its 
refining system to optimize production using the 
crude oil it produces. This helps reduce supply 
chain cost and improves efficiency in refining 
operations, and therefore the supply of refined 
products to its downstream customers.

Domestic refining
Aramco’s in-Kingdom refineries, both wholly-
owned and affiliated, receive their crude oil 
supply from Aramco’s upstream production. 
These refineries accounted for 63% of Aramco’s 
net refining capacity in 2022 (December 31,  
2021: 64%). Together with the local distribution 
system, this provides Aramco unique access  
to the large domestic marketplace to which  
it is the sole supplier. 

In 2022, Aramco placed 26% (2021: 27%) of its 
crude oil production to in-Kingdom wholly-owned 
and affiliated refineries. Aramco’s equity share  
of refined products and the refined products 
produced through its wholly-owned refineries 
located within the Kingdom are primarily 
distributed wholesale to domestic fuel retailers and 
industrial customers through Aramco’s pipelines, 
distribution and terminals system. 

Aramco has five wholly-owned and four domestic 
affiliated refineries in the Kingdom, which help to 
meet domestic refined product demand. Through 
long-term supply agreements with these ventures, 
Aramco has the right to supply all crude processed  
at these refineries.

International refining
In addition to increasing its in-Kingdom refining 
capability, Aramco seeks to expand its 
strategically integrated Downstream business  
in high-growth economies such as China, India, 
and Southeast Asia, while maintaining its current 
participation in material demand centers, such as 
the United States and Europe, and countries that 
rely on importing crude oil, such as Japan and 
South Korea.

Aramco has invested in two refining and 
petrochemical joint ventures with PETRONAS, 
collectively known as PRefChem. These assets  
are located in Johor, Malaysia, adjacent to 
Singapore, Asia’s refined products trading hub. 
Aramco will provide a significant proportion  
of PRefChem’s crude supply under a long-term 
supply agreement. Aramco believes this presents 
an expansion opportunity in Southeast Asia  
and opens up new markets for its crude  
oil production.

In 2022, Aramco’s weighted average ownership 
percentage in its international refineries was  
41% (2021: 41%), but it supplied an average  
of 56% (2021: 54%) of the crude oil used by  
those refineries. This crude placement provides 
significant benefits to Aramco’s operations, 
including a secure and reliable supply of 
high-quality crude oil, which helps to ensure  
a secure and reliable supply of refined products 
to its downstream customers.

The net refining capacity of Aramco’s 
international wholly-owned and affiliated 
refineries was 1.5 mmbpd (2021: 1.5 mmbpd). 
Product sales by Aramco’s international ventures 
are facilitated through multiple distribution 
channels, including systems owned by the 
respective affiliates through a network of 
approximately 17,000 branded service stations.

Performance and achievements

 S Gdańsk Refinery, Poland

Aramco completed three landmark transactions with Polish refiner 
and fuel retailer PKN ORLEN to expand Aramco’s presence in the 
European downstream sector and increase its crude exports to 
Poland through investments in Poland’s refining, wholesale, and jet 
fuel marketing segments for total consideration of SAR 1.8 billion 
($0.5 billion). Aramco has acquired equity stakes of 30% in a 210 
mbpd refinery, 100% in an associated wholesale business, and  
50% in a jet fuel marketing joint venture.

Aramco announced its final investment decision to participate in  
the development of a major integrated refinery and petrochemical 
complex in northeast China. The Huajin Aramco Petrochemical 
Company (HAPCO) joint venture, comprised of Aramco, North Huajin 
Chemical Industries Group Corporation, and Panjin Xincheng 
Industrial Group, will develop a liquids-to-chemicals complex 
including a 300 mbpd refinery and petrochemical units. This  
presents an opportunity for Aramco to supply up to 210 mbpd of 
crude oil feedstock to the complex. The transaction is subject to 
finalization of transaction documentation, regulatory approvals,  
and closing conditions.

Aramco’s Malaysia-based investment in refining and petrochemical 
joint ventures with PETRONAS, collectively known as PRefChem,  
has successfully restarted operations in May 2022, and is ramping  
up gradually with a continued focus on safety and sustainability. 
Aramco’s investment in PRefChem provides an expansion 
opportunity in an important high-growth market and offers  
new geographies for placing its crude oil production.

Performance and achievements

Marking yet another significant step in SABIC establishing itself as 
the primary chemicals arm and an integral member of the Aramco 
group, Aramco completed the transfer of its PRefChem polymers  
and mono-ethylene glycol offtake rights to SABIC.

Aramco and SATORP have obtained the ISCC+ credential for their 
joint waste plastic recycling initiative. The two entities join SABIC  
in holding this certification, a global standard for recycled and 
bio-based materials. The initiative aims to establish the first 
petrochemical circular value chain in the Kingdom to produce 
polymers from plastic waste, reducing the impact of single-use 
plastic on the environment.

SASREF and SABIC Agri-Nutrients received the world’s first 
independent certifications for production of blue ammonia and 
hydrogen. The certifications, granted by a leading independent 
agency, verify that a significant amount of the CO2 associated with 
the manufacturing process of blue ammonia and hydrogen has been 
captured and utilized in downstream applications instead of emitted. 
Aramco, in collaboration with SABIC Agri-Nutrients, has completed 
the world’s first commercial shipment of certified blue ammonia to 
South Korea.

Aramco and TotalEnergies have made a final investment decision for 
the construction of a large petrochemical complex in Saudi Arabia. 
The complex, known as Amiral, will be owned, operated, and 
integrated with the existing SATORP refinery located in Jubail,  
Saudi Arabia. The petrochemical complex will enable SATORP to  
help advance Aramco’s liquids-to-chemicals strategy. The investment 
decision is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals. 

Aramco and its affiliate, S-OIL, have made a final investment  
decision to develop one of the world’s largest refinery-integrated 
petrochemical steam crackers in line with the Company’s strategy to 
maximize the crude-to-chemicals value chain. The SAR 26.3 billion 
($7.0 billion) Shaheen project will be located at S-OIL’s existing site  
in Ulsan, South Korea, with a planned capacity to produce up to  
3.2 million tons of petrochemicals annually.

Overview
Aramco’s chemicals business represents an 
extension of the hydrocarbon value chain and 
strategically complements its refining operations. 
Aramco’s chemicals business, including its 
interest in SABIC, operates in over 50 countries 
and produces a range of chemicals. Aramco’s 
growing operations in chemicals include 
participation in high-growth chemicals markets 
with demand from industries such as packaging, 
automotive, and appliances. 

Following the acquisition of SABIC, Aramco is  
a major global producer of petrochemicals with 
manufacturing in the Americas, Europe, Middle 
East, and Asia Pacific. The acquisition also 
expands Aramco’s capabilities in procurement, 
manufacturing, marketing and sales. SABIC is an 
industry leader in multiple chemical segments, 
and produces a wide range of products, 
including olefins, methanol, MTBE, aromatics, 
glycols, linear alpha olefins, polyethylene, 
polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, 
polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polycarbonate, 
and engineering thermoplastics and their blends.

Since the acquisition of SABIC, Aramco has 
sought to achieve synergies in procurement, 
supply chain, marketing, feedstock optimization, 
stream integration, operations, and maintenance. 
Aramco estimates that it has generated 
incremental EBITDA synergies of approximately 
SAR 8.1 billion ($2.15 billion) and is targeting  
the capture of approximately SAR 11.3 billion  
to SAR 15.0 billion ($3.0 billion to 4.0 billion) in 
annual recurring EBITDA synergies by 2025. 

Aramco also conducts petrochemical 
manufacturing through affiliates located in the 
Kingdom, China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, 
the United States, and the Netherlands, with 
other key industry players, including Dow 
(Sadara), Sumitomo (Petro Rabigh), TotalEnergies 
(SATORP), PETRONAS (PRefChem), and Sinopec 
(YASREF and FREP). Through these affiliates and 
joint ventures, Aramco produces a wide range  
of commodity and differentiated petrochemicals. 

Aramco’s chemicals business continues to  
grow through capacity expansion and new 
investments. Including SABIC, Aramco had a net 
chemicals production capacity1 of 56.3 million 
tons per year as at December 31, 2022, (2021: 
54.2 million tons per year).

 S Valvoline research and development, United States

Aramco signed an equity purchase agreement to acquire Valvoline 
Inc.’s global products business (Valvoline Global Products) for  
SAR 9.9 billion ($2.65 billion). This strategic acquisition is expected to 
complement Aramco’s line of premium-branded lubricant products, 
optimize its global base oils production capabilities, and expand 
Aramco’s own R&D activities and partnerships with original 
equipment manufacturers. The transaction closed in March 2023.

In December 2022, Saudi Aramco Base Oil Company, known as 
Luberef and a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, successfully executed  
its IPO of 29.7% of its shares and the listing of its shares on the Saudi 
Exchange. Luberef is among the largest base oil producers in the 
Kingdom, and Aramco continues to own 70.0% of Luberef following 
the IPO.

Aramco announced a partnership with the Aston Martin Cognizant 
Formula One™ Team to harness the shared commitment to 
engineering excellence and innovation. Through the partnership, 
Aramco aims to drive development of high performance more 
sustainable fuels and advanced lubricants, grow awareness of its 
high-quality products, and support its ambition to supply premium 
fuels and lubricants to the global automotive sector.

In 2022, Aramco sold 4.6 million tons (2021: 4.5 million tons) of  
base oils, maintaining its position as one of the leading marketers  
of base oils globally.

Overview
In keeping with Aramco’s strategy to capture

Overview
Aramco’s Kingdom-wide distribution network 
includes pipelines, bulk plants, air refueling sites, 
and terminals that deliver crude oil, NGL, natural 
gas, and refined products. The pipelines and 
bulk plants network, and the terminals on the 
east and west coast, enable the transportation  
of hydrocarbons for export and for delivery to 
customers across the Kingdom. Further, Aramco’s 
East-West Pipeline links oil production facilities  
in the Eastern Province with Yanbu’ on the west 
coast, providing flexibility to export from the east 
and west coasts of the Kingdom. 

Aramco’s MGS, an extensive network of pipelines 
that connects its key gas production and 
processing sites with customers throughout the 
Kingdom, is currently undergoing an expansion. 
The system’s current capacity is 9.6 bscfd of 
natural gas and supplies eastern, central, and 
western industrial complexes. The MGS 
Expansion Phase II will increase overall gas 
supply capacity from 9.6 bscfd to 12.5 bscfd to 
accommodate the increase in the Kingdom’s 
natural gas demand, including expansion of the 
East-West MGS to ultimately deliver 5.2 bscfd to 
the central and western regions to support future 
utility and industrial development. 

In addition, Aramco has a 15% equity interest in 
the Arab Petroleum Pipeline Company (Sumed 
Company), a joint venture which operates the 
Sumed pipeline. The pipeline runs from the  
Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea through Egypt 
and provides an alternative to the Suez Canal.

Performance and achievements

 S Yanbu South Terminal, Saudi Arabia

In February 2022, the Company completed a SAR 58.1 billion  
($15.5 billion) energy infrastructure deal with a consortium of 
investors led by BlackRock Real Assets and Hassana Investment 
Company to sell a 49% interest in a newly formed subsidiary,  
Aramco Gas Pipelines Company (AGPC). Aramco will continue to 
retain full legal ownership and operational control of its gas pipelines 
network, and the transaction does not impose any restrictions on 
Aramco’s gas production volumes. This transaction represents 
significant progress in Aramco’s asset optimization program, unlocks 
additional value from its diverse asset base, and underscores 
Aramco’s commitment to long-term value creation.

In 2022, the operational resilience of the Company’s infrastructure 
was demonstrated with hydrocarbons continuing to be delivered 
to customers safely and on time. The well-established emergency 
response systems and contingency plans aim to prepare the 
Company to respond effectively to potential incidents.

Overview
Aramco manages crude oil sales operations, 
along with a large and growing portfolio of 
refining and chemicals facilities in Asia, Europe, 
and North America. As part of its strategy to 
unlock additional value, Aramco is expanding its 
crude oil, refined products and chemicals trading 
to significantly grow total traded volumes over 
the next few years.

Aramco is pursuing a globally integrated 
business model to capture additional value 
through greater market access and coverage as  
it seeks to grow its worldwide trading activities. 

Aramco’s trading activities are conducted 
primarily through Aramco Trading Company 
(ATC) and its subsidiaries. In addition to its 
expanding trading activities in crude oil, refined 
products and chemicals, Aramco sees the 
potential to grow its trading activities and has 
progressed a number of initiatives to offer 
products with a lower-carbon footprint including 
the trading of biofuels. In 2022, ATC concluded 
its first biofuel transaction after obtaining the 
ISCC certification to trade products with a 
lower-carbon footprint.

Aramco is well positioned to use its production 
and distribution network to optimize its supply 
and trading capabilities. By optimizing the 
production, refining and distribution processes 
and integrating them with its trading business, 
Aramco seeks to ensure that customers receive 
reliable service and consistent products.  
In addition, there is the potential to optimize 
product flows on a domestic and international 
basis across regional and global supply chains  
to maximize value. 

These operations support Aramco’s upstream 
and downstream activities by enabling it to 
optimize crude oil sales and product placement 
through its significant infrastructure network of 
pipelines and terminals, and access to shipping 
and logistics resources. Aramco also maintains 
flexibility to respond to fluctuations in demand 
through its five crude grades and MSC.

Supply and trading

Performance and achievements

Aramco advanced its strategy to expand and integrate its global 
trading operations by agreeing to an internal reorganization of its 
U.S. trading business, which closed on January 3, 2023. ATC, through 
its subsidiaries, acquired Motiva’s U.S. trading business, which 
provides ATC with the platform to supply Motiva with crude oil and 
feedstocks and to offtake and trade refined products and chemicals 
generated by Motiva. The acquisition will provide ATC with access  
to incremental volumes and markets that are expected to strengthen 
its trading capabilities.

In 2022, Aramco traded an average of 6.7 mmbpd (2021: 5.7 mmbpd) 
of crude oil and refined petroleum products, and 2.7 million tons of 
liquid chemical products (2021: 2.4 million tons). In 2022, Aramco’s 
total crude oil exports averaged 7.1 mmbpd (2021: 6.3 mmbpd).

The Company continued to demonstrate its strong operational 
flexibility and supply reliability by delivering crude and other 
products in a timely manner with 99.9% reliability in 2022  
(2021: 99.9%).

Overview
As at December 31, 2022, Aramco’s power 
operations comprised 17 captive power plants 
(2021: 17) and associated transmission and 
distribution assets located across the Kingdom. 
These assets are primarily designed to provide 
electricity and steam to Aramco’s oil and gas 
production facilities, gas processing plants and 
wholly-owned refineries in a safe, reliable and 
efficient manner. Some of these power assets are 
wholly-owned while others are owned by joint 
ventures in which Aramco has an ownership 
interest. Aramco also enters into offtake 
arrangements with independent power producers. 

In addition, Aramco currently owns a 6.9%  
stake in the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC), the 
Kingdom’s national electricity utility company, 
and an effective 29.8% (2021: 42.2%) stake in 
Marafiq, a domestic utility company that serves 
the industrial areas of Jubail and Yanbu’. 

The Company also remains committed to the 
global energy transition and views renewable 
energy as a complement to its own energy 
products, supported by vast solar and wind 
resources in-Kingdom.

Power Performance and achievements

 S Abqaiq Plants, Saudi Arabia

In 2022, Aramco generated 4.8 GW (2021: 5.2 GW) of power, of 
which 3.5 GW (2021: 3.3 GW) were used to meet internal demand, 
and 1.3 GW (2021: 1.3 GW) of spill power was transferred to the 
national grid. In 2021, the Fadhili Power Plant joint venture supplied 
0.6 GW to SEC.

In November 2022, The Power and Water Utility Company for Jubail 
and Yanbu (Marafiq), an associate of Aramco, successfully executed 
its IPO of 29.2% of its shares and the listing of its shares on the Saudi 
Exchange. The IPO was comprised of shares offered by the majority 
shareholders of Marafiq, including Saudi Aramco Power Company 
and SABIC, in proportion to their shareholding. Following completion 
of the IPO, the effective equity ownership of Aramco’s subsidiaries  
in Marafiq was reduced from 42.2% to 29.8%.

Aramco’s corporate activities primarily support 
the activities of its Upstream and Downstream 
segments, as well as the overall business.  
The corporate activities include technical  
services that are essential to the success of 
Aramco’s core business, as well as human 
resources, finance, legal, corporate affairs,  
and information technology.

Aramco’s integrated corporate development 
organization is mandated to maximize value 
creation by efficiently executing portfolio 
optimization and growth opportunities in line 
with corporate strategies. This would enable  
the Company to unlock the value of its assets  
and redeploy capital toward opportunities  
with growth prospects and attractive returns.

Corporate overview

 X Procurement & Supply Chain Control Tower, 
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia

As part of its portfolio optimization efforts, in 
February 2022 the Company completed a SAR 58.1 
billion ($15.5 billion) energy infrastructure deal with 
a consortium of investors led by BlackRock Real 
Assets and Hassana Investment Company to sell a 
49% interest in a newly formed subsidiary, Aramco 
Gas Pipelines Company (AGPC). As part of the 
transaction, AGPC leased usage rights in Aramco’s 
gas pipelines network and leased them back to 
Aramco for a 20-year period. In return, AGPC will 
receive a tariff payable by Aramco for specified gas 
products that flow through the pipelines network. 
Aramco will continue to retain full legal ownership 
and operational control of its gas pipelines network 
and the transaction does not impose any restrictions 
on Aramco’s gas production volumes.

Ensuring optionality through diversified funding 
sources is an important component of Aramco’s 
financial strategy. As part of Aramco’s focus on 
optimizing funding costs, in April 2022 Aramco 
signed a five-year agreement for SAR 37.5 billion 
($10.0 billion) of certain revolving credit facilities. 

These transactions demonstrate investor confidence 
in Aramco’s long-term outlook, while reinforcing 
Aramco’s role as a catalyst for attracting significant 
foreign institutional investors into the Kingdom.

Performance and achievements

Aramco’s corporate development activities also seek 
to build a world-class local supply chain to serve  
the needs of the Company and its partners. Under 
Aramco’s National Champions program, which 
encompasses a set of unique initiatives to drive 
in-Kingdom business development, the Company 
seeks to facilitate the creation of a diverse, 
sustainable, and globally competitive in-Kingdom 
energy sector. This includes the iktva, Namaat, and 
Taleed initiatives, which together support in-Kingdom 
economic growth, innovation, job creation, and 
small- and medium-enterprise (SME) development.

In 2022, Aramco entered into over 90 agreements 
under iktva with an estimated value of SAR 64.9 
billion ($17.3 billion) to build long-term collaborative 
relationships with strategic local suppliers. In January 
2023, Aramco signed over 100 agreements and 
Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) to help advance 
a diverse, sustainable, and globally competitive 
industrial ecosystem.

Additionally, the Company launched the Taleed 
program in October 2022, which strives to accelerate 
SME growth across multiple sectors. Thirty MoUs have 
been signed with leading public and private partners 
to enable development of the SME ecosystem.

recognized under the corporate segment, and 
the corporate outreach and citizenship activities. 
The increase in losses in 2022 was mainly 
attributable to the unfavorable impact of higher 
discount rates on employee home loans, and  
loss on investments in equity securities. 

Corporate capital expenditures decreased during 
the year due to completion of certain community 
development projects and lower expenditures 
related to various industrial support projects.

Sustainability is embedded within the Aramco 
strategy. The long-term sustainability of the 
business will be driven by the Company’s ability 
to leverage its competitive position while 
reducing its emissions. Acting responsibly across 
all aspects of its business will enable Aramco  
to successfully navigate and benefit from a lower 
emissions future. 

Sustainability governance
Aramco’s Board of Directors oversee 
sustainability efforts through the Sustainability, 
Risk and Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) 
Committee. The Committee reviews and provides 
oversight on sustainability, risk and HSE policies 
and practices to ensure they are discussed, 
understood, owned, and promoted at the  
Board level. The Committee receives quarterly 
updates from management regarding the 
Company’s performance across a range of 
sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs), 
and provides oversight with respect to strategy, 
goals, and important areas of focus. The 
Sustainability, Risk and HSE Committee reports  
its findings to the Board.

At a management level, the Company’s 
Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) aligns  
all sustainability-related activities under the 
guidance and oversight of a single body.  
The SSC is comprised of Aramco Senior Vice 
Presidents representing business lines and 
administrative areas, and is led by the Executive 
Vice President of Strategy and Corporate 
Development. The SSC reports to both the 
Strategy Council and Management Committee, 
and is responsible for identifying sustainability 
issues and their impact on long-term value 
creation for the business and stakeholders.  
See Section 4: Risk for more information on 
Aramco’s risk management framework, and 
Section 5: Corporate governance for the 
Sustainability, Risk and HSE Committee Report.

Commitment to act responsibly

Four areas of focus
Aramco has identified the following four 
sustainability focus areas to oversee its 
sustainability performance:
• Climate change and the energy transition;
• Safe operations and people development;
• Minimizing environmental impact; and
• Growing societal value.

Aramco takes both a strategic and operational 
approach as it seeks to address these significant 
areas, and has identified KPIs for each focus area. 
A high-level overview of the 2022 sustainability 
performance is provided in this section. Aramco 
will elaborate on its overall sustainability 
performance and plans in its upcoming 2022 
Sustainability Report.

Supporting this is the ambition to achieve 
net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse  
gas emissions by 2050 across wholly-owned 
operated assets, and achieve zero routine  
flaring by 2030. This is an important part of the 
Company’s focus on long-term value creation, 
and complements the Kingdom’s aim to reach 
net-zero emissions by 2060 through the circular 
carbon economy approach. 

As disclosed in the 2021 Sustainability Report, 
interim targets have been set to reduce or 
mitigate net Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 
from the Company and its operationally 
controlled entities by 52 mmtCO2e compared to 
2035 business as usual forecast emissions, and 
reduce upstream carbon intensity by at least  
15% by 2035 compared to a 2018 baseline.

To achieve these targets, Aramco focuses on five 
key levers: energy efficiency across upstream  
and downstream assets; further reductions in 
methane and flaring; increased use of renewable 
energy sources; carbon capture, utilization, and 
storage; and development or purchase of offsets 
to help address hard-to-abate emissions. Within 
these levers are targets to achieve carbon 
capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) capacity 
of 11 mmtCO2e annually by 2035, and plans to 
invest in or to have made a final investment 
decision with respect to 12 gigawatts of solar  
PV and wind projects by 2030. 

During 2022, Aramco achieved the following:
• In partnership with the Ministry of Energy, 

announced plans for one of the largest scale 
carbon capture and storage hubs globally.

• Established a $1.5 billion Sustainability Fund, 
one of the largest of its kind in the world. The 
Fund’s initial focus areas will include CCUS, 
greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency, 
nature-based solutions, digital sustainability, 
hydrogen, ammonia, and synthetic fuels.

• Aramco subsidiaries SASREF and SABIC 
Agri-Nutrients received the world’s first 
independent certifications for production 
of blue ammonia and hydrogen. In 
collaboration with SABIC Agri-Nutrients, 
Aramco also delivered the world’s first 
accredited commercial shipment of lower-
carbon blue ammonia to South Korea.

• Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Aramco 
Trading Company, the Company participated 
in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 
region’s first voluntary carbon credits auction.

Climate change and the energy transition

The challenge of decoupling economic growth 
from greenhouse gas emissions is clear. Events 
over the last year have underlined further that 
energy security is equally important and 
highlighted ongoing underinvestment in energy 
sources. Both COVID-19 and geopolitical events 
have provided a reminder that the transition of 
the global economy, energy systems, and 
materials towards a lower-carbon future is 
complex, multi-dimensional, and will stretch 
across generations.

Alternatives to traditional hydrocarbon-based 
energy sources are progressing, but, on their 
own, are not yet ready to meet the world’s 
energy demands and ensure a smooth energy 
transition. Oil demand is expected to grow  
for the rest of the decade and the world will 
likely continue to need oil and gas for the 
foreseeable future.

With access to some of the world’s largest 
hydrocarbon resources, Aramco has a role to 
play in helping the world navigate towards a 
lower-carbon future. The production of 
hydrocarbons accompanied by carbon capture 
technology, in which Aramco is investing, could 
complement emerging alternatives and serve as 
an integral component of the future energy mix.

Aramco aims to leverage its strengths and strives 
to maximize the value of the energy it produces, 
while seeking to reduce the negative impact of 
greenhouse gases. And it is not just about 
energy; hydrocarbons could also be essential to 
the development of potential new materials that 
are expected to play a significant role in the 
energy transition. Advanced, durable materials 
are essential for manufacturing wind turbines, 
solar panels, transportation, storage devices,  
and infrastructure.

The Company’s many decades of careful 
long-term reservoir management and 
technology investments underpin its low-cost, 
efficient operations that have helped it maximize 
value from the Kingdom’s resources.

GHG emissions

1. The Company’s GHG emissions reporting is based on the World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG protocol 
guidelines. The Company reports emissions using the operational control basis for measurement.

2. The Company’s GHG emissions inventory includes emissions from wholly-owned in-Kingdom operated assets, SASREF, Motiva, and ARLANXEO.

3. 2022 figures for Scope 1 emissions, Scope 2 emissions, upstream carbon intensity, and flaring intensity have undergone ISAE3000 (revised) limited assurance and assurance 
results will be published on the Aramco website in Q2 2023. The 2021 figures for Scope 1 emissions, Scope 2 emissions, and upstream carbon intensity have undergone 
external limited assurance and can be viewed in the 2021 Sustainability Report.

4. The Jazan Refinery is excluded from the GHG emissions and flaring inventories.

Despite increased hydrocarbon production of 10.3% in 2022, 
total emissions (Scope 1 emissions and Scope 2 emissions)  
from the Company and its operationally controlled entities 
increased by only 5.9% compared to the previous year. This 
was enabled by more efficient operations and a reduction  
in flaring intensity by 16.5% compared to the previous year 
due to improved operations of the Company’s in-house flare 
gas recovery systems across several facilities.

An important metric for Aramco is the carbon intensity of 
upstream operations, which is among the lowest in the 
industry per barrel of oil equivalent and achieved through 
efficient operations, active management of the Company’s 
prolific reservoirs, and sound engineering. In 2022, upstream 
carbon intensity decreased by 3.7% compared to the previous 
year and continues to be amongst the lowest of major oil 
producers in the world.

Aramco is leveraging its R&D and technology initiatives 
to develop, demonstrate and, ultimately, implement 
innovative approaches that could help lower emissions 
across the oil and gas industry. And some of these could 
have application in other emission-intensive industries.

Aramco strives to reduce flaring across its business,  
with investment including flare gas recovery systems and 
programs to improve asset integrity, energy efficiency, leak 
detection, and repairs. As a signatory to the World Bank’s 
“Zero Routine Flaring by 2030” initiative, the Company 
shares best practices and knowledge with its peers so  
that its work has a broader and more positive impact.

Aramco conducts business in a manner that aims 
to prevent incidents with the potential to impact 
people, damage assets, or harm the environment. 
The Company adheres to the Occupational  
Safety and Health Administration Standards in 
developing and reporting its health and safety 
performance metrics.

While the Company endeavors to have strong 
controls in place to mitigate the risk of 
operational incidents, five fatalities (one 
employee and four contractors) sadly occurred 
during the year. The Company and its 
operationally controlled entities also experienced 
11 Tier 1 process safety events1. Compared to 
2021, the total recordable case (TRC) frequency 
improved by 7.4% and the loss time injuries/illnesses 
(LTI) rate improved by 17.6%. All incidents 
have been investigated during the year, with 
root causes identified, corrective actions 
implemented, and lessons shared with all 
relevant parties to limit the risk of reoccurrence.

To protect its workforce, the Company 
implements its enterprise-wide safety focus  
with robust policies and standards under the 
stewardship of the Company’s Health, Safety, 
Security and Environment (HSSE) Committee. 
Aramco also deploys its subject matter experts  
to independently verify the compliance and 
implementation of its Safety Management System, 
and establish appropriate action plans to further 
improve its safety performance and environment.

Safe operations and people development

The Company promotes and supports diversity and inclusion 
(D&I), occupational health, and mental well-being.

Over the past five years, Aramco’s commitment to D&I has 
resulted in the percentage of female hires increasing due 
to a concerted effort to achieve strategic targets and KPIs 
administered under a dedicated Diversity and Inclusion 
Division. There has been an increase of 22.6% for females 
in leadership positions at the Company from 2021 to 2022  
with strategic plans to continue on this upward trajectory.

A major contributor to Aramco’s success in boosting diversity 
has been the establishment of diversity and inclusion 
corporate targets, and KPIs on female representation, women 
in leadership, and people with disabilities representation.

Aramco has a proud history of providing opportunities for 
education and training over many decades. These include 
offering world-class training, first-rate vocational programs, 
and a suite of opportunities to fulfill employees’ career 
ambitions. The Company has delivered leadership and 
targeted development programs to over 18,500 employees 
through the Leadership Center, a world-class facility located in 
Ras Tanura, and through affiliation with top-ranked business 
schools and leading development partners such as Harvard, 
Wharton, and the London Business School.

Aramco is implementing best practice 
environmental management systems and 
investing in initiatives that improve natural 
habitats and reduce damage to shared resources 
as the Company aspires to create a legacy for 
future generations.
One of the ways this is achieved is by seeking 
to limit groundwater use in operations and 
protecting sensitive ecological areas to support 
Aramco’s efforts to preserve the Kingdom’s 
environment and any areas in which it operates.

Headquartered in one of the most arid 
environments in the world, water management 
has been an essential focus of Aramco since 
inception. Today that includes:
• Assigning value to groundwater used for projects 

to incentivize the use of alternative sources.
• Seeking to reduce dependence on 

nonrenewable groundwater by using 
alternative water sources like seawater, treated 
sewage effluent, and treated reject streams, 
including significant investment in desalination.

In 2022 freshwater consumption was 93.60 
million cubic meters compared to 94.61 million 
cubic meters in 2021. This reduction is mainly  
the result of conservation efforts.

Aramco strives to achieve zero spills. There  
were 15 hydrocarbon spills in 2022 with two of 
the spills responsible for more than 99% of the 
total volume spilled. Eighty-nine percent of the 
contaminated soil related to one of the spills  
was removed to rehabilitate the affected area 
and further cleanup operations are ongoing.  
All of the spilled oil related to the second spill 
was recovered. 

The Company captures lessons learned from  
any hydrocarbon spill and shares them across  
its business. It also seeks to improve its spill 
prevention processes, asset integrity and 
inspection, response to hydrocarbon spill 
emergencies, and its hydrocarbon recovery 
processes. The Company is also continuously 
training and conducting drills to ensure competency 
and readiness during emergency situations. 

Natural climate solutions
During the year, Aramco planted 11 million 
mangrove seedlings in-Kingdom, bringing 
the cumulative total to 24 million mangrove 
seedlings. The Company also completed the third 
phase of its million trees initiative, bringing the 
total number of native trees planted in-Kingdom 
to three million. Mangroves have the capacity to  
act as carbon sinks, supporting the decarbonization 
plan. The replanting of mangrove coastlines 
supports increased biodiversity of fauna and flora. 
Aramco’s biodiversity policy highlights the 
Company’s aspiration to have a net positive impact 
on biodiversity across its operations.

Aramco believes its commitment and investment 
in training, skills development, and nurturing of 
in-Kingdom partnerships has contributed to the 
development of the labor force in Saudi Arabia, 
while adding robustness to the Company’s supply 
chain through localization.

Aramco’s National Champions program 
encompasses a set of unique programs focused 
around five strategic domains — sustainability, 
digital, industrial, manufacturing, and social 
innovation — that drive development from an  
initial idea to a small- and medium-enterprise (SME) 
through to global businesses, and aligns with  
the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 and its Shareek 
Private Sector Partnership Reinforcement 
Program (Shareek). In March 2023, the Company 
signed a Shareek framework agreement in 
support of Aramco’s efforts to localize its supply 
chain and ensure its long-term cost and 
productivity leadership, sustainability, and 
resilience, while contributing to the Kingdom’s 
economic development.

The Company’s in-Kingdom Total Value Add 
(iktva) program is an ongoing success. Through 
the program, the local component of the 
Company’s overall expenditure across its supply 
chain now stands at 63.0%, with a target to grow 
to 70.0% by 2025. Billions of dollars in economic 
activity that historically would have left the 
Kingdom instead remained to serve the interests 
of the Company and support the local economy.

In 2022 alone, Aramco entered into over 
90 agreements with an estimated value of 
SAR 64.9 billion ($17.3 billion) to build long-term 
collaborative relationships with strategic local 
suppliers. In January 2023, Aramco signed 
over 100 agreements and Memoranda of 
Understanding (MoU) to help advance a 
diverse, sustainable, and globally competitive 
industrial ecosystem.

1. Applies to Saudi Arabian Oil Company (the Company).

Growing societal value

Alongside iktva and Shareek is Aramco’s Namaat 
industrial investment program and the Taleed 
SME growth program. At the end of 2022, 61 
investments had been made through Namaat 
with an aim to create jobs for Saudis and expand 
the Kingdom’s energy and chemicals value 
chains. The Taleed program, launched in October 
2022, aims to accelerate SME growth across 
multiple sectors. Taleed strives to deliver SAR 3.0 
billion ($0.8 billion) in funding and financial 
solutions to support SME development. Aramco 
is partnering with a wide range of entities to 
deliver Taleed initiatives, and 30 MoUs have been 
signed with leading public and private partners 
to enable development of the SME ecosystem.

Risk objectives
Aramco operates in an industry characterized 
by price volatility, hazardous operations, and 
uncertain project outcomes. Taking informed 
risks is an inherent and necessary part of doing 
business. Aramco manages its strategic, 
operational, compliance and financial risks by 
continuously assessing them and undertaking 
appropriate responses. Business decisions are 
made after due consideration of rewards 
and associated risks.

Risk management framework
The Board of Directors provides risk oversight 
as a component of its strategic leadership. 
The Sustainability, Risk and HSE Committee of 
the Board oversees the risk management 
framework and monitors specific risks.

The primary role of the Sustainability, Risk 
and HSE Committee is to monitor overall 
management of risk and activities relating to 
health, safety and the environment and to assist 
the Board of Directors with:
I. Leadership, direction, and oversight with 

respect to the Company’s risk appetite, risk 
tolerance, risk framework, and risk strategy;

II. Governance and management of strategic, 
operational, sustainability, and 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
related risks; and

III. Assisting the Board and the Audit Committee 
to foster a culture within the Company that 
emphasizes and demonstrates the benefits 
of risk management. The Audit Committee 
focuses on financial risks, including financial 
reporting and treasury risks, as well as on 
internal and external compliance.

Aramco’s enterprise risk management (ERM) 
framework follows the Three Lines Model. The 
operating businesses and support organizations 
form the first line, as risk owners, and have 
primary responsibility for identifying and 
managing their risks. The second line comprises 
dedicated risk management functions, 
responsible for monitoring and reporting on 
risks, and providing guidance to risk owners. Risk 
management functions include Loss Prevention, 
Environmental Protection, Information Security, 
Corporate Emergency Management and 
Continuity, Corporate Compliance, and Financial 
Risk Management organizations, as well as the 
Corporate Enterprise Risk Management group. 

Internal Audit, as the third line, provides 
management and the Audit Committee with 
independent assurance on the effectiveness of 
internal control systems. Aramco’s Global ERM 
Policy requires subsidiaries and operationally 
controlled affiliates to manage risks in a 
structured manner, overseen by their Boards 
of Directors. Aramco also encourages affiliates 
to apply ERM principles and practices to their 
management of risks.

Management-level oversight of the ERM 
framework is provided by the Management 
Committee, chaired by the President and CEO. 
He also chairs the HSSE Committee, which 
oversees health, safety, security, and 
environmental risk management; the Strategy 
Council, which reviews matters of strategic risk; 
and the Conflicts of Interest and Business Ethics 
Committee. Various other management-level 
committees oversee specific risk-related topics, 
such as the Sustainability Steering Committee 
and the Information Security Risk Management 
Steering Committee.

Business risk assessment
The process by which individual organizations 
identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report 
risks to the achievement of business objectives is 
integrated into Aramco’s annual planning cycle 
through a system based on ISO 31000 principles 
and guidelines. This includes the escalation, as 
appropriate, of risk ownership through Aramco’s 
organizational levels, resulting in a hierarchy 
of risks from individual departmental risks to 
corporate risks. Annually, the Management 
Committee reviews the composition of the top 
risks, taking into consideration risks reported 
from the businesses and a top-down scan for 
new and emerging risks. The Management 
Committee is updated quarterly on individual 
risks, and every year several risks are presented 
in detail to the Management Committee and the 
Board’s Sustainability, Risk and HSE Committee.

Decision-making
To reduce planning uncertainty and help 
manage the variability of outcomes, Aramco 
has embedded risk assessment into its strategic 
and investment planning. Strategic scenarios 
are stress-tested, and individual projects and 
investments pass through a gated decision 
process that includes risk assessments and 
value assurance reviews.

The following risks do not necessarily comprise all the risks 
affecting Aramco. There may be additional risks that Aramco 
is currently not aware of, or that Aramco currently believes are 
immaterial, which may in the future become material or affect 
Aramco’s business, financial position and results of operations, 
or the market price of the shares. As a result of these and 
other risks, the forward-looking events and circumstances 
discussed in this Annual Report might not occur in the way 

Aramco expects, or at all. All forward-looking statements 
in this Annual Report should be considered in light of these 
explanations and shareholders should not put undue 
reliance on forward-looking statements.

The risks described in this section are not presented in 
order of priority based on their importance or expected 
effect on Aramco.

Understanding risks

Risks related to Aramco’s operations and activities

Aramco’s results of 
operations and cash 
flow are significantly 
impacted by 
international crude oil 
supply and demand 
and the price at which 
it sells crude oil.

Sales of crude oil are the largest component of 
Aramco’s consolidated revenue and other 
income related to sales, accounting for 47.0%, 
and 50.3% for the years ended December 31, 
2021 and 2022, respectively. Accordingly, 
Aramco’s results of operations and cash flow are 
significantly impacted by the price at which it 
sells crude oil.

International crude oil supply and demand and 
the sales price for crude oil are affected by many 
factors that are beyond Aramco’s control, 
including the following:
• Markets’ expectations with respect to future 

supply, demand and price of petroleum and 
petroleum products;

• Global economic and political conditions and 
geopolitical events, including any that impact 
international trade (including trade routes);

• Decisions regarding production levels by the 
Kingdom or other producing states (the 
Kingdom is a member country of OPEC);

• The impact of natural disasters and public 
health pandemics or epidemics (such as 
COVID-19) on supply and demand for crude oil, 
general economic conditions, and the ability 
to deliver crude oil;

• The development of new crude oil 
exploration, production and transportation 
methods or technological advancements in 
existing methods;

• Capital investments of oil and gas companies 
relating to the exploration, development and 
production of crude oil reserves;

• The impact of climate change on the demand 
for, and price of, hydrocarbons (see risk — 
Climate change concerns and impacts 
could reduce global demand for hydrocarbons 
and hydrocarbon-based products and could 
cause Aramco to incur costs or invest 
additional capital);

• Changes to environmental or other regulations 
or laws applicable to crude oil and related 
products or the energy industry (see risk — 
Aramco’s operations are subject to 
environmental protection, health and safety 
laws and regulations, and increased concerns 
regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics 
and their potential impact on the environment 
have resulted in more restrictive regulations 
and could lead to new regulations);

• Prices and availability of alternative energies, 
including renewable energy;

• The electrification of transportation, 
technological developments in the cost or 
endurance of fuel cells for electric vehicles, 
and changes in transportation-mode 
preferences, including ride-sharing;

• Weather conditions affecting supply 
and demand;

• Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar,  
the currency in which crude oil is priced 
globally; and

• Crude oil trading activities.

Risk factors



Continued

Aramco’s results of 
operations and cash 
flow are significantly 
impacted by 
international crude oil 
supply and demand 
and the price at which 
it sells crude oil.

International crude oil prices have fluctuated 
significantly in the past and may remain volatile. 
Between January 2016 and February 2020, Brent 
prices generally fluctuated between $40 and 
$65 per barrel. Brent prices fell below $23 per 
barrel in mid-March 2020 in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and other supply and 
demand factors, and did not recover to above 
$60 per barrel until February 2021. Since then, 
Brent prices have increased and rose significantly 
in February 2022 in response to the Russia-
Ukraine conflict, related international sanctions 
and other macroeconomic factors, reaching 

$128 per barrel in the first half of 2022. 
On October 5, 2022, OPEC+ decided to cut oil 
production quotas by two million barrels per day 
starting in November 2022. As of December 31, 
2022, the Brent price was $85.9 per barrel.

Fluctuations in the price at which Aramco sells 
crude oil could cause its results of operations 
and cash flow to vary significantly. In addition, 
decreases in the price at which Aramco is able 
to sell its crude oil could have a material adverse 
effect on Aramco’s results of operations and 
cash flow.

Aramco operates in 
a highly competitive 
environment. 
Competitive pressure 
could have a material 
adverse impact on 
the price at which it 
sells crude oil and 
other products.

The sale of crude oil outside the Kingdom is very 
competitive. Aramco’s primary competitors for 
the sale of crude oil outside the Kingdom include 
national and international oil companies, many 
of which have substantial crude oil reserves and 
financial resources. The primary factors affecting 
competition are the price, reliability, quantity, 
quality and geographic location of crude oil 
produced. Increased competitive pressures could 
have a material adverse impact on prices at 
which Aramco can sell crude oil and its regional 
and global market share.

In addition, outside the Kingdom, refining and 
petrochemical plants in Aramco’s downstream 
segment are subject to competition in the 

geographies into which they sell refined products 
or petrochemicals. Competitors include, but are 
not limited to, refining and petrochemical plants 
located in, or in close proximity to, relevant 
markets, and in the case of refining and 
petrochemical plants that are net importers, 
from other international producers. Operating 
efficiencies and production costs are key factors 
affecting competition for refined products and 
chemicals. Accordingly, if the operating 
efficiencies and production costs of Aramco’s 
refineries are not sufficiently competitive in 
the geographies they serve, Aramco’s business, 
financial position and results of operations could 
be materially and adversely impacted.

Climate change 
concerns and impacts 
could reduce global 
demand for 
hydrocarbons and 
hydrocarbon-based 
products and could 
cause Aramco to  
incur costs or invest 
additional capital.

Climate change concerns manifested in public 
sentiment, government policies, laws and 
regulations, international agreements and 
treaties, lawsuits against energy companies, 
company net-zero ambition and other 
commitments, investor pressure, fossil fuel 
divestment campaigns and other actions may 
reduce global demand for hydrocarbons and 
hydrocarbon-based products and propel a shift 
toward lower carbon intensity fossil fuels, such as 
gas, or alternative energy sources. In particular, 
increasing pressure on governments, businesses, 
organizations and individuals to reduce GHG 
emissions has led to a variety of actions that aim 
to reduce the use of fossil fuels, including 
international agreements to reduce GHG 
emissions. For example, the Paris Agreement 
became effective in November 2016, and many 

countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement 
are adopting domestic measures to meet their 
goals, which include reducing their use of fossil 
fuels and increasing their use of alternative 
energy sources. The landscape of GHG related 
laws and regulations has been in a state of 
constant reassessment and it is difficult to predict 
with certainty the ultimate impact GHG related 
laws, regulations and international agreements 
will have on Aramco. In addition, jurisdictions in 
which Aramco operates or its products are sold 
that are not currently subject to GHG regulation 
may become regulated and existing GHG 
regulations may become more stringent. 
A reduction in demand for hydrocarbons and 
hydrocarbon-based products could have a 
material adverse effect on Aramco’s business, 
financial position and results of operations.

Risks related to Aramco’s operations and activities continued

Continued

Climate change 
concerns and impacts 
could reduce global 
demand for 
hydrocarbons and 
hydrocarbon-based 
products and could 
cause Aramco to  
incur costs or invest 
additional capital.

In line with the Kingdom’s announced aims and 
the Saudi Green Initiative, Aramco announced its 
ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 
greenhouse gas emissions across its wholly-
owned operated assets by 2050, which in turn 
will help support the Kingdom’s aim to reach 
net-zero emissions by 2060 through the circular 
carbon economy approach. Aramco may incur 

substantial costs and capital expenditures to 
achieve its net-zero ambitions. If Aramco does 
not meet its announced net-zero targets, or if 
Aramco’s efforts do not meet increasing societal 
or stakeholder expectations and standards, 
Aramco may be exposed to claims and its 
reputation, employee retention and business  
may be negatively impacted.

Terrorism and 
armed conflict 
may materially 
and adversely 
affect Aramco.

Aramco’s facilities have been targeted by terrorist 
and other attacks. In March 2022, a storage 
facility in Jiddah was subject to attack by 
unmanned aerial vehicles and missiles and, in 
March 2021, the Riyadh Refinery was subject to 
an attack by unmanned aerial vehicles. In 
addition, in September 2019, the Abqaiq facility 
and the Khurais processing facility were subject 
to attack by unmanned aerial vehicles and 
missiles. As a result of the attacks on the Abqaiq 
facility and the Khurais processing facility, crude 
oil production and associated gas production 
were temporarily reduced and Aramco took a 
number of actions to minimize the impact of 
lower Arabian Light and Arabian Extra Light 
production by tapping into Aramco’s inventories 
located outside of the Kingdom and swapping 
crude oil grades of deliveries to Arabian Medium 
and Arabian Heavy.

Furthermore, in both May and August 2019, 
the East-West pipeline and the Shaybah field, 
respectively, were targeted by unmanned aerial 
vehicle attacks. These attacks resulted in a brief 
shutdown of the pipeline and fires and damage 
to the processing and cogeneration infrastructure 
at the Shaybah NGL facility.

Additional terrorist or other attacks or armed 
conflict could impact Aramco’s operations and 
have a material adverse effect on Aramco’s 
business, financial position and results of 
operations, could cause Aramco to expend 
significant funds and could impact the market 
price of the shares.

Aramco exports a 
substantial portion 
of its crude oil and 
refined products to 
customers in Asia, and 
adverse economic or 
political developments 
in Asia could impact 
its results of operations.

Aramco exports a substantial portion of its 
crude oil and refined products to customers 
in Asia. In 2021 and 2022, customers in Asia, 
including Aramco’s affiliated refineries located 
in Asia, purchased 81% and 79%, respectively, 
of its crude oil exports. Aramco expects to 
export additional crude oil to Asia as new 
downstream assets in Asia commence 
operations. In addition, the refined, chemical, 
petrochemical, base oil and finished lubricant 
products that are produced at Aramco’s joint 
ventures and international operations in Asia 
are generally sold locally and exported to 
other Asian countries.

Since early 2020, economic conditions in Asia 
have been significantly impacted by the outbreak 
of COVID-19. If there is a prolonged slowdown in 
economic growth, an economic recession or 
other adverse economic or political development 
in Asia, Aramco may experience a material 
reduction in demand for its products by its 
customers located in the region. Moreover, 
any such development in other parts of the 
world (including political and social instability 
or armed conflict) may result in other producers 
supplying surplus capacity to Asia, thereby 
increasing competition for customers in Asia, 
which could negatively impact the prices at 
which Aramco sells its products to customers 
there. A significant decrease in demand for 
Aramco’s products in Asia could have a material 
adverse effect on its business, financial position 
and results of operations.

Risk factors continued



Aramco is subject to 
operational risks and 
hazards that may have 
a significant impact on 
its operations or result 
in significant liabilities 
and costs.

Aramco is subject to operational risks common 
in the oil and gas and petrochemical industries, 
including the following:
• crude oil or gas spills, pipeline leaks and 

ruptures, storage tank leaks and accidents 
involving explosions, fires, blow outs and 
surface cratering;

• power shortages or failures;
• mechanical or equipment failures;
• transportation interruptions and accidents;
• tropical monsoons, storms, floods and other 

natural disasters (including weather conditions 
associated with climate change);

• chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic 
or hazardous substances or gases; and

• changes in laws and regulations that could 
require Aramco to update or modify its 
methods of production, processing, storage 
or transportation of products.

These risks could result in damage to, or 
destruction of, Aramco’s properties and facilities, 
death or injury to people and harm to the 
environment, which could have a significant 
impact on its operations or result in significant 
liabilities and remediation costs. In addition, 
Aramco is not insured against all risks and 
insurance in connection with certain risks  
and hazards may not be available  

(see risk — Aramco could be subject to losses 
from risks related to insufficient insurance).  
To the extent a subcontractor is responsible for 
the damage, Aramco’s recourse to the relevant 
subcontractor may be limited by contract or the 
financial viability of such subcontractor. Such 
occurrences could also interrupt Aramco’s 
operations, delay Aramco projects or damage  
its reputation, which could have a material 
adverse effect on its business.

Furthermore, the majority of Aramco’s assets 
are located in the Kingdom and it relies heavily 
on a cross country pipeline system and terminal 
facilities to transport crude oil and products 
through the Kingdom. Aramco also depends 
on critical assets to process its crude oil, such 
as the Abqaiq facility, which is its largest oil 
processing facility and processes a significant 
amount of Aramco’s daily produced crude oil. 
The East-West pipeline, the Shaybah NGL facility, 
the Abqaiq facility and the Khurais processing 
facility have been subject to attacks in 2019. 
If Aramco’s critical transport systems or processing 
facilities were subject to a significant disruption, 
it could have a material adverse effect on Aramco’s 
business, financial position and results of operations 
(see risk — Terrorism and armed conflict may 
materially and adversely affect Aramco).

The resurgence of 
COVID-19 or 
outbreaks of other 
infectious diseases 
and its impact on 
business and 
economic conditions, 
may have negative 
effects on Aramco’s 
business, financial 
position, cash flow, 
results of operations, 
and price of its 
securities.

The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken  
to combat it have had a widespread impact on 
business and economic conditions, including  
on the demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined 
products and petrochemicals. Public health 
authorities and governments at local, national 
and international levels implemented various 
measures to respond to the pandemic, including 
restrictions on travel, voluntary and mandatory 
quarantines, workforce reductions of personnel 
who are deemed to be nonessential and 
restrictions on business activities. These measures 
led to lower demand for crude oil, natural gas, 
refined products and petrochemicals which has 
had, and may continue to have, a direct impact 
on Aramco’s operations. In addition, the COVID-19 
pandemic has resulted in volatility in global 
capital markets and investor sentiment, which 
may affect the availability, amount and type  
of financing available to Aramco.

Aramco is not able to predict how long the 
COVID-19 pandemic will persist or if there will be 
further resurgences or new variants of COVID-19 
or outbreaks of other infectious diseases, how 
long measures that are introduced to respond 
will be in place or if additional restrictive 
measures may be introduced. It also cannot 
predict how long the effects and the efforts to 
contain them will continue to impact its business 
after such outbreaks are under control.

In addition, if a significant percentage of Aramco’s 
workforce is unable to work, or if Aramco is 
required to close facilities because of illness or 
government restrictions, Aramco’s operations 
and business may be negatively affected.

Risks related to Aramco’s operations and activities continued

Estimates of proved 
hydrocarbon reserves 
depend on significant 
interpretations, 
assumptions and 
judgments. Any 
significant deviation 
or changes in existing 
economic and 
operating conditions 
could affect the 
estimated quantity 
and value of Aramco’s 
proved reserves.

Aramco’s reserve estimates conform to the 
SPE-PRMS definitions and guidelines, which are 
internationally recognized industry standards 
promulgated by the Society of Petroleum 
Engineers, the World Petroleum Council, the 
American Association of Petroleum Geologists, 
the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, 
the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the 
Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts 
and the European Association of Geoscientists 
& Engineers. Reserve estimation is an inherently 
complex process that principally relies on a 
combination of knowledge, experience and 
judgment. Aramco’s and D&M’s estimates of 
the quantity of Aramco’s proved hydrocarbon 
reserves depend on significant interpretations, 
assumptions and judgments relating to available 
geological, geophysical, engineering, 
contractual, economic and other information, 
and take into account existing economic and 
operating conditions and commercial viability 
as at the date the reserve estimates are made.

There can be no assurance that the 
interpretations, assumptions and judgments 
utilized by Aramco to estimate proved reserves, 

or those utilized by D&M for the purposes of 
preparing its certification letter, will prove to be 
appropriate or accurate. Any significant deviation 
from these interpretations, assumptions or 
judgments could materially affect the estimated 
quantity or value of Aramco’s proved reserves. 
In addition, these estimates could change due 
to new information from production or drilling 
activities, changes in economic factors, including 
changes in the price of hydrocarbons, changes to 
laws, regulations or the terms of the Concession 
or other events. Further, declining hydrocarbon 
prices may cause certain proved reserves to no 
longer be considered commercially viable, 
which could result in downward adjustments 
to Aramco’s estimates of its proved reserves, 
impairment of its assets or changes to its capital 
expenditures and production plans. Moreover, 
proved reserve estimates are subject to change 
due to errors in the application of published rules 
and changes in guidance. Any material reduction 
in the quantity or value of Aramco’s proved 
reserves could adversely affect Aramco’s 
business and reputation.

The independent 
third-party 
certification with 
respect to the 
Kingdom’s estimated 
reserves does not 
cover the entirety 
of its reserves.

Aramco retained independent petroleum 
consultants, D&M, to audit, as at December 31, 
2021, reservoirs Aramco believes accounted for 
approximately 85% of its proved oil reserves to 
which it has rights under the Concession and 
remain to be produced after December 31, 2021, 
but before December 31, 2077 (the end of the 
initial 40-year term of the Concession plus the 
first 20-year extension). Aramco chose this scope 
because of the overall scale of the Kingdom’s 
reserves and the concentration of deposits in the 
major reservoirs that were assessed. Further 
independent assessment of the Kingdom’s 
smaller reservoirs would have taken several years 
to complete. D&M’s reserves estimation of 217.0 
billion barrels of oil equivalent reserves for the 
reservoirs it evaluated was within the no material 
difference category (within 5% of Aramco’s 
internal estimation for the same reservoirs) 
for the same Concession time period.

There is no independent third-party certification 
letter with respect to the balance of the 
Kingdom’s proved oil equivalent reserves or as 
at a more recent date than December 31, 2021. 
Any material deviation in the quantity of proved 
reserves could have a material adverse effect on 
Aramco’s financial condition and reputation.

Risk factors continued



Aramco could be 
subject to losses  
from risks related to 
insufficient insurance.

Aramco insures against risk primarily by self-
insuring through its captive insurance subsidiary, 
Stellar, which provides insurance exclusively to 
Aramco. Aramco also obtains insurance in certain 
areas from third-party providers in excess of the 
coverage provided through Stellar.

Aramco does not insure against all risks and 
its insurance may not protect it against 
liability from all potential events, particularly 
catastrophic events such as major crude oil spills, 
environmental disasters, terrorist attacks or acts 
of war. In addition, it does not maintain business 
interruption insurance for disruptions to its 

operations and certain of its operations are 
insured separately from the rest of its business. 
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that 
Aramco can continue to renew its existing levels 
of coverage on commercially acceptable terms, 
or at all. As a result, it could incur significant 
losses from uninsured risks or risks for which 
its insurance does not cover the entire loss. 
Any such losses could have a material adverse 
effect on Aramco’s business, financial position 
and results of operations.

Aramco’s ability to 
achieve its strategic 
growth objectives 
depends on the 
successful delivery  
of current and future 
projects and achieving 
these objectives  
may not have the 
anticipated impact.

Aramco’s ability to achieve its strategic growth 
objectives depends, in part, on the successful, 
timely and cost-effective delivery of capital 
projects, which are carried out by Aramco or 
by it along with joint ventures or partners and 
affiliates. Aramco faces numerous challenges 
in developing such projects, including 
the following:
• fluctuations in the prices for hydrocarbons, 

which may impact its ability to finance its 
projects from its cash flow from operating 
activities or make projects less economically 
feasible or rendered uneconomic;

• making economic estimates or assumptions 
based on data or conditions, including demand 
and price assumptions, which may change;

• constraints on the availability and cost of 
skilled labor, contractors, materials, equipment 
and facilities;

• its ability to obtain funding necessary for the 
implementation of the relevant project on 
terms acceptable to it, or at all;

• difficulties in obtaining necessary permits, 
complying with applicable regulations and 
changes to applicable law or regulations;

• difficulties coordinating multiple contractors 
and subcontractors involved in complex 
projects;

• its ability to find major global industry partners 
and new opportunities for downstream 
investments globally;

• market factors outside of its control affecting 
its ability to fund such projects, including 
constraints that prevent or limit financing 
providers’ ability to invest in hydrocarbons-
related projects; and

• undertaking projects or ventures in new lines 
of business in which Aramco has limited or no 
prior operating experience.

These challenges have led and could lead to 
delays in the completion of projects and 
increased project costs. If projects are delayed, 
cost more than expected or do not generate 
the expected return, Aramco’s operations and 
expected levels of production could be impacted. 
These occurrences could result in Aramco 
recognizing impairments on its projects, 
assuming liabilities of joint ventures or partners 
and affiliates or other consequences, any of 
which could have a material adverse effect on 
Aramco’s business, financial position and results 
of operations.

Aramco is pursuing lower carbon intensity 
products and operations to address climate-
related risks and opportunities, including 
through lowering net carbon emissions. Other 
oil and gas companies may benefit from 
governmental incentives, such as financial 
incentives provided by the U.S. Inflation 
Reduction Act enacted in August 2022 for clean 
energy, including hydrogen, energy storage, 
clean energy vehicles and carbon capture, 
utilization and storage. If Aramco is unable to 
avail itself of similar incentives, its competitive 
position may be impacted. In addition, Aramco’s 
ability to develop low carbon products and 
solutions will also depend on the market 
acceptance of and regulatory support for 
these products.

Risks related to Aramco’s operations and activities continued

Continued

Aramco’s ability to 
achieve its strategic 
growth objectives 
depends on the 
successful delivery  
of current and future 
projects and achieving 
these objectives  
may not have the 
anticipated impact.

In addition, the financial impact resulting from 
certain of Aramco’s strategic growth projects 
and from its ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 
and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across its 
wholly-owned operated assets by 2050 is 
uncertain. There is a risk that even if Aramco 
is able to achieve its strategic growth objectives, 
their impact on its business may not be as 
profitable or as beneficial as anticipated, 
which may have a material adverse effect on 
its business, financial position and results 
of operations.

Furthermore, many of Aramco’s projects require 
significant capital expenditures. If cash flow from 
operating activities and funds from external 
financial resources are not sufficient to cover 
Aramco’s capital expenditure requirements, 
Aramco may be required to reallocate available 
capital among its projects or modify its capital 
expenditure plans, which may result in delays to, 
or cancellation of, certain projects or deferral  
of certain capital expenditures. Any change to 
Aramco’s capital expenditure plans could, in 
turn, have a material adverse effect on Aramco’s 
growth objectives and its business, financial 
position and results of operations.

Aramco’s historical 
results of operations 
may not be directly 
comparable from  
year to year.

In recent years, the Government has adopted a 
number of changes to the fiscal regime under 
which Aramco operates. These changes have a 
material impact on Aramco’s results of operations 
and make its consolidated financial statements 
for certain periods less directly comparable, 
particularly with respect to revenue and other 
income related to sales, production royalties, 
other taxes, income taxes and zakat. Accordingly, 
Aramco’s historical results of operations are not 

necessarily determinative of its likely future cash 
flows, results of operations or rate of growth, 
and its past performance should not be relied 
upon as an indication of its future performance. 
For a more detailed discussion of the fiscal 
regime changes and their effect on Aramco’s 
consolidated financial statements, see Section 2: 
Results and performance, Section 6: Additional 
financial and legal information, and Section 7: 
Consolidated financial statements.

Aramco may not 
realize some or all of 
the expected benefits 
of recent or future 
acquisitions, including 
the acquisition of a 
70% equity interest 
in SABIC.

Aramco has engaged in, and may continue 
to engage in, acquisitions of businesses, 
technologies, services, products and other assets 
from time to time. Any such acquisition entails 
various risks, including that Aramco may not be 
able to accurately assess the value, strengths and 
weaknesses of the acquisition or investment 
targets, effectively integrate the purchased 
businesses or assets, achieve the expected 
synergies or recover the purchase costs of the 
acquired businesses or assets. Aramco may also 
incur unanticipated costs or assume unexpected 
liabilities and losses in connection with any 
business or asset it acquires, including in relation 
to the retention of key employees, legal 
contingencies (such as, contractual, financial, 
regulatory, environmental or other obligations 
and liabilities) and risks related to the acquired 
business, and the maintenance and integration 
of procedures, controls and quality standards. 

These difficulties could impact Aramco’s ongoing 
business, distract its management and employees 
and increase its expenses which could, in turn, 
have a material adverse effect on its business, 
financial position and results of operations.

On June 16, 2020, Aramco acquired the PIF’s 70% 
equity interest in SABIC for total consideration 
of SAR 259.1 billion ($69.1 billion). For the 
acquisition to be successful for Aramco, it will 
need to manage its ownership stake in SABIC in 
a manner which supports the optimization of 
SABIC’s performance. The realization of such 
benefits may be affected by a number of factors, 
many of which are beyond Aramco’s control. 
Failure to realize some or all of the anticipated 
benefits of the acquisition may impact Aramco’s 
financial performance and prospects, including 
the growth of its downstream business.

Risk factors continued



Aramco is exposed 
to risks related  
to operating in 
several countries.

A substantial portion of Aramco’s downstream 
operations are conducted outside the Kingdom. 
Risks inherent in operating in several countries 
include, without limitation:
• complying with, and managing changes to 

and developments in, a variety of laws and 
regulations, including, without limitation, 
with respect to price regulations, data privacy, 
cybersecurity, the environment, forced 
divestment of assets, expropriation of property 
and cancellation or forced renegotiation of 
contract rights;

• complying with tax regimes in multiple 
jurisdictions and the imposition of new or 
increased withholding or other taxes or royalties;

• the imposition of new, or changes to existing, 
transfer pricing regulations or the imposition of 
new restrictions on foreign trade, investment 
or travel;

• adverse changes in economic and trade 
sanctions, import or export controls and 
national security measures resulting in business 
disruptions, including delays or denials of 
import or export licenses or blocked or rejected 
financial transactions;

• conducting business with subsidiaries, joint 
operations and joint ventures and their 
potential challenges implementing policies 
and procedures consistent with the Company’s 
policies and procedures; and

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Operating in several countries also requires 
significant management attention and resources. 
The occurrence of any of these risks may be 
burdensome and could have a material adverse 
effect on Aramco’s business, financial position 
and results of operations.

Aramco is 
dependent on 
Senior Management 
and key personnel.

Aramco operates in a competitive environment, 
and its success depends upon its ability to 
identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain 
highly-qualified Senior Management and other 
key personnel. Aramco’s Senior Management 
and other key personnel may voluntarily 
terminate their employment with Aramco or 
leave their positions due to reasons beyond 
Aramco’s control. If Aramco experiences a large 

number of departures of its oil and gas experts 
in a relatively short period of time, attracting 
and retaining a sufficient number of replacement 
personnel may be challenging. If Aramco is 
unable to hire and retain Senior Management 
and other key personnel with requisite skills and 
expertise, it could have a material adverse effect 
on Aramco’s business, financial position and 
results of operations.

Aramco’s operations 
are dependent on the 
reliability and security 
of its IT systems.

Aramco relies on the security of critical 
information and operational technology systems 
for, among other things, the exploration, 
development, production, storage and 
distribution of hydrocarbons, the processing, 
use and security of financial records, proprietary 
information, intellectual property, personal 
information and operating data, and 
communications with management, personnel 
and business partners. Cyber incidents may 
negatively impact these or other functions and, 
particularly in relation to industrial control 
systems, may result in physical damage, injury 
or loss of life and environmental harm. Aramco’s 
systems are a high-profile target for sophisticated 
cyberattacks by nation states, criminal hackers 
and competitors, and it routinely fends off 
malicious attempts to gain unauthorized systems 
access. While Aramco seeks to maintain a secure 
network infrastructure to protect against critical 
data loss and to ensure operational integrity and 
continuity, there is a risk that determined 

attackers with access to the necessary resources 
could successfully penetrate its systems. 
Attempts to gain unauthorized access to Aramco 
networks have been successful in the past, 
including a 2012 cyberattack in which Aramco 
resorted to manual procedures for certain 
nonoperational related matters while the breach 
was contained. To date, none of these attempts 
have been material to Aramco’s financial 
performance or reputation. Nonetheless, the 
nature and breadth of any potential future 
cyberattack remain unknown and technology 
that has allowed an increase in remote working 
arrangements may increase the risk of 
cybersecurity incidents, data breaches or 
cyberattacks. Such incidents could result in 
significant costs, including investigation and 
remediation expenses, regulatory scrutiny, legal 
liability and the loss of personal or sensitive 
business or third-party information, and could 
have a material adverse effect on Aramco’s 
operations and reputation.

Legal and regulatory risks

Aramco is and has 
been subject to 
significant litigation 
and other actions.

Aramco is and has been subject to significant 
litigation, primarily in the United States and 
the Kingdom. Some of the most significant U.S. 
litigation has involved allegations of violations 
of antitrust laws arising, in part, from the 
Kingdom’s membership and participation in 
OPEC. Such antitrust litigation sought extensive 
relief, including treble damages, divestiture of 
assets in the United States and disgorgement of 
profits. If granted, this relief could have had a 
material adverse impact on Aramco. To date, 
the OPEC-related antitrust lawsuits have been 
dismissed on the basis of various sovereign 
defenses under U.S. law. However, there is no 
assurance that Aramco will prevail on the basis  
of these defenses in the future in connection 
with OPEC-related or other lawsuits, and Aramco 
and its affiliates could be subject to similar claims 
elsewhere in the future where it may not have 
similar defenses. In addition, there is a risk  
that laws could be enacted in the future that 
would expressly remove or weaken certain 
sovereign defenses.

In addition, increasing attention on climate 
change risks may result in increased litigation 
against Aramco and its affiliates. Claims relating 
to climate change matters have been filed 
against companies in the oil and gas industry by 
private parties, shareholders of such companies, 
public interest organizations, state attorneys 
general, cities and other localities, especially 
in the United States and Europe. These lawsuits 
seek a variety of remedies, including financial 
compensation for alleged past and future 
damages resulting from climate change and 
court orders requiring energy companies to 
reduce GHG emissions. Furthermore, oil and 
gas companies have been subject to a growing 
number of lawsuits alleging damages from the 
companies’ contributions to climate change, 
failure to protect the environment from the 
effects of their operations, concealing 
information about the consequences of the use 
of their products on climate change and similar 
matters. Motiva has been named in several of 
these lawsuits, and Aramco and its affiliates may 
be named in similar lawsuits in the future.

In addition, oil and gas companies are also 
increasingly subject to lawsuits based on 
allegations that certain public statements 
regarding environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) matters or net-zero or carbon neutrality 
targets are made without clear plans, exaggerate 
spending on energy that comes from sources 
other than fossil fuels, lack details or factual 
support or rely too heavily on carbon or other 
offsets or technologies that are not yet viable or 
scalable and therefore are false and misleading 
“greenwashing” campaigns or that climate-
related disclosures made by companies are 
inadequate. Aramco could be subject to such 
lawsuits if it makes these types of statements and 
its customers or investors believe they have been 
harmed as a result. Motiva is subject to this type 
of lawsuit where a state government in the 
United States alleged that Motiva engaged in 
greenwashing and misled consumers about the 
consequences of the use of its products on 
climate change.

Litigation could result in substantial costs 
(including civil or criminal penalties, or both, 
damages or the imposition of import trade 
measures) and require Aramco to devote 
substantial resources and divert management 
attention, any of which may have a material 
adverse effect on its business, financial position 
and results of operations.

Moreover, exports of crude oil, refined products 
and petrochemicals by Aramco or its affiliates to 
foreign countries may be affected by litigation, 
regulatory actions, investigations, disputes or 
agreements that lead to the imposition of import 
trade measures, including anti-dumping and 
countervailing duties, safeguard measures, 
import licensing and customs requirements, and 
new or increased tariffs, quotas or embargoes. 
The possibility and effect of any such measures 
will depend on the laws governing the foreign 
country to which the applicable products are 
being exported and applicable international 
trade agreements. Foreign countries may 
take such measures for political or other reasons, 
including reasons unrelated to Aramco actions 
or operations. Because the majority of Aramco’s 
products are exported, any such measures may 
have a material adverse effect on Aramco’s business, 
financial position and results of operations.

Continued

Aramco is and has 
been subject to 
significant litigation 
and other actions.

In addition, the Kingdom is a party to 
international trade agreements, such as World 
Trade Organization agreements, that include 
commitments by the Kingdom with respect to 
the composition of its laws, regulations and 
practices that impact international trade. The 
Kingdom may become a party to other such 
agreements in the future. Compliance by the 
Kingdom with any such commitments may 
directly or indirectly impact Aramco and could 
cause it to alter its operations in a manner that 

is costly or otherwise has a material adverse 
effect on its business, financial position or results 
of operations. If the Kingdom fails to comply 
with these commitments, Aramco’s business 
operations could be exposed to scrutiny and 
Aramco or its affiliates’ exports could be subject 
to potential remedial measures, such as duties, 
which could have a material adverse effect on 
Aramco’s business, financial position and results 
of operations.

Aramco operates in 
a regulated industry 
and its business may 
be affected by 
regulatory changes.

The oil and gas industry in the Kingdom is a 
regulated industry. Any change in the Kingdom’s 
laws, regulations, policies or practices relating 
to the oil and gas industry could have a material 
adverse effect on Aramco’s business, financial 
position and results of operations. In addition, 
although the Concession provides for an initial 
period of 40 years, which will be extended by 
the Government for 20 years provided Aramco 
satisfies certain conditions commensurate with 
current operating practices (and may be 

amended and extended for an additional 
40 years thereafter subject to Aramco and 
the Government agreeing on the terms of 
the extension), there is no assurance that the 
Government will not revoke the Concession 
in whole or in part or adversely change 
Aramco’s rights in respect of the Concession, 
which would have a significant adverse effect 
on Aramco’s business, financial position and 
results of operations.

Violations of 
applicable sanctions 
and trade restrictions, 
as well as anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption 
laws, could adversely 
affect Aramco.

Aramco currently conducts business, and could 
in the future decide to take part in new business 
activities, in locations where certain parties 
are subject to sanctions and trade restrictions, 
as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, 
imposed by the United States, the European 
Union, the United Kingdom and other 
sanctioning or regulatory bodies. Laws and 
regulations governing sanctions, trade 
restrictions and bribery and corruption are 
complex and are subject to change. For example, 
sanctions activities against Russia and individuals 
and companies connected to the Russian 
government or its officials have increased 
following the start of the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict and additional sanctions could be 
imposed in the future that may adversely 
impact Aramco’s businesses.

There can be no assurance that Aramco’s 
corporate governance, compliance and ethics 
policies and procedures (including with respect 
to sanctions and trade restrictions, anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption) will protect it from the 
improper conduct of its employees or business 
partners, which conduct could result in 
substantial civil or criminal penalties. If Aramco 
were to be sanctioned in the future, as a result 
of its transactions with other parties or 
otherwise, such sanctions could result in asset 
freezes against Aramco, restrictions on investors 
trading securities issued by Aramco or other 
adverse consequences. Such penalties or 
sanctions could have a material adverse effect 
on Aramco’s business, financial position and 
matter of operations.

Legal and regulatory risks continued

Aramco is required to 
obtain, maintain and 
renew governmental 
licenses, permits and 
approvals in order to 
operate its businesses.

The rights granted to Aramco under the 
Concession represent Aramco’s licenses, permits 
and approvals necessary to conduct business 
in the Kingdom with respect to hydrocarbons 
operations and related activities. However, 
Aramco is required to obtain and renew any 
license, permit or approval that is required under 
the Hydrocarbons Law, GSPR (which is replaced 
by the Energy Supplies Law) or with respect to 
certain other activities unrelated to hydrocarbons 
operations. There can be no assurance that the 

relevant authorities will issue any such licenses, 
permits or approvals in the time frame 
anticipated by Aramco, or at all. Any unforeseen 
failure to renew, maintain or obtain the required 
permits and approvals, or the revocation or 
termination of existing licenses, permits and 
approvals, may interrupt Aramco’s operations, 
could result in financial and other penalties 
and could have a material adverse effect on 
Aramco’s business, financial position and 
results of operations.

Aramco’s operations 
are subject to 
environmental 
protection, health 
and safety laws and 
regulations and 
increased concerns 
regarding the safe  
use of chemicals and 
plastics and their 
potential impact on 
the environment have 
resulted in more 
restrictive regulations 
and could lead to 
new regulations.

Aramco’s operations are subject to laws and 
regulations relating to environmental protection, 
health and safety. These laws and regulations 
govern, among other things, the generation, 
storage, handling, use, disposal and 
transportation of hazardous materials, the 
emission and discharge of hazardous materials, 
groundwater use and contamination and the 
health and safety of Aramco’s employees and 
the communities in which it operates. 
Compliance with these obligations can result 
in significant expenditures. If Aramco fails to 
comply with applicable laws and regulations, 
it could be subject to fines or the partial or total 
shutdown of related operations. Aramco has, 
from time to time, shutdown certain facilities in 
order to ensure compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations.

The implementing regulation for air quality 
was issued pursuant to the resolution of the 
Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture 
number (512258/1/1442) dated 24/09/1442H 
(corresponding to May 6, 2021) in accordance 
with the Environmental Law issued by Royal 
Decree No. M/165, dated 19/11/1441H 
(corresponding to July 10, 2020), and became 
effective on January 13, 2021. The implementing 
regulation for air quality imposes significantly 
more stringent limits on emissions from various 
types of facilities, compared to earlier 
regulations, and the Company is currently 
engaged in discussions with the regulator to 
clarify or reconsider certain requirements set 
out under this regulation. Depending on the 
outcome of the Company’s discussions with the 
regulator, there is a risk that significant costs 
could be required to bring Aramco’s facilities  
into compliance with this regulation. 

In addition, a stricter interpretation of existing 
laws and regulations, any changes in these laws 
and regulations or the enactment of new laws 
and regulations may impose new obligations 
on Aramco or otherwise adversely affect 
Aramco’s business, financial position and results 
of operations.

Aramco may also (i) incur significant costs 
associated with the investigation, clean up and 
restoration of contaminated land, water or 
ecosystems, as well as claims for damage to 
property and (ii) face claims of death or injury 
to persons resulting from exposure to hazardous 
materials or adverse impacts on natural resources 
and properties of others resulting from its 
operations (including potentially from the 
transportation of hazardous substances and 
products, feedstock or chemical pollution). Any 
such costs or liabilities could have a material 
adverse effect on Aramco’s business, financial 
position and results of operations. In particular, 
in the United States, Motiva and other companies 
in the petroleum refining and marketing industry 
historically used MTBE as a gasoline additive. 
Motiva is a party to pending lawsuits concerning 
alleged environmental impact associated with 
historic releases of MTBE in the United States, 
many of which involve other petroleum 
marketers and refiners. Plaintiffs in these MTBE 
lawsuits generally seek to spread liability among 
large groups of oil companies and seek 
substantial damages. Additional lawsuits and 
claims related to the use of MTBE, including 
personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. 
Motiva could be subject to material liabilities 
relating to MTBE claims.

Aramco’s operations 
are subject to 
environmental 
protection, health 
and safety laws and 
regulations and 
increased concerns 
regarding the safe 
use of chemicals and 
plastics and their 
potential impact on 
the environment have 
resulted in more 
restrictive regulations 
and could lead to 
new regulations.

Moreover, concerns regarding chemicals and 
plastics, including their safe use and potential 
impact on the environment, and how plastics 
contribute to climate change, reflect a growing 
trend in societal demands for increasing levels 
of product safety, less plastic use, environmental 
protection and recycling. These concerns have 
led to more restrictive regulations and could lead 
to new regulations. They could also manifest 
themselves in shareholder proposals, delays or 
failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory 

approvals, increased costs related to complying 
with more restrictive regulations, delayed 
product launches, lack of market acceptance, 
lower sales volumes or discontinuance of 
chemicals or plastics products, continued 
pressure for more stringent regulatory 
intervention and increased litigation. These 
consequences could also have an adverse effect 
on Aramco’s business, financial position, results 
of operations and reputation.

The mechanism 
for equalization 
compensation Aramco 
receives from the 
Government in respect 
of domestic sales of 
certain hydrocarbons 
may be changed.

The Concession requires Aramco to meet 
domestic demand for certain hydrocarbons, 
petroleum products and LPG through domestic 
production or imports. In addition, pursuant to 
the Kingdom’s regulatory regime, Aramco is 
required to sell crude oil and certain refined 
products to third parties in the Kingdom at the 
Government’s regulated prices. The regulated 
prices for these products have historically 
generated less revenue for Aramco than if  
the same products had been sold for export.

Pursuant to an equalization mechanism, the 
Government compensates Aramco for the 
revenue it directly forgoes as a result of selling 
these products in the Kingdom at regulated 
prices. Under this mechanism, Aramco receives 
compensation for the difference between 
regulated prices and equalization prices in 
respect of such sales.

Furthermore, in the Kingdom, natural gas prices 
are regulated by the Government and the price 
that domestic customers pay is traditionally set 
by the Council of Ministers. Effective September 
17, 2019, the Government implemented an 
equalization mechanism to compensate Aramco 
for the revenue it directly forgoes as a result of 
selling Regulated Gas Products in the Kingdom 
at Domestic Gas Prices, in the event that the 
Government does not adjust the Domestic Gas 
Prices to meet the pricing of the gas projects in 
order to ensure Aramco receives a commercial 
rate of return on each project. Under this 
mechanism, Aramco receives compensation 
for the difference between Domestic Gas Prices 
and Blended Prices in respect of such sales.

No assurance can be given that either 
equalization mechanism will not be revoked or 
amended on terms less favorable to Aramco than 
the existing mechanism. In addition, in the event 
that the equalization price is less than the 
regulated price, in the case of liquids, or the 
Blended Price is less than the Domestic Gas Price, 
in the case of natural gas, the difference would 
be due from Aramco to the Government. Any 
such event could have a material adverse effect 
on Aramco’s earnings, cash flow, financial 
position and results of operations.

Legal and regulatory risks continued

Aramco is required 
to separate its 
downstream business 
into an independent 
legal entity within 
a certain time period 
as a condition of the 
Government allowing 
the general corporate 
tax rate to apply 
to Aramco’s 
downstream business.

Effective January 1, 2020, the tax rate applicable 
to Aramco’s downstream activities is, for a 
five-year period, the general corporate tax rate 
of 20% that applies to all similar domestic 
downstream companies under the Income Tax 
Law, rather than the 50% to 85% multitiered 
structure of income tax rates that previously 
applied to domestic oil and hydrocarbon 
production companies. In order for the general 
corporate tax rate to apply to Aramco’s 
downstream business, Aramco is required to 
separate its downstream activities (from the 
oil and hydrocarbon production activities) 

into an independent legal entity before 
December 31, 2024. If Aramco does not comply 
in separating its downstream business within this 
five-year period and is not granted an extension, 
Aramco’s downstream business will be taxed 
retroactively on an annual basis for such 
five-year period in accordance with the 
multitiered tax rates applicable to domestic  
oil and hydrocarbon production companies.  
In such case, Aramco may be required to pay  
the difference in taxes due to the Government,  
which could adversely affect its financial position.

Risks related to the Kingdom

The Government 
determines the 
Kingdom’s maximum 
level of crude oil 
production and 
target MSC.

The Government determines the Kingdom’s 
maximum level of crude oil production in the 
exercise of its sovereign prerogative. Accordingly, 
the Government may in its sole discretion 
increase or decrease the Kingdom’s maximum 
level of crude oil production at any time based 
on its sovereign energy security goals or for 
any other reason, which may be influenced 
by, among other things, global economic and 
political conditions and their corresponding 
impact on the Kingdom’s policy and strategic 
decisions with respect to exploration, 
development and production of crude 
oil reserves.

In order to facilitate rapid changes in production 
volumes, the Government requires Aramco to 
maintain MSC in excess of its then current 
production in accordance with the Hydrocarbons 
Law and has the exclusive authority to set MSC. 
MSC refers to the average maximum number of 
barrels per day of crude oil that can be produced 
for one year during any future planning period, 
after taking into account all planned capital 
expenditures and maintenance, repair and 
operating costs, and after being given three 
months to make operational adjustments. 
Aramco incurs substantial costs to maintain MSC 
and has historically utilized a significant amount 
of this spare capacity. However, there can be no 
assurance that it will utilize spare capacity in the 
future. The Government has decided in the past 
and may in the future decide to increase MSC. 

MSC was 12.0 million barrels of crude oil per 
day from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022. 
In line with the Government’s 2020 mandate for 
MSC to be increased to 13.0 million barrels of 
crude oil per day, Aramco is proceeding with 
its plans to reach the mandated MSC by 2027. 
Future increases in MSC could require Aramco to 
incur significant additional capital expenditures.

The Government’s decisions regarding maximum 
level of crude oil production and MSC, and 
Aramco’s costs of complying with such decisions, 
may not maximize returns for Aramco. For 
example, Aramco may be precluded from 
producing more crude oil in response to either 
a decrease or increase in prices, which may limit 
its ability to generate additional revenue or to 
increase its production of downstream products. 
Any of these actions could have a material 
adverse effect on Aramco’s business, financial 
position and results of operations.

Risk factors continued



If growth in domestic 
gas demand is less 
than expected, 
Aramco may not 
receive its expected 
return on its gas 
infrastructure 
investments.

The Concession requires that Aramco meet 
domestic demand for gas and, according to IHS 
Markit, domestic demand for gas is expected  
to grow by a CAGR of 4.0%. In response to the 
expected increase in demand for gas in the 
Kingdom, Aramco is undertaking several projects 
to grow its gas supply. Aramco’s gas infrastructure 
investment costs may include costs related to 
well drilling, upgrades to existing facilities and 
the construction of new facilities to handle 
additional volumes, including gas processing 
facilities, pipelines and distribution networks 
including MGS, and storage facilities. Aramco  
is compensated for its sales of natural gas to 
domestic consumers based on usage.

Therefore, if the forecasted growth in domestic 
demand for natural gas is less than expected, 
Aramco may not receive its expected return on 
its gas infrastructure investments, which may 
have a material adverse effect on its business, 
financial position and results of operations.

The Kingdom’s public 
finances are highly 
connected to the 
hydrocarbon industry.

The oil sector accounted for 38.6% and 40.9% of 
the Kingdom’s real GDP in the years ended 
December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. In 
addition, oil revenues accounted for 58.2% and 
68.2% of the Government’s total revenues in the 
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, 
respectively.1 The Government is expected to 
continue to rely on royalties, taxes, dividends 
from Aramco and other income from the 
hydrocarbon industry for a significant portion of 
its revenue. Any change in crude oil, condensate, 
NGL, oil product, chemical and natural gas prices 
or other occurrences that negatively affect 

Aramco’s results of operations could materially 
affect the macroeconomic indicators of the 
Kingdom, including GDP, balance of payments 
and foreign trade and the amount of cash 
available to the Government. A shortfall in 
funding to the Government or a decision to seek 
more revenue from hydrocarbons may lead the 
Government to change the fiscal regime to which 
hydrocarbon producers in the Kingdom, including 
Aramco, are subject. Any such change could have 
a material adverse effect on Aramco’s business, 
financial position and results of operations.

Political and social 
instability and unrest 
and actual or potential 
armed conflicts in 
MENA may affect 
Aramco’s results of 
operations and 
financial position.

Aramco is headquartered and conducts much 
of its business in MENA. The MENA region is 
strategically important geopolitically and has 
been subject to political and security concerns 
and social unrest. For example, in recent years, 
a number of countries in the region have 
witnessed significant social unrest, including 
widespread public demonstrations and, in certain 
cases, armed conflict, terrorist attacks, diplomatic 
disputes, foreign military intervention and 
change of government. Such social unrest and 
other political and security concerns may not 
abate, may worsen and may spread to additional 
countries. Some of Aramco’s facilities, 
infrastructure and reserves are located near the 
borders of countries that have been or may be 
impacted. No assurance can be given that these 
political or security concerns or social unrest 
will not have a material adverse effect on 
Aramco’s business, financial position and results 
of operations.

In addition, the majority of Aramco’s crude oil 
production is exported using international supply 
routes. In particular, the Strait of Hormuz and the 
Suez Canal are key shipping routes for Aramco’s 
crude oil and are located in areas subject to 
political or armed conflict from time to time. For 
example, in May 2019, four oil tankers, including 
two owned by the National Shipping Company  
of Saudi Arabia (Bahri), were sabotaged near the 
Strait of Hormuz and, in July 2019, a British oil 
tanker was seized by Iranian forces in the Strait  
of Hormuz. In addition, in April and July 2018, 
Yemen’s Houthi group attacked tankers operated 
by the National Shipping Company of Saudi 
Arabia (Bahri) off the coast of Yemen. Any 
political or armed conflict or other event, 
including those described above, that impacts 
Aramco’s use of the Strait of Hormuz, Suez Canal 
or other international shipping routes could have 
a material adverse effect on Aramco’s business, 
financial position and results of operations.

Risks related to the Kingdom continued

Continued

Political and social 
instability and unrest 
and actual or potential 
armed conflicts in 
MENA may affect 
Aramco’s results of 
operations and 
financial position.

Moreover, the majority of Aramco’s assets and 
operations are located in the Kingdom and 
accordingly, may be affected by the political, 
social and economic conditions from time to time 
prevailing in or affecting the Kingdom or the 
wider MENA region. Any unexpected changes in 
political, social or economic conditions may have 
a material adverse effect on Aramco, which 
could in turn have a material adverse effect on 
Aramco’s business, financial position and results 
of operations or investments that Aramco has 
made or may make in the future.

Furthermore, any of the events described above 
may contribute to instability in MENA and may 
have a material adverse effect on investors’ 
willingness to invest in the Kingdom or 
companies that are based in the Kingdom, 
which may in turn adversely affect the market 
value of the shares.

Aramco’s financial 
position and results 
of operations may be 
adversely affected if 
the Kingdom stops 
pegging the SAR to 
the U.S. Dollar.

Aramco has determined that the U.S. Dollar is 
its functional currency because a substantial 
amount of its products are traded in U.S. Dollars 
in international markets. A portion of Aramco’s 
capital expenditures and operating expenses are 
denominated in Saudi Riyals, while a significant 
portion of its revenues and long-term liabilities 
are denominated in U.S. Dollars. The Saudi Riyal 
has been pegged to the U.S. Dollar in the 
Kingdom since 1986. If the Kingdom’s policy 
of pegging the SAR to the U.S. Dollar were 
to change in the future and the SAR were to 
become stronger relative to the U.S. Dollar, 
Aramco may experience an increase in the SAR 
denominated costs of its operations. Such an 
increase could have a material adverse effect 
on Aramco’s business, financial position and 
results of operations.

In addition, Aramco pays dividends to the 
Government, in its capacity as a shareholder 
of the Company, in U.S. Dollars and to other 
shareholders in SAR. If the SAR is no longer 
pegged to the U.S. Dollar and the SAR were 
to become stronger relative to the U.S. Dollar, 
Aramco may be required to expend additional 
cash to fund its SAR denominated dividends. 
Such changes could have a material adverse 
effect on Aramco’s financial position.

Risk factors continued



The Government may 
direct Aramco to 
undertake projects  
or provide assistance 
for initiatives outside 
Aramco’s core 
business, which may 
not be consistent with 
Aramco’s immediate 
commercial objectives 
or profit maximization.

The Government has directed, and may in the 
future direct, Aramco to undertake projects or 
provide assistance for initiatives outside Aramco’s 
core business in furtherance of the Government’s 
macroeconomic, social or other objectives, 
leveraging Aramco’s know-how, resources  
and operational capabilities. For instance, the 
Government has previously directed Aramco 
to develop and construct large infrastructure 
projects and provide management, logistical and 
other technical assistance for certain Government 
initiatives. The Concession requires that all 
Aramco contracts with any Government agency 
or any arrangement for the furnishing of 
hydrocarbons, services or otherwise shall be 
on a commercial basis and, on September 5, 
2019, Aramco and the Government entered into 
a framework agreement to govern the furnishing 
of services by Aramco to the Government.

While these projects and initiatives have 
generally been of national importance to the 
Kingdom and in Aramco’s long-term commercial 
interests, they have often been outside of 
Aramco’s core businesses and have not always 
been consistent with its immediate commercial 
objectives or profit maximization. If the 
Government directs Aramco to undertake 
future projects other than on a commercial 
basis, Aramco’s financial position and 
results of operation may be materially and 
adversely affected.

The Company is supervised by a Board  
consisting of 11 Directors. The Board oversees  
the management of the Company and is vested 
with all authority to manage the business of the 
Company and supervise its affairs. The Board has 
the power to form any number of committees 
it deems necessary for effective governance, 
oversight, and operations of the Company, or 
to delegate all or some of its authorities to any 
of the committees, as it deems appropriate. 
The Capital Market Law, Companies Law and 
its implementing regulations, and the Bylaws 
along with the Company’s internal governance 
regulations and policies, outline the duties and 
responsibilities of the Board.

Each of the Board’s 11 Directors was elected at 
the Company’s AGM convened on July 1, 2021, 
except for the President and Chief Executive 
Officer who is automatically appointed as a 
member of the Board, pursuant to the Bylaws. 
Each Director was elected for a term of three 
years until June 30, 2024, or until his or her 
replacement is duly elected. There is no limit 
on the number of terms that a Director may 
serve on the Board.

Board Committees
Currently, the Board has four standing 
committees: (i) Audit, (ii) Sustainability, Risk and 
HSE1, (iii) Nomination, and (iv) Compensation. 
Each Committee meets regularly throughout the 
year, reports its actions and recommendations 
to the Board, and receives reports from 
management. All Board Committees have 
their respective charters that identify each 
Committee’s roles, powers, and responsibilities. 
The primary responsibilities of each Committee 
are summarized below in each of the respective 
committee reports or statements, as applicable. 
Additionally, each Board Committee is chaired 
by an independent Non-executive Director.

Independence
The Company’s Bylaws set forth requirements 
concerning the composition of its Board, including 
that the number of independent Directors must 
satisfy the minimum requirements of applicable 
laws and regulations in the Kingdom. Annually, 
the Board makes an affirmative determination 
regarding the independence of each Director 
based upon the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee and in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations. Applying these 
standards, the Board has determined that the 
following five Board members are independent 
Directors: Mr. Liveris, Ms. Elsenhans, Mr. Cella, 
Mr. Weinberger, and Mr. Gulliver.

There are no existing conflicts of interest 
between any duties of any Director toward the 
Company and the Director’s personal interests 
and/or other duties. Further, during the last fiscal 
year, none of the Directors participated in any 
competing business with the Company, according 
to the competition standards approved by the 
General Assembly.

The business address of each Director is the 
registered address of the Company.

Board diversity and composition
The Board values diversity of talent, skills, 
viewpoints and experience, and believes 
that Board diversity of all types enhances 
the performance of the Board and provides 
significant benefits to the Company. Accordingly, 
the Nomination Committee considers the diversity 
of the Board with respect to these categories 
when reviewing its composition, as well as 
when nominating new Director candidates.

In its assessment of the Board’s composition, 
the Nomination Committee also considers each 
Director’s professional experience, integrity, 
honesty, judgment, independence, 
accountability, willingness to express 
independent thought, understanding of the 
Company’s business and other factors that the 
Nomination Committee determines are pertinent 
in light of the current needs of the Board. 
The Nomination Committee also considers 
each Director’s key skills and experience in 
light of the Company’s strategy.

When identifying prospective candidates for 
the Board, the Nomination Committee considers 
the criteria described above and seeks individuals 
with successful leadership experience who have 
achieved prominence in their primary fields, 
and whose background demonstrates an 
understanding of business affairs as well as the 
complexities of a large, publicly listed company. 
In addition, candidates must have demonstrated 
an ability to think strategically and make decisions 
with a forward-looking focus, as well as the ability 
to assimilate relevant information on a broad 
range of complex topics. Moreover, candidates 
must have the ability to devote the time necessary 
to meet a Director’s responsibilities.

characteristics of the Company’s businesses 
and the associated qualifications, skills and

Board evaluations
The Board conducts an annual self-assessment, 
alternating between conducting its own 
assessment with the Nomination Committee 
overseeing the process and engaging with a 
third-party consultant to conduct the assessment 
at least once every three years. Director 
responses and feedback are reviewed and 
tracked over time to identify trends and 
determine appropriate items of focus to enhance

the Board’s performance. In 2022, the Board 
conducted its self-evaluation with the 
Nomination Committee overseeing the process 
and communication of the results to the Board.

Audit Committee report



• A report on significant litigation matters;
• A review of the Company’s financial risk 

management activities;
• A report on processes and internal controls for 

the subsidiary, Aramco Trading Company;
• A report on the Company’s financing strategy;
• A review and approval of an amended Internal 

Auditing charter;
• The Company’s 2023 global internal audit plan, 

including the related plan development 
approach and process;

• A report on the Company’s financial 
framework;

• A report on the Company’s Enterprise Tax 
Risk Management Framework;

• A report on managing enterprise-wide 
regulatory compliance risks through a global 
compliance framework; and

• A report on the Company’s internal controls 
over financial reporting.

The Company’s General Auditor was present at 
each of the Audit Committee meetings held in 
2022. As part of his presentations to the Audit 
Committee, the General Auditor reported on 
the Company’s internal auditing activities 
undertaken during the year. As part of the 
Audit Committee’s review of the 2023 global 
internal audit plan, the Audit Committee sought 
to ensure that the plan is aligned with the key 
risks of the business.

Financial reporting and external audit
Two of the Audit Committee’s key responsibilities 
are to monitor the integrity of the financial 
statements and to assess the effectiveness of 
the external auditor.

The Audit Committee has assessed that 
appropriate accounting policies have been 
adopted throughout the accounting period 
and that management has made reasonable 
estimates and judgments over the recognition, 
measurement, and presentation of the 
financial results.

At the Audit Committee’s meetings in 2022 there 
were extensive reports and discussions with the 
external auditor and members of management 
regarding the financial statements, including 
detailed analysis of the financial performance 
and changes in the financial position of the 
Company, the process to prepare the final 
financial statements and the related independent 
review by the external auditor for the first, 
second and third quarters of the year. 

The external auditor also presented to the Audit 
Committee members the 2022 External Audit 
Plan reviewing the process they would undertake 
to complete the audit of the 2022 annual financial 
statements. Also, at this meeting, the Audit 
Committee reviewed the external auditor’s 
performance and independence for 2022 and 
did not identify any deficiencies.

At the 2021 AGM, the Company’s shareholders 
appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for 
the 10-year period from 2021-2030 up to and 
including the first quarter of 2031. Therefore, 
PwC will not have to be appointed by the 
shareholders until fiscal year 2031. The Audit 
Committee endorsed, for approval by the Board, 
the continued appointment of PwC for 2023 
and approved the engagement letter with PwC, 
setting out the terms and conditions for its 
services in 2023. Regardless of this shareholder 
appointment, the Company may, in its discretion, 
appoint, for approval by the shareholders, a 
different external auditor prior to the end of 
PwC’s term.

In 2021, when recommending the appointment 
of PwC as the external auditor for 2022, the Audit 
Committee authorized management to engage 
PwC to perform certain limited other services, 
to ensure they, as external auditor, remain 
independent under the Saudi Organization for 
Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA) 
standards and under guidance issued by the 
International Federation of Accountants. The 
principal limited other services provided by 
the external auditor in 2022 are mainly related 
to tax compliance.

The current audit partner will continue to act as 
global engagement audit partner for PwC, until 
the conclusion of the fiscal year-end 2023 audit, 
subject to satisfactory performance and continued 
engagement of PwC, as external auditor.

Internal controls
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing 
the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal control and financial risk management 
systems. During the course of the year, the Audit 
Committee has considered various material 
controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls, and the Audit Committee is 
of the opinion that the Company’s internal and 
financial control systems and risk management 
systems are effective and adequate.

Finally, in 2022, as a matter of good governance, 
the Sustainability, Risk and HSE Committee 
performed an internal review of its charter to 
ensure it remains in line with peers and global 
best practices. Based on the review that was 
conducted, the Sustainability, Risk and HSE 
Committee endorsed certain amendments to 
its charter to more explicitly address ESG and 
sustainability matters. The amendments to the 
charter were then approved by the Board at its 
May 2022 meeting. The Board also approved to 
change the name of the Risk and HSE Committee 
to the Sustainability, Risk and HSE Committee.

The primary role of the Nomination Committee is 
to lead the process of nominating, appointing 
and evaluating members of the Company’s Board 
and to ensure the effectiveness of the Board and 
the individual Directors. The Nomination 
Committee also evaluates and makes 
recommendations with respect to the structure 
of the Board and composition of the Board’s 
Committees. Further, the Nomination Committee 
evaluates and recommends to the Board the 
appointments of individuals (other than 
Directors) as Company officers, including those 
proposed to hold the title of Executive Vice 
President or higher. The Nomination Committee 
also proposes and makes recommendations to 
the Board with respect to the Company’s relevant 
corporate governance practices and procedures.

The Nomination Committee held three meetings 
in 2022. In March 2022, the Nomination 
Committee verified the following with respect to 
the Directors that were Board members at that 
time: (i) the independence of five independent 
Directors; and (ii) the absence of any conflicts of 
interest. In addition, the Nomination Committee 
reviewed and analyzed the results from the 
2021 Board self-assessment questionnaire and 
endorsed a proposed process for the 2022 Board 
and Board Committees’ self-assessment process. 
The Nomination Committee also discussed a 
proposal for a formal Board succession planning 
process, to ensure the maintenance of an 
adequate pipeline of prospective, suitable 
Board candidates. Finally, the Nomination 
Committee endorsed for the Board’s approval 
the appointment of certain individuals to serve 
as officers of the Company.

In October 2022, the Nomination Committee 
reviewed the 2022 self-assessment process for 
the Board and Board Committees and discussed 
and endorsed the proposed 2023 self-assessment 
process, to be externally-led by a board advisory 
consultant. In addition, the Nomination 
Committee reviewed the workshops conducted 
for the Directors in 2022, and reviewed and 
endorsed proposed workshops for the Directors 
in 2023. Further, the Nomination Committee 
reviewed the Company’s succession planning 
process for Board members and Senior 
Executives. The Nomination Committee also 
determined to change the job titles of Senior 
Management as well as the officers of the 
Company to be closer in line with those broadly 
used in the market, effective January 1, 2023. 
Finally, the Nomination Committee endorsed for 
the Board’s approval the appointment of certain 
individuals to serve as officers of the Company.

In December 2022, the Nomination Committee 
convened for a third time, for a further discussion 
of the Company’s succession planning process for 
Board members and Senior Executives.

With respect to the means used by the Board to 
assess its performance and the performance of 
its members, the Nomination Committee oversaw 
the Board’s 2022 self-assessment process which 
was conducted without third-party participation, 
following the Board’s 2020 engagement with a 
third-party consultant. The self-assessment 
primarily consisted of responding to the same 
questionnaire as used in the 2021 engagement 
and comparing the results to determine any 
trends in the performance of the Board and 
its Committees.

Finally, as a matter of good governance, the 
Nomination Committee performed its customary 
periodic reviews of the adequacy of its charter in 
light of practices of peers and global best practices.

The Company’s compensation framework for 
its Senior Executives is designed to provide a 
balanced compensation package that includes 
base pay, variable pay and benefits as follows:
• With respect to fixed remuneration, the 

Company considers the level and demands 
of the position, including duties and 
responsibilities, as well as the educational 
qualifications, practical experience, skills, 
performance, and seniority of the individual, all 
within the context of market conditions and pay 
practices of peers and other relevant companies.

• With respect to variable remuneration, the 
Company offers variable compensation that 
is market-aligned and subject to the fulfillment 
of predefined performance goals. Two key 
variable pay plans are used: (i) a Short-Term 
Incentive Plan (STIP), an annual cash-based 
plan designed to reward performance in three 
areas (financial, operational, and safety and 
sustainability); and, (ii) a Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) designed to reward key financial, 
strategic and environmental/sustainability 
performance over a three-year period. 

The values reported for 2022 represent 
the awarded amount for the 2020 to 2022 
performance period, granted in shares which 
vested on March 1, 2023, and the cash 
equivalent of dividend distributions on those 
shares during the performance period.

• Besides pension, savings plan and medical 
services, benefits are primarily housing-related 
allowances or equivalent, and transportation-
related allowances or equivalent. The nature 
and levels of benefits for the Senior Executives 
are periodically reviewed and approved by the 
Compensation Committee.

• End-of-service awards represent the annual 
incremental value to the employee of pension 
provisions and end-of-service severance 
provisions, all of which are paid post-
employment.

Dividend distribution policy and 
dividends framework
Pursuant to the Bylaws, the Board has sole 
discretion to declare dividends with respect 
to the outstanding shares in accordance with 
the Company’s Dividend Distribution Policy. 
However, it is under no obligation to do so. 
The amount and frequency of any dividends will 
depend on a number of factors, including the 
Company’s historic and anticipated earnings and 
cash flow, the Company’s financial obligations 
and capital requirements, general economic 
and marketplace conditions, and other factors 
deemed relevant by the Board. The Company’s 
expectations in connection with these factors 
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, which may be beyond the 
Company’s control.

The Company pays dividends to non-Government 
shareholders in SAR and to the Government in 
U.S. dollars. All shares have the same entitlement 
to any dividends declared by the Board and any 
dividends are and will be distributed in 
compliance with applicable tax laws.

In 2021 and 2022, the Company’s dividend 
payments totaled SAR 281.3 billion ($75.0 billion) 
and SAR 281.3 billion ($75.0 billion), respectively. 
On March 10, 2023, the Company declared an 
ordinary dividend of SAR 73.2 billion ($19.5 
billion) with respect to the fourth quarter of 2022 
and is payable to the holders of shares as at the 
eligibility date for payment of such dividend as 
declared by the Board.

On May 12, 2022, the Company’s Extraordinary 
General Assembly, approved the Board of 
Directors’ recommendation to capitalize SAR 15.0 
billion ($4.0 billion) of the Company’s retained 
earnings to support the distribution of bonus 
shares to shareholders, in the amount of one 
share for every 10 shares held. This resulted in an 
increase of ordinary shares outstanding from 200 
billion to 220 billion, and an increase in Aramco’s 
share capital by SAR 15.0 billion ($4.0 billion). 
Accordingly, this resulted in dividends per share 
of SAR 0.3198 ($0.08528) (based on 
220,000,000,000 ordinary shares outstanding).

Governance, risk and compliance continued



In addition, on March 10, 2023, the Board of 
Directors recommended to the Extraordinary 
General Assembly to increase the Company’s 
share capital by SAR 15.0 billion ($4.0 billion) and 
increase the number of the Company’s issued 
ordinary shares by 22.0 billion without par value. 
Such increase will be through capitalization  
from the Company’s retained earnings. Each 
shareholder will be granted one bonus share for 
every 10 shares owned. The increase of the share 
capital and the number of ordinary shares is 
subject to obtaining necessary approvals from 
competent authorities and the Extraordinary 
General Assembly, which will be announced 
later as per the required regulatory period.

It is the intention of the Board, in its discretion, to 
deliver sustainable dividends to its shareholders. 
The Company’s Dividend Distribution Policy 
states that dividends may be declared from 
net profits only after the Company has:
• Ensured that dividends are capable of being 

distributed by the Company with reference 
to its most current financial statements;

• Established any reserves to meet contingencies 
as determined from time to time at the 
discretion of the Board; and

• Taken into consideration its working capital 
requirements, near-term liquidity, and any 
other factors or considerations that may be 
relevant in this regard, including but not 
limited to the implications of any dividend 
distributions on the Company’s capital 
structure, credit ratings, and publicly 
communicated gearing targets.

Royal Order No. A/42, dated 26/1/1441H 
(corresponding to September 25, 2019) provides 
that, if the Board resolved to distribute dividends, 
and to the extent that the Board determines that 
the amount of any quarterly cash dividend 
declared with respect to calendar years 2020 
through 2024 would have been less than 
$0.09375 per ordinary share (based on 
200,000,000,000 ordinary shares outstanding) 
but for the Government forgoing its rights to 
such dividend as follows, the Government will 
forgo its right to receive the portion of cash 
dividends on the shares owned by the 
Government (currently amounting to 94.19%) 
equal to the amount necessary to enable the 
Company to first pay the minimum quarterly 
cash dividend amount described above to 
holders of ordinary shares other than the 
Government. The remaining amount of the 
declared dividend as determined by the Board 
in its discretion will be paid to the Government.

Additionally, dividends forgone will not accrue 
or otherwise be paid to the Government and the 
waiver applies to all ordinary shares not held by 
the Government from time to time and held 
from 2020 to 2024.

In 2022, no shareholder of the Company has 
waived any rights to dividends.

Punishments and penalties
The Company is committed to high standards of 
governance. The Company is not aware of any 
penalty, precautionary procedure or preventative 
measure imposed on it by any authority, 
supervisory, regulatory, or judicial body in 2022.

Board of Directors’ report
The information contained in Sections 1 – 6 of 
this Annual Report constitutes the Board of 
Directors’ report.

Compliance with CMA Corporate Governance Regulations
The Company has implemented all the provisions contained in the Corporate Governance Regulations 
issued by the CMA, to the extent applicable to it in light of the Bylaws, except the provision noted below:

Article No. Provision of the Article Justification

92 (Guiding Article) If the Board forms a corporate 
governance committee, it shall 
assign to it the competences (sic) 
stipulated in Article (91) of these 
Regulations. Such committee shall 
oversee any matters relating to the 
implementation of governance, 
and shall provide the Board with 
its reports and recommendations 
at least annually.

While this is a Guiding Article, the 
Board has charged the Nomination 
Committee, formed pursuant to 
the Company Bylaws, with the 
responsibility of overseeing and 
making recommendations to the 
Board with respect to the 
Company’s corporate governance 
policies and practices, including 
the competencies of effective 
governance described in Article 
(91) of the Regulations.

Reserves as at December 31, 2022
As at December 31, 2022, the Kingdom’s reserves in the fields Aramco operates consisted of 338.4 billion boe (2021: 337.3 billion 
boe), including 261.6 billion barrels (2021: 261.6 billion barrels) of crude oil and condensate, 36.1 billion barrels (2021: 36.0 billion 
barrels) of NGL and 246.7 tscf (2021: 241.5 tscf) of natural gas, including 156.9 tscf (2021: 153.7 tscf) of nonassociated gas.

Under the Original Concession, which was in effect until December 24, 2017, Aramco’s rights with respect to hydrocarbons 
in the Kingdom were not limited to a particular term. Accordingly, until such date, the Kingdom’s reserves in the fields Aramco 
operated were the same as Aramco’s reserves. Effective December 24, 2017, the Concession limited Aramco’s exclusive right to 
explore, develop and produce the Kingdom’s hydrocarbon resources, except in the Excluded Areas, to an initial period of 40 
years, which will be extended by the Government for 20 years provided Aramco satisfies certain conditions commensurate with 
current operating practices. In addition, the Concession may be extended for an additional 40 years beyond the prior 60-year 
period subject to Aramco and the Government agreeing on the terms of the extension (see Section 6: Additional legal 
information — the Concession). The provision of a specified term in the Concession impacts the calculation of Aramco’s reserves 
as compared to the Kingdom’s reserves in the fields Aramco operates. The Concession also requires Aramco to meet domestic 
demand for certain hydrocarbons, petroleum products and LPGs through domestic production or imports.

Based on the initial 40-year period and 20-year extension of the Concession, as at December 31, 2022, Aramco’s reserves were 
258.8 billion boe (2021: 253.6 billion boe). Aramco’s oil equivalent reserves consisted of 200.8 billion barrels (2021: 196.9 billion 
barrels) of crude oil and condensate, 25.2 billion barrels (2021: 25.2 billion barrels) of NGL and 201.9 tscf (2021: 194.5 tscf) of 
natural gas. As at December 31, 2022, Aramco’s portfolio included 535 (2021: 530) reservoirs within 142 (2021: 142) fields 
distributed throughout the Kingdom and its territorial waters.

Aramco manages the Kingdom’s unique reserves and resources base to optimize production and maximize long-term value 
pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Law, which mandates that Aramco’s hydrocarbon operations promote long-term productivity of 
the Kingdom’s reservoirs and support the prudent stewardship of its hydrocarbon resources. Aramco has historically replaced 
reserves on an organic basis through revisions of reserve estimates at existing fields and through delineation and exploration 
to identify new fields. As a result, the Kingdom’s estimated proved reserves at the largest oil fields operated by Aramco have 
increased since the time of original production.

The following table sets forth Aramco’s estimates of its proved reserves based on the term of the Concession as at December 31, 
2022 and 2021.

Aramco’s reserve estimates conform to the SPE-PRMS definitions and guidelines, which is the internationally recognized industry 
standard sponsored by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the World 
Petroleum Council, the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the Society of 
Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts and the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers. To estimate or update 
Aramco’s reserve estimates, the Upstream segment employees responsible for reserves calculations perform technical analyses 
that are reviewed internally by progressively higher levels of management until finalized at year-end. Aramco annually updates 
its estimates as it acquires and interprets new data. For reservoirs that have been producing and have established certain 
performance trends, Aramco is typically able to reliably forecast the reservoir’s future production. For reservoirs that have little 
to no production history and new discoveries, Aramco undertakes further analysis in addition to multidisciplinary evaluation  
to formulate production forecasts.

Aramco
The Company was established in the Kingdom as a company with limited liability by virtue of Royal Decree No. M/8 dated 
4/4/1409H (corresponding to November 13, 1988) to assume the privileges and rights of the Arabian American Oil Company. 
On January 1, 2018, the Company was converted into a Saudi joint stock company pursuant to Council of Ministers Resolution  
No. 180 dated 1/4/1439H (corresponding to December 19, 2017) and registered in the city of Dhahran under commercial 
registration No. 2052101150 dated 11/07/1439H (corresponding to March 28, 2018) with Saudi Arabian Oil Company as its official 
name. Its registered head office is located at P.O. Box 5000, Dhahran 31311, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Its share capital is seventy 
five billion Saudi Riyals (SAR 75,000,000,000), consisting of two hundred and twenty billion (220,000,000,000) fully paid ordinary 
shares with no par value. Aramco’s primary operating segments are Upstream and Downstream, which are supported by 
corporate activities (for further details refer to Section 2: Results and performance).

On December 11, 2019, the Company completed its IPO and its ordinary shares were listed on Saudi Exchange (The Exchange). 
In connection with the IPO, the Government, being the sole owner of the Company’s shares at such time, sold 3.45 billion 
ordinary shares, or 1.73% of the Company’s share capital. In addition, concurrent with the IPO, the Company acquired 117.2 
million of its ordinary shares from the Government for a cash payment of SAR 3,750 million which are being classified as treasury 
shares. These shares are for use by the Company for its employee share plans. On February 13, 2022, the Government announced 
the transfer of 4% of the Company’s total share capital to the Public Investment Fund (PIF). Therefore, the current ownership of 
the Government in the Company is 94.19%.

In May 2022, the Extraordinary General Assembly approved the granting and distribution of one bonus share for every ten shares 
held by the shareholders. This resulted in an increase of issued ordinary shares from 200 billion to 220 billion and the share 
capital of the Company from SAR 60.0 billion to SAR 75.0 billion.

Material agreements
Aramco has entered into a number of agreements for the purposes of its business. The following is a summary of those 
agreements that Aramco considers material to its business. Aramco believes that all such agreements, in addition to the key 
provisions thereunder, have been included in this section and that there are no other agreements that are material in the context 
of its business. These summaries do not purport to describe all the applicable terms and conditions of such agreements and are 
qualified in their entirety by the respective agreements.

The Concession
Background
The Arabian American Oil Company Concession Agreement was ratified on 4/2/1352H (corresponding to May 29, 1933) and 
granted Arabian American Oil Company certain exclusive rights, including the right to explore, drill, recover and treat crude oil 
and other hydrocarbons located within certain areas of the Kingdom (which were revised and grew over time), with limited 
territorial exceptions. Pursuant to Royal Decree No. M/8 dated 4/4/1409H (corresponding to November 13, 1988) approving 
Aramco’s original articles, Aramco enjoyed all the privileges and rights provided under the Arabian American Oil Company 
Concession Agreement, and all subsequent supplementary documents, agreements, Governmental orders and decisions in 
connection therewith (collectively, the “Original Concession”). Effective 6/4/1439H (corresponding to December 24, 2017), and  
in accordance with the Hydrocarbons Law, the Government, represented by the Minister of MEIM (predecessor to the Minister of 
Energy), and Aramco entered into the revised Concession Agreement (the “Concession”), which was adopted under Royal Decree 
No. (M/38) dated 6/4/1439H (corresponding to December 24, 2017) and replaced and superseded in its entirety the Original 
Concession on such date (the “Concession Effective Date”). Further, on 20/1/1441H (corresponding to September 19, 2019), and  
in accordance with the Hydrocarbons Law, the Government, represented by the Minister of Energy, and Aramco entered into  
an amendment to the Concession, with effect from January 1, 2020) (the “Concession Amendment”).

Grant of rights
The Government grants Aramco the following rights to be exercised at Aramco’s own risk during the term of the Concession:
• The exclusive right to explore, prospect, drill, appraise, develop, extract, recover and produce hydrocarbons in the Concession Area;
• The non-exclusive right to manufacture, refine, treat, market, sell, transport and export hydrocarbons and their derivatives 

extracted, recovered, developed, produced, treated, refined, consumed, transported, manufactured, marketed, sold, exported 
or dealt with in any other way by Aramco or on its behalf pursuant to the rights granted to Aramco in the Concession;

• The exclusive right to market and distribute hydrocarbons, petroleum products and LPG in the Kingdom, with Aramco’s 
commitment to meeting all the domestic market’s needs for such products based on the consumption requirements thereof 
through domestic production or imports in accordance with laws issued by the Government;

• The right to build, own and operate relevant facilities and assets as may be necessary or desirable to perform Aramco’s 
operations within the Reserved Areas;

• Certain rights related to lands, such as use of land, easements, water rights, right-of-way and other suitable rights of any part 
of the Concession Areas, that are outside the Reserved Area, designated in connection with Aramco’s operations and 
transportation of products and free access to and use of any part of the Reserved Area;

• The right to purchase, lease, import or otherwise obtain all materials, equipment and any other supplies necessary for Aramco’s 
operations;

• The right to conduct such other activity related to the foregoing subject to the provisions of the Concession and applicable law; 
and

• The right to receive Government assistance in securing the rights granted in the Concession, obtaining permits, licenses and other 
special approvals and obtaining access, rights of way and water rights from third parties necessary for Aramco’s operations.

Additional legal information



Under the Concession, Aramco is required to obtain the necessary licenses, permits and approvals that may be required pursuant 
to the Hydrocarbons Law, the Law of Gas Supplies and Pricing (which is replaced by the Energy Supplies Law) and the regulations 
issued pursuant to these laws. The Concession and Aramco’s rights referred to under the Concession represent the licenses, 
permits, and approvals that are necessary or required for Aramco to conduct business in the Kingdom with respect to Aramco 
Operations and any related activities in accordance with the agreement. All hydrocarbons in the Kingdom are owned by the 
Kingdom, and upon extraction or recovery of such hydrocarbons by Aramco, title to such hydrocarbons shall automatically pass 
to Aramco at the ownership transfer point. Aramco has no rights to any natural resources existing in the Concession Area other 
than hydrocarbons except as otherwise provided in the Concession.

The rights granted to Aramco under the Concession are subject to the Hydrocarbons Law and other applicable law, including 
production decisions issued by the Government pursuant to its sovereign authority. Aramco may not sell to any entity any 
hydrocarbons or derivatives therefrom in violation of decisions the Government considers necessary for the protection of 
supreme security interests for the Kingdom in times of war or other emergency in international relations.

Term
The Concession will remain effective for 40 years from the Concession Effective Date, unless terminated earlier in accordance 
with its terms.

The Government will issue a decision to extend the Concession for a period of 20 years on the 30th anniversary of the Concession 
Effective Date, provided Aramco has fulfilled the following conditions: (a) Aramco has exerted reasonable efforts to maximize 
reserves and their recovery in the Concession Area, taking into consideration production decisions and hydrocarbons market 
conditions; (b) Aramco has conducted its operations in a manner that (i) is economically efficient, (ii) enhances the productivity 
of the reservoirs in the long-term in the Concession Area and (iii) supports good management of hydrocarbons, in all cases, 
according to the Hydrocarbons Law; and (c) Aramco generally has conducted its activities and operations in the Kingdom in 
an economically efficient manner thereby enhancing the efficiency of the Kingdom’s economy.

If the Concession is extended as described in the previous paragraph, the Concession may be amended and extended for an 
additional 40 years following the 60th anniversary of the Concession Effective Date, if Aramco provides the Government with 
notice confirming its intent to extend the Concession, at any time from the beginning of the 50th anniversary until the end of 
the 53rd anniversary of the Concession Effective Date, provided that the parties undertake exclusive negotiations for a two-year 
period (which may be extended or reduced by the parties), commencing at the end of the 53rd anniversary of the Concession 
Effective Date, to reach an agreement on the terms and conditions of such amendment and extension. If the Government and 
Aramco are unable to reach agreement on the amendment and extension during such exclusive negotiation period, and the 
Government elects to negotiate with any third party to enter into an agreement with respect to any hydrocarbon activities or 
operations in the Concession Area, Aramco will have a priority right to enter into an agreement with the Government under  
the same terms and conditions as agreed between the Government and such third party, provided that Aramco notifies the 
Government of its desire to exercise the priority right within 120 days of its receipt of a written notice from the Government that 
includes the entire draft agreement with such third party with respect to such hydrocarbon activities and operations in the 
Concession Area.

Royalty and taxes
Commencing January 1, 2017, royalties payable to the Government with respect to the Company’s operations were calculated 
as follows:
• With respect to the Company’s production of crude oil and condensates, including those used by the Company in its operations, 

royalties were calculated based on a progressive scheme applied to crude oil and condensate production value. Production was 
valued based on the Company’s official selling prices. An effective royalty rate was applied to production value and was based 
each month on the average daily price quotes for Brent crude on the Intercontinental Exchange (or any successor exchange) for 
each day during such period. The effective royalty rate was determined based on a baseline rate of 20% applied to the value  
of production at prices up to $70 per barrel, a marginal rate of 40% applied to the value of production at prices above $70 per 
barrel up to $100 per barrel and a marginal rate of 50% applied to the value of production at prices above $100 per barrel.

• With respect to the Company’s production of natural gas, ethane and NGL, excluding those volumes used by the Company for 
upstream operations and related operations (including transportation, pipelines and storage and export facilities, fractionation 
plants, gas and NGL plants), royalties are calculated based on a flat royalty rate of 12.5% applied to a factor established by the 
Ministry of Energy. As at December 31, 2022, the factor to which this royalty is applied is $0.035 per mmBTU for NGL (propane, 
butane and natural gasoline) and $0.00 per mmBTU for natural gas (methane) and ethane. The Minister of Energy may amend 
the price on which such values are based, taking into account the price that achieves the targeted internal rate of return set by 
the Minister of Energy in coordination with the Company.

Commencing January 1, 2020, the Concession Amendment amended the royalties payable to the Government with respect to the 
Company’s production of crude oil and condensates, including those used by the Company in its operations, so that the effective 
royalty rate is determined based on a baseline rate of 15% applied to the value of production at prices up to $70 per barrel, 
a marginal rate of 45% applied to the value of production at prices above $70 per barrel up to $100 per barrel and a marginal 
rate of 80% applied to the value of production at prices above $100 per barrel.

In order to increase gas production to meet the needs of the Kingdom, the Government may choose not to collect royalties 
on natural gas, NGL (including ethane) and condensates for a period specified by the Government with respect to any field as 
required by the economics of such field’s development. Pursuant to the Ministry of Energy’s authority under the Concession, 
on February 25, 2018, the Ministry of Energy decided not to collect royalties from the Company on condensate production for 
a grace period of five years beginning on January 1, 2018. On September 17, 2019, the Ministry of Energy issued Ministerial 
Resolution No. 1/422/1441, dated 18/1/1441H (corresponding to September 17, 2019), which extends the period for which the 
Company will not be obligated to pay royalties on condensate production after the current five-year period for an additional 
10-year period, which may be further extended for subsequent 10-year periods, unless the Government determines the 
economics impacting gas field development do not warrant such an extension.

The Government has the option to take all or part of the royalty in-kind from the produced hydrocarbons.

Acquisition of 70% equity interest in SABIC
On June 16, 2020, Aramco acquired the PIF’s 70% equity interest in SABIC for total consideration of $69.1 billion. SABIC 
operates in over 50 countries and produces a range of chemicals. Aramco believes that purchasing this majority interest in 
SABIC advances its strategy to increase the proportion of petrochemicals production in its downstream portfolio and supports 
Aramco’s downstream growth ambitions. In addition, Aramco believes that the acquisition facilitates the application of SABIC’s 
expertise in the chemicals industry to Aramco’s existing and future integrated downstream facilities.

The March 27, 2019, purchase agreement provided that the purchase price for the acquisition would be paid on the closing date 
in the form of a cash payment equal to 50% of the purchase price (to be adjusted for certain expenses) and a seller loan in an 
amount equal to 50% of the purchase price with the last payment due on or before December 31, 2021. On October 6, 2019, 
Aramco and the PIF agreed to amend the payment terms to provide that, on the closing date, 36% of the purchase price (to be 
adjusted for certain expenses) would be paid in cash and 64% would be paid in the form of a seller loan with the last payment 
due on or before September 30, 2025.

On June 16, 2020, Aramco and the PIF agreed to further amend the payment terms to provide that the entire purchase price 
would be paid over several installments pursuant to a seller loan provided by the PIF (deferred consideration).

On January 24, 2022, the Company, in agreement with PIF, made a partial prepayment of $7.6 billion, which reduced the 
principal amounts of two promissory notes payable on or before April 7, 2024 and April 7, 2026, by $7.0 billion and $1.0 billion, 
respectively. In addition, on June 30, 2022, the Company made a second partial prepayment of $10.2 billion, which reduced the 
principal amount of a promissory note payable on or before April 7, 2025 by $2.5 billion and further reduced the principal 
amount of the promissory note payable on or before April 7, 2026 by $9.5 billion.

After taking these payments into account, as at December 31, 2022, future loan payments, which are represented by promissory 
notes, are payable between April 7, 2023 and April 7, 2028 (the last payment), as follows:
1. On or before April 7, 2023, an amount equal to $10.5 billion plus a loan charge of $500 million;
2. On or before April 7, 2024, an amount equal to $3.5 billion plus a loan charge of $600 million;
3. On or before April 7, 2025, an amount equal to $8.0 billion plus a loan charge of $800 million;
4. On or before April 7, 2026, an amount equal to $6.6 billion plus a loan charge of $1.5 billion;
5. On or before April 7, 2027, a loan charge of $1.0 billion; and
6. On or before April 7, 2028, a loan charge of $1.0 billion.

On March 7, 2023, the Company agreed with PIF to make a third partial prepayment of $15.7 billion on or before March 15, 2023. 
This partial prepayment will fully reduce the outstanding principal amount of $3.5 billion of the promissory note payable on or 
before April 7, 2024, and will partially reduce the outstanding principal amounts of the promissory notes payable on or before 
April 7, 2025, and April 7, 2026, by $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. The outstanding amounts of the loan charge 
promissory notes payable between 2024 and 2028, aggregating to $4.9 billion, will also be fully reduced. After taking this 
prepayment into account, the future loan payment will be as follows:

1. On or before April 7, 2023 an amount equal to $10.5 billion plus a loan charge of $500 million;
2. On or before April 7, 2025 an amount equal to $4.2 billion;
3. On or before April 7, 2026 an amount equal to $0.9 billion.

Subject to the exceptions set forth below, the promissory notes are freely transferable and assignable and may be pledged by  
the PIF. However, if the PIF receives any offer or commitment of financing which would include a transfer of any promissory note, 
Aramco may within 30 days of receiving notice of the offer or commitment, notify the PIF in writing of its intent to purchase  
all or a portion of the promissory notes to be transferred on the same terms. To the extent Aramco does not elect to purchase  
the promissory notes to be transferred, the PIF may transfer such promissory note during the subsequent 120-day period. 
Furthermore, the PIF may not transfer, assign or pledge at any time promissory notes with aggregate initial principal outstanding 
balances of (i) $3.5 billion and a payment date of April 7, 2026, (ii) $250 million and a payment date of April 7, 2027, and (iii)  
$250 million and a payment date of April 7, 2028. Aramco currently intends to repay the promissory notes in a phased manner 
through cash from operations, external debt financing or a combination thereof.

As part of the June 16, 2020, amendment to the purchase agreement, Aramco agreed to enter into foreign exchange 
transactions with banking institutions mutually agreed between Aramco and the PIF to exchange U.S. dollars for Saudi Riyals. 
The aggregate amount of these foreign exchange transactions is (i) up to $2.0 billion between June 16, and August 2, 2020, 
(ii) up to $3.0 billion in 2021 and (iii) up to $2.0 billion in 2022.

Intellectual property
Aramco assesses, develops and incorporates new technology in a manner tailored to Aramco’s operations to protect business 
interests, enhance its operational efficiency, increase profitability and reduce the environmental impact of its operations. 
The scale of Aramco’s hydrocarbon reserves and operational capabilities enable it to realize significant benefits and value 
from otherwise marginal technological benefits.

Aramco focuses its technology initiatives in two primary areas: upstream and downstream. In addition, Aramco is working 
on several focused initiatives, including reductions in the environmental impact of operations and advancements in digital 
technologies. Upstream technology development is directed primarily to improving methods for discovering new hydrocarbon 
reserves, improving oil recoveries, increasing productivity, discovering novel catalysts and reducing lifting costs. Downstream 
technology development is dedicated primarily to maximizing value across the hydrocarbon chain and finding new and improved 
methods of producing products. Aramco’s environmental impact initiatives include efforts aimed at producing lower carbon 
intensity crude oil, advancing efficient transport and driving high-impact lower carbon intensity solutions. Aramco’s digital 
technologies include innovations that leverage machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics.

Aramco intellectual property portfolio includes patents, trademarks and copyrights, of which no individual asset is considered 
material to the Company, nor does the business of the Company depend on any such asset.

Litigation
From time to time, Aramco is subject to various claims, lawsuits, regulatory investigations and other legal matters arising in the 
ordinary course of business, including contractual claims relating to construction projects and agreements to render services 
undertaken by Aramco, claims for title to land and environmental claims. Additionally, Aramco in the past has been subject 
to antitrust claims.

Furthermore, exports of crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals by Aramco or its affiliates to foreign countries may 
be affected by litigation, regulatory actions, investigations, disputes or agreements that lead to the imposition of import trade 
measures, including anti-dumping and countervailing duties, safeguard measures, import licensing and customs requirements, 
and new or increased tariffs, quotas or embargoes. The possibility and effect of any such measures will depend on the domestic 
laws in the relevant country to which the applicable products are being exported and applicable international trade agreements. 
Foreign countries may take such measures for political or other reasons, including reasons unrelated to Aramco actions 
or operations.

The outcome of litigation and other legal matters, including government investigations or other trade actions, is inherently 
uncertain. Aramco believes it has valid defenses to the legal matters currently pending against it as a party. Certain trade actions 
that do not involve Aramco as a party may instead involve its products or industry, other products or industries impacting its 
operations, or the countries in which it operates. Trade actions may be taken without prior notice, or with retroactive effect. 
Actual outcomes of these legal, regulatory and other proceedings may materially differ from current estimates. To date, 
none of these types of litigation or trade matters have had a material impact on Aramco’s operations or financial position. 
Aramco believes that it is not presently a party to any legal, regulatory or other proceedings that, if determined adversely to it, 
could reasonably be expected, individually or taken together, to have a material adverse effect on Aramco’s business, financial 
position or results of operations.

from NGL.

Production costs
The sum of operating costs and 
depreciation, reflecting both the 
erosion of asset value over time on 
an accounting basis and the cost 
of operating the business.

Proved reserves
Those quantities of liquids and gas,

engineering data, can be estimated with 
reasonable certainty to be economically 
producible — from a given date forward, 
from known reservoirs, and under 
existing economic conditions, operating 
methods and government regulations 
— prior to the time at which contracts 
providing the right to operate expire, 
unless evidence indicates that renewal  
is reasonably certain, regardless of 
whether deterministic or probabilistic 
methods are used for the estimation. 
The project to extract the hydrocarbons 
must have commenced or the operator 
must be reasonably certain that it will 
commence the project within a 
reasonable time.

Reliability

caused by factors that are under the 
Company’s control (e.g. terminal, 
pipeline, stabilization, or production) 
negatively affect the score, whereas 
delays caused by conditions that are 
beyond the Company’s control, such 
as adverse weather, are not considered. 
A score of less than 100 percent 
indicates there were issues that 
negatively impacted reliability.

Reserves life

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Saudi Arabian 
Oil Company 
 
Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements   
 
Our opinion 
  
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated 
financial position of Saudi Arabian Oil Company (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) 
as at December 31, 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the 
year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, that are endorsed in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and other standards and pronouncements issued by the Saudi Organization for 
Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). 
  
What we have audited 

The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise: 
 
● the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022; 
● the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022; 
● the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2022; 
● the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended December 31, 2022; 
● the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022; and 
● the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include significant accounting policies and other 

explanatory information.  
 
Basis for opinion  
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.  
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. 
 
Independence 

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants (including International Independence Standards), endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
(the “Code”), that is relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code’s requirements.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Saudi Arabian 
Oil Company (continued) 
 
Our audit approach 
 
Overview  
 

 ● We determined overall Group materiality taking into account the profit-
oriented nature of the Group.  

● Based on income before income taxes and zakat of Saudi Riyals (“SAR”) 
1,153 billion, we determined our overall Group materiality at SAR 37.5 
billion. 

● Our quantitative threshold for reporting misstatements to those charged 
with governance was set at SAR 2.8 billion. 

 Based on their size, complexity and risk: 
● We selected the Company’s standalone operations and five other 

components located in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United States of 
America, the Republic of Korea and Malaysia for full-scope audits; and 

● We also determined a number of other components to be in scope for the 
Group audit, in respect of which appropriate audit procedures were 
performed. 

 Our key audit matters comprise the following: 
● Assessment of recoverability of the goodwill and brand recognised as part 

of the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (“SABIC”) acquisition; and 
● Accounting for the gas pipelines transaction.  

 
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in 
the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we considered where the Board of Directors made 
subjective judgments; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, 
consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to 
fraud. 
 
Materiality 

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain 
reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the 
consolidated financial statements.  
 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including 
the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and 
in aggregate, on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Saudi Arabian 
Oil Company (continued) 
 

Overall Group 
materiality 

SAR 37.5 billion (2021: SAR 28.1 billion). 

How we determined it Based on income before income taxes and zakat. 

Rationale for the 
materiality benchmark 
applied 

Income before income taxes and zakat is an important benchmark for the 
Group’s stakeholders and is a generally accepted benchmark for profit-
oriented groups. 

 
We agreed with those charged with governance that we would report to them misstatements identified during 
our audit above SAR 2.8 billion. 
 
How we tailored our Group audit scope  

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the 
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
 
The Group’s operations are conducted through many components in different parts of the world. In 
establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be 
performed by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms or 
other audit firms operating under our instructions. Where the work was performed by component auditors, 
we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to be able 
to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on 
the Group’s consolidated financial statements as a whole.  
 
The most significant component within the Group is the Company itself and most of the audit effort was spent 
by the Group engagement team based in Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We identified five additional 
components where a full-scope audit on the respective components’ financial information was performed 
under our instructions. Members of the Group engagement team performed the full-scope audit of the 
component located in Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Component teams in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia, the United States of America, the Republic of Korea and Malaysia performed full-scope audits of the 
components at those locations based on our instructions. We also instructed certain other component teams 
to perform an audit or specified procedures on material consolidated financial statement line items as part 
of our overall Group audit scoping strategy. The selection of these components was based on qualitative and 
quantitative considerations, including whether the component accounted for a significant proportion of 
individual consolidated financial statement line items.  
 
The Group engagement team’s involvement in the audit work performed by component teams considered the 
relative significance and complexity of the individual component. This included allocating materiality to the 
different components, sending formal instructions, obtaining regular updates on progress and results of 
procedures as well as reviewing deliverables and the relevant underlying working papers.  

 
Key audit matters  

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter       How our audit addressed the key audit matter 

Assessment of recoverability of the goodwill 
and brand recognised as part of the SABIC 
acquisition   

International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’, that is endorsed in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, requires goodwill and 
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives to 
be tested annually for impairment, irrespective of 
whether there is any indication of impairment. 
 

Management performed an assessment of 
recoverability of the goodwill and brand 
(determined to have an indefinite useful life) 
recognised as part of the SABIC acquisition. The 
carrying amounts of these assets were SAR 99.1 
billion and SAR 18.1 billion, respectively, at 
December 31, 2022. 
 

Goodwill has been allocated to the Downstream 
operating segment. Therefore, the goodwill 
impairment test was performed at the Downstream 
operating segment level. The brand test was 
performed based on an aggregation of the relevant 
cash-generating units. 
 

The recoverable amounts were determined based on 
value-in-use calculations derived using discounted 
cash flow models. The models were based on the 
most recent financial plans and included 10-year 
projection periods with terminal values assumed 
thereafter.  
The exercise performed by management supported 
the goodwill and brand carrying values and did not 
identify the need for any impairment charges to be 
recognised.  
We considered this to be a key audit matter given the 
significant judgment and estimates involved in 
determining recoverable amounts and the 
uncertainty inherent in the underlying forecasts and 
assumptions. The key inputs and assumptions in 
determining the recoverable amounts included the:  
● Cash flows during the 10-year periods including 

commodity prices and margins; 
● Terminal values; and  
● Pre-tax discount rates. 
 

Refer to Note 2(f), Note 2(i) and Note 6 to the 
consolidated financial statements for further 
information. 

 
 
 

 
Our procedures included the following: 

● We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s 
allocation of goodwill to the Downstream operating 
segment and brand to the aggregation of the 
relevant cash-generating units, based on the 
requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, that 
is endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 

● We assessed the completeness of the carrying values 
of the assets and liabilities considered as part of the 
impairment tests for the goodwill and brand in light 
of the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of 
Assets’, that is endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia. 

● With input from internal valuation experts, where 
considered necessary, we performed the following 
procedures on management’s value-in-use 
calculations, as deemed appropriate: 

- Considered the consistency of certain 
unobservable inputs underlying the 10-year cash 
flows such as expected product volumes and 
future costs with approved financial plans;  

- Compared a sample of forecast commodity prices 
and margins underlying the 10-year cash flows to 
market data points; 

- Evaluated the reasonableness of approved 
financial plans by comparison to historical results;  

- Assessed the reasonableness of the approach and 
inputs used to determine the terminal values by 
benchmarking to observable market practice and 
information;  

- Evaluated the reasonableness of the pre-tax 
discount rates used by cross-checking the 
underlying assumptions against observable 
market data;  

- Tested the mathematical accuracy and logical 
integrity of the models; and 

- Tested management’s sensitivity analyses that 
considered the impact of changes in assumptions 
on the outcome of the impairment assessments.  

● We considered the reasonableness of the movement 
in the recoverable amounts at December 31, 2022 
compared to the prior year in light of changes in the 
underlying inputs and assumptions. 

● We considered the appropriateness of the related 
accounting policies and disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements.

Key audit matter       How our audit addressed the key audit matter 

Assessment of recoverability of the goodwill 
and brand recognised as part of the SABIC 
acquisition   

International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’, that is endorsed in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, requires goodwill and 
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives to 
be tested annually for impairment, irrespective of 
whether there is any indication of impairment. 
 

Management performed an assessment of 
recoverability of the goodwill and brand 
(determined to have an indefinite useful life) 
recognised as part of the SABIC acquisition. The 
carrying amounts of these assets were SAR 99.1 
billion and SAR 18.1 billion, respectively, at 
December 31, 2022. 
 

Goodwill has been allocated to the Downstream 
operating segment. Therefore, the goodwill 
impairment test was performed at the Downstream 
operating segment level. The brand test was 
performed based on an aggregation of the relevant 
cash-generating units. 
 

The recoverable amounts were determined based on 
value-in-use calculations derived using discounted 
cash flow models. The models were based on the 
most recent financial plans and included 10-year 
projection periods with terminal values assumed 
thereafter.  
The exercise performed by management supported 
the goodwill and brand carrying values and did not 
identify the need for any impairment charges to be 
recognised.  
We considered this to be a key audit matter given the 
significant judgment and estimates involved in 
determining recoverable amounts and the 
uncertainty inherent in the underlying forecasts and 
assumptions. The key inputs and assumptions in 
determining the recoverable amounts included the:  
● Cash flows during the 10-year periods including 

commodity prices and margins; 
● Terminal values; and  
● Pre-tax discount rates. 
 

Refer to Note 2(f), Note 2(i) and Note 6 to the 
consolidated financial statements for further 
information. 

 
 
 

 
Our procedures included the following: 

● We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s 
allocation of goodwill to the Downstream operating 
segment and brand to the aggregation of the 
relevant cash-generating units, based on the 
requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, that 
is endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 

● We assessed the completeness of the carrying values 
of the assets and liabilities considered as part of the 
impairment tests for the goodwill and brand in light 
of the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of 
Assets’, that is endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia. 

● With input from internal valuation experts, where 
considered necessary, we performed the following 
procedures on management’s value-in-use 
calculations, as deemed appropriate: 

- Considered the consistency of certain 
unobservable inputs underlying the 10-year cash 
flows such as expected product volumes and 
future costs with approved financial plans;  

- Compared a sample of forecast commodity prices

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Saudi Arabian 
Oil Company (continued) 
 
Key audit matter       How our audit addressed the key audit 

matter 

Accounting for the gas pipelines transaction 
 
The Company sold a 49% equity interest in Aramco 
Gas Pipelines Company (“AGPC”) in February 2022 
to GreenSaif Pipelines Bidco S.à r.l. (formerly, GEPIF 
III Finance III Lux S.à r.l.) (“GreenSaif”) for upfront 
sale proceeds of SAR 58.1 billion. 
As part of the arrangement, immediately prior to the 
sale, the Company leased usage rights to its gas 
pipelines network to AGPC for a 20-year period. 
Simultaneously, AGPC granted the Company the 
exclusive right to use, operate and maintain the 
pipelines during this period in exchange for a tariff. 
The Company retained title to, and operational 
control of, the pipelines. 
Under the agreed terms and conditions, GreenSaif is 
entitled to receive dividend distributions from AGPC 
based on its share of available cash, when the 
Company pays discretionary dividends to its 
ordinary shareholders. 

Given the discretionary nature of GreenSaif’s 
entitlement to dividends, the upfront sale proceeds 
have been recognized as a non-controlling interest in 
the consolidated financial statements. 
We considered this to be a key audit matter given the 
nature and materiality of the transaction as well as 
the judgment involved in determining the 
classification of AGPC as a subsidiary and the 
accounting treatment of the sale proceeds as a non-
controlling interest. 
Refer to Note 2(e) and Note 34(b) to the consolidated 
financial statements for further information. 

 
 
Our procedures included the following: 
● We held discussions with management to 

understand the legal structure of the arrangement 
and the nature of transactions on closing in 
February 2022 and during the 20-year period. 

● We read the relevant agreements and considered 
the consistency of the underlying terms and 
conditions with the accounting treatments. 

● With input from internal accounting specialists, 
we considered appropriateness of the accounting 
treatment of:  
- AGPC as a subsidiary; and 
- Sale proceeds as a non-controlling interest, 

keeping in view the potential alternative 
treatment. 

● With input from internal valuation experts, where 
considered necessary, we assessed the 
reasonableness of the carrying value determined 
by management of AGPC’s net assets immediately 
prior to the sale. 

● We considered the appropriateness of the related 
accounting policies and disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements.

Other information  
 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Annual 
Report (but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon). 
 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
 
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.  
 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.  
 
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and those charged with governance for the 
consolidated financial statements 
 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, that are endorsed in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA, and the applicable 
requirements of the Regulations for Companies and the Company’s Bylaws, and for such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the 
Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process. 
 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Saudi Arabian 
Oil Company (continued) 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the 
audit. We also: 
 
● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether 

due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. 

● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. 

● Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a 
going concern. 

● Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 

● Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We 
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion. 

 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.  
 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to 
eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Saudi Arabian 
Oil Company (continued) 
 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Consolidated statement of cash flows



1. General information
The Saudi Arabian Oil Company (the “Company”), with headquarters located in Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the 
“Kingdom”), is engaged in prospecting, exploring, drilling and extracting hydrocarbon substances (“Upstream”) and processing, 
manufacturing, refining and marketing these hydrocarbon substances (“Downstream”). The Company was formed on November 
13, 1988, by Royal Decree No. M/8; however, its history dates back to May 29, 1933, when the Saudi Arabian Government (the 
“Government”) granted a concession to the Company’s predecessor for the right to, among other things, explore the Kingdom 
for hydrocarbons.

On December 20, 2017, Royal Decree No. M/37 dated 2/4/1439H was issued approving the Hydrocarbons Law, which applies to 
the Kingdom’s hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon operations. Under the Hydrocarbons Law, all hydrocarbon deposits, hydrocarbons 
and hydrocarbon resources are the property of the Kingdom until ownership is transferred at the well head or when extracted. 
Further, the Hydrocarbons Law codifies the Government’s sole authority to set the maximum amount of hydrocarbons 
production by the Company and the maximum sustainable capacity that the Company must maintain.

All natural resources within the Kingdom, including hydrocarbons, are owned by the Kingdom. Through a concession in 1933, 
the Government granted the Company the exclusive right to explore, develop and produce the Kingdom’s hydrocarbon 
resources, except in certain areas. As of December 24, 2017, the Company’s original concession agreement was replaced and 
superseded by an amended concession agreement (the “Concession Agreement”) which provides the Company the exclusive 
right to explore, drill, prospect, appraise, develop, extract, recover, and produce hydrocarbons in the concession area. The 
Company is also provided the exclusive right to market and distribute hydrocarbons, petroleum products and liquid petroleum 
gas (“LPG”) in the Kingdom along with the non-exclusive right to manufacture, refine, and treat production and to market, sell, 
transport and export such production.

The initial term of the Concession Agreement is for 40 years, which shall be extended by the Government for 20 years unless the 
Company does not satisfy certain conditions commensurate with its then current operating practices. In addition, the Concession 
Agreement may be amended and extended for an additional 40 years beyond the original 60-year period, subject to the 
Company and the Government agreeing on the terms of such extension.

Effective January 1, 2018, Council of Minister’s Resolution No. 180, dated 1/4/1439H (December 19, 2017) converted the Company 
to a Saudi Joint Stock Company with new Bylaws. The Company’s 1988 Articles were cancelled as of January 1, 2018, pursuant to 
Royal Decree No. M/36, dated 2/4/1439H (December 20, 2017). The Company’s Commercial Registration Number is 2052101150. 
The Company’s share capital was set at Saudi Riyal (“SAR”) 60,000, divided into 200 billion fully paid ordinary shares with equal 
voting rights without par value. On May 12, 2022, after obtaining necessary approvals from the competent authorities in relation 
to the issuance of bonus shares, the Extraordinary General Assembly (“EGA”) approved the increase in the Company’s share 
capital by SAR 15,000 and the commensurate increase in the number of the Company’s issued ordinary shares by 20 billion 
without par value. The Company’s share capital after the increase is SAR 75,000, divided into 220 billion fully paid ordinary shares 
with equal voting rights without par value (Note 36).

On December 11, 2019, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and its ordinary shares were listed on the Saudi 
Exchange. In connection with the IPO, the Government, being the sole owner of the Company’s shares at such time, sold an 
aggregate of 3.45 billion ordinary shares, or 1.73% of the Company’s share capital. In addition, concurrent with the IPO, the 
Company acquired 117.2 million of its ordinary shares from the Government for a cash payment of SAR 3,750, and classified  
them as treasury shares (Note 16). These shares are being used by the Company for its employee share plans (Note 17).

On February 13, 2022, the Government transferred 8 billion ordinary shares, or 4% of the Company’s share capital, to the Public 
Investment Fund (“PIF”), the sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom. Following the transfer, the Government remains the 
Company’s largest shareholder, retaining a 94.19% direct shareholding.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together “Saudi Aramco”) were approved by the 
Board of Directors on March 10, 2023.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.  
The consolidated financial statements provide comparative information in respect of the previous period.

(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”), that are endorsed in the Kingdom, and other standards and pronouncements issued by the Saudi Organization for 
Chartered and Professional Accountants (“SOCPA”). The consolidated financial statements are also in compliance with IFRS as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Amounts and balances relating to Shari’a compliant financial 
instruments of the Company, its subsidiaries and investments are disclosed separately. All other relevant amounts and balances 
relate to conventional financial instruments.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain items measured 
at fair value, which are primarily investments in securities, derivatives and certain trade receivables. The accounting policies that 
follow have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(b) Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to exercise judgment in 
applying Saudi Aramco’s accounting policies and in the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions concerning 
the future. Management has made various judgments that may significantly impact the valuation and presentation of assets and 
liabilities. In addition, management also applies judgment when undertaking the estimation procedures necessary to calculate 
assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Accounting estimates, by definition, may not equal the related actual results and are 
subject to change based on experience and new information. The areas requiring the most significant judgments, estimates  
and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are: accounting for interests in subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements and associates, fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition, recoverability of asset carrying 
amounts, determining the lease term, taxation, provisions, post-retirement obligations and determination of functional currency 
and are set out in the individual accounting policies below.

Net zero ambition and the energy transition 
Saudi Aramco’s ambition is to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across its wholly-owned 
operated assets. Low lifting costs and low-carbon production intensity, compared to its peers, facilitates Saudi Aramco to 
continuously supply hydrocarbon products through the energy transition for the foreseeable future. Saudi Aramco is targeting 
emissions reductions to be achieved by improving energy efficiency and management of flaring and methane emissions; 
investing in renewable energy projects and certificates; carbon capture and storage; and developing an offsetting program that 
includes planting mangroves and purchasing carbon offsets through voluntary markets. 

Saudi Aramco performed a review of the impact of climate change on its financial statements, including an assessment of risks 
due to climate change on material financial statement line items, significant judgments, and material estimation uncertainties. 
Estimates, such as the pace of energy transition and demand forecasts, and their impact on commodity prices, margins, and 
growth rates, include assumptions and inherent uncertainties that will be subject to change as market factors, policy and 
regulation evolve. The outcome of our review confirmed that the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the  
2022 consolidated financial statements are consistent with Saudi Aramco’s long-term strategy and the profile of its operations. 
Saudi Aramco will continue to update its financial plans, estimates, and assumptions concerning the economic environment  
and the pace of the energy transition.

(c) New or amended standards
(i) Saudi Aramco adopted the following IASB pronouncement, as endorsed in the Kingdom, effective for annual periods 

beginning on or after January 1, 2022:

Amendment to IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment
In May 2020, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment, which prohibits the deduction from the 
cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while the entity is preparing the asset 
for its intended use. Instead, the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, are recognized in 
profit or loss. There is no material impact on Saudi Aramco’s consolidated financial statements from adopting this amendment  
to IAS 16.

(ii) There are no standards, amendments or interpretations that are not yet effective that are expected to have a material impact 
in the current or future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.

(d) Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) reform
IBOR reform represents the reform and replacement of interest rate benchmarks, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate 
(“LIBOR”) by global regulators. On March 5, 2021, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority announced the future cessation and loss 
of representativeness of the LIBOR benchmarks. Saudi Aramco has a number of contracts, primarily referenced to U.S. dollar 
(“USD”) LIBOR, of which most applicable tenors will cease to be published on June 30, 2023.

In this regard, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 4, Insurance 
Contracts, IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 16, Leases, as part of Phase 2 of a 
two-phase project for IBOR reform, which address issues that arise from the implementation of the reform. These amendments, 
issued on August 27, 2020, and effective January 1, 2021, include: (1) providing practical expedients in relation to accounting for 
instruments to which the amortized cost measurement applies by updating the effective interest rate to account for a change in 
the basis for determining the contractual cash flows without adjusting the carrying amount; (2) additional temporary exceptions 
from applying specific hedge accounting requirements, including permitted changes to hedge designation without the hedging 
relationship being discontinued when Phase 1 reliefs cease; and (3) additional disclosures related to IBOR reform, including 
managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates, its progress and the risks arising from the transition, quantitative 
information about financial instruments that have yet to transition to new benchmarks and changes in the entity’s risk 
management strategy where this arises.

Saudi Aramco has established an IBOR Transition Project, the scope of which includes analyzing the exposure to IBOR 
benchmarks, evaluating the impact of the transition and providing support and guidance to all impacted internal stakeholders. 
As per the transition plan, all contracts and agreements related to the below mentioned financial instruments will be 
renegotiated with counterparties to reflect the alternative benchmark.

(e) Principles of consolidation, acquisition and equity accounting
(i) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries 
are entities over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Company obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the  
date that such control ceases.

Intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealized profits and losses arising from intragroup transactions, have been 
eliminated. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align the accounting policies 
with those used by the Company.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations, including those acquisitions of businesses 
under common control that have commercial substance. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. The consideration 
transferred to acquire a subsidiary comprises the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred to the former owners of 
the acquired business, equity interests issued by Saudi Aramco, the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, and the fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the date the 
assets and liabilities are exchanged, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests. The excess of the consideration 
transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired identifiable 
net assets is recorded as goodwill. Where settlement of any part of the cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in  
the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental 
borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained under comparable terms and conditions.  
Any goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, 
expected to benefit from the business combination’s synergies. Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries  
that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to Saudi Aramco.

Saudi Aramco recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair 
value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Non-controlling 
interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of income, the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, and the consolidated balance sheet, 
respectively.

Saudi Aramco treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions between 
equity owners of the group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the 
controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount  
of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognized in equity.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the previously held equity interest is 
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date with any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement recognized in net 
income or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.

(ii) Joint arrangements
Under IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements, an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control is a joint arrangement. Joint 
control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either 
joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather 
than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. Saudi Aramco has interests in both joint operations and joint ventures.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(e) Principles of consolidation, acquisition and equity accounting continued
1) Joint operations
Joint operations arise where the investors have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of a joint arrangement.  
In relation to its interests in joint operations, Saudi Aramco recognizes its:
• Assets, including its share of any assets held jointly;
• Liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly;
• Revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation; and
• Expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.

2) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the 
net assets of the joint arrangement. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and 
are initially recognized at cost.

Saudi Aramco’s share of results of its joint ventures is recognized within net income, while its share of post-acquisition 
movements in other comprehensive income is recognized within other comprehensive income. The cumulative effect of these 
changes is adjusted against the carrying amount of Saudi Aramco’s investments in joint ventures, which is presented separately  
in the consolidated balance sheet. When Saudi Aramco’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the 
joint venture, including any other unsecured non-current receivables, Saudi Aramco does not recognize further losses, unless  
it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence is retained, the difference 
between the carrying amount derecognized and the proceeds received is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.

Gains and losses on transactions between Saudi Aramco and joint ventures not realized through a sale to a third party are 
eliminated to the extent of Saudi Aramco’s interest in the joint ventures. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of joint ventures to align their accounting policies with those used by Saudi Aramco.

Saudi Aramco’s investments in joint ventures includes, when applicable, goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any 
accumulated impairment loss. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of Saudi Aramco’s 
share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired joint venture at the date of acquisition. 

Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

(iii) Associates
Associates are entities over which Saudi Aramco has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in 
financial and operating policy decisions but with no control or joint control over those policies and is generally reflected by a 
shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method 
of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The accounting policies for joint ventures detailed in Note 2(e)(ii)(2) above are 
also applied by Saudi Aramco to its associates.

Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The acquisition of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates require management to estimate the fair values of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. In addition, judgments are applied in the determination of whether control, joint control or 
significant influence is present with respect to investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements or associates. Judgment is applied 
when determining if an entity is controlled by voting rights, potential voting rights or other rights granted through contractual 
arrangements and includes consideration of an entity’s purpose and design, among other factors. Judgment is applied when 
assessing whether an arrangement is jointly controlled by all of its parties or by a group of the parties by taking decisions about 
relevant activities through unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Judgment is also applied as to whether a joint 
arrangement is classified as a joint venture or joint operation taking into account specific facts and circumstances, such as the 
purpose and design of the arrangement, including with respect to its output, its relationship to the parties and its source of cash 
flows. Judgment is applied in determining whether significant influence is held by assessing factors such as representation on the 
board of directors, participation in policy-making processes, material transactions with the entity, interchange of managerial 
personnel, and provision of essential technical information. Refer to Notes 7, 34, 35, 38, and 39.

(f) Intangible assets
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill is carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or 
groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the acquisition in which the goodwill arose. The units or 
groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(f) Intangible assets continued
Intangible assets other than exploration and evaluation costs (Note 2(g)) and those with indefinite useful lives such as goodwill 
and brand acquired on acquisition of Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (“SABIC”) in 2020, consist primarily of brands and 
trademarks, franchise/customer relationships and computer software. If acquired in a business combination, these intangible 
assets are recognized at their fair value at the date of acquisition and, if acquired separately, these intangible assets are 
recognized at cost. All these intangible assets are subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

The following table sets forth estimated useful lives, in years, of the principal groups of these intangible assets:

Brands and trademarks 10 to 22
Franchise/customer relationships 5 to 25
Computer software 3 to 15

Amortization is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of income.

(g) Exploration and evaluation
Exploration and evaluation costs are recorded under the successful efforts method. Under the successful efforts method, 
geological and geophysical costs are recognized as an expense when incurred and exploration costs associated with exploratory 
wells are initially capitalized on the consolidated balance sheet as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete  
and the results have been evaluated. If potential commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are found, these costs continue to be 
capitalized subject to further appraisal activities that would determine the commercial viability and technical feasibility of the 
reserves. If potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons have not been found, and no alternative use of the well is 
determined, the previously capitalized costs are written off to exploration in the consolidated statement of income.

Exploratory wells remain capitalized while additional appraisal drilling on the potential oil and/or gas field is performed or while 
optimum development plans are established. All such capitalized costs are not subject to amortization, but at each reporting date 
are subject to regular technical and management review to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value 
from the well. Where such intent no longer exists, the costs are written off to exploration in the consolidated statement of 
income. Capitalized exploratory expenditures are, at each reporting date, subject to review for impairment indicators.

When proved reserves of hydrocarbons are determined and there is a firm plan for development approved by management, the 
relevant capitalized costs are transferred to property, plant and equipment.

(h) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated on the consolidated balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures directly attributable to the construction and/or acquisition of the asset (Note 2(s)). Land 
and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. When a construction-in-progress asset is deemed available for use as intended 
by management, depreciation commences.

Subsequent expenditures including major renovations are included in an asset’s carrying amount, or recognized as a separate 
asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to Saudi Aramco and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced item is derecognized. All other repair and maintenance 
expenditures are expensed as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use  
is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met (Note 2(v)).

Where the life of expected hydrocarbon reserves substantially exceeds the economic or technical lives of the underlying assets, 
the straight-line method of depreciation is used. The unit of production method is used for fields where the expected reserve life 
is approximately equal to or less than the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets. Depletion rates are calculated on the 
basis of a group of wells or fields with similar characteristics based on proved developed reserves. The estimation of expected 
reserve lives reflects management’s assessment of proved developed reserves and the related depletion strategy on a field-by-
field basis. Depreciation expense on all other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost less residual 
values over the estimated useful lives. Depreciation expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of income.

Depreciation expense is calculated after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual 
value at the end of its useful life. The useful lives and residual values are determined by management at the time the asset is 
initially recognized and are reviewed annually for appropriateness or when events or conditions occur that impact capitalized 
costs, hydrocarbon reserves, residual values or estimated useful lives.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(h) Property, plant and equipment continued
The estimated useful lives or, for right-of-use assets the lease term, if shorter (Note 2(j)), in years, of principal groups of 
depreciable assets is as follows:

Land and land improvements 3 to 54
Buildings 5 to 50
Oil and gas properties 15 to 30
Plant, machinery and equipment 2 to 52
Depots, storage tanks and pipelines 4 to 30
Fixtures, IT and office equipment 2 to 20

Gains and losses on disposals of depreciable assets are recognized in net income.

(i) Impairment of non-financial assets
Saudi Aramco assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired except 
that assets with indefinite useful lives such as goodwill and brand acquired on acquisition of SABIC in 2020 are reviewed for 
impairment on an annual basis. If an indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds 
its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal or value in use (“VIU”). 
The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on either, post-tax discounted cash flow models or available data from 
binding arm’s length sales transactions for similar assets, or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the 
asset. The VIU calculation is based on a post-tax risk adjusted discounted cash flow model. The use of post-tax discount rates in 
determining VIU does not result in a materially different determination of the need for, or the amount of, impairment that would 
be required if pre-tax discount rates had been used.

Impairment losses are recognized as a component of net income. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of a non-goodwill 
impairment loss decreases, a reversal of the previously recognized impairment loss is recognized in net income.

Significant accounting judgments and estimates
Impairment tests are undertaken on the basis of the smallest identifiable group of assets (cash-generating unit), or individual 
assets, for which there are largely independent cash inflows. The key assumptions used to determine the different cash-
generating units involves significant judgment from management.

For the purposes of determining whether impairment of items of property, plant and equipment has occurred, and the extent of 
any impairment or its reversal, the key assumptions management uses in estimating future cash flows for its VIU calculations are 
forecasted future oil, gas, refined product and chemical prices, expected production volumes, future operating and development 
costs, refining and petrochemical margins and changes to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model. There is an 
inherent uncertainty over forecasted information and assumptions. Changes in these assumptions and forecasts could impact the 
recoverable amounts of assets and any calculated impairment and reversals thereof.

(j) Leases
Saudi Aramco’s portfolio of leased assets mainly comprises land and buildings, drilling rigs, marine vessels, industrial facilities, 
equipment, storage and tanks, aircraft and vehicles. The determination of whether the contract is, or contains, a lease is based  
on the substance of the contract at the inception of the lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right  
to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Saudi Aramco recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets are initially 
measured at cost, which comprises lease liabilities at initial measurement, any initial direct costs incurred, any lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date, and restoration costs less any lease incentives received. Subsequent to initial 
recognition the right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses,  
if any, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the 
end of the lease term or if the cost of the asset reflects the exercise of the purchase option, in which case right-of-use assets are 
depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of 
income. Right-of-use assets are included under property, plant and equipment (Note 5).

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(j) Leases continued
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments. Lease payments include fixed lease payments, 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, amounts payable for guaranteed residual values and payments to be 
made under extension or purchase or termination options, where applicable. The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case, the lessee’s incremental 
borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an 
asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the lease liabilities are measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the 
lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and adjusted for remeasurement to reflect any 
reassessments or lease modifications. Lease liabilities are included under borrowings (Note 20). Lease payments are allocated 
between the principal and finance costs. Finance costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of income over 
the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Saudi Aramco has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term and low-value leases. Lease 
payments under short-term and low-value leases are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of income on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.

Significant accounting judgments and estimates
In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise 
an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options are only included in the lease term if the lease is 
reasonably certain to not be terminated or to be extended. The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant 
change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and is within the control of the lessee.

(k) Investments and other financial assets
(i) Classification
Management determines the classification of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the financial assets 
and the contractual terms of the cash flows. Saudi Aramco’s financial assets are classified in the following measurement 
categories:
• those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or through profit or loss); and
• those to be measured at amortized cost.

For financial assets measured at fair value, gains and losses are recorded either in net income or other comprehensive income. 
For investments in debt securities, this depends on the business model in which the investment is held. For investments in equity 
instruments that are not held for trading, this depends on whether Saudi Aramco has made an irrevocable election at the time of 
initial recognition, due to the strategic nature of these investments, to account for such equity investments at fair value through 
other comprehensive income. Saudi Aramco reclassifies debt securities, when and only when, its business model for managing 
those assets changes. Certain revenue contracts provide for provisional pricing at the time of shipment with the final pricing 
based on an average market price for a particular future period. Such trade receivables are measured at fair value because the 
contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest. All other trade receivables meet the criteria for 
amortized cost measurement under IFRS 9.

(ii) Recognition and derecognition
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade-date, which is the date on which Saudi Aramco 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial 
assets have expired or have been transferred and Saudi Aramco has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

(iii) Measurement
At initial recognition, Saudi Aramco measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of 
financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed as a component of net income. Saudi Aramco 
subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value.

Equity investments:
Where Saudi Aramco has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, 
there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to net income following the derecognition of the investment. 
Dividends from such investments continue to be recognized as a component of net income when Saudi Aramco’s right to receive 
payments is established. Changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as a 
component of net income.

(k) Investments and other financial assets continued
Debt securities:
Subsequent measurement of debt securities depends on Saudi Aramco’s business model for managing the asset and the cash 
flow characteristics of the asset. Debt securities are classified into the following three measurement categories:

1) Amortized cost:
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and 
interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is 
subsequently measured at amortized cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognized as a component of net income 
when the asset is derecognized or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the 
effective interest method.

2) Fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”):
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows 
represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken 
through other comprehensive income, except for impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and 
losses which are recognized as a component of net income. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to net income. Interest income from these 
financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest method.

3) Fair value through profit or loss (“FVPL”):
Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that  
is subsequently measured at FVPL and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognized as a component of net income in the 
period in which it arises. Financial assets at FVPL are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of  
the asset within 12 months from the end of the reporting period, in which case the asset is included in current assets.

Other financial assets:
Other financial assets are classified into the following categories:

1) Amortized cost:
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and 
interest are measured at amortized cost. A gain or loss on a financial asset that is subsequently measured at amortized cost and  
is not part of a hedging relationship is recognized as a component of net income when the asset is derecognized or impaired. 
Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate.

Financial assets at amortized cost comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, other assets and receivables,  
due from the Government and trade receivables other than those subsequently measured at FVPL, as described below.

2) Fair value through profit or loss:
Trade receivables related to contracts with provisional pricing arrangements are subsequently measured at FVPL.

(iv) Impairment
Saudi Aramco assesses on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with debt securities carried at either 
amortized cost or FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase  
in credit risk.

For trade receivables, Saudi Aramco applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses 
to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables.

(l) Derivative instruments and hedging activities
Saudi Aramco’s use of derivative instruments does not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

(i) Derivative instruments classified as held for trading
Saudi Aramco uses commodity derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to price fluctuations, which arise on 
purchase and sale transactions for physical deliveries of crude, natural gas liquids and various refined and bulk petrochemical 
products. The derivatives are initially recognized, and subsequently remeasured at fair value and recorded as an asset, when the 
fair value is positive, or as a liability, when the fair value is negative, under trade receivables or trade and other payables in the 
consolidated balance sheet, respectively.

The fair value of the derivatives is determined in accordance with Saudi Aramco’s derivative valuation policy by reference to the 
traded price of that instrument on the relevant exchange or over-the-counter markets at the consolidated balance sheet date.  
The gain or loss from the changes in the fair value of the swap from its value at inception is recognized in net income.

(ii) Derivative instruments designated as hedges
Saudi Aramco uses interest rate swaps and currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
and foreign exchange rates. These derivative financial instruments, designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges, are 
purchased from counterparties of high credit standing and are initially recognized, and subsequently remeasured, at fair value.

At the inception of the hedging transaction, Saudi Aramco documents the economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(l) Derivative instruments and hedging activities continued
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument used for hedging purposes is classified as a current asset or liability when  
the remaining maturity of the derivative is less than 12 months; otherwise, it is classified as a non-current asset or liability.

1) Fair value hedges
A fair value hedge is a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or firm commitment. Saudi Aramco designates 
certain currency forward contracts as fair value hedges. The gain or loss from the changes in the fair value of the currency 
forward contracts is recognized in net income, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

2) Cash flow hedges
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of a particular risk associated with all or a component of a recognized asset or liability or a highly 
probable forecast transaction, and could affect profit or loss. Any gain or loss relating to the effective portion of changes in the 
fair value of interest rate swap contracts is recognized in other comprehensive income, with the ineffective portion recognized 
immediately in net income.

Gains and losses deferred through other comprehensive income are reclassified to net income at the time the hedged item affects 
net income. However, when a hedged item is a forecast transaction resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability, the gains and losses deferred through other comprehensive income, if any, are included in the initial cost 
or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires, any cumulative gain or loss deferred 
through other comprehensive income will remain until the forecast transaction is recognized. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss deferred through other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified 
to net income.

(m) Income tax and zakat
Income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax expense. Income tax expense is recognized in net 
income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income. In this case, the related income 
tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income.

Current income tax expense is calculated primarily on the basis of the Tax Law. In addition, income tax expense results from 
taxable income generated by foreign affiliates.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method at tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the 
reporting period and expected to apply when the related deferred income tax is realized or settled on temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. In 
estimating such tax consequences, consideration is given to expected future events. Deferred income tax is not provided on initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction, does not 
affect either the accounting profit or the taxable profit.

Deferred income tax assets are recognized where future recovery is probable. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and when the 
deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. Deferred income tax is not provided for taxes on possible future 
distributions of retained earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the distribution can be controlled and it is probable that the 
retained earnings will be substantially reinvested by the entities.

Zakat is levied at the higher of adjusted income subject to zakat or the zakat base in accordance with the Regulations of the 
Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (“ZATCA”) in the Kingdom. Zakat is computed using the zakat base. The zakat provision is 
charged to the consolidated statement of income.

Significant accounting judgments and estimates
Saudi Aramco establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for potential claims by the tax authorities of the respective 
countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as different interpretations of tax 
regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority and the outcome of previous negotiations. This requires the 
application of judgment as to the ultimate outcome, which can change over time depending on facts and circumstances. A 
change in estimate of the likelihood of a future outflow and/or in the expected amount to be settled would be recognized in net 
income in the period in which the change occurs. Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent it is considered 
probable that those assets are recoverable. This includes an assessment of when those assets are likely to reverse, and a judgment 
as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable income available to offset the assets when they do reverse. This requires 
assumptions regarding future profitability. To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an 
increase or decrease in the amounts recognized in respect of deferred income tax assets as well as in the amounts recognized  
in net income in the period in which the change occurs.

Detailed taxation information, including current expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, is presented in Note 8.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(n) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost comprises all expenses to bring inventories to 
their present location and condition and, for hydrocarbon and chemical inventories, is determined using the first-in, first-out 
(“FIFO”) method. For materials and supplies inventories, cost is determined using the weighted average method, less an 
allowance for disposal of obsolete and/or surplus materials and supplies. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in  
the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.

(o) Due from the Government
The Government compensates the Company through price equalization (Note 2(z)) and for past due trade receivables of specified 
Government, semi-Government and other entities with Government ownership or control to whom the Company supplies 
specified products and services.

Revenue on sales to these specified Government, semi-Government and other entities with Government ownership or control is 
recognized upon the satisfaction of performance obligations, which occurs when control transfers to these customers. Control  
of the products is determined to be transferred when the title of products passes, which typically takes place when product is 
physically transferred to these customers. Once receivables from these customers are past due, these trade receivables are 
reclassified as a due from the Government current receivable. In cases where any of these customers settle past due amounts, 
the Government guarantee receivable is credited with the amounts received. The balance is presented within due from the 
Government even if it is payable to the Government based on the Company’s expectation to settle the balance on a net basis  
with other amounts due from the Government.

Implementing regulations issued by the Government allow the Company to offset any amounts due from the Government 
against payment of taxes, and in the event of insufficiency of tax balances, offset against any other amounts due and payable by 
the Company to the Government. Balances due from the Government at December 31 represent amounts to be settled through 
offset against tax payments.

(p) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and in banks together with all highly liquid investments purchased with original 
maturities of three months or less.

(q) Treasury shares
Treasury shares are recognized as a deduction from equity at the amount of consideration paid by the Company for their 
acquisition, including any directly attributable transaction costs incurred.

(r) Financial liabilities
Saudi Aramco recognizes a financial liability when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of an instrument.

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Upon 
derecognition, the difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to discharge or cancel the liability is 
recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Further, when an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the 
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.

Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as financial liabilities at FVPL or as financial liabilities measured at amortized 
cost, as appropriate. 

Saudi Aramco’s financial liabilities are:

(i) Financial liabilities at FVPL
Derivative financial liabilities are categorized as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges (Note 2(l)). Derivative 
financial liabilities held for trading are included in current liabilities under trade and other payables with gains or losses 
recognized in net income.

(ii) Financial liabilities at amortized cost
Financial liabilities other than financial liabilities at FVPL are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost and are 
recorded net of transaction costs. Such financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method. Discounting is omitted when the effect is immaterial. Financial liabilities 
measured at amortized cost are included in current liabilities, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the 
end of the reporting period, which are classified as non-current liabilities.

Financial liabilities at amortized cost include trade and other payables and borrowings. Financial liabilities are disclosed 
separately from financial assets in the consolidated balance sheet unless there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognized amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(s) Borrowing costs
Any difference between borrowing proceeds and the redemption value is recognized as finance costs in the consolidated 
statement of income over the term of the borrowing using the effective interest method.

Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred except for those costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset which are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset until the asset is complete for its intended 
use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for intended use or sale.

(t) Post-employment benefit plans
(i) Pension plans
Funded pension plans are non-contributory plans for the majority of employees and are generally funded by payments by  
Saudi Aramco and where applicable by group companies to independent trusts or other separate entities. Assets held by the 
independent trusts and other separate entities are held at their fair value. Valuations of both funded and unfunded plans  
are performed annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The valuations take into account 
employees’ years of service, average or final pensionable remuneration, and are discounted to their present value using  
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related defined  
benefit obligation.

The amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The periodic pension cost included 
in operating costs in the consolidated statement of income in respect of defined benefit pension plans primarily represents the 
increase in the actuarially assessed present value of the obligation for pension benefits based on employee service during the 
year and the net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset. Net interest is calculated by multiplying the defined benefit 
liability and plan assets by the discount rate applied to each plan at the beginning of each year, amended for changes to the 
defined benefit liability and plan assets as a result of benefit payments or contributions.

Past service costs, representing plan amendments, are recognized immediately as pension costs in the consolidated statement  
of income, regardless of the remaining vesting period.

Remeasurements representing actuarial gains and losses, arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions, and the actual returns on plan assets excluding interest on plan assets, are credited or charged to equity, net of tax, 
through other comprehensive income.

For defined contribution plans where benefits depend solely on the amount contributed to or due to the employee’s account and 
the returns earned from the investment of those contributions, plan cost is the amount contributed by or due from Saudi Aramco 
and is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of income.

(ii) Other post-employment benefits
Saudi Aramco provides certain post-employment healthcare, life insurance and other benefits to retirees and certain former 
employees. The entitlement is usually based on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a 
minimum service period. To the extent these plans are not fully funded, a liability is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Valuations of benefits are performed by independent actuaries.

Such plans follow the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans.

Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The costs of defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical benefits are determined using actuarial valuations.  
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions, which are reviewed annually. Key assumptions include discount rates, 
future salary increases, future healthcare costs, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexity of the 
valuation, the underlying assumptions and the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant 
uncertainty. Information about amounts reported in respect of defined benefit plans, assumptions applicable to the plans  
and their sensitivity to changes are presented in Note 21.

(u) Share-based compensation
The cost of an equity-settled award granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument on 
the date the award is granted. This cost is recognized as an employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of income 
with a corresponding increase in equity.

The cost of a cash-settled award granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the liability at each 
consolidated balance sheet date until settlement. This cost is recognized as an employee benefit expense in the consolidated 
statement of income with the corresponding recognition of a liability on the consolidated balance sheet.

The cost of both the equity-settled and cash-settled awards is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which 
the employees render the required service for the award and any non-market performance condition attached to the award is 
required to be met. Additionally, for a cash-settled award, any changes in the fair value of the liability between the vesting date 
and the date of its settlement are also recognized in the consolidated statement of income within employee benefit expense.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(u) Share-based compensation continued
In determining the fair value of an equity-settled or cash-settled award, an appropriate valuation method is applied. Service and 
non-market performance conditions are not taken into account in determining the fair value of the award, but during the vesting 
period the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Company’s best estimate of the number of awards that 
are expected to vest. Any market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the 
award’s fair value.

(v) Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are liabilities where the timing or amount of future expenditures is uncertain. Provisions are recognized when Saudi 
Aramco has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of economic 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the end of 
the reporting period. Amounts are discounted, unless the effect of discounting is immaterial, using an appropriate discount rate 
that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in 
the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense within finance costs in the consolidated statement of 
income.

Saudi Aramco records a provision and a corresponding asset for decommissioning activities in Upstream operations for well 
plugging and abandonment. The decommissioning obligation for a well is recognized when it is drilled. Decommissioning 
provisions associated with Downstream facilities are generally not recognized, as the potential obligations cannot be measured, 
given their indeterminate settlement dates. The decommissioning obligations will be recognized in the period when sufficient 
information becomes available to estimate a range of potential settlement dates. Decommissioning costs are provided for at the 
present value of expected costs to settle the obligation using estimated cash flows. The value of the obligation is added to the 
carrying amount of the related asset and amortized over the useful life of the asset. The increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognized as finance costs in the consolidated statement of income. Changes in future cash flow estimates 
resulting from revisions to the estimated timing or amount of undiscounted cash flows are recognized as a change in provision 
and related asset.

A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of a possible obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where 
the amount of a present obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability or it is not probable that there will be an 
outflow of resources to settle that obligation. Contingent assets are not recognized, but are disclosed where the inflow of 
economic benefits is probable.

Significant accounting judgments and estimates
Most of Saudi Aramco’s well plugging and abandonment activities are many years into the future with technology and costs 
constantly changing. Estimates of the amounts of a provision are recognized based on current legal and constructive 
requirements and costs associated to abandon using existing technologies. Actual costs are uncertain and estimates can vary  
as a result of changes in the scope of the project and/or relevant laws and regulation. The estimated timing of decommissioning 
may change due to certain factors, such as reserve life, a decision to terminate operations, or changes in legislation. Changes  
to estimates related to future expected costs, discount rates and timing may have a material impact on the amounts presented.  
As a result, significant judgment is applied in the initial recognition and subsequent adjustment of the provision and the 
capitalized cost associated with decommissioning, plugging and abandonment obligations. Any subsequent adjustments to  
the provision are made prospectively. Detail on the particular assumptions applied when making certain non-current provisions  
is included in Note 22.

(w) Foreign currency translation
The USD is the functional currency of the Company. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Any foreign currency monetary assets or liabilities are 
translated at each reporting date using the prevailing reporting date exchange rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognized as a component of net income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities, other than those measured at  
fair value, are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions.

Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The Company has determined that USD is the functional currency as a substantial amount of its products are traded in USD  
in international markets. However, a substantial amount of costs of the Company are denominated in SAR, which has been 
exchanged at a fixed rate to USD since 1986. A change in the fixed exchange rate could impact the recorded revenue, expenses, 
assets and liabilities of the Company.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(x) Presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in SAR. The financial position and results of the operations of the Company, 
subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates that have a functional currency which is different from the presentation currency 
are translated at reporting date exchange rates and the average exchange rates that approximate the cumulative effect of rates 
prevailing at the transaction dates, respectively. All resulting exchange differences are recognized through other comprehensive 
income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that foreign operation is 
recognized in net income.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the reporting 
date exchange rate.

Translations from SAR to USD presented as supplementary information in the consolidated statement of income, consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of changes in equity, and consolidated 
statement of cash flows at December 31, 2022 and 2021, are for convenience and were calculated at the rate of USD 1.00 = SAR 3.75 
representing the exchange rate at the consolidated balance sheet dates.

(y) Revenue recognition and sales prices
Revenue from sales of crude oil and related products is recognized upon the satisfaction of performance obligations, which 
occurs when control transfers to the customer. Control of the products is determined to be transferred to the customer when the 
title of crude oil and related products passes to the customer, which typically takes place when product is physically transferred 
into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism.

Revenue contracts for crude oil and certain related products provide for provisional pricing at the time of shipment, with final 
pricing based on the average market price for a particular future period. Revenue on these contracts is recorded based on the 
estimate of the final price at the time control is transferred to the customer. Any difference between the estimate and the final 
price is recorded as a change in fair value of the related receivable, as part of revenue, in the consolidated statement of income. 
Where applicable the transaction price is allocated to the individual performance obligations of a contract based on their relative 
stand-alone selling prices.

(z) Other income related to sales
The Government compensates the Company through price equalization for revenue directly forgone as a result of the Company’s 
compliance with local regulations governing domestic sales and distribution of certain liquid products, LPGs and certain other 
products. This compensation reflected in these consolidated financial statements, is calculated by the Company as the difference 
between the product’s equalization price and the corresponding domestic regulated price, net of Government fees, in 
accordance with the implementing regulations issued by the Government in 2017 and 2019.

This compensation is recorded as other income related to sales, that is taxable, when the Company has satisfied its performance 
obligations through transfer of the title to the buyer, which occurs when product is physically transferred. The compensation due 
from the Government is characterized as a due from the Government (Note 2(o)) current receivable and is recognized initially  
at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less impairment losses, if any.

The implementing regulations allow the Company to offset any amounts due from the Government against payment of taxes, 
and in the event of insufficiency of tax balances, offsetting may extend against any other amounts due and payable by the 
Company to the Government.

(aa) Production royalties
Royalties to the Government are calculated based on a progressive scheme applied to crude oil production. An effective royalty 
rate is applied to production based on the Company’s official selling prices. The effective royalty rate is determined based on a 
baseline marginal rate of 15% applied to prices up to $70 per barrel, increasing to 45% applied to prices above $70 per barrel and 
80% applied to prices above $100 per barrel. All such royalties are accounted for as an expense in the consolidated statement of 
income and are deductible costs for Government income tax calculations.

(bb) Research and development
Development costs that are expected to generate probable future economic benefits are capitalized as intangible assets and 
amortized over their estimated useful life. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.  
All other research and development costs are recognized in net income as incurred.

(cc) Dividends
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorized and no longer at the discretion of  
the Company, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies, judgments and estimates continued
(dd) Earnings per share
(i) Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
• the net income attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company
• by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period, adjusted for bonus elements  

in ordinary shares issued during the period and excluding treasury shares.

(ii) Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:
• the after-income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares; and
• the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion  

of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

3. Financial risk management
Financial risks include market risk (including foreign currency exchange risk, price risk, and interest rate risk), credit risk, and 
liquidity risk. Financial risk management is carried out primarily by a central treasury department. The adequacy of financial risk 
management policies is regularly reviewed with consideration of current activities and market conditions on a consolidated basis. 
Saudi Aramco uses derivative financial instruments with limited complexity to manage certain risk exposures and does not enter 
into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.

(a) Financial risk factors
(i) Market risk
1) Foreign currency exchange risk – The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due  
to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Saudi Aramco operates internationally but has limited exposure to financial risk due to changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates as most significant transactions are denominated in its functional currency (Note 2(w)), are linked to its functional currency 
or are hedged. Saudi Aramco’s limited foreign currency exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions or recognized 
assets or liabilities denominated in a currency that is not Saudi Aramco’s functional currency. In addition, a substantial amount of 
costs of Saudi Aramco are denominated in SAR which has been at a fixed rate to USD since 1986. A change in the fixed exchange 
rate would result in foreign exchange differences being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

Saudi Aramco engages in foreign currency hedging activities through the use of currency forward contracts to manage its 
exposure from significant transactions denominated in a foreign currency. The hedge ratio considers variability in potential 
outcomes, spot rates, as well as interest rates, and on a transaction by transaction basis, can cover up to 100% of the exposure  
at inception.

The notional amounts of outstanding currency forward contracts designated as hedging instruments are included in Note 30.

2) Price risk – The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Price risk primarily stems from investments in securities and commodity trading.

a) Investments in securities
Saudi Aramco has limited exposure to price risk with such risk arising from investments in securities carried at fair value.

Saudi Aramco regularly reviews its positions in investments in securities considering current and expected future economic 
trends.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, a change in fair value due to a movement of 5% in the price of listed equity securities would 
result in a change in other comprehensive income before income taxes of SAR 435 and SAR 457, respectively.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, a change in fair value due to a movement of 5% in the unit price of equities and mutual and 
hedge funds would result in a change in income before income taxes of SAR 15 and SAR 18, respectively.

b) Commodity derivative contracts
Saudi Aramco trades crude, natural gas liquids and various refined and bulk petrochemical products and uses commodity 
derivatives as a means of managing price and timing of risks arising from this trading. In effecting these transactions, Saudi 
Aramco operates within policies and procedures designed to ensure that risks, including those related to the default of 
counterparties, are managed within authorized limits. The notional amounts of outstanding commodity derivative contracts  
are included in Note 30.

3. Financial risk management continued
(a) Financial risk factors continued
3) Interest rate risk – The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes  
in market interest rates. 

Saudi Aramco is exposed to interest rate risk from changes in interest rates that affect the fair value or future cash flows of 
financial instruments, principally borrowings, issued at variable and fixed rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose Saudi 
Aramco to cash flow interest rate risk, which is partially offset by short-term time deposits and debt securities held at variable 
rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose Saudi Aramco to fair value interest rate risk. Saudi Aramco may enter into interest 
rate swap agreements as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, a change of 1% in market interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would result in  
a net change of SAR 2,161 and SAR 2,127, respectively, in Saudi Aramco’s income before income taxes as a result of the effect  
of higher or lower market interest rates.

The notional amounts of interest rate swap contracts are included in Note 30.

(ii) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparties might not fulfill their contractual payment obligations towards an entity.

Saudi Aramco is exposed to credit risk related to its counterparties not performing or honoring their obligations, which could 
result in financial loss. Credit risk arises from credit exposures on trade and other receivables as well as from cash and cash 
equivalents, short-term investments, debt securities, and derivatives with financial institutions. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk is the carrying value of these assets.

Saudi Aramco’s trade receivables arise from a global customer base, which limits geographic concentrations of credit risk. 
Moreover, a credit risk policy is in place to ensure credit limits are extended to creditworthy counterparties and risk mitigation 
measures are defined and implemented accordingly. Saudi Aramco performs ongoing evaluations of its counterparties’ financial 
standing and takes additional measures to mitigate credit risk when considered appropriate, including but not limited to letters of 
credits, bank guarantees or parent company guarantees.

In addition, the credit risk policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any individual counterparty based on their credit rating 
as well as other factors. Moreover, Saudi Aramco’s investment policy limits exposure to credit risk arising from investment 
activities. The policy requires that cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments be invested with a diversified group of 
financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Saudi Aramco ensures that each counterparty is of an acceptable credit 
quality by relying on quantitative and qualitative measures compiled from internal and third-party rating models. At December 31, 
2022, all short-term investments were with financial institutions assigned a long-term credit rating of “BBB” (2021: “BBB”) or above.

Employee home loans (Note 9) and debt securities are generally considered to have low credit risk based on history of default 
and thus the impairment provision recognized during the year based on the general approach allowed by IFRS 9, where 
applicable, was substantially limited to 12-month expected losses.

Saudi Aramco applies the simplified approach allowed by IFRS 9 in providing for expected credit losses for trade receivables, 
which uses the lifetime expected credit loss provision for all trade receivables. Such credit losses have historically been nominal 
and the loss allowance for trade receivables (Note 12) is not material.

(iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.

Saudi Aramco’s liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and ensuring the availability 
of incremental funding through credit facilities (Note 20). Management also monitors and forecasts Saudi Aramco’s liquidity 
requirements based on current and non-current expected cash flows.

Saudi Aramco invests surplus cash in current accounts, time deposits, money market instruments, government repurchase 
agreements, and marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to meet 
forecasted cash flow requirements. Saudi Aramco prioritizes security and liquidity over yield.

Note 20 analyzes Saudi Aramco’s borrowings into relevant maturity groupings based on the balances associated with each 
contractual maturity date at the end of the reporting period.

Saudi Aramco has financial guarantees arising in the ordinary course of business. The earliest period in which such guarantees 
can be called is the effective date as defined in the related agreements. The maximum exposure is limited to the gross value of 
such guarantees.

3. Financial risk management continued
(b) Capital structure management
Saudi Aramco seeks to maintain a prudent capital structure, comprised of borrowings and shareholders’ equity, to support its 
capital investment plans and maintain a sustainable dividend profile. Maintaining sufficient financial flexibility is considered 
strategically important to mitigate industry cyclicality, while also enabling the pursuit of organic and inorganic investment 
opportunities. Borrowings or dividends will result in an adjustment to Saudi Aramco’s capital structure. 

Gearing is a measure of the degree to which Saudi Aramco’s operations are financed by debt. Saudi Aramco defines gearing  
as the ratio of net (cash) / debt (total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, investments in debt 
securities (current and non-current), and non-current cash investments) to total equity and net (cash) / debt. Saudi Aramco’s 
gearing ratios at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, were as follows:

2022 2021

Total borrowings (current and non-current) 393,144 510,921
Cash and cash equivalents (226,047) (299,579)
Short-term investments (281,215) (27,073)
Investments in debt securities (current and non-current) (8,565) (8,966)

Non-current cash investments – –
Net (cash) / debt (122,683) 175,303
Total equity 1,666,147 1,280,668

Total equity and net (cash) / debt 1,543,464 1,455,971
Gearing (7.9)% 12.0%

Previously, Saudi Aramco defined gearing as the ratio of net debt (total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents) to net debt 
plus total equity. The gearing under the previous definition would have been 9.1% and 14.2% as at December 31, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021, respectively.

(c) Casualty loss risk retention
Saudi Aramco’s casualty loss risk strategy includes a risk retention and insurance program, including providing coverage to 
certain joint arrangements and associates limited to Saudi Aramco’s percentage interest in the relevant entity. Current maximum 
risk retention is SAR 3,190 per loss event (2021: SAR 2,988) and various insurance limits apply, of which the risk retention forms a 
part. Should a credible loss event occur, the maximum insurance limit above retention is SAR 4,498 (2021: SAR 4,700) per event 
dependent on the circumstances.

(d) Fair value estimation
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a 
principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Management believes that the fair values of Saudi 
Aramco’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at amortized cost are not materially different from 
their carrying amounts at the end of the reporting period.

Saudi Aramco measures financial instruments such as derivatives, equity investments and debt securities classified as FVPL, and 
equity investments and debt securities classified as FVOCI, at fair value at each consolidated balance sheet date. Saudi Aramco 
uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair 
value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities 
for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or 

indirectly observable; and
• Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

3. Financial risk management continued
(d) Fair value estimation continued
The valuation techniques for Saudi Aramco’s investments in securities are described in Note 10. The changes in Level 3 
investments in securities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are as follows:

2022 2021

January 1 5,268 4,970
Net additions (disposals) 2,790 (5)
Net unrealized fair value gain 391 407
Realized gain (loss) 41 (104)
December 31 8,490 5,268

The movement in trade receivables related to contracts with provisional pricing arrangements mainly relates to sales transactions, 
net of settlements, made during the period, resulting from contracts with customers (Note 12). Unrealized fair value movements 
on these trade receivables are not significant.

The change in the carrying amount of commodity derivative contracts primarily relates to purchase and sales of derivative 
contracts, including recognition of a gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value. Fair value movements on 
commodity derivatives are not significant.

The movement in the financial assets and liabilities relating to options and forward contracts on Saudi Aramco’s own equity 
instruments in certain subsidiaries, is mainly due to the change in the unrealized fair value during the period.

4. Operating segments
Saudi Aramco is engaged in prospecting, exploring, drilling, extracting, processing, manufacturing, refining and marketing 
hydrocarbon substances within the Kingdom and has interests in refining, petrochemical, distribution, marketing and storage 
facilities outside the Kingdom.

Saudi Aramco’s operating segments are established on the basis of those components that are evaluated regularly by the CEO, 
considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker monitors the operating results of 
Saudi Aramco’s operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance 
assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on revenues, costs and a broad range of key performance indicators in 
addition to segment profitability.

For management purposes, Saudi Aramco is organized into business units based on the main types of activities. At December 31, 
2022, Saudi Aramco had two reportable segments, Upstream and Downstream, with all other supporting functions aggregated 
into a Corporate segment. Upstream activities include crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids exploration, field 
development and production. Downstream activities consist primarily of refining and petrochemical manufacturing, supply and 
trading, distribution and power generation, logistics, and marketing of crude oil and related services to international and 
domestic customers. Corporate activities include primarily supporting services including Human Resources, Finance and IT not 
allocated to Upstream and Downstream. Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner 
similar to transactions with third parties.

The accounting policies used by Saudi Aramco in reporting segments internally are the same as those described in Note 2 of the 
consolidated financial statements.

Information by segments is as follows:

Upstream Downstream Corporate Eliminations Consolidated

2022
External revenue 1,024,628 980,681 1,646 – 2,006,955

1. Cash used for exploration and evaluation operating activities in 2022 was SAR 5,531 (2021: SAR 4,410) and expenditures for investing activities were SAR 5,054 (2021: SAR 3,299).

2. Other intangible assets with a net book value of SAR 2,510 (2021: SAR 1,841) comprise of licenses, technology, usage rights and processing and offtake agreements of SAR 1,695 
(2021: SAR 593) and patents and intellectual property of SAR 815 (2021: SAR 1,248). Processing and offtake agreements of SAR 1,083 were acquired during 2022 (2021: Nil).

3. Saudi Aramco recognized a write-down of SAR 330 on certain other intangible assets during the year (2021: Nil).

Intangible assets recognized on acquisitions are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with the 
exception of goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, and the SABIC brand, which has been determined to have an indefinite 
useful life and are not subject to amortization.

Saudi Aramco performed an annual impairment test for the goodwill acquired as part of the SABIC acquisition, amounting to 
SAR 99,116 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, which is allocated to the Downstream operating segment. The recoverable amount  
of the Downstream operating segment was determined based on VIU calculations which require use of certain assumptions. The 
calculations used cash flow projections for a period of 10 years based on financial plans approved by management. Cash flows 
were discounted and aggregated with a terminal value. Management’s estimate for the cash flows is based on past performance 
and management’s expectation of the future. This includes management’s forecast for prices and margins for the downstream 
operations. The growth rate used in the terminal value calculation represents long-term inflation forecast. Pre-tax discount rate 
of 11.1% (2021: 8.6%) was applied to the cash flows. As a result of the analysis, management did not identify any impairment of 
goodwill related to the SABIC acquisition.

Saudi Aramco also performed an annual impairment test for the brand acquired as part of the SABIC acquisition amounting to 
SAR 18,140 at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The impairment test was performed by aggregating the relevant cash-generating 
units. Cash flows were calculated in the same way as for the goodwill impairment test. The cash flows were discounted using 
the pre-tax discount rate of 10.9% (2021: 7.8%). As a result of the analysis, management did not identify any impairment.

Management believes that a 1% increase in the discount rates, a 1% decrease in the growth rate, or a reasonable range of 
increase or decrease in any of the other assumptions used for cash flow projections, individually, would not change the outcome 
of the impairment analysis for the goodwill or the brand.

8. Income taxes and zakat
(a) Kingdom income tax rates
The Company is subject to an income tax rate of 20% on its Downstream activities and on the activities of exploration and 
production of non-associated natural gas, including gas condensates, as well as the collection, treatment, processing, 
fractionation and transportation of associated and non-associated natural gas and their liquids, gas condensates and other 
associated elements. All other activities are subject to an income tax rate of 50%, in accordance with the Tax Law. The 20% 
income tax rate applicable to the Company’s Downstream activities, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, is conditional on 
the Company separating its Downstream activities under the control of one or more separate wholly owned subsidiaries before 
December 31, 2024, otherwise the Company’s Downstream activities will be retroactively taxed at 50%. The Company expects  
to transfer all its Downstream activities into a separate legal entity or entities within the period specified.

Additionally, according to the Tax Law, shares held directly or indirectly in listed companies on the Saudi Exchange by taxpayers 
engaged in oil and hydrocarbon activities are exempt from the application of corporate income tax. As a result, the Company’s 
ownership interests in such companies are subject to zakat.

The reconciliation of tax charge at the Kingdom statutory rates to consolidated tax and zakat expense is as follows:

2022 2021

Income before income taxes and zakat 1,152,962 769,521
Less: Income subject to zakat (24,682) (27,766)
Income subject to income tax 1,128,280 741,755

Tax effect of:
Income not subject to tax at statutory rates and other (1,497) (1,455)
Income tax expense 546,976 355,155
Zakat expense 1,981 1,970
Total income tax and zakat expense 548,957 357,125

(Note 34). 

A deferred income tax liability has not been recognized with regard to the undistributed earnings of certain subsidiaries, which 
are considered to be permanently reinvested in their respective businesses. Such earnings would be taxed only upon distribution. 
There was no material cumulative taxable undistributed earnings or unrecognized deferred income tax liability for such 
subsidiaries at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Also, a deferred income tax asset has not been recognized largely related to 
cumulative unused tax losses of certain subsidiaries with carry-forward periods from 2023 to indefinite. Such losses are available 
for offsetting against future taxable profits of the subsidiaries in which the losses arose. The cumulative amount of the unused 
tax losses and other items is SAR 41,178 and SAR 37,791 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the unrecognized 
deferred income tax asset is SAR 11,077 and SAR 9,296 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

8. Income taxes and zakat continued
(e) Income tax and zakat assessments
The Company and the majority of its affiliates are subject to tax review and audit in tax jurisdictions where they operate. In June 
2020, the Company and its wholly owned domestic affiliates were notified that the Saudi Arabian income tax submissions for all 
years up to and including the year ended December 31, 2019 were accepted as filed.

For the Company’s other domestic and international affiliates, examinations of tax and zakat returns for certain prior years had 
not been completed as of December 31, 2022; however, the Company is not aware of any significant claims. Therefore, no 
material provision for any additional income tax and zakat liability has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

Equity investments designated at FVOCI are not held for trading. Instead, they are held for medium to long-term strategic 
purposes. Accordingly, management has elected to designate these equity investments at FVOCI as recognizing short-term 
fluctuations in these investments’ fair value in net income would not be consistent with Saudi Aramco’s strategy of holding these 
investments for long-term purposes and realizing their performance potential in the long run.

The fair value of Sumed is based on expected cash flows discounted using a rate based on market interest rates and a risk 
premium specific to the unlisted security which was 16.1% and 11.35% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair 
value of TAQA is based on an earnings growth factor for unlisted equity securities from market information for similar types  
of companies. The fair value of Daehan is determined using discounted cash flow analysis based on the risk-adjusted yield.

10. Investments in securities continued
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date of the investments in debt securities is the fair value. To limit credit 
risk, Saudi Aramco’s investment policy requires that these securities be diversified. Credit ratings for debt securities held at 
December 31, 2022, range from AAA to BB (2021: AAA to BB) as set out by internationally recognized credit rating agencies.

The movement in investments in securities is as follows:

2022 2021

January 1 25,676 23,687
Net additions 3,002 1,252
Net unrealized fair value (loss) gain (918) 413

Net additions include unsettled transactions of SAR (33) at December 31, 2022 (2021: SAR (267)).

11. Inventories
2022 2021

Crude oil, refined products and chemicals 81,698 58,242

Net movement in allowance (234) 453
Balance, December 31 3,214 3,448

During 2022, a portion of the inventory purchased from third parties by certain affiliates amounting to SAR 1,759 (2021: nil) was 
written-down to its net realizable value.

12. Trade receivables
Trade receivables from export and local sales are denominated primarily in USD and SAR, respectively.

The components of trade receivables are as follows:

2022 2021

Arising from export and local sales at international prices 154,858 130,821
Arising from local sales at Kingdom regulated prices 9,865 9,817

164,723 140,638
Less: Loss allowance (281) (265)

164,442 140,373

Trade receivables relating to certain contracts with provisional pricing arrangements are measured at fair value. The fair value 
was calculated using forward curves and future prices. These trade receivables are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy 
(Note 3(d)) due to the inclusion of unobservable inputs, including counterparty credit risk in the fair value calculation.

As described in Note 2(o), the Government, through the Ministry of Finance, provided a guarantee to the Company in the event 
that certain Government, semi-Government and other entities with Government ownership or control are unable to settle within 
the terms agreed with the Company.

The movement of the allowance for trade receivables related to past due sales is as follows:

2022 2021

16. Treasury shares
On December 11, 2019, the Company acquired 117.2 million ordinary shares from the Government for cash consideration of  
SAR 3,750. These shares were classified by the Company as treasury shares for the purposes of issuing them to the Company’s 
employees upon vesting or purchase of the shares in the employee share plans, including those that the Company may adopt in 
the future. The number of treasury shares issued to employees during 2022 was 19.7 million (2021: 13.7 million) in relation to 
employee share plans (Note 17). Further, the number of treasury shares held by the Company increased by 8 million ordinary 
shares as a result of the issuance of bonus shares during 2022 (Note 36). The number of treasury shares outstanding  
as at December 31, 2022, was 76.6 million (2021: 88.3 million).

17. Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation relates to grants or issuance of ordinary shares awarded to the Company’s eligible employees under 
the respective plan terms. Awards are generally equity-settled; however, in limited circumstances awards may be settled in cash. 
The Company recognized the following share-based compensation expense in the consolidated statement of income, as an 
employee benefit expense, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Equity-settled Cash-settled Total

2022
Share-based compensation expense 296 3 299

2021
Share-based compensation expense 207 2 209

At December 31, 2022, the total carrying amount of the liabilities in respect of the cash settlement elements and dividend 
equivalents of the respective awards was SAR 20 (2021: SAR 17) and the intrinsic value of such liabilities, which had vested during 
the year, was SAR 5 (2021: SAR 3).

17. Share-based compensation continued
Awards granted or shares issued during the year relate to the Long-Term Incentive Plan for Executives (“ELTIP”) and the Long-
Term Incentive Plan for Management (“MLTIP”), the Long-Term Incentive Plan for certain other eligible employees (“LTIP”) and 
the Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).

Awards for all plans were granted for nil consideration, with the exception for ESPP, under which shares were issued at a discount 
of 20% to the fair market value of the shares at each purchase date. The fair values of awards granted were determined by 
reference to the market values of the Company’s ordinary shares on the grant dates for equity-settled awards and at the 
consolidated balance sheet date for cash-settled awards. Where applicable, the fair values of the awards subject to market-based 
performance measures were estimated using an appropriate valuation method.

The number of awards settled in shares during the year in relation to the employee share plans was 19.7 million  
(2021: 13.7 million).

Participants in the plans (other than the ESPP) are entitled to dividend equivalents, if dividends are paid to ordinary shareholders, 
during the vesting period. Such dividend equivalents will be paid in cash on vesting of the awards. Accordingly, no adjustment 
for expected dividends during the vesting period was made in determining the fair value of the awards. Participants in all plans 
become entitled to dividends only after shares have been issued to the participants as the registered holders.

The vesting of ELTIP is dependent on the achievement of (a) specified non-market and market-based performance measures over 
a three-year performance period, and (b) required service, except for certain qualifying leavers. Upon vesting, 50% of the vested 
awards are required to be held by the participants for an additional two years, except for certain qualifying leavers. The awards 
will be settled with the participants in shares on vesting.

The vesting of MLTIP is dependent on the participants achieving (a) specified individual performance targets over a one-year 
performance period, and (b) required service, except for certain qualifying leavers. The awards are subject to graded vesting. 
Twenty-five percent of the awards will vest after the end of the performance period, and the remaining 75% of the awards will 
vest in equal installments over three years from thereon, provided that the participants continue to meet the required service 
condition. The awards will be settled with the participants in shares on vesting, except for certain qualifying participants who  
will receive cash-settlement.

The vesting of LTIP is dependent only on the participants achieving required service, except for certain qualifying leavers. The 
awards are subject to graded vesting. Twenty-five percent of the awards will vest immediately, and the remaining 75% of the 
awards will vest in equal installments over three years, provided that the participants continue to meet the required service 
condition. The awards will be settled with the participants in shares on vesting, except for certain qualifying participants who  
will receive cash-settlement.

Shares issued under the ESPP are required to be held until the earlier of one year from the date of issuance or at the time of 
cessation of employment.

In addition, finance costs amounting to SAR 4,826 were capitalized in property, plant and equipment during the year ended 
December 31, 2022 (2021: SAR 3,285) (Note 5).

Borrowings – other than leases
Saudi Aramco has entered into long-term financing arrangements with various lenders. These financing arrangements limit the 
creation of additional liens and/or financing obligations and certain of these arrangements are secured over certain property, 
plant and equipment, and other non-current assets of Saudi Aramco with a total carrying value of SAR 95,018 (2021: SAR 94,379). 
Additionally, certain financing arrangements require compliance by Saudi Aramco with covenants to maintain certain financial 
and other conditions. Saudi Aramco has complied with these covenants throughout the reporting period. The fair value of 
borrowings excluding lease liabilities at December 31, 2022, was approximately SAR 319,910. This was mainly determined  
using inputs that are categorized in level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, except for the fair value of other financing 
arrangements that was primarily determined using level 3 inputs.

(a) Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration represents the amount payable to PIF for the SABIC acquisition in 2020. The amount is payable over 
several installments from August 2020 to April 2028, pursuant to a seller loan provided by PIF. On January 24, 2022, the 
Company, in agreement with PIF, made a partial prepayment of SAR 28,579 ($7,621), which reduced the principal amounts of  
two promissory notes payable on or before April 7, 2024 and April 7, 2026, by SAR 26,250 ($7,000) and SAR 3,750 ($1,000), 
respectively. In addition, on June 30, 2022, the Company made a second partial prepayment of SAR 38,192 ($10,185), which 
reduced the principal amount of a promissory note payable on or before April 7, 2025 by SAR 9,375 ($2,500) and further reduced 
the principal amount of the promissory note payable on or before April 7, 2026 by SAR 35,625 ($9,500). These partial 
prepayments resulted in a net gain of SAR 3,064 ($817), which was recognized in the consolidated statement of income.

amount under the arrangement is repayable in monthly installments, commencing from October 2021 to October 2046.

(i) Sukuk
A Sukuk is a financial instrument similar to a bond that complies with Islamic financing principles.

(i) On October 9, 2011, Saudi Aramco issued Sukuk for SAR 2,344 at par value, with semi-annual repayments from December 20, 
2014 to December 20, 2025 that provides a rate of return above SAIBOR. The Sukuk was structured as Istisnah for  
pre-construction and Ijarah for post-construction of the project.

(ii) On April 10, 2017, Saudi Aramco issued Sukuk for SAR 11,250 at par value as part of a SAR 37,500 program. The Sukuk 
issuance provides a return based on Saudi Arabian Interbank Offered Rate (“SAIBOR”) plus a predetermined margin  
payable semi-annually on April 10 and October 10. The Sukuk matures on April 10, 2024. In accordance with the terms  
of the Sukuk, 51% of the proceeds from issuance are invested in Mudaraba assets and the remaining 49% are used in  
a Murabaha arrangement.

(iii) On June 17, 2021, Saudi Aramco issued three tranches of USD denominated Sukuk trust certificates aggregating to an 
equivalent of SAR 22,500 ($6,000) at par value with semi-annual payments on June 17 and December 17. The Shari’a 
compliant senior unsecured certificates consist of three-year maturities for SAR 3,750 ($1,000) with a coupon rate of 0.946%, 
five-year maturities of SAR 7,500 ($2,000) with a coupon rate of 1.602% and 10-year maturities of SAR 11,250 ($3,000) with  
a coupon rate of 2.694%. In accordance with the terms of the Sukuk, 55% of the proceeds from issuance are structured as  
an Ijara and the remaining 45% are structured as a Murabaha arrangement. The certificates were listed on the London Stock 
Exchange’s Regulated Market and sold in accordance with Rule 144A/Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933,  
as amended. The proceeds are for general corporate purposes and the Sukuk mature between 2024 and 2031. At initial 
recognition, the Company recorded an amount of SAR 22,399 ($5,973) for the issuance proceeds, net of estimated  
transaction costs.

20. Borrowings continued
Borrowings – other than leases continued
(j) Murabaha
Saudi Aramco has various Murabaha Shari’a compliant borrowings from a number of financial intuitions. The borrowed amounts 
are repayable in semi-annual installments from 2008 to 2032. Commission is payable on amounts drawn and is calculated at  
a market rate plus a margin. In addition, Saudi Aramco also has access to unutilized Murabaha facilities of SAR 9,880, including  
the SAR denominated Islamic Murabaha facility of SAR 7,500 (Note 20(e)) (2021: SAR 11,625).

(k) Saudi Industrial Development Fund
Saudi Aramco has various borrowing agreements with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund. The amounts borrowed are not 
subject to periodic financial charges and are repayable in semi-annual installments from 2008 to 2035. As at December 31, 2022, 
an amount of SAR 48 (2021: SAR 115) was available for drawdown under these agreements.

In 2021, Saudi Aramco entered into a facility agreement with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund for an amount of  
SAR 1,200. The facility was fully drawn in 2021 and is repayable in semi-annual installments from 2026 to 2035.

(l) Ijarah/Procurement
Saudi Aramco has Procurement and Ijarah Shari’a compliant Islamic facility agreements with a number of banks. The facilities  
are repayable in semi-annual installments from 2014 to 2039.

In 2021, Saudi Aramco entered into new Ijarah Shari’a compliant Islamic facility agreements aggregating to SAR 1,542.  
The facilities are repayable in semi-annual installments from 2026 to 2028.

As at December 31, 2022, an amount of SAR 603 (2021: SAR 618) was undrawn under these facilities.

(m) Wakala
Saudi Aramco has Shari’a compliant Islamic facility agreements with a number of lenders. The facilities utilize a Wakala financing 
structure which is an agency arrangement. The facilities are repayable in installments on a semi-annual basis, from 2019 to 2036. 

In 2021, Saudi Aramco entered into a new Wakala facility agreement amounting to SAR 394. The facility is repayable in semi-
annual installments from 2026 to 2028. The total amount recognized as at December 31, 2022, was SAR 198 (2021: SAR 198).

An amount of SAR 271 was undrawn as at December 31, 2022 (2021: SAR 241), under these facilities.

Lease liabilities
Lease liabilities are effectively secured as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default. The lessor has 
ownership of the assets during the term of the contract and is typically responsible for the operation, insurance and maintenance 
of the assets until termination of the underlying agreements. For certain leases, the lessor shall transfer its rights, title and interest 
in the assets to the lessee on the last day of the agreements; for others, there are no further obligations on completion of 
agreements. Performance guarantees are provided by the lessor under the terms of the agreements.

The total cash outflow for leases for the year ended December 31, 2022, was SAR 12,114 (2021: SAR 12,143). Expenses relating to 
short-term and low value leases were recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022, 
and amounted to SAR 518 (2021: SAR 329) and SAR 261 (2021: SAR 403), respectively.

21. Post-employment benefits
Saudi Aramco sponsors or participates in several funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other post-
employment benefit plans that provide pension, severance, death, medical and other benefits to substantially all of its employees 
primarily in the Kingdom. The majority of the defined benefit plans for the Kingdom-based employees are governed under the 
Kingdom’s Labor Law, applicable benefit plan laws of the USA, and/or Company policies. Benefits to employees of group 
companies are provided based on local regulations and practices of the respective jurisdiction.

Retirement benefits for defined benefit pension plans are paid, primarily, in the form of lump sum payments upon retirement 
based on final salary and length of service. Other post-employment benefits such as medical are used to cover retired employees 
and eligible dependents of retirees for medical services in line with the plan policy documents.

At December 31, the net liability recognized for employee defined benefit plans in the consolidated balance sheet is as follows:

2022 2021

Pension plans (7,481) (1,384)
Medical and other post-employment benefit plans 11,370 42,113

21. Post-employment benefits continued
The components of net defined benefit cost, before tax, are primarily recognized in producing and manufacturing, and  
selling, administrative and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Remeasurements are included in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Net defined benefit cost and remeasurements for the years ended 
December 31 are as follows:

Pension benefits Other benefits
2022 2021 2022 2021

Amounts recognized in net income:
Current service cost 4,455 4,560 3,551 3,008

Net interest (income) cost (180) (26) 1,357 1,050

Losses from changes in demographic assumptions 12 80 5,501 1,448
(Gains) losses from changes in financial assumptions (23,044) (4,351) (50,212) 2,004
Losses from changes in experience adjustments 1,871 206 360 705
Returns on plan assets (excluding interest income) 13,965 (7,496) 15,360 (8,651)

(7,196) (11,561) (28,991) (4,494)
Net defined benefit (gain) loss before income taxes (2,748) (7,485) (24,083) 1,319

The present value of the defined benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis 
using a number of assumptions, based in part on market conditions. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying 
amount of the defined benefit obligations.

The significant assumptions used to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the years ended  
December 31 are as follows:

Pension benefits Other benefits
2022 2021 2022 2021

Discount rate 5.4% 2.9% 5.6% 3.1%
Salary growth rate 5.2% 4.7% – –
Annual average medical claim cost, in whole SAR 29,138 27,638
Health care participation rate 95.0% 95.0%
Assumed health care trend rates:

Cost-trend rate 6.5% 7.0%
Rate to which cost-trend is to decline 5.0% 5.0%
Year that the rate reaches the ultimate rate 2026 2026

All the above assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the defined 
benefit obligations.

Saudi Aramco determines the discount rate used to calculate the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to  
be required to settle the post-employment benefit plan obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, Saudi Aramco 
considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds in the USA that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of 
the related defined benefit obligation.

The salary growth rate assumption is based on a study of recent years’ salary experience and reflects management’s outlook  
for future increases. The annual average medical claim cost assumption is based on medical costs incurred in external medical 
providers, on behalf of the Company’s employees and retirees. The health care participation rate considers the historical 
participation rate, amongst others, derived from the best available historical data. The assumed health care cost-trend rates 
reflect Saudi Aramco’s historical experience and management’s expectations regarding future trends.

Mortality assumptions are reviewed regularly and set based on actuarial advice in accordance with best practice and statistics, 
adjusted to reflect the experience and improvements to longevity. Relevant life expectancies are as follows:

Saudi plans U.S. plans
Life expectancy at age: Male Female Male Female

50 33.6 36.3 35.6 37.4
60 24.4 26.7 26.4 27.8
60 (currently aged 40) 26.1 28.3 27.9 29.3

The sensitivity of the overall defined benefit obligations to changes in the principal assumptions, keeping all other assumptions 
constant, is presented below. The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit 
obligations as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation from one another.

Plan assets consist of the following:
2022 2021

Cash 5,381 5,584
Equity instruments 30,315 48,703
Investment funds 65,663 72,031
Bonds 55,500 52,324
Sukuk (Shari’a compliant) 1,804 2,175

158,663 180,817

Plan assets are administered under the oversight of the Company or one of its subsidiaries and managed by independent trustees 
or separate entities, in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles, acting in the best interest of plan 
participants. The objectives of the plans are to maximize investment returns consistent with prudent risk over a long-term 
investment horizon in order to secure retiree benefits and minimize corporate funding. 

All plan assets are held separately, solely to pay retiree benefits. Funded Saudi plans have the right to transfer assets held in 
excess of the plan’s defined benefit obligation to another funded Saudi plan. The right to transfer such assets is solely in respect 
of amounts held in excess of the plan’s defined benefit obligations and solely to plans with defined benefit obligations exceeding 
the value of assets held. Where Saudi Aramco has no rights to a refund of plan assets, surplus assets are recognized on the 
consolidated balance sheet on the basis that economic benefit can be gained through a reduction in future contributions.

Through its post-employment benefit plans, Saudi Aramco is exposed to a number of risks including asset volatility, changes  
in bond yields, inflation and life expectancy. Investment risk is minimized through diversification of investments among fixed 
income, equity, and alternative asset classes. Asset allocation is determined by an asset liability modeling study. The target asset 
allocation is, approximately, 25% (2021: 36%) equity instruments, 38% (2021: 31%) debt instruments, and 37% (2021: 33%) 
alternative assets. Inflation risk is partially offset by equities inflation and life expectancy risk is borne by Saudi Aramco.

Plan assets include transferable securities with a fair value of SAR 6,794 (2021: SAR 7,192) in the Company and its affiliated entities.

Employer contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be SAR 6,738 in 2023. While the Saudi plans are generally not 
governed by regulatory minimum funding requirements, the funding objective is to reach full funding of the larger plans only. 
Saudi Aramco pays annual contributions equal to benefit payments. Asset outperformance is expected to meet the shortfall 
between assets and the assessed liabilities within a reasonable period. Funding for the U.S. plans sponsored by Aramco Shared 
Benefit Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is recommended by the actuary in order to meet Saudi Aramco’s 
funding strategy to meet benefit plan expenses using applicable U.S. plan funding rules. Other plans follow local regulations  
or contractual obligations to meet minimum funding requirements.

In addition to the above plans, Saudi Aramco maintains or participates in defined contribution plans for which Saudi Aramco’s 
legal or constructive obligation is limited to the contributions. The costs of the defined contribution plans, which are included 
principally within producing and manufacturing, and selling, administrative and general expenses in the consolidated statement 
of income, are SAR 1,201 and SAR 1,634 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (Note 26).

22. Provisions and other liabilities
2022 2021

Asset retirement 17,568 18,296
Environmental 770 824
Financial liability – options and forward contracts 2,929 3,301
Other non-current liabilities 6,510 3,823

27,777 26,244

Asset retirement provisions relate to the future plugging and abandonment of oil and natural gas wells and the decommissioning 
of certain Downstream assets. The environmental provision is for the remediation of ground water and soil contamination. 
Payments to settle these provisions will occur on an ongoing basis and will continue over the lives of the operating assets, which 
can exceed 50 years for the time when it is necessary to abandon oil and natural gas wells. The amount and timing of settlement 
in respect of these provisions are uncertain and dependent on various factors that are not always within management’s control.

The movements in asset retirement and environmental provisions are as follows:

Service Reserve Account balance, which needs to be funded prior to June 2026.

In addition to the senior debt restructuring, effective March 25, 2021, the Company, Dow (and/or their affiliates) and Sadara have 
also entered into agreements to (i) provide additional feedstock by increasing the allocated quantity of ethane and natural 
gasoline supplied by Saudi Aramco, and (ii) gradually increase Saudi Aramco’s rights to market, through SABIC, its equity share of 
finished products produced by Sadara (subject to certain agreed terms) over the next five to 10 years. The Company has provided 
a guarantee for the payment and performance obligations of SABIC under the Product Marketing and Lifting Agreement.

On June 17, 2021, Excellent Performance Chemical Company (“EPCC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Sadara 
entered into a new SAR 1,500 subordinated revolving credit facility to provide shortfall funding to Sadara. As of December 31, 
2022, the facility was not utilized. Unless extended, the facility is scheduled to mature in June 2023. The unutilized amount of 
SAR 1,357 under the subordinated credit facility entered on June 17, 2013 has been cancelled.

With respect to Sadara’s fuel and feedstock allocation, Saudi Aramco has provided two letters of credit to the Ministry of Energy 
for SAR 169 and SAR 225, respectively, to construct epoxy plants and for the development of projects to support conversion 
industries in the Kingdom. In July 2021, the second letter of credit was reduced from SAR 225 to SAR 169 reflecting the sponsor 
payment for the Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide Pipeline project for Sadara. In April 2022, the second letter of credit was 
further reduced to SAR 152.

(b) Petro Rabigh
In March 2015, the two founding shareholders of Petro Rabigh, the Company and Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd., concluded 
external long-term debt financing arrangements with lenders on behalf of Petro Rabigh for the Rabigh II Project (“the Project”)  
in the amount of SAR 19,380 for which the two shareholders provided guarantees for their equal share of the debt financing  
(the “Completion Guarantees”). On September 30, 2020, Petro Rabigh achieved project completion under its senior finance 
agreements and, as a result, the founding shareholders were released from their obligations under the Completion Guarantees. 
As part of project completion, the founding shareholders entered into a debt service undertaking with the Rabigh II lenders, 
whereby each founding shareholder, on a several basis, undertakes to pay 50% of any shortfalls in scheduled (and not 
accelerated) Rabigh II debt service on each Rabigh II payment date until the earlier of the final Rabigh II repayment date in June 
2032 or the repayment of SAR 5,625 of the outstanding equity bridge loans. The semi-annual scheduled principal debt service 
under the Rabigh II financing is approximately SAR 622.

The founding shareholders arranged equity bridge loans (“the EBLs”) in an aggregate amount of SAR 11,250 which the founding 
shareholders guarantee on a several and equal basis, to meet the equity financing requirements under the senior finance 
agreements. Upon closing of the rights issuance (Note 32(c)), Petro Rabigh repaid SAR 1,940 of its equity bridge loans out of  
the proceeds of the rights issuance. The maturity date for the remaining EBLs of SAR 9,310 was extended to March 20, 2023. 

On September 30, 2020, Petro Rabigh entered into revolving loan facilities in an aggregate amount of SAR 5,625 with the 
Company and Sumika Finance Company Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. Unless extended, 
these facilities will mature in December 2023. As of December 31, 2022, an amount of SAR 2,175 was outstanding under these 
facilities, of which the Company’s share was SAR 1,088. Petro Rabigh also entered into another revolving loan facility for SAR 
1,875 with the Company, which, unless extended, matures in December 2023. As at December 31, 2022, no amount was utilized 
under this facility.

(c) Other
Saudi Aramco has provided guarantees of SAR 2,110 (2021: SAR 4,151) in relation to borrowings and other obligations of certain 
other affiliates, arising in the ordinary course of business.

34. Sale of equity interests in affiliates 
(a) Power and Water Utility Company for Jubail and Yanbu (“Marafiq”)
On November 24, 2022, Marafiq, an associate of Saudi Aramco, announced the listing of its shares on the Main Market of the 
Saudi Exchange following the successful completion of its IPO. The IPO comprised shares offered by the majority shareholders of 
Marafiq, including Saudi Aramco Power Company and SABIC, in proportion to their shareholding. Following the completion of 
the IPO, the aggregate equity ownership of the aforementioned Saudi Aramco subsidiaries in Marafiq reduced from 49.6% to 
35%, resulting in proceeds of SAR 1,651 and a gain of SAR 464. The carrying value of the investment in Marafiq in the 
consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022, was SAR 3,020 (December 31, 2021: SAR 3,924).

(b) Aramco Gas Pipelines Company (“AGPC”)
On February 23, 2022, the Company sold a 49% equity interest in AGPC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Company, to GreenSaif Pipelines Bidco S.à r.l. (formerly, GEPIF III Finance III Lux S.à r.l.) (“GreenSaif”) for upfront proceeds of SAR 
58,125 ($15,500) in cash.

GreenSaif is an entity owned by a consortium of investors led by affiliates of BlackRock Real Assets and Hassana Investment 
Company, the investment management arm of the General Organization for Social Insurance (“GOSI”) in the Kingdom. GreenSaif, 
as a shareholder of AGPC, is entitled to receive quarterly distributions of its pro rata share of AGPC’s available cash when the 
Company pays discretionary dividends to its ordinary shareholders. Given the discretionary nature of distributions to GreenSaif,  
in line with the principles outlined in Note 2(e), GreenSaif’s shareholding represents a non-controlling interest and, therefore,  
the upfront sale proceeds are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as a non-controlling interest within equity.

Immediately prior to the closing of the transaction, the Company leased the usage rights to its gas pipelines network to AGPC  
for a 20-year period. Concurrently, AGPC granted the Company the exclusive right to use, operate and maintain the pipelines 
network during the 20-year period in exchange for a quarterly, volume-based tariff payable by the Company to AGPC.  
The tariff is backed by minimum volume commitments. The Company will at all times retain title to, and operational control  
of, the pipelines.

(c) Aramco Oil Pipelines Company (“AOPC”)
On June 17, 2021, the Company sold a 49% equity interest in AOPC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,  
to EIG Pearl Holdings S.à r.l. (“EIG”) for upfront sale proceeds of SAR 46,547 ($12,412) in cash.

EIG is an entity owned by a consortium of investors led by EIG Global Energy Partners. EIG, as a shareholder of AOPC, is entitled 
to receive quarterly distributions of its pro rata share of AOPC’s available cash when the Company pays discretionary dividends  
to its ordinary shareholders. Given the discretionary nature of distributions to EIG, in line with the principles outlined in Note 2(e), 
EIG’s shareholding represents a non-controlling interest and, therefore, the upfront sale proceeds have been recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements as a non-controlling interest within equity.

Immediately prior to the closing of the transaction, the Company leased the usage rights to its stabilized crude oil pipelines 
network to AOPC for a 25-year period. Concurrently, AOPC granted the Company the exclusive right to use, operate and 
maintain the pipelines network during the 25-year period in exchange for a quarterly, volume-based tariff payable by the 
Company to AOPC. The tariff is backed by minimum volume commitments. The Company will at all times retain title to, and 
operational control of, the pipelines.

35. Investments in affiliates
(a) Investments in subsidiaries
(i) Grupa LOTOS S.A. transaction
On January 12, 2022, Aramco Overseas Company B.V. (“AOC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Saudi Aramco, entered into share 
purchase agreements with Grupa LOTOS Spółka Akcyjna (“Grupa LOTOS S.A.”), a subsidiary of Polski Koncern Naftowy ORLEN 
S.A. (“PKN ORLEN”), to purchase shares in certain entities of Grupa LOTOS S.A. Under this transaction, AOC acquired 100% 
equity interest in LOTOS SPV 1 Sp. z o.o. for a cash consideration of SAR 930 ($248), in addition to acquiring 30% of the issued 
share capital of LOTOS Asfalt sp. z o.o. and 50% of the issued share capital of LOTOS-Air BP Polska sp. z o.o. for SAR 889 ($237) 
(Note 35(c)). These acquisitions are in line with Saudi Aramco’s strategy of expanding its downstream presence in Europe and 
further expanding its crude imports into Poland.

Prior to completion of the transaction, an organized part of the wholesale business operated by LOTOS Paliwa sp. z o.o. (“LOTOS 
Paliwa”), a subsidiary of Grupa LOTOS S.A., was transferred to LOTOS SPV 1 Sp. z o.o., subsequently renamed as Aramco Fuels 
Poland sp. z o.o. (“AFP”). AFP is engaged in the acquisition, storage, blending, marketing, transportation, distribution and the 
sale of fuel to wholesale customers.

The closing of the transaction occurred on November 30, 2022. The transaction resulted in Saudi Aramco obtaining control of 
AFP. Saudi Aramco accounts for acquisitions of subsidiaries using the acquisition method of accounting. This requires recognition 
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition date.

Saudi Aramco engaged an independent valuer in order to determine the fair value of the assets and liabilities of AFP as part of 
the purchase price allocation process. Based on the preliminary fair values of the total identifiable net assets and liabilities of  
SAR 909, including cash acquired of SAR 513, goodwill of SAR 21 has been recognized.

(a) Investments in subsidiaries continued
Acquisition and transaction costs of SAR 37 were expensed as selling, administrative, and general expenses in the consolidated 
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Post-acquisition, AFP contributed revenues of SAR 2,043 and net profit of SAR 14, which is included in the consolidated statement 
of income.

(ii) SABIC Agri-Nutrients Investment Company (“SANIC”)
On January 4, 2021, SABIC Agri-Nutrients Company (“SABIC AN”), formerly Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Company (“SAFCO”), 
acquired 100% of the issued share capital of SANIC from SABIC. The total value of shares in SANIC is set at SAR 4,809, the 
consideration for which was paid by issuing 59,368,738 ordinary new shares in SABIC AN to SABIC valued at SAR 81 per share, 
thereby increasing the ownership by SABIC of SABIC AN from 43% to 50.1%. Under the terms of the transaction, the settlement 
of working capital and net debt at SANIC since the transaction date, amounted to SAR 2. A net loss of SAR 677 arising from this 
transaction has been recognized in retained earnings, which represents Saudi Aramco’s share of the loss recorded by SABIC.

(b) Investments in joint operations
Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company (“JIGPC”)
On September 27, 2021, Saudi Aramco entered into an arrangement with Air Products, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra 
relating to the Jazan Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (“IGCC”) power plant, an Air Separation Unit (“ASU”) and certain 
ancillary assets (together, “the facility”). The transaction entailed creation of JIGPC, a limited liability company, with SAPCO, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company owning 20%, while Air Products, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra own 46%, 25% 
and 9%, respectively. JIGPC will operate the facility under a 25-year contract for a predetermined monthly fee. Saudi Aramco will 
supply feedstock to JIGPC, and JIGPC will produce power, steam, hydrogen and other utilities for Saudi Aramco. The transaction 
has been accounted for as a financing arrangement and the assets remain in the books of the Company. Based on the facts and 
circumstances, including the source of cash flows as well as the purpose and design of the arrangement, in line with the 
principles outlined in Note 2(e), JIGPC has been accounted for as a joint operation by Saudi Aramco.

SAPCO’s total contribution in JIGPC, as a shareholder, is expected to be SAR 3,600, of which an amount of SAR 3,443 has been 
contributed as of the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. The financial close of the transaction occurred on 
October 27, 2021. The total proceeds of the transaction are SAR 44,063, of which, the Company received the first tranche of SAR 
18,386, net of the ASU purchase consideration of SAR 8,146. The ASU, which was previously accounted for as a lease, was 
purchased by the Company and transferred with the rest of the facility as part of the closing. The second tranche of SAR 15,563 
was received on January 19, 2023, with the remaining amount of SAR 1,968 expected to be received by the end of 2023 (Notes 
20(h), 40).

(c) Investments in joint ventures and associates
Grupa LOTOS S.A. transaction
On November 30, 2022, AOC acquired 30% of the issued share capital of LOTOS Asfalt sp. z o.o., subsequently renamed as 
Rafineria Gdańska sp. z o.o. (“POLREF”), for SAR 853 ($227). The remaining 70% of the equity interest is held by PKN ORLEN 
(Note 35(a)(i)). The investment in POLREF has been accounted for as an associate. POLREF operates an oil refinery located in 
Gdańsk, Poland. Post-acquisition, the refinery processes the crude oil supplied by PKN ORLEN and AFP into finished products,  
in exchange for a processing fee.

In addition, on November 30, 2022, AOC acquired 50% of the issued share capital of LOTOS-Air BP Polska sp. z o.o., subsequently 
renamed as Air BP Aramco Poland sp. z o.o. (“AIRBP”), for SAR 36 ($10). The remaining 50% of the issued share capital of AIRBP  
is retained by BP Europa SE (Note 35(a)(i)). The investment in AIRBP has been accounted for as a joint venture. The business of 
AIRBP includes acquisition, storage, transport, distribution and sale of aviation fuels in bulk or having them delivered into 
aircrafts in and outside of Poland.

1. Dividends of SAR 70,331 paid in 2022 relate to 2021 results. Dividends of SAR 70,325 paid in 2021 relate to 2020 results.

2. Dividend per share reflects the effect of the issuance of the bonus shares approved on May 12, 2022, as described below. 

3. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect a dividend to shareholders of approximately SAR 73,150, which was declared on March 10, 2023 (March 18, 2022: SAR 70,331). 
This dividend will be deducted from unappropriated retained earnings in the year ending December 31, 2023. 

On May 12, 2022, after obtaining necessary approvals from the competent authorities, the Extraordinary General Assembly 
(“EGA”) approved the increase of the Company’s share capital by SAR 15,000 and the commensurate increase of the number of 
the Company’s issued ordinary shares by 20 billion without par value. Such increase was effected through capitalization of the 
Company’s retained earnings. Each shareholder was granted one (1) bonus share for every ten (10) shares owned. The Company’s 
share capital after the increase is SAR 75,000, divided into 220 billion fully paid ordinary shares with equal voting rights without 
par value.

On March 10, 2023, the Board of Directors recommended to the EGA to increase the Company’s share capital by granting bonus 
shares to its shareholders through capitalization of SAR 15,000 from retained earnings and by increasing the number of the 
issued ordinary shares by 22 billion without par value. The increase of the share capital and the number of ordinary shares is 
subject to obtaining necessary approvals from competent authorities and the EGA, which will be announced later as per 
regulatory requirements. Once the EGA approves the capital increase, eligible shareholders will be entitled to receive one (1) 
bonus share for every ten (10) shares owned, and the Company’s share capital will increase to SAR 90,000, divided into 242 billion 
fully paid ordinary shares with equal voting rights without par value.

37. Earnings per share
The following table reflects the net income and number of shares used in the earnings per share calculations:

2022 2021

Net income attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company 597,215 395,203

Weighted average number of ordinary shares (in millions) (Note 2(dd))1 219,913 219,897

Earnings per share for net income attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company (in Saudi Riyals)1 2.72 1.80

1. Earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been calculated by retrospectively adjusting the weighted average number of outstanding shares to 
reflect the effect of the issuance of bonus shares approved on May 12, 2022 (Note 36).

Potential ordinary shares during the year ended December 31, 2022, related to employees’ share-based compensation in respect 
of employee share plans that were awarded to the Company’s eligible employees under those plan terms (Note 17). These share 
plans did not have a significant dilution effect on basic earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

6. Under liquidation.

40. Events after the reporting period
(a) Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company (“JIGPC”)
On January 19, 2023, Saudi Aramco received SAR 15,563 in respect of the second tranche of the financing arrangement with 
JIGPC (Notes 20(h), 35(b)). The remaining amount of SAR 1,968 under the financing arrangement is expected to be received  
by the end of 2023.

(b) Valvoline Inc.’s global products business
On March 1, 2023, Aramco Overseas Company B.V. (“AOC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the transaction 
for the acquisition of a 100% equity interest in Valvoline Inc.’s global products business (“VGP Holdings LLC”). The purchase price 
is SAR 9,938 ($2,650) in cash, subject to certain customary adjustments. VGP Holdings LLC is a leading worldwide independent 
producer and distributor of premium branded automotive, commercial and industrial lubricants, and automotive chemicals. This 
strategic acquisition will complement Saudi Aramco’s line of premium branded lubricant products, optimize its global base oils 
production capabilities, and expand its own research and development activities and partnerships with original equipment 
manufacturers.

The transaction resulted in Saudi Aramco obtaining control of VGP Holdings LLC. Saudi Aramco accounts for acquisitions of 
subsidiaries using the acquisition method of accounting. This requires recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at 
fair value as of the acquisition date. Due to the timing of the acquisition, the initial accounting for the business combination has 
not been completed at the time the consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance.

(c) Private Sector Partnership Reinforcement Program (“Shareek”)
On March 1, 2023, it was announced that Saudi Aramco executed the Shareek Support Framework Agreement (the 
“Agreement”) with Shareek. The Agreement sets out the eligibility conditions that Saudi Aramco would need to satisfy in order 
to voluntarily apply for and receive incentives from Shareek. Saudi Aramco intends to utilize these incentives to expand its 
business and strengthen its supply chain in the Kingdom. To maintain eligibility for Shareek incentives, Saudi Aramco would need 
to, among other conditions, deploy certain of its capital and operational expenditure in the Kingdom until 2030. Any incentives 
received are subject to such eligibility conditions being met.

(d) Partial prepayment of deferred consideration to PIF
On March 7, 2023, the Company agreed with PIF to make a third partial prepayment of SAR 59,040 ($15,744) on or before March 
15, 2023. This partial prepayment will fully reduce the outstanding principal amount of SAR 13,125 ($3,500) of the promissory 
note payable on or before April 7, 2024, and will partially reduce the outstanding principal amounts of the promissory notes 
payable on or before April 7, 2025, and April 7, 2026, by SAR 14,438 ($3,850) and SAR 21,562 ($5,750), respectively. The 
outstanding amounts of the loan charge promissory notes payable between 2024 and 2028, aggregating to SAR 18,375 ($4,900), 
will also be fully reduced (Note 20). This partial prepayment will result in a gain of approximately SAR 4,635 ($1,236).
