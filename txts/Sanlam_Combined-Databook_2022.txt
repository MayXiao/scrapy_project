Reaching your full potential and pursuing a life of 
personal excellence in times of uncertainty

As I reflect on the theme of the 2022 Sanlam Benchmark research, I am reminded of the 
science – and art – of personal excellence found within the practices of Neuro-linguistic 
Programming (NLP). 

An approach to personal development, NLP ultimately speaks to the difference 
between excellence and average. As we strive for excellence, we make sense of 
information and understand it before acting on it. Then, using words, we communicate 
our understanding and actions. This is what separates actions that produce the mere 
average, from those that produce the truly excellent outputs.

H e a l t h c a re
“It is health that is the real wealth, and not pieces 
of gold and silver.” 
- Mahatma Gandhi

As employers take the holistic needs of employees into 
consideration, employee benefits will increasingly marry 
healthcare, wealthcare and selfcare. Health – both physical 
and mental – is taking centre stage, particularly within the 
context of a tough economic environment.

While there are visible shifts in the Employer Value 
Proposition (EVP) and how employees view work in their 
lives, both employers and employees have ideas in mind 
about the kind of holistic benefits needed in this post-
pandemic age. 

Let’s be clear: The ‘Great Resignation’ of the US and parts 
of Europe is not really a South African phenomenon. Quite 
the contrary. Having a job and an income has become a new 
asset class in South Africa. Many households experienced 
multiple financial impacts of the pandemic through either 
reduced income, retrenchment, forced unpaid leave or a 
sabbatical, and loss of a family member and their income.

Understandably, holding on to a job holds immense value. 
However, as much as employees value their jobs, they expect 
more from it in terms of ensuring their holistic well-being. In 
response, significant numbers of respondents – among both 
employer funds and umbrella funds – indicated that their 
value proposition takes a holistic view of the employee as a 
professional and family person and offers a wide range of 
financial and healthcare benefits.

NLP strikes a chord with 
me in its attitude of acting 
guided by curiosity and 
sense making, rather than 
assumption. It is that curiosity, 
the desire to understand the 
employee benefits industry 
and context we are in, which 
informs the actions we need 
to take as we envision a new 
tomorrow.

Much like NLP, the Sanlam 
Benchmark research is a 
system of interdependent 
studies underpinned by 
a curiosity about and 
fascination with consumer 
behaviour and decision 
making. This curiosity is 
essential as we aim to capture 
the burning issues facing 
retirement funds, current 
clients and retirees in the 
country.

If there is a difference 
between the Sanlam 
Benchmark research and the 
principles of NLP, it is that 
our research is premised 
on several assumptions. 
These assumptions inform 
our analytical process as 
we seek to understand 
individual consumer needs 
and circumstances. The aim 
of the research, ultimately, is 
to identify and focus on those 
attributes that could lead to 
a life of personal excellence 
rather than produce merely 
average outcomes.

One of the key insights 
to come out of the 2022 
research is that in the wake 
of the uncertainty of the 
COVID-19 pandemic job 
security goes hand in hand 
with holistic care. The sudden 
loss of jobs, or even just the 
fear of losing incomes, has 
put an existential strain on the 
mental health of South Africa. 

We a l t h c a re
“An investment in knowledge pays the best 
interest.”
- Benjamin Franklin

The welfare of our environment is equally important for 
social and economic well-being. Hence, sustainability is 
slowly becoming a priority, given that the retirement fund 
industry has a key role to play in driving environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) concerns. Retirement fund assets 
pack a substantial financial punch, as globally they make up 
most of the assets in South Africa but are exposed to ESG 
risks such as those posed by climate change and inequality. 
The urgency to put in place measures to reduce and manage 
these risks cannot be overstated. 



Benchmark Survey 2022  Combined Databook 5

The 2022 research explores the 
extent to which South African 
retirement funds have incorporated 
ESG strategies in their investment 
mandates. After all, the primary 
goal of retirement funds remains to 
provide members with secure future 
incomes. And retirement funds are well 
positioned to actively engage on ESG 
issues and set the tone for a transition 
to a low-carbon, climate-resilient 
economy.

Retirement reform and legislation 
also continue to inform and shape the 
future direction of the industry. Among 
the most significant regulations that 
have been in the headlines over the 
past year have been the National 
Treasury’s proposed two-pot system, 
the tightening of the governance 
of umbrella funds, and changes to 
the Policyholder Protection Rules. 
Our research highlights some of the 
polarised views consumers have 
regarding the long-term financial 
impact of the proposed two-pot 
system. We observe that at least one 
third of employees are unfamiliar with 
the employee benefits provided by 
their employers. 

This is worrying, as NLP highlights 
that a lack of knowledge and 
understanding prevents individuals 
from reaching their full potential 
and pursuing a life of personal 
excellence. It is through knowledge 
and understanding that people are 
empowered to adopt the kinds of 
financial habits needed to enable them 
to retire with confidence. 

Indeed, several Umbrella Fund 
sponsors in the research recognised 
that improving communication was 
critical for imparting knowledge and 
understanding to ensure positive 
retirement outcomes for members. 
In this regard, it is also encouraging 
to find that employees are seeking 

S e l f c a re
“All that we are is the result of what we have 
thought. The mind is everything. What we think 
we become.”
- Buddha

If our value proposition is to offer an integrated holistic 
solution to retirement products, then selfcare refers to the 
need to understand and appreciate that individuals place 
their physical, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being at 
the centre of all life decisions. The pandemic has brought 
about new way of work, and a new perspective on life.

Selfcare can also be aided by instilling confidence in the 
knowledge and understanding of information presented 
to us. When people feel that they can make sense of 
information, they have more confidence to act on it.  

With the past two years serving as painful reminders of 
the interconnectedness between wealthcare, healthcare 
(physical and mental) and selfcare, in our pursuit of 
wealthcare we must be guided by the need for greater 
humanity. The pursuit of personal excellence, rather than just 
the average, for our members has always been a byword 
for Sanlam. That principle remains unchanged even as we 
reimagine a new tomorrow out of what has come before. 
Just as our members face a reshaping of the world and new 
ways of work, so too the context has changed for us. We 
understand, as employers do, that retirement now means 
more than just having the necessary financial resources. Now 
more than ever, wealthcare is intricately tied to healthcare 
and selfcare in this new tomorrow.

We hope that in going through the findings of our 2022 
Sanlam Benchmark research you will see that personal 
excellence remains our rallying cry. 

As always, my team has unpacked this year’s research with 
great curiosity and a sense of exploration. I trust that you 
will find their insights valuable as you navigate the uncertain 
times of a new way of work and living. At Sanlam we remain 
committed to members’ journey to retire with confidence, 
while remaining resilient in the face of uncertainty. 

to improve their understanding of the benefits available to 
them. More and more members are engaging with their 
retirement benefits through digital platforms.

RESEARCH 
METHODOLOGY 

Wagieda Pather 
Head: Market Insights
Sanlam Corporate

We now have nine years of data to analyse since 
we first included a subset of 10 union funds 
in the stand-alone survey. These 10 funds this 
year represent a total of R57.2 billion in assets 
in respect of 635,691 members. Average asset 
size is R5.72 billion this year (with a 5-year 
average of R7.1 billion in 2017-2022). The year-on 
year participation of the union sample remains 
impressive at 70%.

Membership sizes have fluctuated over the past 
five years, averaging at around 64,000 members. 

We have analysed the data for the union funds 
separately and have not reported on it in this 
databook. However, the data is available on 
request and we provide a synopsis of the survey 
results in the Research Summary Report.  

Respondents for both stand-alone and 
participating employers in umbrella funds 
surveys were selected at random and it may be 
possible that some funds included in the survey 
may currently be funds which are administered 
or consulted to by Sanlam. Some participants 
may even have assets invested with Sanlam 
Investments. As it is not a requirement of the 
study, we did not select respondents on the basis 
of their current retirement fund service provider. 

The entire fieldwork process is outsourced to 
BDRC Africa, a leading market research agency.  
This is to ensure the integrity of the data and the 
confidentiality of all respondents is maintained at 
all times.  

The size and the 
scope of the 2022 
stand-alone funds and 
participating employers 
in umbrella funds 
surveys have remained 
largely consistent with 
2021. Interviews were 
conducted amongst 
83 principal officers 
and trustees of stand-
alone retirement funds 
and 100 key liaison 
persons at participating 
employers. 



Benchmark Survey 2022  Combined Databook 7

Interview technique
Interviews were conducted via Zoom 
each lasting approximately 30 minutes. 
Fieldwork took place over a five-week 
period from 31 March to 8 May 2022.

Sample composition
In total we conducted 183 interviews 
and once again, we received 
overwhelming year-on-year survey 
participation by 61% of standalone 
funds and 57% of umbrella sub-funds.

This year only 1 fund who participated 
in the standalone survey in 2021 
was interviewed as umbrella fund 
participants this year. This confirms the 
trend of conversion from stand-alone 
to umbrella funds albeit evidence that 
this is now slowing down. 

Respondents were selected at random 
with a specific quota control to ensure 
that samples were statistically and 
demographically representative of the 
retirement fund industry. 

One of the questions we often receive 
is whether the sample size is sufficient 
and robust enough to make accurate 
statistical inferences on the employed 
population. The simple answer is that 
a sample size of 100 for institutional 

research will produce an approximate margin of sampling 
error that is within a 6% to 10% range, and with a 95% 
confidence level. Which suggests that the sample size we’ve 
selected is robust and the conclusions drawn credible.

We are satisfied that the sample size for this study meets 
statistical analysis requirements.

Data tables and graphs
The tables and graphs in this report are based on 83 (stand-
alone) and 100 (participating employers in umbrella funds) 
responses. In some instances the sample responses are ≠ 100. 
Where: 

 the number of responses is less than 100, the question 
was not applicable to all respondents

 the number of responses is greater than 100, the 
question allowed for multiple responses

Caution: Data should be used with care, particularly where 
the number of responses is <30, as this is considered 
statistically insufficient to draw any meaningful industry 
conclusions at a quantitative level.
