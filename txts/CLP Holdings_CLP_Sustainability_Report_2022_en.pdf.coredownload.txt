Welcome to CLPʼs 
2022 Sustainability 
Report

Chairman and 
CEO message

While governments around the world began to relax their 
COVID-19 restrictions in 2022, rising geopolitical tensions 
created shockwaves over the year, exacerbating inequality on 
a wide scale and forcing the world into ever more uncertainty.

The energy sector was especially hard hit by the impacts of 
the Russia-Ukraine war, which has led to profound impacts 
on global energy markets, including price volatility, supply 
shortage, and energy security issues.

To better understand the risks and opportunities that may 
arise from this global energy crisis and from this evolving 
operating environment, CLP continued to adopt a double 
materiality approach to assess its business sustainability from 
financial and impact perspectives.

Financially material topics which may be of most interest 
to investors and other stakeholders are discussed in the 
Annual Report; impact material topics which reflect positive or 
negative impacts on people, the environment and the economy 
are covered in this Sustainability Report.

In 2022, CLP refined its materiality assessment process with an 
updated methodology for identifying and assessing risks and 
opportunities in a systematic approach. This helps to ensure 
that strategy and purpose remain aligned, stakeholders' 
needs are responded to, emerging environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) risks and opportunities are better identified, 
and full transparency is maintained in reporting.

By aligning this Sustainability Report with the Annual 
Report, CLP aims to help stakeholders, in particular our 
customers, people, partners and the wider community, find 
the information they seek. Links to related sections of the 
Annual Report are provided. To address the growing interest in 
climate-related responses, CLP has also prepared a standalone 
Climate-related Disclosures Report.

We hope you find our reports insightful, informative and 
thought-provoking. Feedback on this report is welcome, 
and can be sent through CLP’s online survey or via 
email (srfeedback@clp.com.hk).

Chairman and 
CEO message

“Looking back, the year of 2022 was largely 
defined by the conflict in Ukraine and its related 
energy crisis, as well as the lingering impact of 
the pandemic. With rising inflation and interest 
rates, it has become one of the most economically 
challenging years in recent history. We all have 
been dealing with the impact in varying degrees.”
The Honourable Sir Michael Kadoorie, Chairman (left) and 
Richard Lancaster, Chief Executive Officer (right)

As we hope for an end to these crises, we remain focused on 
decarbonising and digitalising our operations while supporting 
our customers and communities. We also work closely with 
partners, policy makers and other stakeholders to make 
energy transition a reality.

Transitioning to net zero
To grow our business for the long term, we must continue 
our move towards net zero to play our part in addressing the 
global challenge of climate change. In 2022, we remained on 
track to achieve our targets set in our Climate Vision 2050.

In line with our commitment to phase out coal-based assets 
before 2040, we divested our 70% stake in the coal-fired 
Fangchenggang Power Station in Guangxi, Mainland China. 
The decision came after a thorough review of options and 

with the objective to free up capital for us to further invest in 
renewable energy projects while ensuring the much-needed 
power reliability and job security in the community concerned. 
Going ahead, we will continue to engage with governments, 
business partners and relevant stakeholders to support an 
orderly transition for our legacy coal-fired assets.

In the meantime, our renewable energy portfolio has 
continued to deliver steadily. The Qian’an III wind project in 
Jilin province began commercial operations in 2022 and other 
renewable energy projects including the Xundian II and Bobai 
wind farms, as well as the Yangzhou Gongdao and Guangdong 
Mazhang solar plants, also in Mainland China, have made good 
progress. All five projects are grid-parity that do not rely on 
government subsidies. In India, the new Sidhpur wind farm is 
expected to be fully commissioned by June 2023.

Bolstering energy security and reliability
As we decarbonise our operations, we also make it a priority to 
provide customers with reliable and reasonably priced energy. 
In Hong Kong, we believe maintaining investment under the 
next five-year Development Plan leading up to 2028 will be 
important for the city’s energy security and reliability, which 
are delivered through diversification.

That is why CLP has brought nuclear power to Hong 
Kong across the border since decades ago and recently 
invested in additional capacity at gas-fired Black Point 
Power Station. The offshore LNG terminal, which began 
construction long before the current energy crisis, will prove 
even more strategically significant than initially imagined. 
The infrastructure underlines the importance of long-term 
planning in the energy industry where investments often take 
years to materialise and last for decades. On the other hand, 
early planning also affords sufficient time for us to repurpose 
existing facilities as a cost-effective and flexible way to lower 
emissions, as we pay close attention to the growing potential 
of hydrogen in facilitating the energy transition. 

In Australia, we continued to invest in new forms of on-
demand generation capacity and flexible assets which play an 
important role alongside renewables. We have partnered with 
Edify Energy on two new battery projects in New South Wales 
and we are studying a grid-scale 500MW battery project at our 
existing site at Mount Piper Power Station.

Creating value for stakeholders
In our energy transition journey, we take on board the needs 
of our customers, employees and the wider community. Our 
future is not just one where we are suppliers and producers 
of energy, but where we provide elevated service to support 
customers to meet their energy demand, make better energy 
choices and find solutions to meet their own sustainability 
targets. Our strategy to evolve the business into an Energy-as-
a-Service model is another example of us looking ahead and 
preparing ourselves to be sustainable for generations to come.

By investing in an agile, innovative workforce, we are building 
the team that can thrive through this period of evolution. CLP 
has a proud history and enduring legacy on which the coming 
decades will be built. We continue to develop new skills to put 
us at the forefront of our industry’s transition.

To realise our ambition, we collaborate with our suppliers. 
In December, we rolled out a new Supplier Code of Conduct 
which sets out our expectations of suppliers and reflects 
international standards. It encompasses key sustainability 
topics including environmental management, climate change, 
as well as labour practices and human rights.

Reinforcing resilience
We understand our critical role in ensuring a reliable power 
supply for the community and economy. To this end, during 
the past year, we continued to build our climate and cyber 
resilience in view of the changing operating environment. 
As part of our efforts, we launched an asset management 
standard to guide climate-related risk assessments and 
adaptation practices for our generation and network assets 
in Hong Kong. This went hand in hand with our continuous 
studies in assessing our climate risks and adaptation approach. 
To further protect our power systems, we also undertook a 
comprehensive review of our cyber security strategy to help 
manage potential challenges.

Our transformation into a Utility of the Future is well 
underway. Our strategy, underpinned by our core values with 
a clear path to net zero, is central to how we manage our 
business regardless of the external shocks and unexpected 
macroeconomic changes in the current environment.

As we hope for a 2023 of less conflict and more stability, 
we maintain our primary focus on decarbonisation and 
sustainable energy solutions in Hong Kong and Mainland 
China with disciplined presence elsewhere. By investing 
strategically, in partnership where appropriate, we can 
deliver against the growth opportunities and continue 
our transformation.

CLP recognises the diversity of methodologies used globally 
to measure the sustainability performance of organisations. 
This report references several reporting guidelines and 
frameworks to ensure comparability – an approach aligned 
with international best practice.

IFRS Foundation’s International Sustainability 
Standards Board
The investor-focused sustainability disclosure organisation 
Climate Disclosure Standard Board (CDSB) and Value 
Reporting Foundation (VRF), arising from the merger of 
the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and 
the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), 
consolidated into the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) Foundation in June 2022, to support the 
development of new International Sustainability Standards 
Board (ISSB) standards.

In March 2022, the Exposure Drafts IFRS S1 General 
Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related 
Financial Information (General Requirements Exposure Draft) 
and IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (Climate Exposure 
Draft) were published and marked an important step 
forward in responding to capital providers’ needs for 
comparable, consistent and reliable sustainability-related 
disclosures.  As a long-time preparer of sustainability reports 
and integrated annual reports, CLP provided feedback on the 
consultation paper and made reference to certain disclosures 
where appropriate.  

For its 2022 Annual and Sustainability Reports, CLP references 
the suite of tools currently available, namely the Integrated 
Thinking Principles and the SASB Standards for Electric 
Utilities & Power Generators.

Download the SASB Content Index for Electric 
Utilities & Power Generators

Download the ISSB's IFRS S2 Climate-related 
Disclosure Exposure Draft Content Index

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
The GRI is an international independent organisation providing 
widely-used standards for sustainability reporting. CLP’s 
reports have reported with reference to the GRI Standards 
since 2007.

This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI 
Universal Standards 2021. It also reports on the GRI G4 
Electric Utilities Sector Disclosures, covering key aspects of 
sustainability performance which are meaningful and relevant 
to the electric utility sector.

Download the GRI Content Index

The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong's 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
Reporting Guide
Companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) 
are required to meet the ESG Reporting Guide disclosure 
obligations from financial years commencing on or after 
1 July 2020. The Guide was updated in 2019 after extensive 
consultation conducted by HKEx.

CLP’s Annual and Sustainability Reports have adopted the 
new disclosure obligations since the 2019 reporting cycle. In 
particular, the materiality assessment process, as outlined 
under the mandatory disclosure requirements, has been 
applied to prioritise CLP's response to the "comply or explain" 
provisions of the Environmental and Social Aspects of the 
HKEx ESG Reporting Guide.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD)
The TCFD develops voluntary, consistent climate-related 
financial risk disclosure recommendations for use by 
companies in providing information to investors, lenders, 
insurers and other stakeholders. The recommendations 
consider the physical, liability and transition risks associated 
with climate change and what constitutes effective financial 
disclosures across industries.

CLP has produced a standalone Climate-related Disclosures 
Report in accordance with the TCFD recommendations to 
assist stakeholders seeking climate-related information. The 
report references the TCFD’s latest publications, including the 
Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies 
(October 2021), Annex: Implementing the Recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(October 2021), and Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and 
Transition Plans (October 2021).

Different organisations are developing frameworks and 
guidelines to facilitate TCFD disclosures, including the ISSB's 
Exposure Draft of S2 Climate-related Disclosures, released in 
March 2022, and the HKEx's Guidance on Climate Disclosures 
(November 2021).

Other guidance documents developed for electric utilities 
were also referenced. Most notably are those published by 
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD), where CLP is participating in several TCFD working 
groups. These documents include the WBCSD TCFD Electric 
Utilities Preparer Forum Report, published in June 2019, 
and Evaluating climate-related financial impacts on power 
utilities, published in November 2021.

Disclosures Report

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data
CLP's GHG emissions are reported with reference to the 
World Resources Institute (WRI)/WBCSD GHG Protocol, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2006), the International 
Standard for GHG Emissions ISO 14064 and relevant local 
statutory guidelines where applicable.

To facilitate implementation, in 2007 CLP developed the first 
version of the Group-wide GHG reporting guideline which 
referenced some of the guidelines above. This reporting 
guideline is reviewed in accordance with CLP's practice at least 
every three years. In 2019, CLP enhanced its GHG disclosure to 
also include Scope 3 emissions. 

Read more on the GHG Accounting Methodology

Financial data
All financial data in this report is consistent with the figures 
published in the audited financial statements of CLP's 2022 
Annual Report. These financial statements were prepared in 
accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards 
(HKFRS) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants (HKICPA) and the requirements of the Hong Kong 
Companies Ordinance (Cap.622).

This report covers the CLP Group’s sustainability performance 
for the calendar year ending 31 December 2022. It is published 
at the same time as the CLP 2022 Annual Report. The CLP 
2021 Sustainability and Annual Reports were published in 
March 2022.

CLP reviews its reporting scope regularly to ensure the 
material impact of the Group’s overall portfolio is covered. 
Any assets that have been operating and sold during the year 
are reflected in the reporting scope. In 2022, additions to 
the reporting scope include the Tallawarra B gas-fired power 
station in Australia, Gongdao solar farm and Xundian II wind 
farm with battery storage in China. Shiheng Power Station has 
ceased to be owned by CLP since January. In November 2022, 
CLP sold its 70% interest in the coal-fired Fanchanggang Power 
Station in Mainland China. Divestment of 10% equity interest in 
Apraava Energy to CDPQ were completed in December 2022.

In 2022, the following data points have been adjusted:

• Health, Safety and Environment (HSE): Due to 
organisational change, CLP has adjusted the disclosures 
of safety metrics. Data from CLP Holdings and Hong 
Kong are regrouped and reported under Hong Kong. Two 
existing environmental metrics, in the categories of total 
freshwater consumption and freshwater intensity of CLP’s 
power generation process, have been revised and are now 
independently assured.

• Climate-related financial information: CLP has started to 
report the capital investments, operating earnings and 
revenues of each type of renewable energy individually, 
namely solar, hydro, wind and waste-to-energy. This 
change aligns with international reporting guidelines.

• Our people: Total staff turnover rate is reported 
in employee metrics to align with international 
reporting practices.

• Customers: Total electricity sold by sectors is newly 
reported. This provides transparency on the amount of 
usage of electricity in different sectors.

Good corporate governance and risk management form the bedrock of a sustainable business and 
underpin long-term success. To protect this bedrock, the Group continuously strives to embed 
good corporate governance practices in its day-to-day operations, in pursuing its vision and by 
implementing CLP's Value Framework.

Corporate governance framework and code
Robust corporate governance framework promotes and 
safeguards the interests of shareholders and other 
stakeholders. CLP is committed to maintaining a rigorous 
framework of corporate governance that upholds the Group’s 
credibility and reputation.

GRI reference: 2-9, 2-12, 2-15, 2-23, 2-24

Corporate governance is a matter of culture, driving CLP 
to continually make conscious decisions around correct 
behaviours. Over the years, the Company has developed 
and put in place a CLP Code on Corporate Governance, 
Corporate Governance Framework and a comprehensive set of 
procedures, systems, policies and guidelines that make up the 
unique CLP corporate governance structure.

Download the CLP Code on Corporate Governance

The CLP Code was last updated in early 2023 to reflect the 
new requirements under the Corporate Governance Code 
Appendix 14 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities 
on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (HKEx). The 
CLP Code, while embracing the terms set out within HKEx's 
Corporate Governance Code, goes beyond this by advancing a 
structure that builds on CLP’s own standards and experience.

The Board is CLP’s highest governance body and actively 
promotes the success of the Group by directing and 
supervising all of its affairs in a responsible and effective 
manner. Some of these responsibilities are discharged through 
delegation to six Board Committees. The two committees 
most involved in sustainability-related matters are the 
Sustainability Committee and the Audit & Risk Committee.

In 2022, the Board spent its time on strategy, performance 
monitoring and planning, governance and risk, stakeholder 
engagement, leadership and people.

The CLP Corporate Governance Report in the Annual Report 
discloses the Company's governance performance in detail. 
Below are the highlights from 2022:

• Board Succession – Appointed Board members and 
Independent Non-Executive Director (INED) to enhance the 
Board's diversity.

• Board Committees Refresh – Refreshed the composition of 
CLP Holdings Board Committees.

• Alignment of Subsidiary Board Leadership with Business 
and Functional Responsibilities – Refreshed the Board 
directorship of CLP Group Subsidiaries with two key 
objectives, which are:

– delegating the management of the subsidiary board 
from the C-suite management to mid-management such 
that the C-suite management can better focus on the 
management at the senior leadership level; and

– empowering mid-management to take up the leadership 
and management of the subsidiary boards whilst 
ensuring that this would be well aligned with their 
business/functional responsibilities.

• Female Director Representation Target of 30% – Set 
target for female Directors representation on the CLP 
Holdings Board to enhance diversity. The target of 30% 
representation is not a ceiling, and if it fails below 30%, 
CLP will provide clarity in relation to the appointment or 
change in Board composition and the expectations of return 
of female Director representation to at least 30% or higher. 
This will be reviewed by the Nomination Committee on an 
annual basis.

A strong governance framework is key to ensuring that 
the sustainability issues CLP faces are incorporated into 
the corporate agenda. Sustainability is well integrated into 
CLP's business strategy and the CLP Board has overall 
responsibility for CLP’s environment, social and governance 
(ESG) reporting and sustainability. Sustainability governance 
has been embedded in the corporate governance structure 

throughout the Group – from Board-level committees to 
management-level Group functions and business units.

Two of the Board Committees, the Sustainability Committee 
and the Audit & Risk Committee, have separate but 
complementary roles in sustainability management. These 
two committees are supported by the Sustainability 
Executive Committee and coordinated by the Group 
Sustainability Department. 

Sustainability Committee
The Sustainability Committee holds the primary role 
of overseeing the management of the Group’s 
sustainability issues.

Download the Terms of Reference of the 
Sustainability Committee

Following on from the update of our Climate Vision 2050 in 
September 2021, the Committee has been closely monitoring 
the evolving developments on climate change. Ensuring that 

the Committee maintains a balanced view, the Committee was 
briefed on the latest developments by two leading external 
experts on separate occasions on the topics of the impact of 
the energy crisis on climate action and the key outcomes of 
COP27. The Committee also had a robust review of the Climate 
Vision 2050 and how CLP’s performance and commitment on 
climate action have been received by CLP’s stakeholders.

Between 1 January 2022 and the date of this report, the 
Committee met four times (including three times in 2022 and 
once in 2023). The following table is a summary of how the 
Committee spent its time during this period.

In 2022, the SEC convened five times, including before each 
Sustainability Committee meeting. These meetings provide a 
platform for the executive team to initiate or develop strategic 
sustainability projects, shape and receive progress updates 
on current projects and engage in strategic discussions on 
emerging issues.

Key themes discussed in 2022 are summarised below:

Specifically, the carbon reduction potential of CLP’s new 
energy services offerings, and their commercial potential;

• Provided direction to CLP's Climate Vision 2050 review, in 
light of the developments mentioned above;

• Monitored the latest development of voluntary carbon 
markets and their implications on CLP. This included:

– reviewing CLP’s response to the public consultation, 
conducted by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary 
Carbon Market on the draft principles for voluntary 
carbon credit standards developed; and

– monitoring the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity 
Initiative, which is developing guidance on the credible 
use of carbon credits;

• Reviewed the material topics identified in materiality 
assessment and determined the impact material topics 
and financially material topics to be featured in the 
Sustainability Report and the Annual Report respectively;

• Maintained oversight of the Company’s public disclosures 
on sustainability issues, including the CLP Annual and 
Sustainability Reports, and the CLP Climate-related 
Disclosures Report;

• Provided direction to the Company’s response to 
the various ESG disclosures standards, including 
the ISSB exposure drafts on General Sustainability-
related Disclosures.

• Reviewed the scope of sustainability data assurance;

• Reviewed and endorsed the Group’s environmental targets, 
covering air emissions, waste and water use;

• Reviewed performance of ESG indices results and trends to 
drive improvements in operational performance;

• Reviewed the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) membership criteria; and

• Reviewed and endorsed the Supplier Code of Conduct 
and three-year roadmap to embed sustainability in 
procurement practices.

Group Sustainability Department
The Director-led Group Sustainability Department regularly 
reports to and seeks guidance from the Sustainability 
Committee and SEC.

The Department is responsible for managing the 
implementation of the Group’s climate change strategy. This 
includes reporting and reviewing progress on CLP’s Climate 
Vision 2050 and TCFD implementation, as well as monitoring 
changes in stakeholder expectations and their implications to 
the Company.

Through its role, the Department embeds sustainability 
into existing operational practices and helps inform the 
development of the business strategy and planning processes. 
It monitors sustainability issues and updates the Sustainability 
Committee and SEC on emerging risks and opportunities. It 
also leads corporate sustainability reporting and identifies 
areas for improving operational performance.

In executing best practice, the Department is committed 
to developing capacity on ESG reporting and performance 
management as well as exchanging its experiences across 
organisations, sectors and countries. It supports and organises 
sustainability-related events and works closely with different 
stakeholder groups. For instance, the Department hosts 
Sustainability Forums and meetings with Group functions and 
Business Units across regions on a regular basis to facilitate 
the sharing of experiences and insights on how to move 
sustainability forward.

Proactive and effective risk management is part of good corporate governance and one of the 
foundations of the long-term growth and success of the Company.
 
Risk Management Framework
In line with international standards and best practices, CLP 
defines “risk” as the effect of uncertainty on objectives. 
The effect can be positive, negative, or both, and can 
result in opportunities and threats. CLP aims to identify 
risks early so the threats can be understood, managed, 
mitigated, transferred or avoided while the opportunities 
can be enhanced and captured where appropriate. This 
demands a proactive approach and an effective Group-wide 
risk management framework.

GRI reference: 2-23, 205-1

CLP’s risk management framework comprises four 
key elements:

• Risk management philosophy;

• Risk appetite;

• Risk governance structure; and

• Risk management process.

CLP’s overall risk management process is overseen by the 
Board through the Audit & Risk Committee. There is strong 
recognition that risk management is the responsibility of 
everyone within the Group and cultivating and embedding 
risk awareness into the organisational culture is critical for 
the successful implementation of CLP’s risk management 
framework. Consequently, risk management is integrated into 
all business and decision-making processes, including strategy 
formulation, business development, business planning, capital 
allocation, investment decisions, internal control and day-to-
day operations.

Materiality 
assessment process

The 
materiality matrix

CLP reviews how ESG issues are impacting the business and 
its stakeholders through an annual materiality assessment. 
The review process uncovers emerging ESG risks and 
opportunities for considerations in the risk review and 
business planning processes. Below is a list of selected top tier 
ESG risks:

• Climate change – physical and transition risks

• Major HSE incidents 

• COVID-19 outbreak

• Procurement and supply chain capabilities risks

• Cyber security attack

• Regulatory changes

• Tariff adjustment challenge – Hong Kong 

• Physical security breach

• Gas supply shortage

• Major failure – generation assets

Read the list of CLP Group’s top tier risks in the Risk 
Management Report in the 2022 Annual Report

CLP's risk management objectives are two-tiered:

• Strategic
At a strategic level, CLP focuses on identifying and 
managing the material financial and non-financial risks 
associated with pursuing its strategic and business 
objectives. In pursuing growth and transformational 
opportunities, CLP aims to optimise risk and return 
decisions as defined and quantified through a diligent and 
independent review and challenge process.

• Operational
 At an operational level, CLP aims to identify, 
analyse, evaluate and mitigate operational hazards and 
threats while enhancing and capturing opportunities for 
operational improvement where appropriate. This is done 
to create a safe, healthy, efficient and environmentally 
friendly workplace for its employees and contractors. Other 
considerations include ensuring public safety and health, 
minimising environmental impact, as well as securing asset 
integrity and adequate insurance.

CLP is committed to open, transparent, regular and timely communication with its stakeholders 
and offers a readiness to address their concerns to build trust and confidence. This is delivered 
through the CLP Stakeholder Engagement Framework.
 
Strategies and procedures
CLP’s Stakeholder Engagement Framework provides open and 
transparent channels for stakeholder input and a review and 
consideration process where concerns about CLP's business 
are responded to in a timely manner.

GRI reference: 2-12, 2-16, 2-25, 2-29, 207-3, 413-1

While each business unit develops its own project-specific 
engagement plan depending on their needs, the plan they 
develop follows the framework steps below.

1. Establishing engagement scope and aligning with 
business objectives

2. Mapping issues and concerns

3. Identifying relevant stakeholders: CLP's business activities 
involve a diverse range of stakeholders, each with 
distinct attributes, concerns and interests. In addition to 
regular communications with stakeholders (such as email 
updates, information kits, press releases and video stories), 
key stakeholder groups for each project are identified 
and prioritised based on the issues mapped, how the 
stakeholders will be impacted and their influence on the 
success of the business.

4. Developing a communications and engagement plan: CLP 
uses a wide range of easily accessible public engagement 
channels, both formal and informal. Those channels include 
surveys, focus groups, briefings, visits, events, roadshows 
and online channels, all of which enable it to receive 
concerns, interest or feedback at any time during the year. 
Drawing on past experiences, the channels for each project 
are selected based on the project’s nature and the most 
effective means of reaching the identified stakeholders.

5. Conducting engagement activities

6. Capturing feedback and reporting on outcomes: CLP seeks 
to address stakeholders’ views and concerns and identify 
areas for improvement in a timely manner. To do so, we 
rely on a number of measures. They include: measuring the 
amount of stakeholder feedback captured; the outcomes 
following our stakeholder engagement; media monitoring 
and analysis; brand perception ratings; and public and 
industry recognition and awards.

Materiality 
assessment process

The 
materiality matrix

The materiality assessment is the foundation of best practice sustainability management and 
ESG reporting. The assessment supports the integration of sustainability into CLP business 
strategy and its ongoing efforts to create long-term value for stakeholders.
 
The assessment process overview
At the same time a materiality assessment helps to 
contextualise ESG impacts and how these should be disclosed 
in its reports. By combining both internal and external 
stakeholder views with extensive megatrends analysis, CLP 
determines which ESG issues are most material to its business 
from a financial perspective and to stakeholders from an 
impact perspective.

GRI reference: 2-12, 3-1, 3-3

Global standards for best practice in assessing materiality 
continue to evolve in line with broader changes in ESG 
disclosure standards. For example, new guidance from 
the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) is 
expected in 2023 and anticipated to provide additional clarity 
on how to assess financial materiality. Similarly, the GRI 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI), which remains the 
most commonly used standard for sustainability reporting, 
upgraded its materiality assessment methodology in 2021.

In 2022, CLP considered the latest best practice advice from 
standard setters, including the following:

• GRI 3: Material Topics 2021;

• The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
Foundation Sustainability Disclosure Standards;

• Proposals for a Relevant and Dynamic EU Sustainability 
Reporting Standard-setting, published by the European 
Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) in February 
2021; and

• Applying Enterprise Risk Management to Environment, 
Social and Governance-related Risk Guidelines, published 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of 
the Treadway Commission (COSO) and the WBCSD in 
October 2018.

In addition, external experts in materiality assessment were 
consulted via interviews. The expert group included global 
standards setters, investors and well-recognised governance 
and sustainability organisations.

Enhancing the double materiality approach
Since 2018, CLP’s materiality assessments consider how 
megatrends could impact the sustainability of the Company’s 
business strategy in the medium to long term. In 2021, CLP 
became an early adopter of double materiality to support 
its ESG risk management and to inform the ESG content of 
its annual suite of reports. This adoption sees CLP’s Annual 
Report cover financially material ESG topics that potentially 
create or erode enterprise value, while the Sustainability 
Report includes ESG topics that have a material impact on 
people, the environment and the economy.

In 2022, CLP further enhanced its double materiality 
assessment methodology with reference to the new GRI 3 

guidance, albeit with a modified approach to incorporate a 
review of financial risks and opportunities. The methodology 
was developed to identify and assess potential ESG 
impacts, risks and opportunities, thereby operationalising 
an assessment via a standardised and repeatable approach. 
This assessment process helps CLP identify areas of priority, 
in particular how ESG risks and opportunities should be 
integrated into the Group’s strategic planning and risk 
management processes.

The double materiality assessment cycle
While CLP's methodology has evolved year-on-year to reflect 
changes in best practice, the material issues identified since 
2018 have remained relatively consistent, with only minor 
updates over the period. This reflects the reality that in the 
absence of material changes in the operating environment, 
material issues relevant to the utilities sector are unlikely to 
change over a short timeframe.

CLP implements the double materiality assessment process 
based on a three-year cycle. Variations in the breadth and 
scope of the assessment process occur year-on-year, with 
the Group undertaking a comprehensive assessment in Year 1 
and less time-consuming assessments for revalidation and the 
incorporation of incremental changes in Years 2 and 3.

GRI reference: 2-12, 3-1

In 2022, CLP undertook the Year 2 assessment approach.  

Conduct desktop research and 
stakeholder interviews
Megatrends are large, transformative global forces that define 
the future by having a far-reaching impact on business, 
economies, industries, societies and individuals. In 2022, CLP 
conducted a review of prior megatrend analysis and validated 
that the nine megatrends identified in 2021 remain relevant to 
CLP and reflect CLP’s underlying strategic objectives. 

Interviewing stakeholders is a key step in any materiality 
process. CLP’s senior management from a wide range of 

disciplines was interviewed in 2021 (Year 1). In 2022, in line 
with the Year 2 assessment process, external materiality 
experts were interviewed to gauge their views on evolving 
best practice and how this aligns with CLP’s current approach 
to reporting.

In addition, CLP conducted megatrends analysis and reviewed 
its risk registers, internal strategy papers and company 
policies, and GRI and Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB) guidance, to help identify impacts, risk and 
opportunities conceivably material to CLP’s current and future 
prospects.  The process undertaken is evidence-based.

The megatrends impacting CLP

Identify impacts, risks and opportunities
Applying the assessment process, in 2022 (Year 2) CLP 
identified over 80 potential stakeholder impacts and financial 
risks and opportunities.

‘Impact materiality’ refers to significant positive or negative 
impacts on people, the economy and the environment, 
including impacts on human rights, as per the GRI definition.

To integrate data-driven evidence as part of the materiality 
assessment process, in 2022 CLP introduced an artificial 
intelligence (AI)-driven tool to identify evidence of ESG risks 
and opportunities from relevant sources such as corporate 
reports, regulations, standards, news and social media.

Materiality 
assessment process

The 
materiality matrix

‘Financial materiality’ refers to financial risks or opportunities 
which create, preserve or erode enterprise value, as per the 
International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) Exposure 
Drafts. These risks and opportunities are considered to have 
implications for the organisation’s revenues, expenses or 
balance sheet, which in turn means either a negative or 
positive and actual or potential impact on CLP’s stakeholders 
or enterprise value.

Assess and validate impacts, risks 
and opportunities
In 2022, CLP enhanced the assessment methodology by 
considering the severity and likelihood for risk, and the benefit 
and likelihood for opportunities. 

Each impact, risk and opportunity was assessed as either 
negative or positive, actual or potential (as per the latest GRI 3: 
Material Topics 2021 guidance).

In terms of ‘impact materiality’, over 15 risks and opportunities 
were judged as ‘high’ or ‘transformational’; none were 

classified as ‘extreme’. These were then arranged under 
broader sub-topics, and ultimately top-tier material topics. 
This alignment exercise resulted in a slightly revised number of 
top tier sub-topics (12) and top tier material topics (4) in 2022.

To finalise the assessment phase, the significance of each 
negative impact or financial risk was evaluated for its severity 
and likelihood. The methodology employed drew from the 
latest GRI guidance, ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard, 
and CLP’s Group Risk Management Framework.

A similar methodology was devised to assess the significance 
of each positive impact and financial opportunity, with each 
evaluated for its benefit and likelihood.

It must be noted that the methodology CLP employs to assess 
for sustainability-related materiality aligns with and supports 
CLP’s general approach to risk management.

The preliminary results of the Year 2 assessment were 
presented to CLP’s Sustainability Executive Committee and 
the Board-level Sustainability Committee. Both committees 
validated the findings identified by the working group.

CLP’s growth opportunities are positioned around becoming a Utility of the Future. In pursuit 
of this ambition, CLP is decarbonising its existing asset base, investing in clean electricity 
infrastructure, ensuring the delivery of reliable and reasonably priced energy, and acting as a 
trusted partner for governments, communities and customers in the transition to a clean and 
reliable energy future.
 
Partnering in the clean energy transition
Support for the decarbonisation agenda impacts positively the environment and the broader 
community, by helping to reduce air emissions, water use and waste while also ensuring 
the continued supply of reliable and reasonably priced electricity and energy services. CLP’s 
role as a trusted partner in the zero-carbon transition also supports the economy by making 
energy systems more efficient and resilient, and by decoupling generation and distribution from 
extractive, non-renewable and polluting fossil fuels.

As per CLP’s Climate Vision 2050, efforts to identify 
opportunities to phase out coal-fired power generation 
continue. In November 2022, CLP sold its entire 70% interest in 
the coal-fired Fanchanggang Power Station in Mainland China.  

CLP carefully reviewed all possible exit strategies for this 
plant and considered divestment the most appropriate option. 
Handing ownership to a trusted partner, in CLP’s view, 
supports a just transition that aligns with the Group’s Value 
Framework and Labour Standards. In addition, CLP considers 
that transferring the Group’s interest in the plant to a state-
owned enterprise supports continued power supply reliability 
in the community as well as an efficient and orderly transition 
in line with China’s decarbonisation policy. At the same time, 
the sale freed up capital to grow CLP’s renewable portfolio in 
Mainland China.

The sale of this coal-fired plant accelerates CLP’s 
decarbonisation trajectory and is expected to reduce the 
Group’s absolute annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
by around 10% compared with 2022 levels on an equity 
plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis. This 
demonstrates CLP’s strong commitment to accelerate phasing 
out coal-based assets and achieve the net-zero GHG target 
by 2050.

In 2022, CLP Group reduced the GHG emission intensity of 
electricity sold to 0.55 kg CO2e/kWh when compared to 0.57 
kg CO2e/kWh in 2021, while the GHG emission intensity of 
electricity sold in Hong Kong by CLP Power maintained at 
0.39 kg CO2e/kWh.

Shaping and executing the transition to net zero

CLP maintains its commitment to progressively phase out 
coal-fired generation plants.

In Hong Kong, older coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak A 
Power Station will be retired in the next few years, while daily 
coal-fired power generation at Castle Peak B Power Station 
will be ceased by 2035. The phase-out of CLP's minority-
owned coal-fired assets in Mainland China and Taiwan is also 
expected before 2030.

In Australia, the closure of Yallourn Power Station will reduce 
EnergyAustralia’s Scope 1 carbon emissions by over 60% in 
2028-2029 against the 2019-2020 base year.

The other remaining coal-fired power stations where CLP 
maintains operational control are Jhajjar Power Station 
(operated by Apraava Energy) and Mount Piper Power Station 
(owned by EnergyAustralia). CLP maintains its commitment to 
find practical solutions to phase out these coal-fired power 
generation assets from its portfolio in the mid- to late 2030s 
and by 2040 at the latest, respectively. 

As the climate crisis brings a raft of pressing problems to 
all regions of the world, CLP remains a trusted partner in 
transitioning its assets to a clean energy portfolio. This steady 
progression to low-carbon electricity infrastructure ensures 
CLP’s customers continue to have options for accessing clean 
energy supply.

Over the years, CLP maintained its dialogue with governments 
and communities through various channels to help 
shape and deliver their long-term decarbonisation and 
environmental objectives.

For instance, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power) 
organised various working and advisory committees, panels 
and meetings to actively listen to community voices. The 
Company organised site visits to Black Point Power Station for 
more than 20 members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council 
and around 40 senior government officers in October and 
December 2022 respectively. The visits aimed to strengthen 
communications and enhance understanding of CLP Power’s 
multi-pronged approach to decarbonisation in support of the 
Hong Kong Government’s target to achieve carbon neutrality 
by 2050.

Clean electricity infrastructure
Investing in clean energy infrastructure benefits the broader community by reducing the 
combustion of fossil fuels, thus reducing the negative impacts of air pollution and climate change. 
In addition, investment in clean energy infrastructure also benefits the economy by helping 
establish new industries.

As CLP progressively phases out coal-fired power generation, 
the Company is directing investment towards low-carbon 
streams of business, including renewable energy and energy 
services. In 2022, CLP continued to expand its renewable 
energy portfolio in Mainland China. Commercial operations 
began at the 100MW Qian’an III Wind Farm in Jilin province 
and construction commenced for the 50MW Xundian II 
project in Yunnan province. These additional wind assets 
allow customers to access zero-carbon energy supply and 
support the issuance of Green Electricity Certificates (GECs) in 
the region.

In India, Apraava Energy continued to progress its 251MW 
Sidhpur wind farm in Gujarat state, with the project expected 
to be commissioned by June 2023. In December 2021, Apraava 
Energy acquired a 49% stake in a 254-kilometre interstate 
power transmission project in northeast India, and is due 
to take up the remaining 51% by the end of 2025. Apraava 
Energy also recently won a contract to provide advanced 
metering infrastructure services in two regions in Assam State 
in northern India.

CLP's capital investment in gas assets has almost doubled 
in the past two years, increasing from HK$3,445 million in 
2020 to HK$6,713 million in 2022, supporting the low-carbon 
energy transition.

The Group’s renewable energy portfolio, including equity 
capacity and long-term capacity and energy purchase 

arrangements, remained relatively stable in 2022 at 3,611MW, 
compared to 3,624MW in 2021. While additional renewable 
energy assets came into service this year, the divestment of 
10% equity in Apraava Energy hampered overall net growth. 
The current CLP renewable energy portfolio now sits at 23% 
solar and 14% hydro, while wind energy represents 63%.

CLP also made strategic investments to reduce the carbon 
intensity of baseload power generation.

In Hong Kong, the second new gas-fired generation unit D2 
at Black Point Power Station is scheduled for full operation 
in 2024. This will play a key role in allowing older coal-fired 
generation units at Castle Peak A Power Station to be retired 
in the next few years. It will also increase the use of natural gas 
in CLP's fuel mix in Hong Kong, which is currently about 48% on 
a sent-out basis.

In Australia, construction of the Tallawarra B plant in New 
South Wales began in 2021 and is due to be completed by 
late 2023, creating Australia’s first carbon offset hydrogen and 
gas-capable power plant.

Environment and biodiversity 
Effectively minimising environmental impacts from power generation is one of CLP’s 
commitments as a responsible power utility. This is fundamental for upholding a social licence to 
operate and to ensure the maintenance of ecosystem services for sustainability. Conservation of 
biodiversity has a direct positive impact on local economies by protecting ecological processes 
and influencing critical industries, such as agriculture and food production.

Care for the environment is one of the core values in CLP’s 
Value Framework. It is demonstrated in operations as follows:

1. As part of pre-investment decisions: CLP conducts 
environmental due diligence and climate risk assessments 
to evaluate a comprehensive range of potential 
environmental impacts and risks.

2. During the project implementation stage: CLP conducts 
environmental impact assessments. In some jurisdictions, 
the Company goes beyond compliance requirements and 
mitigation measures to ensure impacts are handled with 
extra diligence.

3. For ongoing operations: CLP has a robust ISO 14001 
certified environmental management system in place to 
monitor its environmental impacts.

4. To drive continuous improvement: CLP now sets 
and discloses short-term (2022) and long-term (2030) 
environmental intensity targets for air emissions, water 
and waste. Targets are set on the basis of reviewing 
the performance pattern of individual assets, and 
identifying potential improvement areas with planned 
control measures and operational processes.

As CLP strives to deploy international best practice 
in operations, it continues to explore state-of-the-art 
technologies which can further reduce environmental impacts 
and also enhance operational efficiency. In 2022, CLP Power 
completed a multi-year Gas Turbine Upgrade Project for eight 
gas-fired generation units at Black Point Power Station which 
avoided the emissions of 300 kt of CO2 and 0.4 kt of NOx 

in 2022.

In Australia, a Particulate Matter Continuous Emissions 
Monitoring System (PM-CEMS) was successfully installed at 
Mount Piper Power Station. It is the first coal-fired power 
station in Australia to be calibrated to the United States EPA 
PS11 standard.

As nature and biodiversity loss is an increasingly material 
global risk, in 2022, CLP kept up its goal of “No net loss of 
biodiversity” by implementing various initiatives to preserve 
precious ecosystems in the regions where it operates.

In Hong Kong, CLP entered a 10-year partnership with 
Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden Corporation (KFBG), 
providing a HK$10-million sponsorship to support nature and 
biodiversity recovery by planting up to 25,000 native trees of 
200 different species or more over a 10-year period. This could 
potentially reintroduce critically-endangered native plants to 
the local ecosystem, with anticipated positive knock-on effects 
for pollinators and other wildlife. CLP Power also continued its 
vegetation management programme along transmission lines 
built in environmentally-sensitive country park areas, as well 
as funding the preservation of Hong Kong’s aquaculture and 
fisheries resources.

In China, CLP China engaged its employees to participate in 
a tree-planting programme combating desertification in the 
vicinity of Jinchang Solar Farm.

In Australia, EnergyAustralia established a Biodiversity 
Conservation Agreement (BCA) for restoring the habitat at 
the Thompson Creek Reservoir.

In India, Jhajjar Power Station carried out a baseline 
biodiversity survey and assessment resulting in the Natural 
Capital Action Plan to mitigate biodiversity loss across its 
site. The project received a “Commendation for Significant 
Achievement in Biodiversity” in the CII ITC Sustainability 
Awards 2022 (Award category: Domain-Biodiversity).

In the meantime, CLP is closely monitoring the development of 
the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) 
framework and Science-based Targets for Nature (SBTN). The 
Group has completed a review of the expectations of the 
framework and targets and, in response, will develop short- 
and medium-term action plans to enhance current practices.

Regulatory landscapes
CLP’s collaboration with governments and regulators positively impacts the environment by 
reducing emissions. By contrast, misaligned agendas would increase the environmental, social, 
and financial costs of the energy transition for governments, customers, and communities.

Effective progress in decarbonisation must factor in evolving 
government and community expectations within the markets 
where CLP operates. Regulatory certainty, clear government 
targets and consistent roadmaps support CLP’s ability to 
execute long-term planning and strategic decision-making.

For instance, in Hong Kong, CLP Power is regulated by 
the Scheme of Control Agreement (SCA). To support the 
Government’s environmental policy and goals, CLP Power 
developed the current Five-Year Development Plan (2018 – 
2023) under the SCA with a number of significant capital 
projects, which include:

• Constructing the D1 gas-fired generation unit at the Black 
Point Power Station;

• Constructing an offshore liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) terminal;

• Commencing the enhancement of the Clean Energy 
Transmission System connecting Hong Kong and Mainland 
China to increase use of zero-carbon energy in the 
future; and

• Strengthening the smart grid with digitalised smart 
meter upgrades.

Governments worldwide have been aligning their short- and 
medium-term climate actions with long-term net-zero targets. 
While CLP fully supports governments’ net-zero pledges, the 
Group also considers the risks and opportunities triggered 
by evolving government policies. For example, the Mainland 
China Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is one of the key 
policy instruments in realising the Chinese government’s 
decarbonisation plan. CLP closely monitors the emerging 
ETS compliance rules, such as the new draft allocation plan 
released in November 2022, and assesses the respective 
regulatory risks for better business planning.

As part of its climate action plan, the Hong Kong Government 
has a long-term policy of promoting the adoption of electric 
vehicles (EVs), it announced the target of no new registrations 
of fuel-propelled private cars in 2035 or earlier. While 
supporting the Government in building the EV charging 
infrastructure and network across Hong Kong, CLP Power 
also extended its free EV charging service until the end of 
2023. This demonstrates continuous commitment to providing 
convenience and reliable energy resources to EV motorists 
across Hong Kong.

Similarly, Australian governments are introducing growing 
supports for electric vehicles, and EnergyAustralia is exploring 
different funding options for EV infrastructure, such as 

working with asset and finance companies, as well as 
developing innovative retail contracts.

As the Indian Government announced an interim plan of 
installing 500GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 
under its 2070 carbon neutrality target, Apraava Energy 
will play its part in contributing to India’s clean energy 
transition plan. Apraava Energy is eagerly working towards 
increasing its clean energy portfolio to contribute to India's 
energy transition.

Methodology

The world is in the midst of an energy crisis, triggered by an uncertain geopolitical environment 
and enduring supply chain disruptions. Escalating fuel prices have resulted in assets running 
at reduced capacity, which has increased costs for CLP and its customers alike. The Group 
must balance two vital and sometimes competing objectives: providing customers with 
secure, reliable and reasonably priced energy while continuing to make rapid progress on 
decarbonisation objectives.
 
Reliable and reasonably priced energy
CLP’s customers and the markets in which CLP operates have been adversely impacted by high 
and unstable fuel prices. CLP exercised prudent cost management while ensuring reliable access 
to energy. Enabling the uninterrupted operation of key services needed to maintain societal and 
economic functioning has positive impact on people, the environment and the economy.

In Hong Kong, maintaining high supply reliability is critical for 
CLP’s customers who by large live in a vertical city built around 
an economy that depends on electricity for buildings and 
transport. CLP’s high supply reliability is the result of its power 
expertise, and decades-long commitment to generation, 
network and operational excellence. The Scheme of Control 
Agreement (SCA) signed with the Hong Kong SAR Government 
serves as a stable and long-term regulatory regime, which 

is crucial for providing an effective mechanism to address 
electricity industry's requirements and ensure long-term and 
capital-intensive electric utility infrastructure investments.

As part of its continuous effort in maintaining high supply 
reliability, CLP adopts advanced technology, such as smart 
meters, and implements demand-side management measures 
to optimise electricity consumption and improve utilisation 
of existing assets. Located in the sub-tropical region, its

Bolstering energy security and reliability

Hong Kong operations are also enhanced with a number of 
measures to improve the resilience of the power systems 
against extreme weather. 

CLP puts tremendous effort to maintain its world-class 
reliability of 99.997%. However, electricity supply to around 
175,000 CLP customers in Hong Kong was affected on 21 June 
2022 when a cable bridge in the north-west New Territories 
caught fire. CLP Power immediately began work to restore 
the power supply with priority for essential services, including 
hospitals and railways. Power was restored to around 90% of 
the affected customers seven hours after the incident, and to 
the remaining customers around six hour later.

This extremely rare incident was a matter of profound 
concern for CLP Power, and a panel of experts was 
appointed to conduct a comprehensive investigation. A final 
investigation report was submitted to the Hong Kong SAR 
Government in August 2022. In addition, an external fire 
consultant was engaged to support a fire risk assessment 
and reliability review on common cable infrastructures (CCIs). 
Site-specific assessments were completed on all CCIs and 
an implementation plan to further reduce fire risk exposure 
was formulated.

Globally, fuel prices have been highly volatile. In addition, to 
meet carbon reduction targets and the increasingly tightened 
air emission caps set by the Hong Kong SAR Government, 
more natural gas and zero-carbon energy will be needed in 
the city's fuel mix for electricity generation. CLP Power has 
worked hard to minimise the impact of fuel cost fluctuations 
and maintain tariffs at a reasonable level. These actions 
include: enhancing generation efficiency; making the most 
use of existing gas reserves; exploring new sources of gas 
supplies; and securing competitively priced fuels from the 
global market. For example, CLP imports nuclear power 
which is relatively stable in price. Amid a continued surge 
in international fuel prices, nuclear power has played an 
important role in smoothing out price fluctuations during 
times of energy market volatility. 

With prudent cost management and control, CLP Power again 
froze the basic tariff in 2023 against a backdrop of surging 
international fuel prices. In tandem, it continued its Energy 
Saving Rebate Scheme for low-consumption residential as 
well as small and medium enterprises customers and its 
Concessionary Tariff for the Elderly. CLP Power has also 
set aside about HK$200 million from the CLP Community 
Energy Saving Fund to launch a series of community support 
programmes in 2023, including a HK$100 million Fuel Cost 
Subsidy programme to subsidise the energy costs of 150,000 
families in need.

Financial materiality
Shortages in coal and gas could impact CLP’s profit margins 
by driving up input costs and forcing assets to run at reduced 
capacity. However, CLP may be able to benefit, in the short 
term, from increased demand for fossil fuel generation, but 
the larger commercial opportunity lies in leading a faster 
transition to renewables to support long-term energy security.

As a purpose-led business, CLP recognises its obligation to meet evolving stakeholder 
expectations around the positive role businesses can play in society. This includes empowering 
end users by offering decentralised energy solutions that meet their needs and collaborating 
with partners to deliver clean energy solutions that benefit customers, communities, and 
the environment. Employee and supplier wellbeing is also a priority. CLP recognised that its 
long-term success relies on its capacity to build an agile, diverse, inclusive, and ethical work 
culture capable of attracting the highly skilled talents needed to build a Utility of the Future.
 
Human rights in the supply chain
Human rights due diligence is critical in managing supply chain risks. In becoming a Utility of the 
Future, CLP continues to promote supply chain transparency as a competitive advantage and 
recognises its responsibility to eliminate all forms of modern slavery and labour exploitation. 

In 2022, CLP Procurement Supply Chain Management (PSCM) 
established its Procurement Supply Chain Management 
Sustainability Vision and a three-year roadmap defining the 
focus areas of responsible procurement. 

In accordance with this new roadmap, CLP released its 
first Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) in December 2022, 
and updated the Responsible Procurement Policy Statement 

which has been in use by the Group since 2012. The 
SCoC is derived from CLP’s values, policies, standards and 
objectives, and clearly states CLP’s expectations on the 
suppliers it is doing business with and those who want to 
do business with CLP.  The SCoC articulates 11 responsible 
procurement practices.

Aligning business activities with community, employee and customer expectations

Supplier Code of Conduct – responsible procurement practices

Understanding the importance of upholding human rights 
along its supply chain, CLP’s SCoC incorporated this essential 
element in the following three focus areas:

• Labour Practices and Human Rights: CLP respects all 
internationally recognised human rights relevant to its 
operations and recognises the value of its employees, 
their families and the communities it operates in.  As 
a responsible business, CLP is committed to cascading 
this value to its operations and its suppliers to provide a 
dignified, fair and equal workplace.

• Employee Health and Safety: In 2022, the International 
Labour Organisation (ILO) adopted a safe and healthy work 
environment as one of the fundamental principles and 
rights at work. CLP continued to safeguard the health, 
safety, and wellbeing of its employees as part of the 
Company’s core value. CLP will provide guidance and 
support to its suppliers to create a healthy and safe 
workplace for their employees.   

• Diversity and Inclusion: CLP operates in multiple 
jurisdictions with a workforce and customer base from 
a variety of different cultures and backgrounds. It is 
committed to providing an inclusive and diverse workplace 
allowing it to serve its diverse portfolio of customers.

Having introduced this SCoC, CLP is now establishing a third-
party risk management framework to ensure transparency of 
supplier performance along the value chain and to enhance 
itscapability to assess the different types of risks associated 
with its supply chain.

In introducing these measures, CLP will work with its 
suppliers in a collaborative way and help them in building 
sustainable businesses.

Organisational agility
Organisational agility allows CLP to respond to a changing energy market and to the social and 
geopolitical uncertainties that continue to reshape its business landscape.

CLP implemented a fit-for-purpose operating model in Hong 
Kong and Mainland China, establishing three business lines 
(Hong Kong Scheme of Control, China Power Development and 
Energy Solutions) and two key shared capabilities: Projects & 
Operations (to execute the zero-carbon project pipeline) and 
Digital. The operating model is intended to better align the 
way CLP operates to strategy and accelerate transformation 
towards the Utility of the Future.

Other initiatives aimed at building employee agility, including 
flexible work options, employee engagement initiatives were 
also implemented to foster an agile and open work culture. 
Design thinking and digital capabilities programmes were 
hosted to enhance skills and agile thinking.

Over 4,100 employees have participated in the Design 
Thinking Programme since its launch in 2019, with employees 
now applying design thinking in projects ranging from 
digital transformation and productivity to safety and 
customer service.

The Power of Design Thinking

In the post-COVID-19 pandemic context, The Future of Work 
agenda has emerged and is being debated around the world. 
More initiatives and flexible work arrangements continue to be 
introduced at CLP to support talent attraction and retention 
and to provide a more family-friendly work environment.

Workplace safety and wellbeing
CLP’s strong performance in this topic benefits its people by protecting the health, safety and 
wellbeing of workers in all CLP locations. Safe operations, such as minimising the risk of COVID-19 
virus transmission, also benefits the communities in which CLP operates.

2022 continued to be challenging with the ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic across the globe. Employee health and wellness was 
promoted through flexible working arrangements, equipment 
setups for remote working, regular communications, as well as 
health and wellbeing initiatives targeting mental and physical 
health awareness. Each region responded comprehensively in 
supporting their employees, particularly in respect to mental 
health and ergonomics.

Throughout 2022, a series of programmes covering wellbeing, 
mindset, resilience and high-performance for senior leaders 
were organised. They included activities to support health and 
wellbeing such as the launch of the IncrediPlay platform, an 
online site uniting staff through common wellbeing interests.

Similar initiatives have been gaining more weight in Mainland 
China with a tailored digital health platform launched in 2022. 
Over 500 staff have participated in its activities since the 
launch date.

Customer-facing energy solutions
Supporting decentralised energy solutions benefits people by enabling flexible, reliable and 
cost-effective access to clean energy. Delivering better end-use solutions, in turn, benefits the 
environment by reducing per capita GHG emissions and curbing long-term physical climate risks.

As the energy market evolves to be more customer-centric, 
CLP aspires to become a Utility of the Future with innovation 
and adoption of new technologies, bringing cleaner and 
smarter power supply to its customers. Throughout 2022, CLP 
continued accelerating its digital capabilities and integrating 
digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet 
of Things and big data, into its operations. For example, the 
adoption rate of CLP Power platforms, such as Company 
website and CLP mobile app, amongst the CLP Power 
customer base has increased significantly from 7% in 2019 
to 63% by 2022.

Digitalisation empowers CLP with data that allows a better 
understanding of customers’ preferences and behaviours, 
beyond just individual electricity bill accounts. In 2022, 
CLP Power invited around 600,000 households to reduce 
their energy consumption in the Summer Savers' Rebate 
Programme, in which reward points were provided to 
residential customers with smart meters to reduce energy 
use during peak demand periods on hot summer days. Smart 
air conditioner control with artificial intelligence was also 
introduced to help participating households reduce their 
consumptions during the events. The programme successfully 
encouraged customers to adjust their consumption behaviour 
with a total of 300,000kWh of electricity saved over a four-
hour period.

Recognising the enormous potential that digitalisation 
presents for customers, CLPe continued to provide bespoke 
energy-saving service solutions with digital elements. For 
example, CLPe signed a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) 
agreement with Chinachem Group to build a new water-
cooled air conditioning system bundled with Green Electricity 
Certificates (GECs) at Nina Tower in Hong Kong. This was 
the first zero-carbon chiller system project in Hong Kong . 
CLPe also commenced a distributed solar system at the 
headquarters of MTR Corporation (Shenzhen) Limited in 
Longhua District. It is expected to generate 1,300MWh of 
renewable energy per year, equivalent to a reduction of 16,000 

tonnes of carbon emissions associated with electricity during 
the contracting period.

CLP has invested over HK$780 million since 2017 and 
tapped into the leading technologies emerging in this space. 
Investments included direct equity stakes, venture capital 
funds and joint venture investment partnerships in new 
technologies that have the potential to shape the future of the 
energy sector and bring products or services to CLP customers 
that support their decarbonisation efforts.

One of the signature joint venture investment partnerships in 
2022 was with Hydro X. The company specialises in developing 
an energy-efficient, environmentally friendly chemical process 
to store hydrogen using water and bicarbonate at near room 
temperature and pressure. This technological breakthrough 
will bring safe and efficient hydrogen-handling solutions to 
customers and create a paradigm shift in transportation and 
operations across various sectors and industries.

The accelerating pace of environmental, technological, regulatory and social changes has 
reinforced the importance of business resilience. CLP recognises the strategic value of 
anticipating, withstanding and learning from disruptive events, especially in response to the 
growing threats posed by climate change and cybercrime.
 

Cyber resilience and data protection
Because of CLP’s role in providing critical power infrastructure, a significant cyber security 
breach could have a massive impact on local economies by temporarily shuttering essential 
energy services. Cyber resilience and effective data protection measures allow employees and 
customers to proceed with their activities without fear or threat of cyberattack.

To counter this and to minimise its exposure to the ever-
growing risks posed by cyber threats, CLP has built up strong 
governance practices and a capable and highly experienced 
team within CLP Digital.

The Board-level Audit & Risk Committee maintains effective 
oversight of cyber security risks, while Security, a department 
of CLP Digital, is responsible for the protection of the 
Company.  From a cyber perspective, this protection 
ranges from:

• Promoting cyber security and data protection awareness 
amongst staff;

• Ensuring cyber security threats across both CLP’s 
Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology 
(IT) systems are reduced to acceptable levels; and

• Constantly monitoring CLP systems to deny an attacker 
any advantage.

During the year, CLP Digital undertook a comprehensive 
review of its cyber security strategy with the support of an 
external cyber security specialist consultancy. The review’s 
aim was to ready CLP for the potential challenges of operating 
as a Utility of the Future.

As a result of the review, at an operational level, CLP Digital has 
developed 20 cyber security standards which align with the 
internationally-recognised NIST Cyber Security Framework. 
They provide, for the first time, a comprehensive system of 
acceptable operational practice that will define the Company’s 
cyber operations going forward. The revised standards will be 
introduced and implemented in early 2023.

CLP puts great effort into building a corporate culture that 
can deal with the future challenges associated with handling 
the accelerating volume of data produced by digital assets. 
During the year, a wide range of educational initiatives to eqip 
employees with cyber security capabilities were delivered 
across the Group, including internal broadcasts, briefing 
sessions, pop-up booths and webinars. Furthermore, teams of 
employee volunteers were engaged in CLP Power’s businesses 
as “Cyber Champions” to help deliver key security messages 
directly to fellow employees and collect valuable feedback on 
the effectiveness of CLP Digital’s policies and standards.

Reinforcing resilience in a changing operating environment

Building Resilience in the face of climate change and an evolving 
business environment
Adapting CLP’s physical assets to cope with the disruptive realities of climate change benefits the 
economy by maintaining a reliable energy supply, even in the face of extreme weather events. By 
promoting resilient operations, CLP can also support the energy needs of vulnerable communities 
who are particularly susceptible to physical climate risks such as sea-level rises and outages 
caused by storms.

CLP’s approach to building resilience against climate change 
starts with effective risk management. Recognising climate 
change risks might reasonably impact the business over time, 
climate change risks are fully integrated into CLP’s Group-wide 
risk management system, with management oversight and 
assurance provided to the Board.

CLP considers the resilience of its Climate Vision 2050 and 
other strategic plans by using three climate scenarios. Each 
scenario provides a future state over a typical time horizon of 
20 to 30 years. In tandem, CLP has also developed a financial 
model to help understand the financial impacts of these risks 
across the Group in different time horizons up to 2050.

The nature and extent of climate change risks vary across 
geographies. CLP not only considers this variance in its various 
regions of operation during its risk management process, it 
also conducts asset-level physical climate risk assessments to 
build the resilience of individual assets in each region.

In Hong Kong, CLP Power completed a physical climate change 
risk assessment and climate change adaptation study with 
the support of external consultancies in 2022. This multiple-
year study applied rigorous processes of climate hazard 
screening and impact assessment workshops with relevant 
internal stakeholders. The study was followed by various 
adaptation measures implemented by CLP Power to minimise 
service delivery disruption against the key physical climate 
change risks identified. Key climate hazards, such as extreme 
heat, flash rain, coastal flooding and super typhoons, were 
earmarked for further detailed risk assessment. To set a 
high-level guidance for climate change risk assessment and 
adaptation practice during operation, CLP Power issued an 
Asset Management Standard on Climate Change Adaptation 
for generation and network assets. The standard will be 
reviewed at least every three years to keep abreast of the 
latest climate models and trends.

In India, Apraava Energy conducted a climate risk assessment 
using Physical Climate Risk Screening tool software. This 
helped forecast changing weather patterns at a specific 
geographic location. Apraava Energy also utilises the software

Environmental management and compliance
Our approach
CLP strives to manage the environmental impact of 
electricity generation responsibly. CLP has in place an 
established and effective environmental management system 
and process to improve its resource efficiency and 
environmental performance.

This Group-wide environmental management system is 
contained with the CLP Group Health, Safety and Environment 
Management System (HSEMS), which is driven by the new 
integrated Group HSE Policy.

The policy declares CLP’s aim of building individual, team and 
organisational capabilities and capacities to prevent harm to 
its people, its assets and the communities in which it operates. 
CLP's HSEMS sets out how it implements the policy.

Having an environmental management system supports 
CLP’s endeavours to maintain full compliance with applicable 
environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in 
which it operates. Established processes are in place to 
review relevant environmental laws and regulations for new 
investments, or other updates to existing regulations.

GRI reference: 2-23

The CLP Group HSEMS provides a framework to identify and 
manage significant environmental issues arising from new 
investments, project planning and operations.

Following the ‘plan, do, check, act’ (PDCA) cycle, the 
environmental processes in the HSEMS manage the 
environmental pillar of the Group’s HSE Improvement 
Strategy. They also require the environmental risks and 
opportunities associated with a project's operational life cycle 
to be appropriately managed.

The environmental tools and processes covered in the 
HSEMS include:

• Project Inception/Planning Stage:

– Environmental impact assessments

– Environmental due diligence and climate 
risk assessment

• Project Construction Stage:

– Environmental monitoring and audit

• Project Operation:

– Environmental Management System (EMS) and 
associated data management platform

Learn more about CLP’s HSEMS

At the project planning stage, environmental due diligence and 
climate risk assessment are conducted to identify potential 
environmental risks, liabilities and impacts of proposed 
projects, as part of CLP’s Pre-investment Environmental 
Risk Assessment.

CLP considers the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) a 
crucial step in ensuring all relevant environmental impacts 
such as air quality and biodiversity have been properly 
considered and addressed by effective mitigation measures. 
CLP has processes in place to fulfil the strict EIA requirements 
and recommendations stipulated by local regulators and it 
follows these same assessment requirements in countries 
where regulations are not as stringent. For instance, CLP 
mandates an EIA for all major generation projects in India, even 
though it is not a statutory requirement for renewable energy 
projects in the country.

Read about how environmental aspects are 
considered in new projects

Over the years, CLP has diligently managed environmental 
impacts in line with international best practices. For 
example, under the HSEMS, all power generation assets 
of which CLP has operational control or joint operational 
control are required to achieve third-party certification to 
the international standard, ISO 14001:2015 Environmental 
Management Systems, within two years from the 
commencement of operation or acquisition. In 2022, all assets 
in this category have successfully certified their EMS to the ISO 
14001: 2015 standard.

Initiatives and progress
Driven by the Group’s HSE Improvement Strategy, CLP 
develops performance indicators with goals and targets 
to help monitor the progress and effectiveness of its 
environmental strategies, plans and programmes.

Environmental targets and data management
In 2022, CLP developed a new set of group-wide annual 
environmental targets covering air emissions, waste and 
water management for its fossil fuel plants, which account 
for the majority of CLP’s emissions and resource consumption. 
To drive continuous improvements and meet external 
stakeholder expectations, CLP’s group-wide environmental 
targets are tracked and reviewed on an annual basis. 
Details of the targets are discussed in the respective 
environmental sections.

Digital technology in data management is deployed to ensure 
data integrity and measure progress against targets, as 
well as facilitate the follow-up actions for each asset for 
continual improvement. In addition to CLP’s customised 
Group Operations Information System (GOIS), CLP has 
been implementing MonitorPro, an environmental data 
management system across all its operational assets in 
Australia. The tool is designed to safeguard environmental 
data, automate trend analysis and data reporting and support 
compliance and risk management.

Environmental regulations and compliance
SASB reference: IF-EU-140a.2; GRI reference: 2-27, 306-3 (2016), 307-1

CLP closely monitors developments in environmental 
regulatory requirements. In Hong Kong, the emission 
allowances of CLP's power plants have been progressively 
tightened over time through the Technical Memorandums 
(TM) of the Air Quality Control Ordinance. Since 2022, a 
new set of emission caps requires CLP Power Hong Kong 
Limited (CLP Power) to further reduce the emissions of 
sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Respiratory 
Suspended Particulates (RSP) by 12% to 27% compared with 
the 2021 level which CLP Power has achieved. Discussion with 
the Hong Kong Government on the review of the latest TM is in 
progress, as the new 2028 emissions caps will be promulgated 
in 2023.

In India, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate 
Change issued the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, 
which will be effective from April 2023. These rules require 
the bulk consumers of electrical and electronic equipment, 
including solar PV panels/cells, to ensure their e-waste will 
be handed over only to the registered producer, refurbishing 
entity or recycler. A gap assessment is under progress to 
ensure compliance of all applicable statutory requirements by 
March 2023.

Emerging policy changes in relation to GHG emissions are 
discussed in the Climate-related Disclosures Report.

2 The number excludes eight cases of short-term licence limit exceedances from Jhajjar. Details on the incidences are outlined below.
3 The number was restated to align the calculation methodology across years.

In Australia, there were six environmental licence breaches 
recorded in 2022.

Three of them were relevant to marginal air emissions 
exceedances. One related to particulate matter emissions 
at Mount Piper Power Station, and two others related 
to particulate matters and SO2 emissions at Yallourn 
Power Station.

Another two breaches were from Mount Piper Power Station 
during a 21-day emergency discharge event. One related to 
the exceedance of the daily limit of discharge volume, while 
another one related to missing oil and grease test in the weekly 
water samples.

The local Environment Protection Authority (EPA) was notified 
of these five incidents. Associated corrective and preventive 
active actions have been taken by EnergyAustralia to prevent 
recurrence of similar incidents. None of them resulted in any 
actions by EPA.

The other licence limit exceedance case related to oil spillage 
from Jeeralang Power Station due to the failure of one of 
its unit transformers. The oil contamination was cleaned up 
by using vacuum tankers and removing the contaminated 
soil. EnergyAustralia notified EPA and is currently liaising with 
them for a case review.

In India, there were eight cases of short-term SO2 licence 
limit exceedances at Jhajjar Power Station in 2022. In all 
these incidents, Jhajjar Power Station had requested a 
loading reduction or shutdown of the unit to control SO2 

emissions. However, the State Load Dispatch Centre of India 
denied permission to reduce the loading or shutdown of the 
unit due to the state’s high power demand. Subsequently, 
Jhajjar Power Station continued to run the unit and 
recorded exceedences. All these exceedances were reported 
to the regulatory authorities (the Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB) and Haryana State Pollution Control Board 
(HSPCB)) which have not imposed any penalties or taken any 
further action.

Air emissions
Our approach
Air quality remains a challenge in many of the geographies in 
which CLP operates. CLP reduces its air pollutant emissions 
while it expands its renewable and nuclear energy portfolio. 
Nonetheless, further emission reductions from existing 
fossil fuel power stations remain a high priority in the 
Group’s strategy.

Strategies and procedures
CLP’s Power Plant Air Emissions Standard stipulates that 
any fossil fuel-based power plant developed after October 
2018 (when the Standard became effective) is required to 
operate within CLP’s prescribed limits on sulphur dioxide (SO2), 
nitrogen oxides (NOx) and total particulate matter (total PM), 
or they must fully comply with local regulations, whichever is 
more stringent.

In addition to incorporating state-of-the-art air emissions 
mitigation measures into plant management, CLP also designs 
new gas-fired power stations with advanced generation 
technologies. These new technologies produce electricity 
more efficiently, and assist in further lowering air pollutant and 
GHG emissions.

Monitoring and follow-up
The Company monitors air emissions (NOx, SO2, and total PM) 
from facilities under its operational control using a continuous 
emissions monitoring system and/or stack sampling and 
mass-balance calculation methodologies. CLP is also cognisant 
of the increasing focus on mercury emissions from coal-fired 
power plants and has reported mercury quantities from its 
coal-fired power plants since 2021.

Initiatives and progress
CLP has a long-term commitment dedicated to managing its 
fuel mix and various mitigating measures to respond to climate 
change and air quality improvements.

SASB reference: If-EU-120a.1; GRI reference: 305-7

Depending on the asset type, different environmental metrics 
are material to CLP’s portfolio. Coal-fired power plants, such as 
Yallourn, Mount Piper, Jhajjar and Castle Peak Power Stations, 
are the key contributors to the Group's air emissions, and the 
emissions metrics are heavily influenced by the performance 
of these plants. 

CLP has set intensity targets for air emissions, namely NOx, 
SO2 and PM, where short-term targets are set annually based 
on the three-year average performance of the fossil fuel 
plants. Further performance improvements can be driven 
by the long-term commitment of decommissioning; hence, 
asset retirement planning is considered when determining 
long-term targets.

The 2022 target scope covers fossil fuel plants under 
operational control, which accounts for the majority of 
CLP’s emissions. The emission targets and the year-end 
achievements are shown in the following table:

2022 Target 2022 Performance Achievement 2030 Target

Air 
Emission 
Intensity

NOx (t/GWh) 0.77 0.72 0.65

SO2 (t/GWh) 0.93 0.81 0.69

PM (t/GWh) 0.13 0.11 0.04

During the year, CLP achieved all three air emission targets 
by optimising its diversified fuel mix and maintaining the 
effectiveness of its emissions control facilities. Compared to 
2021, the NOx, SO2, and PM emission intensity of fossil fuel 
assets reduced by 1%, 4% and 7% respectively.

The key programmes in 2022 included:

• Air emission control measures and upgrading

CLP has been implementing various air emission control 
measures and upgrading its infrastructure with advanced 
emissions reduction technology in its fossil fuel plants. In 
Hong Kong, CLP Power completed a multi-year project to 
upgrade eight older gas-fired generation units at Black

Point Power Station in January 2022. The project reduced 
NOx emissions, while increased operational efficiency of 
the upgraded generation units, leading to an improved 
performance on carbon emissions.

Further, Black Point Power Station’s new gas-fired 
generation unit D1, commissioned in 2020, uses a selective 
catalytic reduction system to reduce NOx emissions. The 
same technology will be deployed in another new gas-
fired unit (Unit D2) currently being constructed at the 
power station, further reducing NOx emissions after its 
full operation in 2024. Flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) 
units were deployed at Jhajjar Power Station in India and 
Fangchenggang Power Station in Mainland China which not 
only lower SO2 emissions but also further reduce PM and 
mercury emissions, a co-benefit of FGD.

• Hazardous emissions assessment and monitoring 
programmes

EnergyAustralia assessed Class 3 air quality indicators, 
which classify the most hazardous air pollutants under 
Victorian environmental legislation, at Yallourn Power 
Station to evaluate its impacts on local air quality. The 
assessment covered the hazardous chemicals of dioxins, 
furans, and metals. Extensive stack emissions testing 
and a detailed air quality impact modelling assessment 
were conducted. Compared with Air Pollution Assessment 
Criteria (APAC), the Class 3 air quality substances 
assessment results showed that Yallourn Power Station 
has made insignificant contributions of hazardous chemical 
emissions to the air.

Starting from 2022, Jhajjar Power Station successfully 
complied with United States EPA standard methods 
for mercury sampling at its chimneys to estimate the 
mercury quantities.

• Upgrade of emissions monitoring systems

CLP continuously reviews its emissions monitoring 
system to align with industry best practices in air 
emissions controls.

At Mount Piper Power Station, a Particulate Matter 
Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (PM-CEMS) has 
been successfully installed, calibrated and commissioned 
according to the United States EPA PS11 Standard. This 
is the first PM-CEMS of its type to be calibrated to 
this standard at a coal-fired power station in Australia 
with a baghouse filter. This filter enables reliable and 
accurate data for monitoring and improved control of PM. 
The control of PM emissions also improved the overall 
maintenance and management of the baghouse filter.

At Yallourn Power Station, the Continuous Emissions 
Monitoring System has also been upgraded to enhance 
its capacity for monitoring NOx and SO2 emissions alongside 
particulates and CO emissions which were already installed 
across all operating units.

• Risk management on emissions impact

As air emission levels are largely correlated to the types of 
fuel used, whenever there are changes of fuel used at the 
power plants, CLP will undergo a risk management process 
to assess any changes of air emission levels and its impacts 
on the local vicinity.

During the year, there was a significant gas shortage in 
Australia which triggered the need for EnergyAustralia’s 
gas assets to fire gas turbines on diesel fuel. As the change 
of fuel source can potentially create visible emissions, 
comprehensive risk management processes were carried 
out at the gas-fired power stations of Newport and 
Jeeralang to ensure operations remained as clean as 
possible. EnergyAustralia also commissioned monitoring 
studies to collect emissions performance data and informed 
communities of the potential of more visible emissions than 
firing on natural gas.

Group-level air emissions

Total emissions in 2022 decreased mainly due 
to reduced coal-fired power generation and less 
emissions from Yallourn Power Station,  Mount 
Piper Power Station and Castle Peak B 
Power Station.

Improvement of Hong Kong’s air quality through the Black Point 
Power Station gas turbine upgrade project
Components of the gas turbine unit upgrade

Since 2015, CLP Power has been upgrading gas 
turbines for all eight older gas-fired generation 
units at the Black Point Power Station. The 
project was successfully completed in early 
2022. The upgrades improve unit efficiency, 
reduce NOx and CO2 emissions and bring 
about an incremental increase of unit capacity 
that supports improvements to Hong Kong’s 
air quality. 
The gas turbine upgrade project involved upgrading and 
replacing several components to achieve state-of-the-
art design. It included upgrading the entire combustion 
system with a complete change-out of associated fuel 
systems, all hot-gas path components and an un-flared 
compressor. One of the major environmental benefits 
of the upgrade is the performance guarantee of NOx 

emission reduction from 50 mg/Nm3 to 30 mg/Nm3 by the 
advanced low NOx burner, which leads to a significant 
decrease in NOx emissions intensity. The increase in 
thermal efficiency also lowers carbon intensity which 
aligns with CLP’s vision on decarbonisation.

In addition to the environmental benefits, the upgraded 
system also improves fuel flexibility, lowers turndown 
periods and extends maintenance inspection intervals. All 
these benefits translate to consumer savings in terms of 
operating costs.

Having signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) 
agreement with GE Gas Power (GE) in 2021, CLP is 
currently working collaboratively with GE to explore the 
feasibility of using a variable blend of natural gas and 
hydrogen at Black Point Power Station, with the aim of 
further reducing its carbon emissions in the future.

Emissions avoided after the gas turbine unit upgrade

Biodiversity and land use
Our approach
CLP strives to preserve and enhance natural resources 
while encouraging biodiversity with the Group’s goal of 
“no net loss of biodiversity”. Targets are site-specific and 
depend on the different levels of regulatory controls on 
biodiversity, from assessment requirements through to 
ecological compensation.

GRI reference: 304-1, 304-2, 304-4

Strategies and procedures
CLP’s internal Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
standard mandates an environmental assessment for all new 
projects. During the EIA stage, CLP partners with qualified 
personnel to conduct a biodiversity impact assessment in 
accordance with the CLP Biodiversity Impact Assessment 
Guideline. The Guideline applies to power generation, 
transmission and distribution, mines and other power-related 
projects, and provides a framework for a systemic assessment 
of biodiversity impacts.

The Guideline takes into consideration the IUCN Red List 
of Threatened Species and national conservation lists of 
threatened species, and provides guidance on managing 
biodiversity risks. Any new operations that could affect the 
IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and a country’s national 
conservation list of threatened species are flagged well ahead 
of any investment decision.

The biodiversity impact assessment observes local legislative 
requirements and references the International Finance 
Corporation Sustainability Framework. It describes the 
baseline conditions, evaluates the magnitude and significance 
of project impacts, and investigates options for mitigation. 
The assessment only contemplates offsets after considering 
options relating to avoidance, minimisation, and restoration 
or rehabilitation.

See CLP’s holistic approach to assessing 
new investments

Initiatives and progress
While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to managing 
biodiversity impacts, CLP continues its ongoing efforts in 
biodiversity conservation and land remediation, considering 
factors such as location and level of development in 
the vicinity.

GRI reference: 304-3, EU13

Biodiversity enhancement programmes in 2022 included:

• Vegetation management

The Predictive Vegetation Management System (PVMS), 
developed by CLP Power, was rolled out in March 2022. 
The system monitors the growth and condition of trees 
and vegetation that may affect overhead line operations. In 
around 210 locations, the PVMS and CLP Power’s existing 
tree inventory record have identified tall trees near CLP 
Power’s transmission and distribution overhead lines for 
replacement by native short trees throughout its Tree 
Replacement Programme. This treatment aligns with the 
Hong Kong Government's 'Right Tree & Right Place' Policy 
and Nature Conservation Policy.

• Aquaculture and fisheries conservation

Set up by the Hong Kong Offshore LNG Terminal Project in 
Hong Kong in 2020, the Marine Conservation Enhancement 
Fund (MCEF) and the Fisheries Enhancement Fund (FEF) 
continue to support marine conservation and fisheries 
enhancement projects. The funds have since granted 

approximately HK$31.4 million to support 27 projects and 
HK$23.2 million to support 12 projects respectively. The 
funded projects under MCEF relate to marine conservation, 
habitat restoration and rehabilitation, as well as education 
and ecotourism. For the FEF, the funded initiatives relate to 
fisheries education and tourism, enhancement of fisheries 
resources, and sustainable fishery development.

• Combatting desertification

Recognising the threats to wildlife by desertification and 
land degradation, CLP China carried out annual tree 
planting activities at the Jinchang Solar Farm in the Gobi 
Desert and made tremendous efforts to maintain good 
tree conditions under extreme weather. CLP China also 
actively participated in the tree planting programmes 
organised by the Government in Jinchang. Various species 
of trees, including pine and Amygdalus triloba, were 
planted at the Xipo shelterbelt near the Jinchang Solar 
Power Station, which helped build a local ecological barrier 
to combat the environmental hazards. The programme has 
contributed to windbreak and sand fixation for Jinchang. 
Other assets in Mainland China, such as Lingyuan, have 
also planted trees near power stations for a green and 
sustainable environment.

• Habitat restoration programme

CLP strives to increase the populations of local species 
and enhance local biodiversity through various habitat 
restoration programmes. During the year, EnergyAustralia

established a Biodiversity Conservation Agreement (BCA) 
over a parcel of land adjacent to the Thompson Creek 
Reservoir. The BCA guarantees the protection of the native 
vegetation and habitat on the land from clearing and future 
development, even if the property is sold. Yallourn Power 
Station also rehabilitated 34.4 hectares of land within its 
mined area in 2022 by establishing either native seed or 

pasture grass to help stabilise exposed landforms. With 
power generation and mining set to cease in 2028 at 
Yallourn, EnergyAustralia has embarked on developing 
rehabilitation and remediation plans for both the Yallourn 
Power Station and Mine aiming at repurposing the site 
to provide local amenities for community development 
including conservation and recreation areas.

Case study

A 10-year forest restoration programme partnered with Kadoorie 
Farm and Botanic Garden Corporation (KFBG) to build science-
informed capacity for combating climate change
CLP is sponsoring KFBG for a forest restoration 
programme. It is expected to contribute to 
ecological research, provide insights into carbon 
sequestration potential of science-informed 
reforestation, and build CLP’s knowledge of 
nature-based solutions.
Nature-based solutions are increasingly seen as a vital 
part of the global efforts to achieve the Paris Agreement 
goals on climate change.

These involve actions to conserve, restore, and manage 
natural ecosystems in a sustainable manner, with both 
societal and biodiversity benefits. Recognising that forest 
conservation and restoration is one of the key strategies 
for tackling climate change, CLP entered a signature 
10-year partnership with KFBG to support a native forest 
restoration programme in Hong Kong. KFBG’s ecological 
restoration efforts have been recognised by Botanic 
Gardens Conservation International.

The partnership programme consists of a HK$10-million 
sponsorship that will support KFBG in planting up to 
25,000 native trees of 200 different species or more, and 
numerous understorey plants to help restore 10 hectares 
of diverse upland tropical forest in KFBG’s nature reserve.

The programme is expected to contribute to nature 
recovery and biodiversity with the potential to enable 
the reintroduction of critically endangered native plants, 
with anticipated positive knock-on effects for pollinators 
and other wildlife. Throughout the programme, research 
will be conducted with the aim of helping to establish 
global best practices in forest restoration.

The programme will help build CLP’s knowledge and 
capacity in reforestation, ecosystem recovery, and 
nature-based solutions for carbon offsetting, which can 
potentially be applied to its business operation across 
regions and contribute to its longer-term decarbonisation 
goals. Knowledge gained from this programme will 
be shared with authorities, the academic community, 
and a broad range of stakeholders through regular 
engagement. The research findings from this programme 
may also inform relevant biodiversity-related policy and 
regulations as needed.

Delineation of nature-related risks and opportunities through 
baseline biodiversity assessment at Jhajjar Power Station

In India, Jhajjar Power Station engaged the 
Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) to 
carry out a baseline biodiversity survey and 
assessment in 2022. The initiative followed 
Apraava Energy’s Natural Capital Action Plan 
(NCAP) aimed at mitigating biodiversity loss. 
The project received a “Commendation for 
Significant Achievement in Biodiversity” in the 
CII ITC Sustainability Awards 2022 (Award 
category: Domain-Biodiversity).
The baseline assessment was conducted at Jhajjar’s major 
ecosystems and habitats, including about 496 hectares 
of plant area, the township, nearby villages and eco-
sensitive areas, across three seasons as per India Business 
& Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) directives. The assessment 
scope includes site surveys, ecosystem services risk 
mapping, supplier surveys, biodiversity indexing, and 
NCAP development. Critical ecosystems and ecosystem 
services were identified, and dependency on ecosystem 
services was evaluated.      

The biodiversity at Jhajjar was measured in terms of 
the biodiversity index that depicted the project area’s 
biodiversity status, enlisting four critical ecosystems/
habitats greenbelt plantation, ash dyke, reservoir, 
and natural forest. It further assessed the carbon 
sequestration potential of the trees planted in the power 
plant and the township areas based on the volumes 
and biomass of the tree species. It was assessed that 
the amount of carbon sequestered by trees planted 
so far was about 33,000 tonnes over their lifespan. 
Further, the assessment result showed that the number 
of flora and fauna species is far higher than that reported 
in the previous EIA of the studied area, indicating an 
improvement of biodiversity.

Overall, Jhajjar’s biodiversity value is considered the 
highest in the region. Through the Baseline Biodiversity 
Assessment with the NCAP, it enables the maintenance 
of the diversity of species, habitats, ecosystems, and the 
integrity of ecological functions, seizing opportunities for 
enhancing biodiversity.

Waste
Our approach
CLP endeavours to reduce both the hazardous and non-
hazardous waste it generates as part of its operations. 
Whenever possible, CLP works with qualified parties and 
partners to reuse or recycle materials.

SASB reference: IF-EU-150a.1 and IF-EU-150a.2; GRI reference: 301-2, 306-1, 

306-2, 306-3, 306-4, 306-5 

Strategies and procedures
CLP follows a waste management hierarchy (i.e. prevent, 
reduce, reuse, recycle, replace, treat and dispose) which 
prioritises the most preferred actions that minimise waste 
generation in daily operations. CLP seeks to avoid using 
hazardous materials and replaces them with alternatives 
wherever possible. All hazardous and non-hazardous waste 
is managed in accordance with local regulations, and is 
either collected for disposal by licensed contractors or sold 
for recycling.

At CLP’s coal-fired power stations, coal ash from coal 
combustion and gypsum from the flue gas desulphurisation 
process constitute the majority of by-products from 
operations. CLP endeavours to reuse them for construction 

and other applications in line with local regulations and 
practices rather than dispose of them. While the volume of 
solid and liquid waste generated by regular CLP operations is 
relatively small, projects involving demolition and construction 
usually increase the amount of non-hazardous solid waste.

In addition to the measures at power stations, CLP also drives 
employees’ behavioural changes in waste management by 
setting up recycling facilities at power stations and office 
premises. E-learning courses on waste management are 
available to enhance employee knowledge of the latest waste 
trends and recycling best practices.

Monitoring and follow-up
CLP monitors waste generation on a monthly basis through 
tracking the solid and liquid forms of hazardous and non-
hazardous waste produced and recycled at its facilities.

All ash impoundments from CLP-owned plants (i.e. the various 
ash lagoons holding from Castle Peak Power Station in Hong 
Kong, Jhajjar Power Station in India, Yallourn Power Station 
in Australia and Fangchenggang Power Station in Mainland 
China) have been reviewed and are considered as having low 
hazard potential with satisfactory structural integrity.

Initiatives and progress
CLP implements various measures to reduce the waste 
generated during electricity generation and operation. It 
recycles its hazardous and non-hazardous solid and liquid 
waste and, where feasible, sells by-products, such as ash and 
gypsum, for reuse in other industries.

Individual assets generate different types of waste, whereas 
coal-fired assets are the key contributors and account for 
about 90% of the Group's total waste generated. The amount 
of waste produced and recycled is not related to the amount 
of electricity sent out but to the maintenance and construction 
activities as well as local waste treatment practices.

In 2022, CLP reviewed the volume, characteristics, recycling 
and disposal patterns of waste from its fossil fuel plants. 
CLP has set targets for the recycling rate of non-hazardous 
and hazardous solid waste, as well as hazardous liquid 
waste according to the best practice of waste management 
and local regulatory requirements. The goal is to minimise 
negative environmental impacts by reducing waste disposal 
and increasing recycling. As the amount of non-hazardous 
liquid waste generated in routine operations is minimal 
compared with other waste metrics, no targets were set 
regarding non-hazardous liquid waste.

1 Excluding the off-site treatment of 266 kl alkaline solution from a special event of the boiler chemical clean project at Castle Peak Power Station

In 2022, CLP set itself challenging targets on waste 
management, aiming to increase the recycling rate and reduce 
waste disposal quantities.  During the year, the hazardous 
liquid waste target was missed, caused primarily by a boiler 
chemical cleaning project at Castle Peak Power Station (CPPS), 
which is a special maintenance project conducted at a 10- 
to 15-year interval. During such prior projects, this waste 
could be fully treated and recycled on site. However, in 2022, 
due to site and operational constraints at CPPS, 266 kl spent 
alkaline solution arising from the boiler chemical cleaning 
operation was sent to the Hong Kong’s licensed Chemical 
Waste Treatment Centre for treatment in accordance with 
the local regulatory requirements.  If these quantities were 
excluded, the overall hazardous waste recycling rate would 
have achieved 94% which was close to the 95% target.

The hazardous solid waste target was also slightly missed. 
Historical data shows that the recycling rate and quantities 
of hazardous solid waste fluctuates widely in accordance to 
the maintenance cycle, and the majority of waste generated 
and recycled in this category was from the Selective Catalytic 
Reduction (SCR) System. In 2022, CPPS had an increase in used 
SCR catalysts disposal quantities. Used SCR catalysts cannot 
be recycled in Hong Kong and have to be disposed of according 
to local regulatory requirements. On the contrary, used SCR 
catalyst recycling is possible in Fangchenggang Power Station 
(FCG) in Mainland China but the recycled waste volume in 
2022 was lower compared to 2021. In addition, due to the 
divestment of FCG in 2022, the full year data of FCG has not 
been included. These factors are the main causes of a decrease 
in recycling percentage in 2022.

All targets set for non-hazardous solid waste were achieved. 
These included recycling scrap metal, removal of single-use 
plastics in catering facilities and separation of construction 
waste for reuse and recycling.

In an effort to implement the best practice of waste 
management, CLP runs various programmes to manage waste 
generated at different stages of the project life cycle, to 
contribute to the target set. The successful waste programmes 
will be continued and expanded across the Group in the 
coming years where appropriate. Learnings were shared 
internally and further with contractors to raise awareness 
and build capacity.

Looking ahead, CLP will continue to look for reduction or 
recycling opportunities for waste arising from its projects 
and operations, and other initiatives through project planning, 
internal waste reduction and communication programmes.  As 
waste target-setting is an evolving process, CLP will continue 
to refine the waste targets and the target-setting process, 
aiming at improving the waste recovery value and enhancing 
the circularity of the products and materials used in its 
operations.  In the medium to long term, CLP will strengthen 
its waste management practices according to the circular 
economy principles.

Methodology

Key programmes and initiatives in 2022 include:

• Reducing construction waste from new gas unit project in 
Black Point Power Station

During the construction period, the project team 
implemented a number of initiatives to eliminate, minimise 
or reduce waste arising from construction activities. In 
2022, the excavated construction and demolition (C&D) 
materials were sent to landfill for reuse as topping 
materials, which reduced over 9,000 tonnes of inert 
material disposal to public fill reception facilities. In 
addition, over 10,000m2 of recyclable plastic formwork 
was used for construction instead of temporary timber 
to minimise timber waste generation and conserve 
timber resources.

• Diverting legacy fuel waste for alternative use at Newport 
Power Station

In 2022, the Newport Power Station removed a significant 
volume (circa 600 tonnes) of legacy waste heavy fuel oil to 
proactively prevent any potential environmental incident 
due to an ageing tank. The fuel oil was diverted from waste 
disposal upon project completion and will be reused as fuel 
in the shipping industry.

• Implementing zero waste to landfill initiatives at Jhajjar 
Power Station

Jhajjar Power Station continued its efforts on waste 
minimisation with zero waste to landfill initiatives. This 
involves maximising the reuse of metallic waste, coal 

handling plant conveyor rubber belts, electronic cards, and 
actuators for secondary purposes within site premises. 
Jhajjar also avoided single-use plastic successfully and 
was certified as a single-use plastic free site by the 
Confederation of Indian Industries from November 2022. 
It also transitioned to a paperless office to reduce paper 
consumption through digitalisation.

• Recycling damaged solar panels at Jinchang Solar 
Power Station

The Jinchang Solar Power Station continued its initiative 
of returning damaged solar panels to solar panel 
manufacturers for recycling. This enables the reuse of 
aluminium frames, which accounts for a large part of 
solar panel waste, and the recovery of embedded panel 
components, such as silicon and silver. Since 2017, over 
3,718 solar panels have been returned for recycling.

• Promoting Circular Economy Principles to CLP Power staff

During the year, CLP launched an e-learning course and 
an internal webpage about Circular Economy Principles 
in Hong Kong. The initiative enhances staff awareness 
of utilising resources efficiently and realising sustainable 
development using Circular Economy Principles. CLP Power 
also started collecting polyfoam waste in its major premises 
for recycling and initiated Food Wise Week in Hong Kong 
to encourage staff to bring their own containers for buying 
takeaway food in canteens.

Ash and gypsum by-products recycled or sold

Total amount of ash and gypsum by-products recycled or sold decreased in 2022 mainly due to less coal-fired power 
generation. The percentage of ash recycled or sold increased while the percentage of gypsum slightly decreased.

China’s Plastic Reduction Idea Competition for waste and carbon 
footprint reduction
Recognising growing concerns about plastic 
waste, CLP China organised the Plastic Reduction 
Idea Competition to encourage new plastic waste 
reduction ideas from employees. In response, 
employees actively participated and shared their 
thoughts on substituting plastic with other 
reusable materials and how to avoid single-
use plastics.
Reducing plastic waste requires collective efforts on 
rethinking plastic use habits and seizing opportunities 
to reduce unnecessary usage at source and substitute 
alternative materials whenever feasible. Through this 
waste management competition, CLP China built an 
environmentally friendly culture among employees 
and harnessed their commitment to implementing 
environmental initiatives. Employees shared their ideas 
of feasible alternatives for plastic usage at offices 
and assets. 

Awarded ideas were adopted across all CLP China’s offices 
and assets to minimise plastic waste. All canteens in CLP 
China assets have stopped using single-use plastic meal 
boxes and tableware, for example, by replacing them with 
metal or glass items, particularly the takeaway boxes used 
by shift staff. In addition, some power stations are using 
bamboo baskets and reusable bags when purchasing 
canteen supplies. This simple measure has significantly 
reduced the amount of single-use plastic and plastic waste 
at power station sites.

Assets in CLP China used to feature many safety and 
corporate culture signs made of plastic. They have started 
using metal signage when replacing the signs. This is 
expected to reduce plastic waste by 50 kg per year in a 
sub-region. Some sub-regions, through their procurement 
processes, have replaced plastic stationery with paper 
and metal options.

Water
Our approach
The CLP Group uses seawater cooling or water recirculation 
processes in its generation plants to minimise water 
consumption and environmental impacts.

SASB reference: IF-EU-140a.3; GRI reference: 303-1, 303-2

Strategies and procedures
The quantity of water withdrawal and discharge in CLP’s 
operations is dominated by fossil fuel plants using once-
through seawater cooling. In this process, large quantities 
of seawater are used for cooling and returned to the sea with 
only a slight increase in water temperature. The total volume 
of water withdrawal and discharge is dependent on the total 
electricity generated.

Where freshwater is withdrawn for operations, CLP strives to 
reduce water use and reduce the freshwater intensity of the 
electricity generated. CLP’s power stations carry out a range 
of water conservation initiatives depending on site conditions, 
operational situation and age. The amount of water which can 
be recycled depends on factors such as location, power station 
design, and regulatory requirements.

Monitoring and follow-up
Water concern to CLP is two-fold.

On the one hand, water use in its power plants may impact 
local water quality and scarcity. To address this concern, 
impact assessments are carried out at the planning stage 
of new projects, in accordance with local requirements. This 
ensures that any impacts associated with project construction 
and plant operation are managed and mitigated to an 
acceptable level.

On the other hand, water security is a key risk managed at 
CLP’s fossil fuel and hydropower generation assets. Four out 
of seven of CLP’s fossil fuel plants use seawater for cooling. 

Where seawater cooling is not feasible, CLP strives to reduce 
freshwater use and adopt water recirculation process. Solar 
farms also use water to clean solar panels; however, the 
amount required is comparatively small. As a result, CLP’s risk 
exposure to water availability is limited.

CLP assesses water risks for new projects through systematic 
environmental due diligence, and annually thereafter using 
globally recognised tools such as WRI Aqueduct. The 
assessment covers parameters such as water availability, 
water sensitivity, water stress mapping, potential competing 
use with other stakeholders, and the management strategies 
in each region. Where a water supply risk is identified, the 
Company proactively engages with local stakeholders to 
understand their needs and with local water suppliers to 
mitigate or resolve the issue. The latest assessments across 
the Group indicate that current water supply regimes are 
stable, and the overall risk of substantial impact is minimal.

The quality of water discharges must also meet licensing 
and regulatory standards while maintaining CLP’s licence 
to operate. Under the environmental management system 
(EMS), the adverse impacts of water discharges are identified, 
monitored and controlled under programmes which are 
reviewed on a regular basis. Specific emergency response 
plans have also been developed to prevent and address the 
spillage or leakage of pollutants. As a result of the water 
treatment processes put in place, none of CLP’s operations 
significantly impact their respective water-receiving bodies.

To monitor water use efficiency, CLP tracks freshwater 
withdrawal, discharge, and intensity (based on electricity 
sent out). Internal targets are set each year to encourage 
continuous improvement in water management practices. 
CLP also participates in the CDP Water survey and, through 
disclosing water resource management data through the 
survey, CLP is able to benchmark its practices against 
industry peers.

Initiatives and progress
CLP has taken further steps to improve water management 
and reduce water discharge-related impacts in daily operation.

Fossil fuel assets are the key consumers of freshwater and 
the amount of water consumed is heavily influenced by 
the performance of these plants. CLP has committed to a 
freshwater consumption intensity target, where the short-
term target is set annually based on the 3-year average 

performance. Significant improvements depend on the long-
term commitment of decommissioning the key contributors 
and hence fossil fuel asset retirement planning is considered in 
determining the long-term target.

In 2022, the scope of the target covers fossil fuel plants under 
operational control, which account for the majority of CLP’s 
freshwater consumption. The water target and achievements 
in 2022 are shown in the following table.

In 2022, CLP achieved the target of freshwater consumption 
intensity through various water saving initiatives and 
measures.  CLP continues to track the volume of water 
recycling in its power stations for continual improvement. 
Considerable emphasis is placed on sharing good practices 
across the Group to maximise the benefit of an individual 
power station’s efforts.

Four out of CLP’s seven fossil fuel plants use seawater 
for cooling. The remaining three, Mount Piper, Jhajjar and 
Fangchenggang power plants, operate on a zero liquid 
discharge basis. The water is treated internally and recycled or 
reused in other parts of the power generation process, or for 
dust control or horticulture.

Best practice examples of CLP’s water management are 
summarised below:

• Water leakage management to minimise wastage in 
Hong Kong

The main power stations in Hong Kong are primarily 
reliant on seawater for cooling and freshwater from 
municipal supply for power generation processes. While 
the municipal water supply from the government is 
currently stable, the Black Point Power Station sought to 
further reduce and prevent the risk of physical water losses 
from the plants by replacing a batch of drain valves in 2022.

• Reduction of water wastage by reuse of plant process 
water and adoption of innovative technology in 
Mainland China

Fangchenggang Power Station continues to reuse treated 
wastewater for flue gas desulphurisation, dust suppression 
and irrigation. Other initiatives to reduce water use 
included deploying robotic cleaning systems for dust 
removal at CLP China’s solar farms.

• Wastewater discharge assessment in Australia

Following torrential rain in August 2022 at the Yallourn 
Power Station Mine, EnergyAustralia received approval 
from the Environment Protection Authority Victoria to 
temporarily discharge water from the Township Field 
Pond into the nearby Latrobe River. EnergyAustralia 
proactively conducted the environmental risk assessment 
and monitored the discharge water quality. It was 
concluded that there was minimal risk to the downstream 
environment of the Latrobe River.

• Increase of water use efficiency in India

Jhajjar Power Station has been progressively improving 
water use efficiency at its site through continual 
improvement measures. By enhancing cycles of

Freshwater withdrawal and discharge

Total freshwater withdrawal (including water for cooling and non-cooling) decreased slightly in 2022 due to less 
freshwater withdrawal at Mount Piper and Jhajjar Power Stations. The total freshwater discharge (including water for 
cooling and non-cooling) increased in 2022 primarily as a result of increased freshwater discharge at Yallourn coal mine 
due to heavy rainfall.

Case study

Engineered solution to avoid 
contamination of water 
resources in the vicinity of 
Mount Piper Power Station
EnergyAustralia has successfully designed and 
installed one of Australia's first lined dry 
ash repositories at its Mount Piper Power 
Station to prevent contamination of surface and 
groundwater resources in the vicinity.
Saltwater and ash are by-products from coal 
generation and are disposed of at a dry ash 
repository. EnergyAustralia designed a Leachate Barrier 
Management System, which involves installing a plastic 
liner at the base of the dry ash repository, to direct 
contaminated water to pass through the repository to a 
series of ponds for treatment and reuse. The Leachate 

Barrier Management System is an engineered solution 
that eliminates contamination, ensures regulatory 
compliance, and provides the business, regulators and 
the community with confidence that water resources are 
being protected.

Mount Piper Power Station continues to source water 
from the Springvale Water Treatment Plant which fulfils 
about 80% of the plant’s daily water needs, significantly 
reducing the need to source river water for its operations 
and, in turn, freshwater consumption.

Customer portfolio
CLP operates retail businesses in Hong Kong and Australia, 
where the local market structures, regulatory requirements, 
electricity demand, customer preferences and cultural 
norms differ significantly. Overall, the number of customer 
accounts in both markets remained stable in 2022, with 
continued gradual growth reported in Hong Kong from the 
residential sector.

SASB reference: IF-EU-000.A; GRI reference: EU3

CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power) is the sole 
electricity provider for Kowloon, the New Territories and 
most of the outlying islands of Hong Kong. It serves close 
to 2.8 million customers and about 80% of Hong Kong’s 
population. Total electricity sales for 2022 were 34,824GWh.

While Hong Kong is perceived by some as a mature market, 
there is still a growing demand for electricity. This is 
largely driven by a number of territory-wide development 
and infrastructure projects, as well as new local railway 
infrastructure projects that will improve mobility in Hong 
Kong. In addition, as Hong Kong is targeted as a prime location 
for data centres, there is a need to ensure highly reliable 
power supplies to support and facilitate the development 
of the energy-intensive data centre industry essential to a 
modern economy.

Access to reliable energy
Our approach
Maintaining high availability and reliability of electricity supply 
is critical for our corporate and retail customers to support 
their business operation and daily life respectively. Availability 
and reliability are two key performance metrics that track 
CLP’s ability to meet its commitments to customers.

GRI reference: EU10

Goals and targets
For generation assets, CLP monitors the availability factor in 
terms of the amount of time that an asset is able to produce full 
load equivalent electricity over a certain period, divided by the 
amount of time in that period. Typical values range from 70% 
to 90% and CLP aims to maintain an availability range of 90% 
and above for newer assets.

Targets for each asset are set annually and included in the 
business plan. Performance is reported on a weekly basis to 
senior management. Any significant performance variance is 
analysed and corrective action is taken where appropriate.

Strategies and procedures
While CLP has generation businesses across the Asia-Pacific 
region, Hong Kong is the only location where the business is 
vertically integrated. In other words, it provides generation, 
transmission and distribution of power, as well as retail 
services. CLP Power is regulated by the Hong Kong SAR 
Government under the Scheme of Control Agreement (SCA) 
which requires the Company to provide a sufficient and 
reliable electricity supply at a reasonable price and in an 
environmentally responsible manner.

In Hong Kong, CLP Power uses various measures to maintain 
high supply availability and reliability. These measures include:

• Upgrading generation and network facilities to meet new 
electricity demand;

• Maintaining sufficient generating capacity to meet forecast 
demand as well as planned and unforeseen outages;

• Developing an additional and economically viable gas 
supply option that can strengthen energy security 
through access to competitive gas supplies from global 
markets using Floating Storage and Regasification Unit 
(FSRU) technology;

• Adopting advanced technology such as smart grid 
and implementing demand-side management measures 
to reduce demand growth and improve utilisation of 
existing assets;

• Improving the quality of the power supply to minimise 
voltage dips;

• Enhancing power systems to minimise the impact of 
adverse weather; and

• Ensuring the workforce is committed and well-trained to 
maintain and operate the system, and provide support and 
emergency services around the clock.

Across the Group, CLP promotes organisational learning 
and builds technological capacities to ensure availability 
and reliability. Insights learned from regional experiences 
are shared among functions to plan for a consistent 
management framework. This practice facilitates better 
portfolio management and reduces risks to the Group’s 
operations as a whole.

Current innovative projects, promoting availability and 
reliability, are being pursued in the areas of robotics, asset 
health, video analytics, energy storage, building information 
modelling and automation. These projects are initiated by 
disruptive global start-ups or CLP's own engineers coming up 
with new innovations through operational experience. 

Transmission network
To cope with the territorial development of Hong Kong, CLP 
reviews future transmission network developments annually. 
It studies the latest system maximum demand forecast, 
area load growth, infrastructure development and generation 
development, and plans accordingly.

Annual maintenance and improvement programmes have 
been developed for major transmission assets based on the 
analysis of current conditions and performance of the assets, 
levels of investment and risk.

The power supply network is most exposed to damage 
from extreme climate events, potentially leading to service 
disruptions. In response, CLP continues to improve the 
reliability of its power supply network through a range 
of measures.

In India, Apraava Energy has adopted the philosophy of 
predictive and corrective maintenance of its transmission 
assets. This includes pre-emptive check-ups and assessments 
on operational clearances, ensuring assets are well structured 
and maintained with proper setup, hardware and security. 
Frequent patrolling is carried out for conducting assessments 
for landscape and assets. The results are used to identify 
defects and plan for shutdowns if needed.

A mobile application is now used by Apraava Energy for the 
real-time tracking of site patrols. This shortens the response 
time for any rectifications. Thermovision cameras are used to 
help the team find the defect through heat mapping.

The use of drones for site patrolling is under planning, though 
a ground team will be retained at strategic locations to ensure 
a speedy response to any damage to critical assets.

Initiatives and progress
In Hong Kong, CLP maintained its world-class supply reliability 
of over 99.997%. This is a higher rating than that in other major 
international cities such as London, New York and Sydney.

SASB reference: IF-EU-240a.3, IF-EU-240a.4, IF-EU-550a.2, IF-EU-000.C; GRI 

reference: 203-1, EU4, EU12, EU26, EU27, EU28, EU29, EU30

CLP’s transmission and distribution network in Hong Kong 
serves about 80% of the population of the city overall and close 
to 100% of the population within the Company’s service area.

At the end of 2022, CLP Power had approximately 16,678km 
of circuits at medium or higher voltage. In addition, there were 
240 primary and 15,413 secondary substations operating in 
Hong Kong. As of 2022, the average network loss for the past 
five years was 3.51%, slightly lower than the five-year average 
of 3.61% reported in 2021.

To achieve these percentages, a set of universally recognised 
supply reliability performance indicators is used from the 
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers standard 
(IEEE 1366-2012) to monitor system performance. CLP’s 
performance against these indicators is reported annually to 
the Hong Kong Government.

In India, with the operations and maintenance strategy 
in place, Apraava Energy has achieved 100% availability 
for Satpura Transco Private Limited asset and 99.86% 
availability for Kohima-Mariani Transmission Limited asset 
for transmission of electricity to customers in 2022.

Supply reliability performance indicators and results for CLP Power

Indicator Result

System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI)

The average number of supply interruptions for each customer served. 
Both planned and unplanned interruptions are included.

• The three-year average SAIFI (2020–2022) was 0.27, meaning 
customers experienced a power interruption approximately once 
in four years during this period. This was higher than last year’s 
three-year rolling average of 0.21. It is mainly due to the impact of 
a cable bridge fire incident in Yuen Long.

System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI)

The average duration of interruptions each customer may encounter 
in a given year.

• The three-year average SAIDI (2020–2022) was 0.30 hours, 
including both planned and unplanned interruptions. This was 
higher than last year’s three-year rolling average of 0.23. It is 
mainly due to the impact of a cable bridge fire incident in Yuen Long

Unplanned Customer Minutes Lost (Unplanned CML)

The average duration of unplanned power interruptions per customer 
in a given year. These outages occur without prior notice, and happen 
as a result of various factors such as weather events, third-party 
damage to the network and equipment faults.

• The three-year rolling average (2020–2022) of unplanned CML 
was about 5.7 minutes, which was higher than the 0.99 minutes 
recorded last year. It is mainly due to the impact of a cable 
bridge fire incident in Yuen Long. CLP Power maintains a world-
class supply reliability of over 99.997% in Hong Kong, which 
is higher than other major international cities as shown in the 
diagram above.

Asset management
Our approach
Asset management refers to how CLP manages and utilises its 
assets to provide reliable, reasonably priced and low-carbon 
electricity services to customers and communities. CLP has 
developed and adopted an Asset Management System (AMS) 
Standard. It is a framework of standardised practices which 
manage assets across their entire lifecycle, from the planning 
stage to decommissioning.

Strategies and procedures
Developed in 2016, CLP’s AMS Standard standardises essential 
practices in managing assets across the Group and ensures 
best practice. It accords with the ISO 55000 series of 
standards for asset management systems, as well as the ISO 
31000 standards for risk management.

The AMS Standard is integrated into CLP’s Health, Safety 
and Environment (HSE) Management System and Project 
Management Governance System (PMGS) Standards to 
comprehensively manage the complete lifecycle of an asset.

The AMS contains five key stages and 10 asset management 
elements, as illustrated in the diagram below.

Monitoring and follow-up
CLP’s customised Group Operations Information System 
(GOIS) is used to compile operational data on adherence to 
the AMS Standard. It features built-in data collection, a data 
compilation and an approval sequence and dashboard and 
reporting functions. It follows the CLP Non-Financial Data 
Reporting and Assurance Standard to ensure robust data 
governance. Relevant staff at the asset, regional and Group 
levels have responsibility for upholding the standard.

Continuous improvement
Initial efforts at the project planning stage are critical in 
determining the operational efficiency or capacity factor range 

of an asset through its entire lifespan. Projects involving a 
major asset overhaul require stringent technical and financial 
scrutiny before commencement.

CLP constantly identifies opportunities to improve the 
operational efficiency of its assets to help meet the 
increasingly stringent regulations on emissions and fuel 
efficiency in certain jurisdictions. There are also increasing 
improvement opportunities arising from innovation and 
optimisation, particularly from data analytics.

Initiatives and progress
In 2022, the consumption of coal for power generation 
decreased by 7.5% and gas increased by 6.3% compared 
with 2021. Accordingly, electricity sent out from coal assets 
decreased by 11.3% and gas assets increased by 5.7% (on an 
equity plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis).

Energy sent out by asset type1 (on an equity plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis)

CLP's energy sent out from all asset types decreased to 87,360 GWh in 2022 compared to 91,183 GWh in 2021. High fuel 
prices due to the global energy crisis reduced energy sent out from coal assets to 45% and increased the energy sent 
out from the gas (22%) and non-carbon energy portfolio (33%). In addition, a 350MW unit at the coal-fired Castle Peak 
A Power Station was put in reserve which further reduced energy sent out from coal assets.

Energy services and solutions
Our approach
CLP actively engages its customers and offers a suite of energy 
services and solutions to meet different customer needs in the 
evolving market landscape. Leveraging its digital capability, 
CLP applies new technologies to drive customers’ behavioural 
change on energy consumption.

Strategy and procedures
Drawing on our long expertise in the power industry, we are 
implementing various initiatives to encourage residential and 
business customers and the community at large to use energy 
more efficiently. Essentially we are asking them to change their 
behaviour so that they can save more energy and help protect 
the environment.

CLP seeks to change people’s habits and encourage them to 
conserve energy through:

• Equipping customers with tools and technical support;

• Supporting enablers to make greater energy 
efficiency possible;

• Providing customers with information and energy-saving 
tips; and

• Educating the public.

Goals and targets
The CLP Power Customer Service Quality Policy includes a 
commitment to support customers in using CLP products and 
services more efficiently and effectively.

In Hong Kong, CLP Power is regulated by the Scheme of Control 
Agreement (SCA). The SCA (2018–2033) includes:

1. Performance targets: Under the current SCA, targets are 
set to drive the performance of the CLP Eco Building 
Fund, the CLP Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme and 
energy audits in terms of energy saved per year, number of 
buildings or customers supported, etc.

2. Demand response programmes: This enables commercial 
and industrial customers to lower the overall system 
demand, resulting in a lower requirement for investment 
in new generation units in the long term. The program 
leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technology, developed 
by CLP strategic partner Autogrid to help manage the 
demand reduction. The target for this initiative is to achieve 
a reduction of up to 60MW from the demand peak.

3. A new five-year energy-saving target: CLP must achieve at 
least 4% of energy savings on the basis of average annual 
sales within a five-year period in order to earn incentives 
issued under the SCA. More incentives will be given if the 
energy saving reaches 5%.

• With increasing market demand, CLP proactively engages with 
customers in the property sector to support their renewable 
energy conversion journey. There was continued interest in the 
direct purchase of renewables whether as annual purchasing or as 
24/7 granular matching. This is evidence of positive momentum in 
the market. CLP leverages expertise in renewable energy assets, 
battery storage and energy management indicator to support its 
corporate customers.

Offsetting emissions that can't be otherwise avoided

Products and services Updates in 2022

Energy attribute certificates (EACs)

CLP offers a range of EACs to support customers' 
decarbonisation objectives. In Hong Kong, Renewable 
Energy Certificates (RECs) offer an alternative way for 
customers to support local clean energy generation. 
Each unit of a REC represents the environmental 
attributes of electricity produced by local renewable 
energy sources, generated or purchased by CLP Power.

In Mainland China, CLP China’s renewable assets issue 
Green Electricity Certificates (GECs) which are the only 
officially recognised renewable energy certificates in 
Mainland China. They can be used to meet obligations 
under China's mandatory Renewable Energy Portfolio 
Standard, or to support voluntary green power trading.

In Australia, EACs serve as an option to reduce 
customers' Scope 2 emissions when decentralised 
renewables are not a viable option. For example, 
PureEnergy from EnergyAustralia helps customers 
support the production of green energy from 
government accredited renewable sources.

• Since the launch of RECs in January 2019, over 124GWh of RECs 
have been sold by CLP Power to businesses such as data centres, 
banks, hotels and restaurants, as well as residential customers. In 
2022 alone, close to 100GWh units of REC were sold, a significant 
increase from the 15.4GWh units sold the prior year.

• A commitment to purchase of 300GWh of RECs over a period 
of six years was made by HSBC in October 2022. This is the 
largest and longest commitment since CLP Power launched the 
REC programme.

• Hang Seng Bank has committed to purchase close to 154GWh of 
RECs between 2021 and 2030, equivalent to a reduction of over 60 
kilotonnes in carbon emissions associated with electricity over a 
period of 10 years.

• In November 2022, CLP Power announced an agreement with 
AirTrunk, an Asia-Pacific and Japan hyperscale data centre 
specialist, to launch a renewable energy solution in Hong Kong, 
under which AirTrunk will source hourly RECs from CLP Power to 
provide renewable energy matching at its HKG1 data centre for its 
customer, Microsoft. The agreement, which will be directly linked 
to the West New Territories (WENT) Landfill gas power generation 
units of CLP Power, signifies the first RECs solution linked to an 
identifiable renewable energy project in Hong Kong.

• Green power from CLP China’s new renewable projects that have 
reached grid-parity are bundled with corresponding GECs. For 
example, the 100MW Qian’an III Wind Farm in Jilin province 
supports the issuance of Green Electricity Certificates (GECs) in 
the region.

• Around 12,000 EnergyAustralia customers have chosen a 
GreenPower government accredited PureEnergy option for their 
electricity supply.

Carbon Credits

Carbon credits represent carbon emissions avoided as a 
result of emissions reduction projects. CLP encourages 
its customers and businesses to purchase these carbon 
credits to offset their unavoidable emissions.

In addition to selling carbon credits, CLP also 
collaborates with numerous industries to deliver 
carbon offset initiatives. EnergyAustralia has various 
programmes that provide carbon neutral electricity; 
for example:

• The Go Neutral offer allows residential customers to 
opt in to fully offset the carbon emissions associated 
with their home gas and electricity usage, at no 
added cost to them.

• Business Carbon Neutral helps business customers 
offset their electricity emissions for a flat fee.

• CLP continues to promote carbon offsetting and support 
customers’ decarbonisation journey. Customers can offset their 
unavoidable emissions with CLP Carbon Credits after taking 
actions to cut down their emissions. CLP signed a multi-year 
contract with Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) to provide 
CLP Carbon Credits through the Core Climate platform, the new 
international carbon marketplace launched by the Hong Kong 
Stock Exchange in October 2022.

• As of the end of 2022, EnergyAustralia has over 488,000 customer 
accounts choosing to have their energy use offset and over 
5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been offset 
to date.

• EnergyAustralia now has the largest Climate Active certified offset 
offering in the Australian energy sector and the second largest in 
the country.

Case study

Leading the technology breakthrough in hydrogen storage 
through investment
CLP’s Investment and Venture team took a three-
pronged investment strategy covering direct 
equity investments, venture capital funds and 
joint venture investment partnerships. Capital 
has been deployed in strategically significant 
geographies (Greater China, Israel and the United 
States) and focus areas such as virtual power 
plant orchestration, cybersecurity and building 
energy management. 
CLP Group has invested over HK$780 million in venture 
capital funds since 2017. The benefits derived from these 
investments are twofold. Firstly, the investment brings 
direct strategic value to CLP business operation. For 
example, through AutoGrid’s demand response solutions, 
CLP reduces stress in the network, while Claroty’s 
Operational Technology solutions digitally secure CLP's 
critical assets. Secondly, it imposes substantial influence 
to customers and the wider community by offering 

energy management solutions. For example, CLP 
supported the Airport Authority Hong Kong to adopt 
R&B’s energy management solutions at Hong Kong 
International Airport. 

Advanced technology in handling hydrogen is the key in 
driving the transition to green transportation. Hydrogen 
is the potential fuel source of the future. However, 
multiple challenges are present throughout its lifecycle – 
production, storage and transportation. CLP established 
joint venture investment partnerships with HydroX which 
develops an energy-efficient, environmentally friendly 
chemical process to store hydrogen using water and 
bicarbonate (like baking soda) at near room temperature 
and pressure. This technology breakthrough in hydrogen 
storage allows an efficient and safe use of hydrogen 
as fuel in vehicles which will bring a paradigm shift in 
transportation and operations across various industries.

Case study

Teaming up with Chinachem Group to drive towards carbon 
neutrality goal
Riding on the successful collaboration with 
Chinachem Group (Chinachem) in 2019 to 
promote energy efficiency and decarbonisation, 
CLP Power continues to support Chinachem on its 
journey in pursuing carbon neutrality.
Chinachem Group set their sustainability goals for 2030 to 
further reduce their Scope 1 and 2 operational greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions by 51.8% by 2030. Chinachem 
collaborated with CLP Power in 2019 to transform the 
landmark Nina Tower into an operational and energy-
efficient twin-towers complex by adopting smart and 
green technology.

In early 2023, CLPe signed a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer 
(BOOT) agreement with Chinachem to build Hong Kong’s 
first zero-carbon chiller system at Nina Tower. Under the 
20-year agreement, CLPe will provide funding, design and 
engineering work to convert the existing air conditioning 
system into an energy-efficient water-cooled system. 
PlantPro, an intelligent AI management system, is used 
to control the chiller plants to collect and analyse data, 
performing real-time monitoring and adjustments to 
provide Nina Tower with the most energy-efficient air 

conditioning. The system is expected to reduce electricity 
consumption by over 50% compared with the existing 
system, equivalent to a reduction of 7,000 tonnes of 
carbon emission a year. The electricity consumed by the 
chiller plants will be matched by an equal amount of 
Green Electricity Certificates (GECs) linked to CLP Group's 
renewable energy projects in Mainland China.

Further, to make revolutionary change in the Hong 
Kong construction industry, CLP Power together with 
Chinachem, Gammon Construction Limited and Ampd 
Energy Limited promoted the use of Battery Energy 
Storage System (BESS) to the construction industry in 
Hong Kong. The pitch aims to replace traditional diesel 
generators operated on construction sites with BESS, 
and promote industry collaboration toward emission-
free construction sites. BESS reduces carbon emissions 
by up to 85% annually as compared with traditional 
diesel generators. This successful collaboration on the 
application of BESS won the Association of Energy 
Engineers's prestigious Innovative Energy Project of the 
Year International Award 2022, a highly respected and 
prestigious competition in the construction industry.

Customer privacy
Our approach
Under the CLP Code of Conduct, every employee must 
safeguard the Company’s assets and the resources entrusted 
to the Company’s care, including customer information, 
against loss, theft or misuse.

GRI reference: 418-1

In Hong Kong, the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) 
governs the protection of personal data of individuals. The 
Data Protection Principles in the PDPO frame CLP Power’s 
obligations (as a data user) relating to the collection, accuracy, 
retention, use and security of personal data, as well as the 
rights to access and correct a customer personal data.

Under the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act), EnergyAustralia 
has obligations to ensure the appropriate collection, use, 
disclosure and security as well as access to an individual’s own 
personal information. There are also mandatory data breach 
reporting obligations in relation to Notifiable Data Breaches. 
EnergyAustralia is required to report data breaches if there 
is unauthorised access to, unauthorised disclosure of, or loss 
of personal information that EnergyAustralia holds where this 
is likely to result in serious harm to one or more individuals 
and EnergyAustralia has been unable to prevent the likely 
risk of serious harm with remedial action. Notifications 
must be made to the Office of the Australian Information 
Commissioner (OAIC) and to the affected customers with 
description of the data breach, the kinds of information 
involved and recommendations for customers in response 
to the data breach.

In May 2018, the Australian Government announced that 
energy data would be included in the Consumer Data Right 
(CDR). The sharing of product data in the energy sector 
commenced on 1 October 2022 and consumer data sharing 
commenced on 15 November 2022. It gives customers the 
right to share certain of their transaction, usage and product 
data with service competitors and comparison services. 
EnergyAustralia was granted an exemption by the Australian 
Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and must 
begin data sharing by 15 May 2023.

Strategy and procedures
The CLP Privacy Principles set out the Company’s commitment 
and approach to protecting personal data.

All employees who have to handle or process personal data of 
any individual for business operation in Hong Kong must follow 
CLP procedures, practices and local regulations in relation to 
personal data privacy. The Group preserves the confidentiality 
of the personal data provided to it in accordance with the 
CLP Privacy Policy Statement, which was updated with effect 
from 1 November 2018. The CLP Privacy Policy Statement 
demonstrates the Company’s approach to protecting personal 
data and is applicable to everyone across its entire operations 
who handles personal data.

In addition, business units with operations in Hong Kong must 
implement and abide by the CLP Personal Data Protection 
Compliance Manual which sets out CLP’s data protection 
compliance framework, including its governance structure 
and the roles and responsibilities of different functions under 
the governance structure. This manual also provides guidance 
on the protection and use of personal data. Adherence to 
policies and procedures regarding privacy and data protection 
are further embedded in CLP’s Code of Conduct and the 
compliance management procedures of the Code.

Monitoring and follow-up
CLP monitors and documents any complaints related to 
breaches of customer privacy and the loss of customer data. 
In addition to the CLP Personal Data Protection Compliance 
Manual, the Customer Success & Experience Unit has a 
written guideline for handling customer data incidents. 
The guideline includes the classification and assessment of 
the scope and severity of a data incident, reporting roles 
and responsibilities and the incident response strategy and 
checklist. The Corporate Data Protection Officer also retains a 
record of data incidents and follow-up actions.

EnergyAustralia has developed and maintains a Data Breach 
Response Plan which is implemented by a Data Breach 
Response Team. The plan outlines the strategy for assessing, 
managing, containing and reporting data breaches within 
required timeframes and outlines roles and responsibilities. It 
is enacted each time a potential data breach is identified.

Training and awareness
In further reinforcing CLP rules to protect customer 
information, a key focus has been the prevention 
of unauthorised disclosures to malicious attackers or 
impersonators. Specific awareness activities, including 
communications, quality assurance assessment, coaching 
and additional training for frontline staff, were carried out 
during the year. Company-wide communications, employee 
training and briefing sessions with leadership were also 
conducted to ensure all staff understand current privacy and 
data management obligations. A Data Breach Response Plan 
was formulated while a Data Breach Response Team was 
established to ensure the business has the capability and 
procedures in place to respond swiftly to such incidents.

Customer privacy may be compromised as a result of 
a cyber security incident, or by the mishandling of 
customer information by employees. A compulsory e-learning 
programme on data protection was given to all employees in 
2020 and the e-training has been mandated since 2021 for all 
new employees.

In addition to this broadly received training, CLP runs 
tailored and frequent data protection awareness programmes 
through regular briefings, case sharing, quiz games and 
refreshers to employees who have regular interaction with 
protected data such as members of the Legal Review 
Committee. Industry threats are continuously reviewed 
with a view to strengthening controls on managing and 
monitoring networks, systems and mobile devices, data loss 
and suspicious cyber activities. CLP also regularly reinforces 
the need for timely reporting of potential privacy incidents.

At EnergyAustralia, customer privacy remains the focus 
of briefing sessions with leadership, enterprise-wide 
communications and employee training to ensure all staff 
are up-to-date with current privacy and data management. 
Privacy training is a compulsory requirement for all new 
employees and subsequent refresher training is provided to all 
employees annually.

Initiatives and progress
In 2022, CLP Power reported no cases of customer data loss in 
Hong Kong. In Australia, EnergyAustralia reported one incident 
involving the compromise of customer data.

GRI reference: 418-1

CLP Power was awarded the Privacy-Friendly Awards 2021 
Gold Certificate by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for 
Personal Data (PCPD), Hong Kong, recognising its commitment 
and effort in protecting personal data privacy of customers 
and stakeholders. CLP Power was also recognised by PCPD 
in the inspection for its implementation of a Personal Data 
Privacy Management Programme, and for adopting security 
measures to protect customers’ personal data systems which 
conform to international standards.

On 30 September, an incident involving unauthorised access 
to EnergyAustralia’s My Account data platform resulted in 
data from 323 residential and small business customers 
being potentially compromised. EnergyAustralia promptly 
contacted all affected customers to reset their passwords and 
suspended system access during the incident investigation. 
While the number of customers affected in this incident 
was limited, EnergyAustralia took additional measures to 
ensure the protection of all customer information by 
setting up additional layers of security in its My Account 
data platform. This included more complex passwords 
and the introduction of multi-factor authentication (MFA). 
EnergyAustralia apologised for the incident and notified the 
relevant regulatory authorities and Government agencies.

Customer satisfaction
Our approach
CLP is committed to providing quality service and value to 
customers. This includes meeting regulatory requirements and 
delivering on customer service pledges.

GRI reference: 417-1

Strategy and procedures
CLP customers can access information on products and 
services in a timely and efficient manner through a number 
of communication channels, such as a welcome pack for new 
customers received by e-mail, information on the CLP Power 
websites and CLP Mobile App, as well as the EnergyAustralia 
websites and Mobile Apps. CLP also engages with residential, 
commercial and industrial customers through satisfaction 
surveys, online service portals, site visits to its assets, 
supporting by its account managers and Customer Service 
Centres and Customer Interaction Centre.  

CLP also strives to effectively respond to customer needs 
and preferences. All escalated cases are studied thoroughly to 
appropriately resolve the issues customers have raised.

EnergyAustralia averages one to two million conversations 
with customers every year, either over the phone or via digital 

service channels. It also engages with more than 100,000 
individuals, businesses and stakeholders annually through 
formal research to help shape business decisions, products 
and services.

Monitoring and follow-up
In Hong Kong, an external market research consultant 
conducts an annual telephone survey. The customer 
satisfaction score considers overall satisfaction towards CLP 
and a relative rating against an ideal utility in Hong Kong. The 
score is benchmarked against the public utilities in the energy 
sector and other public service organisations.

In addition to the number of calls and complaints received, 
EnergyAustralia also measures customer satisfaction through 
its Strategic Net Promoter Score (SNPS). Customer 
satisfaction is measured monthly via an online NPS survey 
sent to a representative group of customers. The Transactional 
Net Promoter Score (TNPS) is also used to track customer 
satisfaction in relation to specific customer interactions, 
providing more direct feedback to frontline staff.

Initiatives and progress
CLP is committed to providing safe and reliable energy 
for its customers to support their business operation and 
daily life.  The frontline teams have continued to maintain 
essential support and ensure the reliability of power supply 
and customer service.

GRI reference: 417-3,418-1

Hong Kong
With the tariff adjustment made due to increasing cost 
of the international energy market, similar to counterparts

Australia
While customers have continued to experience the impact 
of COVID-19 on their day-to-day lives, EnergyAustralia has 
demonstrated its continued commitment to its customers by 
focusing on the quality of service they receive. Enhancements 
were made to the EnergyAustralia app to provide a new 
channel for customers to interact aligned to their preferences, 
which has helped drive a 10% reduction in call volumes.

Complaints received by EnergyAustralia
EnergyAustralia’s TNPS decreased slightly in 2022 while 
complaint volumes continued to decline, with total complaints 
received declining by 9.5% from the 2021 figure. This result 
was brought about by continued improvements in internal 
and external dispute resolution practices and operational 
interventions to address key billing complaint drivers.

While EnergyAustralia noted a year-on-year decline in total 
complaint volumes, a 3% decline in the proportion of billing 
complaints was also achieved. This is the result of ongoing 
billing improvement initiatives focused on adopting a tailored 
communication and notification strategy to provide advice 
to its customers proactively and help them manage their 
high bills.

Challenges were experienced during the second half of 2022 
across the energy industry. They were driven by market 
uncertainties arising from the energy crisis and market 
sustainability, and increased cost of living pressures with 
rising inflation and changing customer behaviour. Despite 
these challenges, EnergyAustralia continued to go above and 
beyond to successfully address and resolve customer concerns 
through timely engagement and effective conversations 
with its customers. This was reflected in the reduction 
of complaints.

Security management
Our approach
CLP’s Group Digital’s Security serves to protect our people, 
property, information and reputation against security risks.

Strategies and procedures
CLP’s security strategy is guided by the CLP Risk Management 
Framework, with oversight from the Board. The Group 
Security Policy was updated in 2021 to define the overarching 
approach taken to minimise risk to people, including 
employees, contractors, customers and the public and to 
manage other business risks to acceptable levels. During 2022 
all cyber security-related standards have been updated to take 
into account technological evolution, changing legislation and 
emerging good practice. Moreover, a fundamental review of 
strategy took place, allowing Security team to better place 
itself to support CLP Digital’s initiatives and the transition 
across the Group to the Utility of the Future.

The policy covers the following areas:

• Integrated and centralised organisation and governance: 
Security is an integrated department within CLP Digital 
which covers all relevant lines of security activity within 
the Company, operating independently of the IT and OT 
governing organisations.

• Policies, standards and guidelines: Providing a suite of 
documents guiding how to manage and monitor risks in line 
with recognised industry standards.

• Understanding the threats: Ensuring decisions related to 
the application of security measures are appropriately 
informed and, wherever possible, intelligence driven.

• Communications and awareness: Continuously enhancing 
the security awareness and knowledge of employees and 
contractors with the objective of encouraging security- 
positive behaviour.

• Technical domain: Ensuring that robust operational 
detection and response tools are developed, applied 
and maintained.

• Liaison: Maintaining constructive and trusted relationships 
with external stakeholders such as national cyber security 
agencies and industry bodies to ensure speedy and 
effective cooperation when the need arises.

There are five separate but co-dependent lines of activity, all 
of which are protected (to a lesser or greater extent) by cyber 
and physical security measures. These lines of activity are:

• Information: Data is stored in both hard and electronic 
formats. The confidentiality, integrity and availability of this 
data needs to be protected;

• Operational Technology (OT): Hardware and software that 
detects, monitors or controls physical devices (such as a 
turbine) at CLP assets, needs to be protected;

• Information Technology (IT): The IT used to store, retrieve, 
transmit and manipulate data or information needs to 
be protected;

• Personnel: Staff employed by CLP, both at the workplace 
and travelling for business, must be safe; and

• Brand: CLP’s image, identity and associated reputation 
needs to be protected.

CLP security measures are robust and scalable. They provide 
comprehensive, layered and flexible protection.

CLP's approach to security

Operational responsibilities
The Group Security team was established in 2020 to 
ensure cyber and physical security capabilities and efforts 
complement each other. The team offers an in-house capability 
across the full range of security skillsets. With internal re-
structuring in 2022, the Group Security team was integrated 
into CLP Digital. This is a strategic move to support 
the transition to the “Utility of the Future”. The Security 
department remains separate from both the IT and the 
HSE departments but maintains close working relationships 
with both. Regular reports are provided by Group Digital 
to the Board’s Audit & Risk Committee (ARC). The ARC 
seeks assurance that adequate risk management is in place 
and followed and that appropriate remedial action is taken 
where needed.

Physical security
Our approach
The fundamental – and highly effective – form of security 
is physical security which is applied appropriately to all of 
CLP’s assets. Enhanced measures are used to protect sensitive 
locations such as data centres, control rooms and transmission 
and distribution sites.

GRI reference: 410-1

Strategies and procedures
Physical security refers to the physical measures designed 
to safeguard people, to prevent unauthorised access 
to equipment, facilities, material and documents and to 
safeguard them against security incidents. It covers physical 
barriers (e.g. fences), security lighting, physical access control 
and surveillance systems.

A body of work has been developed to assist all regions 
and their assets in establishing or revising their security 
management documentation. These documents are aligned 
with international standards for security and contain best 
practices derived from across the Group.

• The CLP Physical Security Standard lays down the 
minimum standard of physical security measures expected 
at every asset owned and/or operated by CLP, regardless of 
location or role.

• The CLP Physical Security Guideline provides practical 
guidance on the security requirements expected of all 
business units, in line with the Group Security Policy 
and Physical Security Standard. For instance, it includes 
guidelines on how to identify potential areas of weakness, 
develop appropriate security countermeasures, as well as 
prepare a security response plan.

• The CLP Security Vulnerability Assessment Guideline is the 
flagship document that lays down the process of evaluating 

the security status of any CLP site. Using a risk-based 
approach and in close collaboration with the operator, it 
provides a comprehensive security “health check” covering 
threats, areas of weakness and offers solutions.

• CLP’s Security Due Diligence for Project Design & 
Construction or Site Acquisition has been developed to 
support projects in the early stages of an acquisition or 
a build. Based on the premise that early identification 
of potential problems can reduce risk and the cost of 
retrospective correction, all projects and acquisitions 
undergo this process, regardless of size.

• The CLP Business Travel Risk Management Plan seeks to 
minimise the security, medical and health risks faced by 
employees engaged in business travel. On behalf of the 
Group, Security team in CLP Ditigal leads on business travel 
security in close cooperation with Group HR and Finance.

Training and awareness
CLP security staff play a key role in preventing harm to 
staff and the wider public. They are required to always 
comply with CLP’s Code of Conduct and receive related 
training on an annual basis. In addition to training on national 
regulations and site-specific requirements, contract security 
staff receive induction training on CLP’s policies including 
harassment-free workplace, minimum wage guidelines and 
measures preventing discrimination in the workplace. This 
induction training must be completed before personnel are 
granted access to their assigned workplace sites.

For a third successive year, business travel has all but stopped 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. More effort continues 
to be made in keeping staff across the Group informed on the 
rapidly changing travel situation and border closures across 
CLP’s portfolio countries and other key destinations, as well as 
providing bespoke advice to those who have needed it.

Initiatives and progress
One of the examples of leveraging new technology to digitise 
its operations is CLP's adoption of the remote “Magic Glass” 
lens technology. CLP deployed this technology to conduct 
remote Security Vulnerability Assessment of a windfarm site 
during COVID-19 lockdown to counter the inability of security 
staff to inspect sites in person in 2022.

Normally, Hong Kong-based security staff along with their 
onsite colleagues would conduct security inspections every 
three years on every asset to ensure that appropriate security 
measures were in place. The “Magic Glass” lens technology 
enabled Hong Kong-based staff to conduct a real-time survey 

of a Chinese windfarm site through the eye of a camera carried 
by an on-site colleague, while being 1,000km away at the 
time. This equipment was handy and safe to use in the field 
and could be adapted to a wide range of safety helmets. 
The “Magic Glass” lens technology was also adopted for 
safety and management inspections during the construction 
of the Qian’an third phase wind farm. The adoption of remote 
inspection technologies complimented onsite inspections and 
helped improve overall security inspection efficiency.

Cyber security
Management approach
CLP has enhanced its cyber security governance, built internal 
capacity in the area and improved its information protection.

Strategies and procedures
Cyber security incidents are unique in that the attack occurs in 
a virtual space and may not cause immediate disruption, as in 
the case of data leaks, making them difficult to detect or trace. 
As the workplace and operations are increasingly digitalised, 
electronic devices could become vulnerable to cyberattacks. 
CLP therefore strives to protect the Operational Technology 
(OT) and Information Technology (IT) systems:  

• Operational Technology (OT) is the hardware and software 
that detects, monitors or controls physical devices (such as 
a turbine) belonging to CLP.

• Information Technology (IT) is the technology used to store, 
retrieve, transmit and manipulate data or information.

It is of utmost importance to improve the security culture 
within CLP and empower business units and regions to employ 
suitable technologies and processes to protect the Company’s 
assets and systems.

The management of cyber security is documented in two major 
Cyber Security policies, namely:

• The CLP Group Information Security Policy, which 
sets out the four key information security principles 
of confidentiality, integrity, availability and regulatory 
compliance. With reference to ISO/IEC 27002:2013 
Information Technology Security Techniques – Code of 
practice for information security controls, a set of Group-
level policies have been developed. Regional standards and 
procedures have been developed from these policies and 
tailored to suit the context and local regulations of the 
business unit; and

• The CLP Group Operational Technology Cyber Security 
Policy defines how to develop, implement and maintain 
appropriate safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical 
infrastructure services by CLP. One key focus relates to 
detection and response in cases of OT cyber security events 
and to establish recovery capability on the OT systems.

The department’s evidence-based reporting from internal 
testing provides an important feedback loop that enables the 
Company to pursue continuous improvement. In addition, the 
team helps project managers and business leaders understand 
cyber security risks in the context of CLP’s business and offers 
guidance on risk mitigation strategies.

Training and awareness
Our people are another focus in cyber defence. Every 
employee and associate of the Group is an important cyber 
defence asset. They need to be equipped with relevant 
knowledge to raise their awareness and vigilance.

CLP recognises the critical need to continually adapt and 
enhance its security posture to defend its operations against 
a complex and dynamic threat spectrum. Insight into the 
capability and intent of cyber attackers will help CLP 
develop situational awareness and it offers direction on what 
measures need to be taken to mitigate associated risks. 
Continual effort is given to raising cyber security awareness, 
training and education amongst employees to help them 
practise good “cyber hygiene”.

Security awareness activities at the employee level have 
included: simulated phishing emails, internal broadcast 
campaigns, briefings, videos and the introduction of ‘Cyber 
Champions’ to promote good cyber practice across a range of 
departments and functions.

Monitoring and follow-up
CLP continually monitors its IT systems and networks and 
also seeks out threats to its OT systems. Advances in cyber 
security technologies have helped improve the detection of 
cyber security breaches. If suspicious activity is discovered in 
the IT or OT network environments, immediate action is taken 
to investigate it and, if necessary, isolate the threat and lead 
the recovery action.

Initiatives and progress
In early 2022, CLP commenced a cyber security programme 
to improve detection and response systems for both IT and 
OT. This programme is on track to deliver a new generation 
of capabilities to CLP Digital in 2023. As a result, CLP’s ability 
to manage incidents round the clock across the Group was 
significantly enhanced.

Cyber security continues to be one of CLP’s top-tier risks 
and is regularly assessed and reported to senior management 
through the risk management process. In spite of further 
anticipated regulatory changes and the fact that cyber 
security skillsets are scarce and recruitment is fiercely 
competitive, CLP will continue to seek to uplift its capacity 
in the area of process, people and technology and to recruit the 
expertise required to spearhead the effort.

Emergency and crisis management 
Our approach
Attacks on CLP’s operation systems or physical assets could 
have dire consequences. It is essential to detect any incursion 
in real time, every time, and remediate the incident before 
harm results.

Strategies and procedures
CLP maintains robust and regularly tested emergency 
response and crisis management procedures. As the first line 
of defence, when an incident arises the Incident Management 
Process (featured below) is followed.

CLP Incident Management Process

Crisis Management Plan
Guided by the Group Crisis Management Plan, CLP ensures 
high levels of preparedness to respond to and recover from 
any emergency situations and helps minimise disruption to 
customers. The Plan is continually reviewed and enhanced to 
ensure it is in line with operational changes or the broader 
operating context. It provides a platform for the effective 
handling of a crisis at the Group level. The plan:

• Outlines crisis management organisation, roles, 
responsibilities, procedures and processes;

• Specifies the tools needed to ensure the collective response 
is well planned, well executed and fully integrated across 
the organisation;

• Describes the relationship and interface between the 
handling of regional- and Group-level crises; and

• Details the processes that govern internal and external 
communications during emergencies and crises, ensuring 
our people who are responsible for managing a crisis have 
the necessary information to carry out their responsibilities 
and that key stakeholders are informed.

The Group-level plan is supported at regional level by 
Regional Crisis Management Plans which mirror the Group 
document but are tailored for each region. In addition, detailed 
emergency response plans have been developed for each 
asset. These plans are designed to be used by first responders 
and asset managers.

CLP’s Crisis Management & Emergency Response Structure 
are outlined in the diagram below.

CLP Crisis Management & Emergency Response Structure

Training and awareness
As specified in both Group and regional publications, 
emergency response drills are conducted at least annually at 
all Group sites, with smaller scale drills taking place more often. 

Group and Regional Crisis Management Plans are reviewed 
at least every three years. Regional crisis management 
exercises are conducted annually as part of the internal peer 
review process.

Initiatives and progress
CLP continues to enhance its crisis management capability to 
ensure the organisation can respond promptly and effectively 
when an incident occurs.

From a crisis management perspective, the emphasis of the 
Company has been on maintaining and enhancing capability. 
Initiatives of the year included:

• Adopting cloud-based technology for CLP’s Crisis 
Communications Billboard (CCB) to better facilitate 
incident management;

• Reviewing and improving notification and communication 
tools; and

• At Group level, conducting crisis management 
communications and administrative drills to ensure that 
the equipment and procedures are functional and fully 
understood by the operators.

Case study

Crisis management in action during the cable bridge fire incident
On 21 June 2022, a CLP Power cable bridge in 
Yuen Long caught fire, affecting power supply to 
around 175,000 customers in Yuen Long, Tin Shui 
Wai and part of Tuen Mun, causing the largest 
blackout handled by the Company in more than 
a decade.
CLP Power activated its emergency incident response 
and power supply was first restored to essential services 
including hospitals and railways. With the tremendous 
effort of the engineering teams and emergency supply 
arrangement, CLP Power restored power supply to 
around 90% of the affected customers in around 
seven hours after the incident and subsequently to 
the remaining customers within 13 hours. The task 
was made more difficult as all cables inside the cable 
bridge had been burnt, meaning that the restoration 
operation was largely hands-on. Close cooperation and 
liaison with emergency services proved key to allowing 

effective handling of the operation on the ground by 
CLP Power's engineering teams. At Group level, a small 
special committee was convened to coordinate the 
flow of information and decision-making at Board and 
Government level. Immediately after the incident, an 
investigation panel comprising experts in power, civil and 
fire engineering was set up to find out the cause of the fire 
and make recommendations.

CLP Power maintained close communication with 
relevant government departments and ensured that 
they received all necessary support in the investigation 
and follow-up actions to the incident. The investigation 
findings were submitted to the Hong Kong Government 
and then communicated to the public in a timely 
manner. The Company also coordinated with community 
leaders and related organisations to provide updates, 
possible assistance and support to affected customers 
during the power interruption.

Workforce size and mix
CLP engaged over 18,500 employees and contractors on a 
full-time equivalent basis at the end of 2022.

GRI reference: 2-7, 2-8

The number of total employees rose, primarily due to the 
continued post-pandemic recovery of activity. Utilisation of 
service contractors was slightly higher than in 2021, reflecting 

skilled jobs created in Hong Kong and Mainland China to 
support decarbonisation projects, and renewable energy 
projects in India. Following a strategic review of labour 
hire usage, CLP Power in Hong Kong offered more in-house 
permanent roles to selected labour supply workers.

Fair and ethical work practices
Our approach
Core to our people agenda, and to delivering CLP’s strategy, 
is ensuring that the Group complies with all local laws and 
regulations and demonstrates respect for all our people, 
together with values-based management in addressing 
broader social issues.

GRI reference: 2-23, 2-25, 2-30, 401-2, 402-1, 407-1, 408-1, 409-1

Standards and procedures
CLP’s human resources policies and procedures are intended 
to ensure compliance with all local laws and regulations 
in relation to compensation and dismissal, recruitment and 
promotion, working hours, rest periods, equal opportunity, 
diversity, non-discrimination and harassment, and those 
covering benefits and welfare in the markets in which it 
operates. CLP takes immediate action to investigate and 
address any suspected breaches or issues that are brought to 
its attention.

Beyond compliance, CLP recognises its responsibility to 
respect human rights at work, as laid out in international 
principles, standards, and laws. CLP is a signatory of the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development’s (WBCSD) Call 
to Action for Business Leadership on Human Rights, and of the 
Good Employer Charter established by the Labour Department 
of Hong Kong, pledging to be an employee-oriented employer 
implementing good human resource management practices.

Human rights and labour standards

In addition to local legal compliance, CLP respects 
internationally recognised human rights relevant to its 
operations and requires its business partners and suppliers to 
do the same.

The commitment to upholding human rights is outlined in CLP’s 
Group Labour Standards. It references the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and other 
international standards and sets company-wide minimum 
standards on critical working conditions and the basic rights of 
employees in the workplace.

CLP’s commitment is also integrated in its Value Framework 
and Responsible Procurement Policy Statement and the newly 
launched Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC). EnergyAustralia 
also has its SCoC and reports annually on the risks of modern 
slavery in its operations and supply chains, as well as the 
actions taken to address those risks.

Read more on CLP's Group Labour Standards

Discrimination and Harassment

CLP aims to provide work environments that are free of 
harassment or discrimination on the basis of: gender; physical 
or mental state; race; nationality; religion; age; family status 
or sexual orientation; or any other attribute recognised by the 
laws of the country in which the Company operates.

In 2022, CLP reviewed and refreshed its Harassment-free 
Workplace Policy in Hong Kong and Mainland China to 
support its commitment. Mandatory refresher training was 
rolled out across the organisation to deepen employees’ 
understanding and the Group’s expectations on appropriate 
workplace behaviour.

Use of temporary and contractor labour

CLP uses temporary labour for work that is time-bound or 
during peak activities and engages labour employed by third 
parties for non-core work and/or work requiring specialist 
skills. CLP is committed to taking a responsible approach to 
managing the costs and risks of this contingent workforce. 
This includes considering whether there is an optimal balance 
between the insourcing and outsourcing of capabilities and 
ensuring that the working hours and remuneration of workers 
employed by contractors are fair and reasonable.

Fair wages

CLP complies fully with any local legal requirements with 
respect to minimum wage, and in practice its remuneration 
and benefits for permanent staff often significantly exceed 
local legal requirements.

While it is not Group policy or market practice to provide 
the same employment benefits to temporary staff as for 
regular permanent staff, CLP's benefits for temporary staff 
are competitive with local market practice and meet or exceed 
local legal requirements. CLP monitors pay carefully to ensure 
it is competitive and rewards employees for individual and 
company performance. Core employee benefits are reviewed 
regularly to ensure they are fit for purpose and sustainable.

Supporting our people to speak up and acting on reports 
of wrongdoing

Each CLP business has an employee grievance procedure 
in place that reflects the CLP Value Framework and any 
applicable local legal requirements. Where any employee 
has concerns, established procedures are followed to 
address grievances. These procedures ensure fairness and 
independence in the investigation process, and respect the 
confidentiality of the parties involved. CLP’s Whistleblowing 
Policy is publicly accessible, enabling employees and related 
third parties to raise concerns about any irregularity through 
a confidential channel.

Monitoring and follow-up
CLP’s Value Framework and Group Labour Standards set a 
common framework of principles. Detailed policies in each 
country are fully compliant with local legislation. Regular 
refresher training is organised for employees on key topics 
such as CLP's Code of Conduct and business practice review, 
the Harassment-free Workplace Policy, and others.

CLP prohibits the employment of child labour or forced labour 
in any of its operations. The steps it takes to prevent such 
practices include stringent checking and control procedures in 
selection and onboarding processes.

Each year, CLP uses independent external consultants 
to benchmark remuneration and benefits with relevant 
recruitment markets. Decisions on remuneration are subject 

to the corporate governance process and the approval of 
the Board Human Resources & Remuneration Committee to 
ensure a balance between the interests of both employees and 
shareholders as key stakeholders.

CLP carries out independent audits of its human resources 
policies and procedures to proactively identify any risks of 
legal non-compliance and take remedial action if such risks 
are identified. Immediate action is taken to investigate and 
address any suspected breaches or issues that are brought to 
the Company’s attention.

Read more on breaches of the CLP Code of Conduct

Initiatives and progress
CLP furthered its efforts in working ethically and fairly, 
receiving continued external recognition of its wages and 
retirement policies and practices.

GRI reference: 201-3

CLP’s Group Labour Standards outline CLP’s commitment to 
international principles and conventions and provide more 
detail on how CLP delivers on these commitments through 
company-wide minimum standards on critical working 
conditions including fair and decent work and working hours, 
and the basic rights of employees in the workplace. Following 
their launch, the standards were embedded into procurement 
requirements for labour hire suppliers in Hong Kong and 
tracking and monitoring of temporary manpower supply 
resources has been strengthened. Relevant expectations on 
labour practices and human rights have been embedded 
and communicated with CLP’s suppliers through the newly 
launched SCoC.

CLP did not identify any operation or supplier as having a 
significant risk of child labour, young workers exposed to 
hazardous work or forced or compulsory labour. There was 
no breach of laws and regulations in relation to child and 
forced labour across CLP in 2022. Additionally, no Group 
operation was identified in which the right to exercise freedom 
of association and collective bargaining was violated or at 
significant risk.

CLP’s Hong Kong businesses were awarded Fair Wage 
Certificates by the Fair Wage Network in recognition of 
their wage policies, practices and ongoing enhancements.  In 
2022, to provide staff with greater flexibility in their pension 
planning, CLP extended the maximum period of time for 
former employees to retain their retirement benefits within 
the Group Provident Fund Scheme.

Recognising its efforts in providing sustainable retirement 
benefits, the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Schemes 
Authority in Hong Kong again awarded CLP MPF Employer 
Award 5 Years+ Award, an e-Contribution Award, and the 
Best All-round MPF Employer Award. CLP also received 
awards for the Best ORSO (Occupational Retirement) Scheme 
and the Hong Kong Best Member Communications by Asia 
Asset Management.

Fostering diversity and inclusion
Our approach
CLP believes a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture 
supports high performance and CLP’s ability to operate 
effectively in the many communities in which it operates. 
To this end, CLP has set targets to encourage more women into 
the workforce, and policies to support employees to balance 
work and home-life commitments.

Considering the nature of CLP’s business and the markets in 
which it operates, CLP has set addressing gender diversity as 
a Group-wide priority to ensure a sustainable workforce in the 
face of demographic trends, and to deliver a wider, positive 
social and economic contribution. Long-term aspirational 
Group-wide gender diversity targets have been set, reflecting 
UN Sustainable Development Goals. The targets are:

• Women in Leadership target: To achieve gender balance 
in leadership positions by 2030 against a 2016 baseline 
of 22%;

• Women in Engineering target: For 30% of engineers to be 
female by 2030 compared to a 2016 baseline of 9%; and

• Ensuring equal pay for work of equal value is maintained in 
all CLP Group businesses, that any gender pay equity gap is 
eliminated, and that CLP meets all relevant local compliance 
and disclosure standards.

Standards and procedures
CLP is a signatory to the International Energy Agency’s Equal 
by 30 initiative, a commitment by public and private sector 
organisations to work towards gender equality in the energy 
sector by 2030, and to the Women’s Empowerment Principles 
established by the UN Global Compact and UN Women in India. 
Local Diversity and Inclusion Councils operate in Hong Kong, 
India and Australia to drive the Company's efforts on diversity.

CLP’s human resources policies encourage the retention 
of employees through initiatives including flexible work 
arrangements, maternity leave, and other family-friendly 
policies and benefits. CLP’s recruitment processes are 
designed to be fair and non-discriminatory. In Hong Kong, this 
process follows the Equal Opportunities Commission Code of 
Practice, and includes the use of consistent selection criteria. 
In other parts of the Group, CLP complies with local legislation 
and codes of practice on recruitment. When conducting senior 
level searches, CLP also requires external recruitment firms to 
identify candidates with diverse backgrounds, in line with the 
Group's values.

Monitoring and follow-up
Gender progress is reviewed as part of regular general 
management and engineering talent reviews. The Board 
Human Resources & Remuneration Committee reviews 
progress against gender diversity targets annually. CLP also 
conducts regular reviews to identify any gender pay gaps and 
ensures equal pay for work of equal value.

Initiatives and progress
Management has continued to leverage a variety of targeted 
programmes and activities to drive improved outcomes in 
diversity and inclusion.

GRI reference: 202-1, 202-2, 405-2

As of the end of 2022, Women in Leadership was maintained 
(2022: 29.1% vs 2021: 30.5%), while Women in Engineering 
increased (2022:13.0% vs 2021: 12.3%). Women constituted 
one-third of the Hong Kong Graduate Trainee intake in 
2022. Most women hired had participated in either CLP’s 
Female Engineering Student Mentoring Programme or had 
received an Engineering Study Award to support their final-
year studies.

Focus on ensuring strong female participation in development 
programmes continued with women representing 
approximately 30% of participants.

Independent gender pay equity analysis of CLP's Hong Kong 
payroll, based on UK disclosure requirements, continued to 
show a reverse gender pay gap for both hourly pay and 
bonuses, due to a higher proportion of women in professional 
and managerial roles. Additionally, CLP was recognised for its 
support of the Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission 
Racial Diversity and Inclusion Charter for Employers.

CLP launched its Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Council in Hong 
Kong in the second half of 2022. Comprising members of 
the senior leadership team, the Council aims to strengthen 
business outcomes and foster innovation through D&I. While 
the primary focus on gender diversity remains, other key D&I 
themes relevant to CLP’s business were identified. Going into 
2023, the Council will further define roles and responsibilities 
and set a clear roadmap to drive D&I progress in the business, 
including developing priorities and establishing operational 
guidelines in key employment practices.

CLP continued implementing other planned initiatives to 
drive gender diversity across all markets, including mentoring 
programmes for female engineering students, extended 
partnership with The Woman’s Foundation in Hong Kong 
on STEM learning for girls and celebration and awareness 
building on International Women’s Day.

Across the Group, EnergyAustralia continued delivering 
activities to foster its diversity, equity and inclusion as part 
of its Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Strategy. Activities included 
cultural learning training, organised LGBTIQ+ awareness 
sessions and ally training, as well as policy reviews with gender 
equality in focus. In India, awareness-building sessions on 
unconscious bias were organised in the business in 2022 and 
will be scaled up across the organisation in 2023.

The CLP Group was named Hong Kong’s most inclusive 
employer and ranked fourth in the Asia-Pacific region in 
the Inclusive Index Report by international consultancy, 
Equality Group.

Talent and skills development
Our approach
CLP’s ability to transition to a zero-carbon, digitally enabled 
future requires systematic organisational development and 
adoption of the capabilities required to compete effectively in 
key markets.

GRI reference: 404-2, 404-3

CLP has a comprehensive training and development 
framework in place, aligned to business objectives, to 
help our people to perform competently in their current 
roles and prepare them for future business challenges 
and opportunities. Investment is also made in the wider 
development of young people and to build future energy 
industry capability that is inclusive and accessible to all.

Standards and procedures
CLP’s strategic talent and leadership development approach 
seeks to attract, retain, and develop a diverse, multi-
generational workforce; and develop new skills and share 
talent effectively across the portfolio of businesses. 
Internal development efforts are supplemented by external 
recruitment for new-to-CLP skills focused on innovation, 
digital and renewables capabilities.

Investing in youth and early careers

Addressing future skills needs, and ensuring adequate talent 
supply to the evolving energy industry, requires significant 
investment in promoting and encouraging young people to join 
CLP, and accelerating development in their early careers.

Opportunities for young people are provided in Hong Kong 
through mentoring programmes, partnerships with local and 
overseas institutions to offer work placements to secondary 
and tertiary-level students, internships for fresh graduates 
across a range of disciplines, technical apprenticeships and the 
CLP Graduate Trainee Programme. The CLP Power Academy 
in Hong Kong offers programmes to provide an alternative to 
school leavers and working adults to pursue careers in the 
energy industry. CLP also participates in youth development 
schemes such as the Hong Kong SAR Government’s Greater 
Bay Area Youth Employment Scheme. In Mainland China, CLP 
supports local technicians and engineers to attain professional 
engineering qualifications.

Sustaining core skills and developing new skills for the future

Skills and safety training are provided to develop technical 
and functional competencies and behaviours. All CLP 
employees participate in an annual performance and 
development cycle. This provides ongoing feedback and 
coaching conversations, clarity in terms of expectations on 
behaviour and performance, understanding of how they 
contribute to CLP’s objectives, and support for individual 
development needs. Through this process, CLP also recognises 

and rewards individual performance and success. Employees 
are provided the opportunity to continuously learn and 
build skill via online and face-to-face learning resources and 
programmes, and can access company support for employee-
initiated self-development.

Developing leaders for a Utility of the Future

CLP's strategy requires a diverse leadership team, with 
the resilience, agility, stakeholder management and change 
leadership skills to position CLP for growth, and high-quality 
succession leadership roles. CLP remains committed to filling 
most leadership roles internally.

Strategic, general management and talent development 
programmes are used to develop future leaders, with 
programmes delivered internally (in Hong Kong through the 
CLP Learning Institute and Power Academy) and in partnership 
with leading academic institutions including the International 
Institute for Management Development (IMD), Tsinghua 
School of Economics and Management, Chatham House and 
the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). Expert 
briefings and workshops are conducted on the latest global 
economic, political and technological trends including energy 
transition, digital disruption, wellbeing and resilience.

Monitoring and follow-up
CLP conducts regular talent and capability reviews, 
underpinned by employee analytics, focused on both general 
management and engineering streams. These reviews monitor 
and follow up on actions to address current and future gaps 
and opportunities, including the progress of development 
programmes, recruitment campaigns, initiatives to strengthen 
gender diversity and cross-business assignments.

The effectiveness of this approach is measured against a 
range of key performance indicators, including retention of 
key talent, turnover, diversity and employee engagement 
measures, using developed employee analytics tools. The 
Board Human Resources & Remuneration Committee reviews 
talent and capability progress annually.

Despite the challenges of recruitment and delivering training 
during the COVID-19 pandemic in the past years, CLP increased 
its investment in youth development, core skills training and 
leadership development programmes, and invested in the 
training systems and frameworks needed to become a Utility 
of the Future.

support the accelerated development of mid-career engineers 
and managers. Engineering talent-rotations across Hong Kong 
and China were scaled up, together with continuation of 
CLP's Energy Transition Experience Programme introducing 
the energy business context and opportunities in Mainland 
China and preparing young talent for CLP’s energy transition 
and growth.

Digital skills continued to be deepened through power 
automation training and other upskilling programmes 
designed for employees at various levels. The Udemy 
platform has been launched in Hong Kong as a pilot online 
learning platform, providing a broad variety of courses with 
engineering-relevant contents.

Case study

Nurturing talents for the energy and power industry
As CLP is transforming into a Utility of the Future, 
it is committed to nurturing future-fit talents 
for the energy and power industry. Through 
its graduate trainee programmes, CLP supports 
graduates to equip them with the necessary skills 
and industry-specific knowledge and get broad 
exposure across CLP’s operations in Hong Kong 
and other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
The Engineering Graduate Trainee Programme intake 
of 2022 was the largest cohort ever – 41 engineering 
graduates from Hong Kong, China and overseas started 
with CLP in August 2022. Throughout the two-year 
Graduate Trainee programme, broad exposure across 
CLP’s operation and projects in Hong Kong and other cities 
in the Greater Bay Area will be provided. Comprehensive 
personal and career development support such as 
mentorship, soft skills and leadership training, is also 
included in the programme where trainee are rotated 
across business unit projects.

In addition to the Graduate Trainee Programme, 
Technical Officer Trainee Programme and Technician 
Trainee Programme, CLP introduced a new Digital 
Graduate Trainee Programme in 2022, providing more 
career opportunities for graduates who are passionate 
and interested in the energy and power industry. 
This two-year Digital Graduate Trainee programme 

equips graduates with critical capabilities, including 
but not limited to digital product management, 
system architecture, data analytics, IT, cyber security, 
project management, leadership, commercial skills and 
communication for impact.

Supporting employees to thrive on change
Our approach
CLP is committed to developing an engaged and high-
performing workforce, and to supporting all our people 
to thrive in this period of change brought about by 
energy transition.

GRI reference: 401-2, 401-3, 404-2

This is achieved through a long-term focus on maintaining 
strong working relationships with employees and their 
representatives, providing flexible working arrangements 
and benefits to support employees through all life stages, 
strengthening their wellbeing and resilience, and providing 
support and re-skilling to employees whose jobs are affected 
by the transition to net zero or other business restructuring.

Standards and procedures
Offering flexible working

CLP aims to support employees through all life stages, from 
young people starting their careers to retirement.

People at different life stages may benefit from different 
working arrangements and to this end, CLP promotes family-
friendly leave policies and flexible working arrangements. CLP 
also offers a range of leave options to help our people achieve 
a good work-life balance. These options include parental and 
adoption leave, volunteering and study leave.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CLP accelerated 
implementation of new ways for employees to connect 
virtually and perform their roles more flexibly, by improving 
flexible work policies and online collaboration tools. As the 
recovery from the pandemic begins, flexible working options 
have been embedded with increased take-up of new part-time 
work options and work-from-home arrangements.

Investing in health, wellbeing, and strengthening resilience

CLP provides comprehensive support for physical, social, 
financial and emotional wellbeing and is working 
towards meeting the requirements of ISO 45003:2021 
Psychological  health and safety at work – Guidelines for 
managing psychosocial risks, as part of the Occupational 
Health and Safety Management System. Confidential 
employee assistance programmes are also offered to assist 
employees who may encounter work or personal issues and 
need professional support.

Recognition of CLP’s wellbeing programme, and its coverage of 
all aspects, mental and emotional health, was received at the 
annual Best HR Awards hosted by Hong Kong recruitment 
company, CTgoodjobs. CLP received the Best Corporate 
Wellbeing Programme Award and the Top Happiest Culture 
Award at the 2022 Best HR Awards.

Keeping everyone informed and engaged

CLP’s employee relations approach focuses on establishing 
and maintaining strong working relationships with employees, 
being proactive in consulting on any workplace changes, 
and providing opportunities for employees to raise concerns. 
CLP employees have the right to join organisations and 
professional bodies of their choice. CLP respects and fully 
complies with all legal requirements with regards to union 
membership and collective bargaining. In Australia, CLP 
engages in collective bargaining with 840 employees via 
certified enterprise bargaining agreements approved by the 
independent workplace relations tribunal, the Fair Work 
Commission. These agreements cover most terms and 
conditions of employment, including notice periods, provisions 
for consultation and dispute resolution.

CLP organised the ‘Culture Jam’ Programme in Q3 2022 for 
employees in Hong Kong and Mainland China, to provide an 
opportunity for two-way dialogue on ways of working. During 
three days of online discussion, positive responses were 
received from over 6,000 colleagues across Hong Kong and 
Mainland China and over 30,000 comments were received. 
These valuable responses and engaging feedback will form the 
foundation of future culture-building.

Supporting employees and communities affected by energy 
transition or restructuring

Comprehensive support is provided to employees whose 
jobs are affected by business change or restructuring. 
This includes support tailored to individual needs, including 
training and skills development, career planning, assistance 
for redeployment and financial counselling. It also includes 
engaging actively with local stakeholders from employee 
representative organisations through local educational 
institutions to ensure that study opportunities are developed 
to help meet both the needs of our people, and the region’s new 
and emerging industries.

Following the announcement of the 2028 closure of 
EnergyAustralia's Yallourn Power Station in 2021, the 
Yallourn Workforce Transition Programme providing career 
transition support to employees was implemented. It has 
made significant progress in 2022. The comprehensive 
support programme includes components covering employee 
engagement, training, re-skilling and accreditation, financial 
advice, job search skills and other specialist support.

Read more on the case study of Ensuring a just 
transition for Yallourn in 2022 Climate-related 
Disclosures Report

Monitoring and follow-up
CLP uses independent external consultants to conduct regular 
employee engagement surveys to understand employees’ 
views. Following engagement surveys conducted in 2020 in 
Hong Kong and Mainland China, follow-up focus groups and 
pulse surveys were organised in 2022 for targeted groups to 
track responses.

In Hong Kong, joint consultative committees have been 
established which act as an additional channel of 
communication between the Company and the employees’ 
selected representatives. Employee benefits are regularly 
benchmarked to ensure that appropriate support is provided.

Health, Safety and Environment management
Our approach
Integrating health, safety and environment (HSE) standards 
across the Group’s businesses and processes helps 
achieve the goal of safe, secure and environmentally 
responsible operations. 

GRI reference: 403-1, 403-2 

CLP remains steadfast in continually improving its 
performance in HSE to build capabilities and capacities that 
enable the prevention of harm to employees, contractors, 
customers, the public, and the assets.

Excellence in HSE can only be achieved if CLP operates in a 
planned and systematic way. CLP has an integrated HSE policy 
which sets out high-level expectations driving the direction of 

the HSE Management System (HSEMS). A revamp of the Group 
HSEMS was completed in 2022 to replace the system created 
in 2014.

The refresh focused on further developing four areas of the 
existing HSEMS:

• Leadership and commitment;

• Planning and support;

• Operational enablers; and

• Monitoring, learning and improving.

Download the HSE Policy

HSEMS core components and relationship

The diagram above shows the core components of the Group's 
HSEMS and their interrelationships.  

The HSE Policy establishes the strategy, direction, and vision of 
CLP’s HSE performance expectations.

The revamped Group HSEMS allows CLP to manage risks 
in a planned and systematic way. It helps implement our 
commitment to continually improving HSE performance  and 
meeting the requirements of the Group’s new HSE Policy.

The HSEMS Standards are mandatory and assist in supporting 
the detailed requirements of the HSE Policy and Groupwide 
HSE risks. The HSEMS Directives have been developed to 
supplement the Standards by determining how processes are 

conducted across the Group. The HSEMS Supporting Tools 
have been developed to provide further support or guidance. 

The refresh of the HSEMS aims to provide:

• Clear requirements and expected outcomes based on goal-
oriented risk reduction;

• Process flexibility to account for operational diversity (e.g. 
size, regions, and nature of work conducted);

• Integration of the feedback loop between CLP Group 
requirements and work done by the frontline; and

• Less HSEMS clutter (e.g. unnecessary duplication of, 
inconsistent, or contradictory requirements).

Strategies and procedures
To support safe operations, CLP has in place an HSE 
Improvement Strategy. It has clear objectives, focus areas and 
timelines, and sufficient resources to achieve its objectives, 
including HSE professionals and an appropriate budget. 

Following the five pillars of the Group's HSE Improvement 
Strategy, an annual improvement programme is developed, 
approved and communicated to staff and contractors in each 
business unit. Recommendations are implemented on agreed 
timelines and programme process is monitored.  

For more details, read the Occupational health and 
safety section. 

Operational responsibilities
The Group Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) 
Committee, chaired by the CEO, has the highest executive 
responsibility on HSSE-related issues.

To build a sound safety culture across the Group, the Group 
Operations Leadership Team and the Global HSE Team conduct 
monthly or bi-monthly meetings to coordinate, monitor and 
share knowledge and experience in HSE practices across the 
Group. Special focus is given to becoming a better learning 
organisation to maintain high levels of safety performance. 

In addition, various HSE committees have been established 
to engage employees at the operational level. These 
committees also involve project partners and contractors. 
HSE professionals facilitate the overall engagement effort 
and advise on HSE matters, while the responsibility for 
implementing high levels of HSE standards rests with 
line management.

Occupational health and safety
Our approach
The Group-wide HSE Improvement Strategy aims to build 
individual, team and organisational capabilities and capacities 
that prevent harm to CLP's people and assets and the 
communities in which it operates. Using the Group's strategy 
as its base, each business unit annually develops its own HSE 
action plan for delivery. 

GRI reference: 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-5, 403-7, 403-8 

The CLP Group’s HSE Improvement Strategy in 2022 was 
based on five pillars. They are: 

• Building capabilities; 

• Rethinking risk; 

• Involving stakeholders; 

• Maintaining a healthy and engaged workforce; and 

• Ensuring environmental sustainability. 

Each pillar emphasises a key principle for effective HSE 
management. The pillars aim to uplift the Group’s safety 
culture across operations in all operating regions, promote 
more proactive risk management, and engage employees, 
contractors and other key stakeholders in collectively 
implementing changes to improve safety performance. There 
is a strong theme of becoming a better operational learning 
organisation throughout. 

Goals and targets
CLP is committed to ensuring all its activities and operations 
focus on the elimination of fatalities, life-altering injuries, and 
the occurrence of significant HSE events. 

Monitoring and follow-up
CLP's HSE Performance Monitoring and Reporting Standard 
sets out the safety performance indicators and requirements 
of safety data reporting. The indicators show trends and 
can help identify areas which may require more attention 
to prevent an incident from occurring. CLP has used 
targeted engagements and worker insights to aid in the 
development of more comprehensive and effective incident 
prevention interventions. 

Safety performance is reported internally on a monthly basis. 
Safety performance data and associated insights gained are 
collected and presented in the bi-monthly meetings of the 
Group Operations Leadership Team and the Global HSE Team. 
The data and insights are also reported on a quarterly basis to 
the Group HSSE Committee, chaired by the CEO. 

CLP’s HSE Incident Investigation and Reporting Standard 
sets out the minimum requirements for implementing and 
maintaining a safety incident management system across 
the Group. In the event of a major incident, the CLP Group 

Incident Investigation Panel (IIP) and Investigation Report 
Format Standard are followed. The IIP, chaired by senior 
members of staff from outside the business unit in which the 
accident occurred, conducts a thorough investigation. The IIP’s 
reports are critically reviewed by the Group Chief Operating 
Officer and the regional Managing Director. The intention is to 
identify the factors contributing to the incident and the actions 
required to prevent a recurrence. 

Training and awareness
Personnel will only be asked to do work in areas in which they 
are deemed capable and competent to perform their roles. This 
requires the careful selection, placement, training, ongoing 
competency assessment and authorisation of employees, with 
third-party independent assessment where appropriate. A 
system is in place to identify and deliver the training necessary 
to ensure an individual's competence and knowledge in 
understanding the hazards, risks and control measures 
associated with their work. 

At the asset level, there is flexibility to structure health 
and safety measures and design more specific approaches 
in providing relevant training. This includes monitoring 
the percentage of contractors who have undertaken this 
training. Safety training requirements are in all contracts 
and all contractors are expected to undergo safety training 
relevant to their duties. Spot checks are conducted to 
ensure compliance. 

Continuous improvement
Thorough investigations are conducted into all incidents that 
have the potential to cause serious injuries. The aim is to 
move beyond simply looking at human error as a cause, and 
to understand the more complex latent conditions within 
the systems people operate in that contribute to incidents, 
to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. CLP is committed 
to understanding how decisions and actions would be made 
by employees at a particular point in time in their work, 
by understanding the context which our people operate 
in. CLP is committed to learning from those closest to the 
work, to understand their challenges and identify practical 
improvement opportunities. We believe that by harnessing 
frontline knowledge into our solutions, we will not only get 
better solutions, but also foster an environment of ownership 
from our people who perform the work. 

To find new and better ways of working by learning from 
investigations into incidents, in 2022 CLP ran a “Risk – 
Gravitational Energy” campaign at its operations. The express 
goal of reducing activities where gravity may cause injuries, 
for instance when working at heights. Business units focused 
on learning from normal work in a proactive way rather than 
waiting for an event to occur before learning. In this way, CLP 
is making a fundamental shift in approach by utilising learning

teams in work streams where no injury event has actually 
ocurred. In 2022, there was a special CEO Award in its annual 
event which recognises work done in materially making an 
impact into reducing exposure to gravitational energy. 

Major progress has been made through both adopting 
technology and redesigning systems work approaches. 
Increased use of drones and robots for inspections has helped 
to reduce both the hours and frequency of working at height. 
CLP Power's construction project of the second new gas-fired 
generation unit in Hong Kong significantly reduced work at 
height exposure by utilising a safety in design approach in the 
modularisation of its components, which meant more work 

was done at ground level. Not only did this have a significant 
safety impact in reducing exposure hours to gravitational 
energy, it also delivered an efficiency improvement for cost 
and schedule. This initiative won the 2022 CEO Award for Risk 
– Gravitational Energy.

Lost time injury rate and total recordable injury rate of CLP Group (employees and contractors combined)

Both the lost time injury rate (LTIR) and total recordable injury rate (TRIR) have slightly increased in 2022. This is in part 
due to a single event with multiple injuries in our Hong Kong business and a significant increase of over 2 million work 
exposure hours conducted in 2022.

Public policy
Our approach
CLP acts as a trusted partner to governments and regulators 
in shaping practices and services that contribute to developing 
sound government energy policies and laws that balance 
social, economic and environmental needs.

GRI reference: 2-28, 415-1

The transition to a clean energy economy remains one 
of the critical agenda items for governments around the 
world. CLP continues to engage with governments and 
regulators in formulating decarbonisation policies and plans 
while delivering sustainable low-carbon energy systems 
for infrastructure investment that drives economic growth. 
Through participation in a range of industry and professional 

bodies, CLP provides input to the major issues deemed 
crucial to the energy sector’s ongoing viability and success, 
advocating as a thought leader of the industry.

CLP’s policy is to remain politically neutral and avoid making 
political contributions. Joining an organisation as a member 
is reviewed by the respective Corporate Affairs teams 
based on business objectives and engagement purposes. All 
membership proposals are subject to the final approval of the 
senior management of the Group or Business Units.

Download CLP's Policy on Making 
Political Contributions

Initiatives and progress
CLP continues to strengthen communications with 
governments and regulators, and contributes knowledge, 
experience, and best practices to support government 
decision-making processes. 

GRI reference: 2-28, 201-4, 415-1

Concerted efforts by the private and public sectors are critical 
to addressing the emerging challenges in the energy sector. 
CLP maintains regular communications with government 
and legislators through various channels such as site visits 
and information sharing sessions, to enhance the mutual 
understanding of strategies and policy directions in shaping 
a low-carbon future. CLP also actively responds to major 
public policy consultations and develops carefully considered 
positions that are relevant to the energy sector. By bringing 
its industry expertise to the table, CLP can add value to the 
discussion on how best to pave the way forward for the 
energy industry and the community, as technology and public 
needs evolve.

CLP’s responses to major public policy consultations – in 
addition to the Group-wide positions on critical issues such 
as climate change – are published and accessible on the 
Company’s websites. For example:

• CLP Power has pledged full support to the Hong Kong 
SAR Government’s Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 
2050 since its announcement in 2021. Echoing the Policy 
Address initiatives announced in 2022 to help Hong Kong 
achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, CLP Power fully 
supports the Government’s acceleration of decarbonisation 
efforts and housing and infrastructure development plans, 
including expediting infrastructure in new development 

areas and providing a roadmap for the electrification of 
public transport and commercial vehicles.

• For example, as one of the key strategies to decarbonise 
Hong Kong, the Government is encouraging motorists to 
switch to EVs. CLP Power announced an extension of its 
free EV-charging service until the end of 2023; continuing to 
provide a convenient and reliable public charging network 
for EV motorists across Hong Kong.

• EnergyAustralia welcomed the new Australian Federal 
Government following the elections in May 2022, and 
remains strongly committed to engaging with policymakers 
at all levels to advance the country's clean energy 
transition. Policy developments are expected to promote 
investments in new dispatchable capacity, enabling 
more renewable energy to enter the grid reliably and 
affordably. EnergyAustralia continues to strengthen its 
capital structure to fund its current and future investment 
needs, providing the reliable supply needed to support 
customer demand and the transition to a lower-carbon 
power market. 

• CLP contributed to the public consultations on the draft 
principles for voluntary carbon credit standards developed 
by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market 
(ICVCM) and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity 
Initiative (VCMI), which aim at setting a global standard 
for high-quality carbon credits and developing guidance on 
credible use of carbon credits in businesses.

• In support of the development of globally comparable 
sustainability disclosure standards, CLP submitted a 
response to the International Sustainability Standards 
Board’s (ISSB) public consultation in July 2022 
for the exposure drafts on General Sustainability-
related Disclosures and Climate-related Disclosures after

Case study

Promoting the development of low-carbon energy in Greater 
Bay Area
CLPe signed a memorandum of understanding 
(MoU) with the Longhua District People’s 
Government of Shenzhen Municipality (Longhua 
Government) in August 2022 to promote the 
development of low-carbon energy in the 
Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area 
(GBA) in support of Mainland China’s goal of 
reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2060.
Developing the GBA as an international innovation centre 
that leads the country’s green transformation is one of 
the emphases of the Chinese Government’s National 14th 

Five-Year Plan. Under the MoU, CLPe will work with 
the Longhua Government to develop digitalised energy 
projects and support the digital transformation of the 
Longhua District, with the aim of building a national pilot 
area which sits at the heart of the GBA. For example, 
CLPe will implement one-stop smart energy projects and 
solutions for buildings and parks, including renewable 
energy solutions, EV charging solutions, cooling systems, 
and energy storage applications.

Through this partnership, the Longhua Government can 
leverage CLPe’s professional knowledge and expertise in 

the energy sector to drive the development of integrated 
energy projects in the GBA. With the support of the 
Longhua Government, CLPe will establish its GBA head 
office in Longhua, making it the leading enterprise in the 
application of new energy in the district. The MoU also 
signifies CLPe’s strategic move in accelerating its business 
investment in the GBA.

Code of Conduct and anti-corruption
Our approach
CLP has built its reputation as a trusted partner upholding 
responsible business conduct and ethics. Guided by its 
Value Framework and Code of Conduct, CLP employees 
are committed to acting with integrity and honesty in all 
business activities and standing firm against corruption within 
the Group.

GRI reference: 2-24, 2-26, 205-1, 205-2, 205-3, 416-2

CLP’s Code of Conduct sets out 15 Principles that help 
drive the Company forward and serve as a tool to guard 
against corruption within CLP. The Code is applicable to the 
entirety of the Group, including CLP Holdings, its wholly 
owned subsidiaries, joint ventures or companies under 
CLP’s operational control or joint operational control. For 
transparency, it is also available to the public in both English 
and Chinese.

All employees of CLP, irrespective of their position and 
function, are expected to fully adhere to the principles. In the 
case of joint ventures or companies in which CLP does not hold 
a controlling interest, the representatives are also expected 
to act in accordance with the Code and to make a concerted 
effort to influence those with whom they are working to follow 
similar standards of integrity and ethical behaviour. Likewise, 
contractors working for CLP are encouraged to follow the Code 
for the duration of their contract.

15 Principles of CLP’s Code of Conduct

Download CLP’s Code of Conduct

CLP has a Whistleblowing Policy in place to encourage and 
assist employees and related third parties (such as customers 
and suppliers) who deal with CLP, to raise concerns about 
any real or perceived misconduct, malpractice or irregularity 
through a confidential reporting channel. The Whistleblowing 
Policy is available to the public in both English and Chinese. 
Concerns can be reported independently to CLP Group Internal 
Audit 24/7 through a dedicated whistleblower hotline or email. 
Any concerns received will be handled with care and treated 
fairly and properly.

Download CLP’s Whistleblowing Policy

Training and awareness
Code of Conduct training is mandatory for all staff joining 
the Company. CLP promotes the Code of Conduct and 
Whistleblowing Policy to employees, on a regular basis, by 
advising of any updates or revisions.

Every four years, the Company conducts a Group-wide 
Business Practice Review (BPR) through which all employees 
receive refresher training on understanding the Code’s 
Principles, to help ensure business practices remain compliant 
and ethical.

During these sessions, potential issues are raised and 
reviewed with management. A number of case studies based 
on past violations are included to demonstrate the proper way 
to handle potential and actual situations in which the Code has 
been violated. Contractors are encouraged to attend the BPR 
sessions alongside CLP employees.

The latest BPR training commenced in mid-2021 and was 
completed in 2022 for all regions, including Hong Kong, 
Mainland China, India, and Australia.

Monitoring and follow-up
The General Representation Letter (GRL) process is one of the 
means by which non-compliance with the Code of Conduct can 
be reported. It requires leaders of areas of responsibility to 
annually sign a GRL addressed to the Group Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) outlining their 
area’s adherence, or otherwise, to the Code of Conduct, 
amongst other Company policies.

The process reinforces personal responsibility for good 
governance and facilitates self-assessment on the adequacy 
and effectiveness of controls at different levels within 
CLP. As part of this annual process, business practices are 
reviewed and fraud risks in different areas are assessed, while 
irregularities or exceptions are reported for the attention of 
senior management. Leaders, including managers or above, 
Finance and Procurement staff, secretaries in the Group,

or other key staff considered appropriate by management 
must sign a Code of Conduct Compliance Statement on an 
annual basis.

The Group-wide reporting system for Code of Conduct 
violations applies to any alleged or potential breach. Potential 
violations of the Code of Conduct are reported to Group 
Internal Audit (GIA) by employees, vendors, contractors and 
GIA auditors. Communications are received through means 
such as anonymous letters, emails or phone calls. The Group 
Code of Conduct Committee, which comprises the Chief 
Financial Officer, Chief Strategy, Sustainability & Governance 
Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer, reviews and 
endorses any disciplinary measures to be taken.

GIA regularly reviews compliance with the Code, and 
investigates any potential violations, except for those related 

to human resources, which are investigated by Human 
Resources (HR). The number of breaches of the Code and 
any cases of corruption are reported annually to the Audit 
& Risk Committee (ARC), with the relevant data verified by a 
third party.

For a quicker response to Code of Conduct violations 
in Australia, EnergyAustralia has been delegated the 
responsibility of managing and acting on violations committed 
by EnergyAustralia employees. Under the delegation, 
EnergyAustralia informs the CLP Holdings ARC of cases 
involving senior EnergyAustralia employees.

For Apraava Energy, a separate Internal Complaints 
Committee has been established to handle complaints of 
sexual harassment at the workplace in accordance with 
Indian laws.

Initiatives and progress
In 2022, 10 breaches of the Code of Conduct were reported, 
though none were financially or operationally material to the 
Group, nor did they involve employees at the grade level of 
senior manager and above.

GRI reference: 406-1, 417-2, 417-3

The number of breaches of the Code of Conduct reduced from 
18 in 2021 to 10 in 2022. None of the 10 breaches of the Code 
of Conduct was material to the Group’s financial statements or 
overall operations, nor did they involve employees at the grade 
level of senior manager and above. In addition, there were no 
convicted cases of corruption. The breaches were managed 

internally in accordance with CLP’s complaint handling process 
for Code of Conduct breaches.

Regarding whistle-blowing cases, five cases were received in 
2022 compared with 25 in 2021.

Records of confirmed cases of Code of Conduct 
Principles breaches during the past five years are shown in the 
table below. Between 2018 and 2022, CLP did not have any 
breaches related to seven Code of Conduct principles, namely 
Political Contributions, No Bribery, Gift & Entertainment, Laws

Legal compliance
Our approach
The CLP Group operates in multiple jurisdictions each with 
different legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with 
the requirements of the jurisdictions in which it operates is 
CLP’s top priority for maintaining credibility and the social 
licence to operate.

CLP is a law-abiding company that aspires to go beyond 
legal requirements and bring international best practices to 
its operations. CLP voluntarily follows higher standards that 
reflect the Company’s principles and values and is prepared to 
forego opportunity or advantage when upholding the highest 
standards of corporate governance and integrity is necessary. 
Specific policies and guidelines for each operational area are 
in place to assist CLP in ensuring compliance with the differing 
jurisdictional laws and regulations relating to competition, 
personal data and privacy, intellectual property, health, safety, 
the environment, as well as employment and human resources 
amongst others.

Monitoring and follow-up
One of the responsibilities of the ARC is to review and monitor 
the Company’s compliance with the Code of Conduct, as well as 
the Company’s policies on compliance with applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements such as the Hong Kong Exchanges 
and Clearing Limited (HKEx) Listing Rules, the Companies 
Ordinance (Hong Kong) and the Securities and Futures 
Ordinance (Hong Kong). The ARC also reviews regulatory and 
legal issues. Every six months, Group Legal Affairs compiles a 
CLP Group Key Regulatory and Legal Compliance Issues Report 
for the ARC, which covers key regulatory compliance issues in 
addition to legal cases in which CLP is a named defendant.

CLP is often confronted with changes in the legal and 
regulatory regimes of the various jurisdictions in which it 
operates. The Company closely monitors emerging regulations 
and ensures that it is prepared for changes.

In reviewing new and amended laws and regulations which 
came into effect during the 2022 reporting year, CLP identified 
those which had or would have a significant impact on the 
business and are relevant for inclusion in this report. The 
threshold applied for assessing inclusion is whether significant 
investment or expenditure was required to ensure compliance. 
Laws and regulations that met this threshold are outlined in 
the respective sections of this report:

1. Emissions – air and GHG emissions, discharges into 
water and land, and generation of hazardous and non- 
hazardous waste;

2. Employment – compensation, dismissal, recruitment 
and promotion, working hours, rest periods, equal 
opportunity, diversity, anti-discrimination and other 
benefits and welfare;

3. Health and Safety – safe working environment and 
protecting employees from occupational hazards;

4. Labour Standards – prevention of child and forced labour;

5. Product Responsibility – consumer data protection and 
privacy; and

6. Anti-corruption – bribery, extortion, fraud and 
money laundering.

Initiatives and progress
There were three reportable case of legal non-compliance 
in 2022.

SASB reference: IF-EU-140a.2, IF-EU-550a.1; GRI reference: 2-27, 205-3, 206-1, 

306-3 (2016), 411-1, 413-2, 416-2, 417-2, 417-3, 418-1, EU22, EU25

In the spirit of transparency and accountability, CLP reports 
cases of legal non-compliance annually in this Sustainability 
Report. These include convicted criminal cases against CLP, 
and major breaches that resulted in significant fines (greater 
than HK$1 million) or non-monetary sanctions. CLP’s 2022 
legal compliance performance is summarised below, according 
to the GRI Standards 2021 and the HKEx Environmental, Social 
and Governance Reporting Guide.

The Company is also exposed to the risk of contractual 
disputes and litigation in the course of its normal operations. 
The Group considers each instance separately in accordance 
with legal advice and will make provision and/or disclose 
information as appropriate.

The Ho-Ping litigation is for alleged concerted action with other independent 
power producers (IPPs) in violation of the Taiwan Fair Trade Act. The Taiwan 
Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in 2013 ruled and fined nine IPPs for alleged cartel 
behaviour. The FTC’s decision was eventually overruled by the Taipei High 
Administrative Court (THAC) in October 2014. However, the FTC successfully 
appealed the THAC’s decision to the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC), and 
the case returned to the THAC for re-examination. In May 2017, the THAC ruled 
again in favour of Ho-Ping and rejected the FTC’s decision. In June 2018, the SAC 
accepted FTC’s further appeal and, for the second time, returned the case to the 
THAC for re-examination.

In June 2020, the THAC ruled in favour of Ho-Ping for the third time, and the 
FTC once again appealed to the SAC. In August 2022, the SAC ruled in favour 
of FTC. Ho Ping continues to defend its position and submitted application for 
a retrial in September.

In December 2021, the Victorian Workcover Authority (Worksafe) laid 
charges against EnergyAustralia Yallourn in relation to three breaches of 
the Occupational Health and Safety Act in relation to Graeme Edwards’ death 
at Yallourn Power Station in 2018. The three charges were related to failures to, 
so far as reasonably practicable, provide and maintain a working environment 
that was safe and without risk to health. At the committal mention on 3 June 
2022, a plea of guilty was entered in relation to the charges brought by 
WorkSafe. The sentencing hearing was held on 13 February 2023 where 
EnergyAustralia Yallourn was fined a total of A$1.5 million.

comply with its explicit informed consent (EIC) obligations in relation to some 
Victorian customers.

The EU commits to a number of compliance improvement actions, which 
include increasing the existing annual compliance training in relation to EIC 
requirements and quality assurance checks of sale interactions, appointing 
an independent compliance professional or legal practitioner to thoroughly

by EnergyAustralia to the AER) as well as breached the court-enforceable 
undertaking agreed with the AER in August 2019. The matter was settled 
in June 2022. The Federal Court of Australia agreed with the settlement 
terms put forward by the parties, which include declarations and a pecuniary 
penalty of about HK$60 million with a contribution to the AER’s costs of 
about HK$1,500,000.

Supply chain management 
Our approach
With the aim of powering the city responsibly, CLP extends 
our influence beyond our own operations and promotes good 
working practices throughout our supply chain. 

CLP's effective procurement and supply chain management 
system cultivates long-term and mutually beneficial 
relationships with suppliers who share our values and goals. 
The system is centred on the CLP Group Procurement 
Standard (GPS) which is supported by a set of policies.

The system aims to continually improve CLP's competitive 
advantage by forming commercially viable strategic 
relationships with its preferred suppliers. The approach 
measures business value outcomes in terms of the total 
cost of ownership management, environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) value, supply chain resilience, and 
innovation. As an integral part of the business operation, 
CLP’s procurement commitments are also embedded in a set 
of policies including CLP's Value Framework, CLP Procurement 
Values and Principles, CLP SCoC and other procurement 
policies that govern daily CLP operations.

Strategies and procedures
The GPS provides a framework towards world-class 
procurement practice and for raising CLP’s supply chain 

management capability to support CLP's transition to a Utility 
of the Future.

The GPS provides a structured path for the business to 
deliver value outcomes in the four critical areas of total 
cost of ownership management, sustainability, upstream 
supply chain resilience and innovation. It is regularly reviewed 
through internal engagement for continuous improvement.

The latest version of the GPS was released in early 2022 with 
safety within the supply chain serving as an overarching value 
for the five-dimensional framework. The five dimensions of the 
GPS are:

• Corporate strategy and guiding principles

• Business value outcomes

• Future-fit structures and collaboration

• People and technology

• Change management

For each dimension, the GPS defines levels of world-class 
practice from “basic” to “advanced”. Each business unit 
assesses their required level of functional capability to support 
their business outcomes, and then develops a plan from their 
current level of practice towards leading practices.

CLP’s Whistleblowing Policy and Harassment-Free Workplace 
Policy also enhance CLP's procurement operations and CLP 
encourages all suppliers to uphold the principles outlined in 
these policies.

CLP Procurement team is a member of project steering 
committees and provides appropriate levels of oversight and 
governance in procurement decision-making. Procurement 
commitments in the Company’s various regions are made with 
reference to the clearly-defined authorities set out in the 
Company Management Authority Manuals.

Monitoring and follow-up
CLP’s fit-for-purpose sourcing strategies are designed to select 
suppliers who will best meet its requirements and deliver 
value at an acceptable level of risk.

Following the standard procedure, supplier selections are 
conducted through competitive tendering which assesses 
each supplier’s ability to fulfil quality, health and safety, 
environment, delivery, innovation, sustainability and cost 
criteria. In every supplier contract, CLP safeguards its 
stakeholder interests and ensures the supplier meets its 
commitments and obligations, including legal and regulatory 
compliance, and obligations in respect of intellectual property 
rights, data confidentiality and security.

The Procurement Leadership Team, comprising each 
Region’s head of procurement, oversees aggregated future 
procurement needs, supply market opportunities and risks, 
and the development of procurement strategies.

Procurement and business unit personnel work 
collaboratively to review the market and assess the 
performance of incumbent suppliers, as well as monitor 
sustainability risks in the areas of human rights/modern 
day slavery, environment and community. This joint 
effort has improved CLP’s ability to formulate effective 
sourcing strategies, negotiate and manage risk and supplier 
relationships, and has resulted in tangible commercial benefits 
for each business.

For better management of supplier clusters, CLP segments its 
contracted suppliers into tiers based on relative contract value 
and potential business impact, including risks in relation to 
supply chain and sustainability. The tiers are reviewed on an 
annual basis. The process of segmentation allows CLP to apply 
appropriate levels of governance and engagement for efficient 
supply chain management.

In addition, quarterly risk assessments are conducted 
according to the Corporate Risk Framework for strategic 
suppliers with high business criticality and spend value. 
Heatmaps assist in determining the likelihood of failure events 
and their potential impact on the business. The assessment is 
conducted in conjunction with supplier risk management and 
supplier relationship management processes. Risk mitigation 
plans are developed to address identified risks related 
to delivery performance, supply disruptions and business 
continuity, and sustainability along the supply chain. Regular 
meetings with suppliers are conducted to discuss the 
progress of mitigation plans and explore opportunities for 
further improvement.

Continuous improvement
Through year-round operational, business, and executive 
reviews, CLP enhances its supplier relationship management 
process for strategic suppliers. The reviews consistently 
measure each strategic supplier’s delivery performance, and 
drive continuous improvements and alignment.

Past performance data, future business needs, and technology 
and innovation roadmaps are regularly reviewed with 
suppliers. While supplier performance is measured under a 
structured framework, suppliers are also invited to provide 
feedback to CLP. This approach provides candid two-way 
communication and continuous improvements in the long run. 
Supplier input, with specific focus on technology roadmaps 
and innovation, also strengthens CLP in preparing for 
future challenges.

For example, as a result of the review process, a talent 
development programme has been rolled out in CLP Power 
since 2021. It provides comprehensive training modules, 
including topics on category management and sustainable 
procurement, to uplift the capabilities of the procurement 
team in Hong Kong. Additional sustainability training on 
sustainable supply chain and other related topics will be 
arranged in 2023.

All suppliers contracted for critical projects were subject to 
sustainability risk assessments, representing 51% of total 
procurement project spend.

GRI reference: 2-6, 2-24, 204-1, 308-1, 308-2, 407-1, 408-1, 409-1, 414-1, 414-2

CLP defines critical projects by considering their importance to 
business operations, sustainability risks and contract value.

Suppliers of critical projects are assessed on their 
sustainability practices through various tools, including self-
declared questionnaires, proposal evaluation, site visits, 
and where subcontracting is involved, audits on the 
subcontractor's capability to meet the project's requirements.

In 2022, all critical projects awarded underwent sustainability 
risk assessments. These critical projects represented 51% of 
total procurement projects by value, as compared with 67% in 
2021 and 94% in 2020. The relatively high percentage in 2020 
was attributed mainly to one-off capital projects in Hong Kong.

In 2022, the Group sourced products and services from 6,127 
suppliers to the total amount of HK$54.8 billion – 84% of this 
total was spent on local suppliers based in the respective Hong 
Kong, Mainland China, India and Australia markets. Charts on 
the number of suppliers by region and the spend per region are

Working with an ESG-specialised data analytics company, 
in 2022, CLP’s procurement team reviewed its entire active 
supplier base of approximately 6,000 suppliers against ESG 
criteria in 2022. It included an assessment of its strategic 
suppliers against 54 ESG aspects (including human rights, 
bribery, carbon emissions, amongst others), sanctions, and 
industry risk based on the commodity and location of 
manufacturing bases. The assessment referred to various 
internationally credible third-party references, such as CDP 
Scoring and the Global Slavery Index. As a general statement, 
no major issue or finding was identified amongst the active 
suppliers reviewed.

In Hong Kong, to uplift the procurement team’s capabilities 
in managing its supply chain and associated risks, CLP 
Power introduced several capability development initiatives in 
2022, including:

• A corruption prevention webinar arranged with the Hong 
Kong Government’s Independent Commission Against 
Corruption (ICAC) to promote awareness of anti-corruption 
and anti-bribery practices when working with new and 
incumbent suppliers;

• A procurement talent development training programme 
providing foundational knowledge in core procurement 
practice areas and supply chain management;

• Contract law training sessions to further strengthen 
understanding of key contract terms relevant to 
potential supply chain disruptions or supplier non-
compliance events;

• A pilot applying a Know Your Counterpart (KYC) 
questionnaire which helps identify potential compliance 
and sanction risks arising from third party suppliers and 
their supply chains;

• Regular screening of existing and potential suppliers 
against international sanctions lists to ensure the timely 
identification, assessment and mitigation of potential 
sanction risks; and

• The introduction of preventive measures in CLP Power’s 
end-to-end procurement process to further mitigate 
potential “conflict of interest” risks, in line with CLP’s 
corporate requirements.

In Australia, EnergyAustralia was required to report under 
the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 and submitted its 
second statement in 2022. The Company updated its Modern 
Slavery Policy, covering EnergyAustralia’s obligations within 
its operations and supply chains, and how risks are identified, 
assessed and addressed.

In preparing its statement to the Australian Government, 
EnergyAustralia developed a risk matrix based on a survey 
of supplier locations and commodities to identify high-risk 
suppliers with special focus on modern slavery risk. Any 
suppliers identified as not having any policies or practices 
prohibiting child labour, or forced, bonded or involuntary 
prison labour will be provided with the tools to develop policies

and practices so that they can abide by EnergyAustralia’s 
SCoC. Energy Australia will subsequently conduct surveys to 
monitor their implementation.

Through its reconciliation action planning with Reconciliation 
Australia, EnergyAustralia has committed to increasing its 
number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander suppliers 
to support economic and social improvements for the 
First Nations people of Australia. To help deliver on this 
commitment, the Company engaged as member of two 
Aboriginal-led organisations with over 50% of representation 
coming from First Nations peoples, namely Supply Nation, 
a not-for-profit organisation encouraging the growth and 
engagement of Indigenous businesses, and the Kinaway 
Chamber of Commerce Victoria.

In 2022, Indigenous participation clauses continued to be 
included in EnergyAustralia supplier contracts, particularly 
for contracts for generation sites. By doing so, it seeks to 
encourage its suppliers to help drive Indigenous inclusion by 
increasing their Indigenous business spend, employment and 
cultural awareness.

During the year, EnergyAustralia’s procurement team received 
training and development on Indigenous procurement from 
Supply Nation. By year end, the procurement team reported 
that it had sourced goods and services from 10 Indigenous 
suppliers with a total of A$241,173 in spend.

Responsible procurement 
Our approach
As a responsible business, CLP requires alignment of its targets 
and objectives with those of its business partners. CLP is 
committed to building a value chain that, at its core, shares 
responsible procurement practices.

GRI reference: 2-24, 407-1, 414-2

CLP newly released the SCoC in 2022 which is derived 
from CLP's values, policies, standards and objectives. Setting 
out specific requirements for suppliers to support CLP’s 
environment, social and business objectives, the SCoC 
articulates our 11 responsible procurement practices. They are:

1. Legal Compliance

2. Business Ethics

3. Cybersecurity

4. Quality and Safety

5. Environmental Management

6. Climate Change

7. Employee Health and Safety

8. Labour Practices and Human Rights

9. Diversity and Inclusion

10.Community Relations

11. Supply Chain Management

Download the CLP’s Supplier Code of Conduct

With the introduction of CLP’s first SCoC, EnergyAustralia 
updated and relaunched its SCoC in December 2022. The 
new Code reflects the essence of CLP Group's responsible 
procurement practices. It includes a whistleblowing service 
that suppliers may contact directly or raise any concerns 
with anonymously. The new Code has been added to supplier 
contract precedents and EnergyAustralia Purchase Order 
Terms and Conditions.

Download EnergyAustralia's Supplier Code 
of Conduct

Operational responsibilities
CLP contract terms and conditions outline specific 
sustainability requirements and expectations regarding 
business ethics. Suppliers are encouraged to align with the 
requirements and expectations stated in the SCoC and are 
expected to adopt similar standards and practices when doing 
business with the Company.

The CLP team leading responsible procurement engages 
with key internal and external stakeholders to promote 
procurement practices that reduce ESG risks and enhance 
supplier capabilities to meet CLP’s sustainability expectations. 
The Company strives to shift from reactive risk mitigation to 
advancing opportunities on strategic sustainability priorities. 

Strategies and procedures
CLP takes a risk-based approach to responsible procurement 
across the procurement lifecycle. ESG risks are identified 
and evaluated regularly at category, project and supplier 
levels against each responsible procurement practice. This 
evaluation considers:

• Country-specific risks;

• Product/service-specific risks;

• Industry/category-specific risks;

• Legal and regulatory compliance risks;

• Cybersecurity risks;

• Labour practices and sub-contracting risks;

• Health and safety risks;

• Governance and business conduct risks;

• Environmental risks;

• Operational/supply chain risks; and

• Brand and reputational risks.

Specifically, the risk assessment aims to help CLP manage ESG 
issues, such as labour practices, human rights, modern slavery, 
child labour, harassment, safety, environment, subcontractor 
management and anti-bribery along the value chain. The 
risk assessment results provide insights into sourcing 
strategy development for categories and risk mitigation for 
strategic suppliers.

Initiatives and progress
CLP is strengthening its Responsible Procurement Framework 
and enhancing the visibility of supplier sustainability 
risk, as part of its three-year Responsible Procurement 
Roadmap, which was endorsed by the Sustainability Executive 
Committee in the third quarter of 2022.

Through collaborative programmes with suppliers, the three-
year Roadmap helps drive positive impacts that contribute 
to CLP’s sustainability goals and objectives.  In the first year, 
CLP is focusing on building the foundational capabilities and 
aspirations for sustainability in procurement. A key milestone 
was the launch of the new SCoC in December 2022, and 
the internal and external communication campaign around 
it.  Going into the second year, CLP will drive business

impact through a new SCoC questionnaire which profiles the 
supplier’s strengths or weaknesses against CLP’s responsible 
procurement practices.

Another project in progress aims to enhance the visibility 
of the sustainability risk profile of CLP’s supplier base. A 
third-party risk management framework is currently under 
development. This will help assess a supplier’s sustainability 
profile considering their industry and geography. All active 
and new suppliers will be assessed to identify sustainability 
risk hotspots, and be informed of further actions required, 
including possible support to improve their sustainability 
performance. The proposed assessment process is targeted 
for launch in 2023.

Case study

Supplier Code of Conduct to mandate CLP’s environmental, social 
and business objectives in its value chain

CLP newly released its Supplier Code of Conduct 
(SCoC) in December 2022. Derived from CLP's 
values, policies, standards and objectives, the 
SCoC is a general statement on its expectations 

of the suppliers CLP does business with and those 
who want to do business with CLP. 
The SCoC comprises 11 responsible procurement practices 
which align with CLP’s Value Framework.

• Legal Compliance – Comply with the laws and 
regulations of the jurisdictions in which CLP and its 
suppliers do business

• Business Ethics – Apply ethical business practices 
without conflict of interest or undue influence, and 
against bribery and unethical behaviours and practices 
in business decisions

• Cybersecurity – Respect and protect own data and the 
personal data of customers

• Quality and Safety – Provide reasonably priced and 
reliable energy, quality service and value to customers

• Environmental Management – Minimise the 
environmental impact of the value chain and preserve 
the natural environment proactively

• Climate Change – Decarbonise the portfolio and reduce 
Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions including 
upstream supply chains

• Employee Health and Safety – Provide guidance and 
support to suppliers to create a healthy and safe 
workplace for their employees.

• Labour Practices and Human Rights – Cascade CLP’s 
value to suppliers so as to provide a dignified, fair and 
equal workplace

• Diversity and Inclusion – Provide an inclusive and 
diverse workplace that enables CLP to serve its diverse 
portfolio of customers

• Community Relations – Create a positive impact and 
minimise operational impact through engagement 
with local communities

• Supply Chain Management – Encourage suppliers to do 
business responsibly with their upstream suppliers

For each of the practices, the SCoC highlights what 
the supplier must comply with and what they should 
work towards.

The SCoC is embedded into CLP tender documents 
and contracts. CLP encourages its suppliers to monitor, 
manage and disclose their performance to SCoC and 
to extend similar principles into their upstream supply 
chains. To facilitate the communication with suppliers and 
their understanding of the SCoC, CLP continues to actively 
provide feedback and advice to its suppliers to help them 
work towards reaching CLP’s expected standard.

If there is a gap between a supplier’s approach and the 
SCoC, CLP will encourage the supplier to formulate and 
implement an enhancement plan. To support CLP’s efforts 
in managing its supply chain, CLP may request a supplier 
to provide evidence of accreditations, certifications, self-
assessments, compliance reviews and audit reports.

Providing access to reasonably priced energy
Our approach
Access, in the context of electricity supply, is the ability to 
use a reasonably priced and reliable electricity supply. CLP 
understands that electricity services are essential and strives 
to make them available to all.

Across the Group, services are in place that ensure most 
challenges, including language, culture, literacy, financial 
situation or disability, do not prevent people from accessing 
and using the Company’s products and services.

Special arrangements are in place for customers facing 
financial difficulties to avoid having to disconnect their 
electricity supply.

In Hong Kong, CLP Power offers a braille bill to assist those who 
are visually impaired. In Australia, EnergyAustralia provides 
interpreter services for those with a first language other than 
English, and also offers hearing-impaired and vision-impaired 
billing services.

Initiatives and progress
Various subsidy schemes and hardship programmes in Hong 
Kong and Australia continued to relieve the hardship suffered 
by those in need and safeguard their access to electricity.

SASB reference: IF-EU-240a.3

Hong Kong
Despite soaring international fuel prices for electricity 
generation resulting in an increase in the fuel cost adjustment, 
CLP Power strives to smoothen price fluctuations to provide 
reasonably priced and stable electricity supply.

During 2022, CLP Power offered more than HK$220 million of 
community funding to launch a series of community support 
programmes. For example, while supporting residential 
customers, CLP Power offered a total of HK$50 million in 
electricity subsidies to around 50,000 households in need 
through the ongoing CLP Power Connect Programme. Under 
the programme, CLP Power also provided subsidies and one-
stop support for the landlords of subdivided units to carry 
out rewiring works, and install individual electricity meters for 
tenants of subdivided units, to improve the safety of the units 
and electricity usage tracking. The programme was launched in 
January 2019, and at the end of 2022, 40 subdivided units were 
rewired with 134 individual electricity meters installed.

Soaring international fuel prices and surge in the fuel cost 
for electricity generation have led to an increase in Fuel 
Clause Charge. To ease the burden of families in need, 
CLP Power allocated HK$100 million in 2023 to the CLP 
Fuel Cost Subsidy Programme, providing one-off fuel cost 
subsidies to 150,000 underprivileged households and tenants 
of subdivided units in its supply area. In addition to that, it 
allocated HK$25 million in 2023 to help tenants of subdivided 
units to improve their home safety and living conditions as 
well as subsidise families in transitional housing to buy energy-
efficient electrical appliances.

CLP Power announced HK$200 million in community support with 
HK$100 million allocated for subsidising the fuel expenses of 150,000 
grassroots families in 2023.

EnergyAustralia recognises that all customers need to be 
able to access its products and services fairly and equally. 
Through its Energy Charter, EnergyAustralia commits to 
working together to improve affordability and to support 
customers experiencing vulnerable circumstances.

2022 disclosure

2022 was another challenging year for Australian customers 
with an unprecedented number of factors impacting their 
ability to pay – such as longer than expected recovery 
timeframes for businesses impacted by the pandemic, 
supply chain issues, inflation, interest rate increases, general 
cost of living expenses and multiple flooding events 
on the east coast in Australia. This saw a significant 
increase in both residential and business customers 
experiencing financial difficulties and seeking support. In 
response to the current economic environment and the 
reoccurring natural disasters from January to December 2022, 
EnergyAustralia helped residential customers experiencing 
difficult financial situations by putting in place over 225,851 
payment plans and granting more than 363,338 payment 
extensions. For customers impacted by long-term financial 
hardship, assistance is available under the EnergyAssist 
hardship programme.

The programme helps customers by offering tailored payment 
plans, payment matching and debt waivers, as well as 
energy efficiency education to ensure that customers are 
well-informed for making decisions. EnergyAustralia monitors 
the number of customers on the programme, their debt levels, 
and the number of successful completions. In 2022, 37,864 
account holders entered the programme and 11,441 account 
holders left the programme after successfully completing their 
payment commitments. This represents a graduation rate of 
30%, slightly higher than 27% in 2021.

EnergyAustralia’s business customers were some of the first to 
access tailored support. Rapid Business Assist, a programme 
launched in 2020 to support SMEs facing financial uncertainty, 
continued in 2022. In consultation with customers, 
specialist EnergyAustralia business advisers customise 
payment schedules, offer free standard disconnections and 
reconnections, advise on lowering energy consumption, and 
provide guidance on government energy relief subsidies. 
In 2022, the programme provided more than 15,624 
payment extensions and over 2,490 payment plans for 
business customers.

In addition, EnergyAustralia partnered with various 
organisations to assist customers in financial hardships and 
improve energy efficiency. EnergyAustralia is a member of 
The One Stop One Story Hub Partnership, which helps 
connect its customers and supports those facing Family 
and Domestic Violence or financial hardship to navigate 
support programs available without having to repeat their 
situation multiple times. Since becoming a partner in May 
2022, EnergyAustralia assisted 109 customers to date. 
EnergyAustralia also partnered with Uniting Energy Audits 
to provide its customers with energy efficiency information 
via a home or phone audit. This organisation also provided 
additional support in the form of referrals to other support 
services and completing applications related to government 
grant. EnergyAustralia also partnered with the Good Guys to 
assist with the delivery of new appliances and removal of old 
ones as part of our appliance swap programme.

Strategies and procedures
CLP’s community investment strategy is guided by the CLP 
Group Community Initiatives, Sponsorship and Donation 
Policy, which sets out principles and directions in the 
implementation of community initiatives across all business 
units and functions. The policy, alongside the Company’s 
corporate governance and internal control measures, as well 
as a standardised online reporting platform, aim to facilitate 
a coherent and transparent approach in the assessment, 
design, review and reporting of CLP’s community activities. 
This helps ensure resources are effectively deployed to serve 
the community’s needs in a timely manner.

The strategy focuses on four key areas: Community Wellbeing, 
Environment, Education and Development, and Arts and 
Culture. Each business unit implements the strategy according 
to local conditions and community needs.

Monitoring and follow-up
The CLP Group Community Initiatives, Sponsorship and 
Donation policy is reviewed every three years to ensure it 
aligns with the Company’s development and changes in the 
external environment.

Different socio-economic impact measurement tools that 
evaluate the social impact of community initiatives have been 

benchmarked. The most suitable tools are used to review the 
effectiveness of CLP's community initiatives.

CLP has a standardised online reporting system for reviewing 
and reporting its community initiatives. The system is 
designed to enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency 
of these initiatives by aggregating data on themes, partners, 
spending, beneficiaries, volunteer hours and impacts.

Initiatives and progress

Providing opportunities to young people and nurturing 
future generations
Fresh graduates and career starters face many 
challenges nowadays, particularly in the face 
of economic downturns resulting from the 
pandemic. Across its business areas, CLP Power 
is keeping up its efforts to address the needs of 
local youth and give support in collaboration with 
various partners.
In Hong Kong, Vocational and Professional Education 
and Training (VPET) plays a vital role in broadening the 
learning opportunities of school leavers and in-service 
personnel. In collaboration with the Vocational Training 
Council CLP Power launched the CLP Award for VPET 
Students in 2020. The award assists VPET-enrolled 
students with their financial needs to allow them to 
continue their studies. The VPET programmes offer higher 
diploma training in electrical engineering, mechanical 
engineering, environmental engineering, computer and 
electronic engineering, and environmental protection 
and management.

In 2022, the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund (CESF) 
has allocated HK$1.5 million to the award, providing 
a subsidy of HK$20,000 to each eligible student and 
benefitting a total of 75 students in each cohort. The 
award not only provides training opportunities to these 
students in the energy sector, but also helps nurture 
a new generation of talent for Hong Kong's power 
engineering industry.

In collaboration with the Correctional Services 
Department, CLP Power helps young persons in 
incarceration and those who have been released 
reintegrate into the society, as well as gain knowledge 
and skills via career talks and interview skills workshop. 
Two talks were arranged in Q4 2022 for some 80 young 
inmates to provide them with information on continuation 
of study and pathways to engineering.

CLP Power supports the Government’s Strive and 
Rise Programme by nominating 16 mentors, including 
graduate trainees, young engineers and other 
representatives from various business units, to join the 
one-year mentorship programme. The mentors will be 
paired with junior form underprivileged students on a 
one-on-one basis and provide them with advice on life 
and study via a wide range of activities including visits to 
CLP facilities.

Furthermore, as part of "The Green Cedar Project", 
a poverty alleviation and ethnic minorities culture 
preservation campaign launched by CLP in Guangxi, 
Mainland China since 2019, CLP published the first Black 
Miao Dictionary in the region to support the educational 
development of local students. The dictionary features 
about 1,500 vocabularies and short sentences using 
Mandarin homophones and Pinyin, enabling students to 
learn the Black Miao language with ease and appreciate 
the beauty of the language, which is ebbing away.

Healing the social scars from the pandemic
To fully support the local community on the 
journey of pandemic recovery, CLP Power rolled 
out a range of targeted initiatives to address the 
needs of the communities of Hong Kong.
During the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, CLP 
donated HK$2 million to Hong Kong Community Anti-
Coronavirus Link (HKCACL) to buy 10,000 sets of 
personal protective equipment for volunteers carrying 
out anti-infection work in the community. To support 
the community in its fight against the pandemic, CLP 
Power relaunched an electricity bill payment deferral 
programme for SMEs in the catering and retail trades, 
allowing them to defer payment for two months.

Although schools have resumed face-to-face classes, a 
combination of that and e-learning has become a new 
normal as the pandemic continues to disrupt normal 
life. CLP launched a Student E-Learning Assistance 
Programme to donate new iPads, laptops, internet 
mobile WiFi hotspots and data SIM cards to 1,500 
primary, secondary, and tertiary students from low-
income families. The initiative aims to help youngsters 
with online classes and e-learning as they prepare for the 
new academic year.

Under the prolonged pandemic, CLP Power facilitated 
social engagement for the elderly by organising four 
community tours for over 60 elderly who are living in Sha 
Tau Kok and Shatin to tour around the historic landmarks 
and beautified distribution box and substation on the 
Senior Citizen’s Day, enabling them to reconnect with 
the community and learn more about the relationship 
between the electricity supply and the community. Over 
5,300 goody bags were prepared to elderly in need 
in 2022.

In addition to supporting HKCACL for purchasing 10,000 
sets of personal protective equipment for its volunteers, 
CLP volunteers prepared more than 13,500 anti-virus 
goody bags for distribution to frontline medical staff. CLP 
volunteers used their design thinking skills and expertise 
to develop a digital solutions management system for 

the HKCACL, allowing it to better manage volunteer data 
and inventory, match service and supply requests, and 
support the operation of its call centre. CLP Power also 
worked closely with HKCACL on a series of communication 
campaign themed “One Heart, Fight the Virus” to inject 
positivity to the society and show appreciation to all walks 
of life during the pandemic. In addition, 5,500 free meal 
coupons and emergency food packs were distributed to 
the CLP Hotmeal Canteens’ service users. Over 20,000 
nutritious food packs were distributed to children from 
low-income families through 29 NGO partners. DIY solar 
fan workshops were arranged for the beneficiaries.

In Mainland China, to support the local community, 
CLP donated RMB300,000 (HK$371,169) to support the 
COVID-19 relief efforts by local authorities in Qian’an 
county, Jilin province, where several of its wind farms are 
based. Employees meanwhile continued a programme of 
regular visits to distribute food and necessities to people 
in villages and elderly homes near CLP’s plants during the 
Chinese New Year holiday period.

CLP’s effort in helping people in need through its 
community programmes is well recognised and won the 
Outstanding Corporate Award and Gold Award of the 
Volunteer Hour Award for Corporate in the Hong Kong 
Volunteer Award 2022.

CLP distributes e-learning devices to 1,500 underprivileged students and 
encourages them to use them for more effective learning.

Reconnecting society and strengthening social ties in post 
pandemic era with series of social events
As we moved forward to the new normal, CLP 
Power launched a series of social events in Hong 
Kong to reconnect the society.
To conclude the We Love Dance programme launched 
in 2021, CLP Power organised a dance competition 
to promote exercise, energy-saving and caring for the 
underprivileged, while spreading positive energy to 
energise the city via a city-wide dance campaign. In the 
final dance competition, eight teams of talented dancers 
selected from 50 entrants took to the floor to display their 
dance moves designed around themes of love, electricity 
and energy-saving in a show of creativity and vigour. Since 
the programme launched in October 2021, more than 
5,500 participants joined a range of community activities 
including over 100 community classes, a 10-day mobile 
truck roadshow and family online dance contest.

In addition to energising the community through dance, 
CLP Power extended the campaign to support those 
in need. For every dance completed by participants 
in the extensive programme of activities, CLP Power 
offered electricity subsidies to beneficiaries of the CLP 
Power Connect initiative. The beneficiaries included 
elderly people, disabled people, low-income families and 
tenants of subdivided units. The campaign contributed 
HK$2 million in subsidies to the initiative.

We love Dance concluded with a dance competition that not only energised 
the city but also encouraged the public to embrace low-carbon living

To spruce up the ubiquitous grey distribution boxes across 
the city, the Distribution Box Beautification Project was 
launched in 2021 by featuring the work of local artists 
on distribution boxes in four districts of Hong Kong. The 

project has extended to the other 10 districts in the CLP 
Power’s supply area in 2022. The artworks were themed 
on local landmarks, cultural elements and sustainable 
power generation. The artworks were developed in 
collaboration with students of the Technological and 
Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong and local artists. 
An artwork exhibition was staged to bring more exposure 
to the initiative and encourage the public to adopt 
green lifestyle via appreciation of the distribution box 
artworks. New guided tours to visit the boxes, the 
traditional shops and local landmarks at Tsim Sha Tsui, 
Sham Shui Po and Yuen Long , were conducted for 
students to inspire them to learn about the unique 
history of their districts and the relationship between 
electricity and community. In extension to the Project, 
Art x Tech workshop has also been introduced to four 
secondary schools to increase students’ awareness in 
decarbonisation via virtual world applications.

Given its popularity with the local community, the 
beautification project has also been implemented to 
substations to enhance the dissemination of green 
messaging and social engagement. Two murals were 
completed at Haiphong Road Substation, Tsim Sha Tsui, 
and Hung To Road Substation, Kwun Tong, in August 2022 
and January 2023 respectively. The Beautification Project 
in 2022 is one of the endorsed programmes under Hong 
Kong SAR's 25th anniversary celebrations.

Case study

Teaming up with local initiatives and giving back to the community 
through EnergyAustralia’s Community Grants Programme
EnergyAustralia is committed to making a 
positive contribution to local communities. The 
Community Grants Programme provides funding 
to local initiatives that aim to deliver sustainable 
benefits and achieve tangible outcomes.
EnergyAustralia is proud to be involved in the 
communities where it operates. It recognises the 
importance of engaging with the community to build 
a vibrant place to live and work. Community Grants 
Programme support this endeavour by providing funding 
to local initiatives which deliver sustainable benefits 
and tangible outcomes to the communities at the sites 
it operates, including Hallett Power Station, Mount 
Piper and Wallerawang Power Stations, Tallawarra 
Power Station, Yallourn Power Station and the Geelong 
Call Centre.

In 2022, EnergyAustralia provided over A$140,000 (HK$ 
759,270) to grass roots communities to support local 
projects in the areas of education, social inclusion and 
regional sports and recreation through its Community 
Grants Programme.

The Geelong Call Centre funded to the  Wangala Primary 
School to build a yarning circle at an unused site within 
the school’s ground. This yarning circle will be a place 
for students to come together to yarn and share their 
feelings and stories. It seeks to build resilience as part 
of their wellbeing programme. ‘Yarning’ is part of First 
Nations culture – a culture fully embraced by the school 

and proudly reflected  in its local Wadawurrung name, 
Wangala, meaning "to make good" or "to make right".

Yallourn Power Station granted its fund to the Thorpdale 
Primary School for a Sound Writing Program. The 
Sound Write program uses structured synthetic phonics 
resources to teach students to read, write and spell. It 
provides children with the skills to decode words rather 
than memorise them to learn. Throughout the year, the 
programme has helped many students at the school learn 
to read, write and spell using phonics. These grants, which 
support and connect with the community that Yallourn 
has been part of for 100 years, are supported by more 
than 500 employees at Yallourn site.

Safety around CLP’s network
Our approach
Public health and safety concerns are largely related 
to electromagnetic fields (EMF) arising from the CLP 
power system. Measurements of EMF remain well below 
international guidelines.

GRI reference: 416-1, 416-2

While the Group’s HSE Management System Standard sets 
out an overarching approach to managing the safety risks in 
operations, responsibility is also taken for preserving public 
health and safety, including for people who work or live in close 
proximity to electricity supply lines.

CLP operates a transmission and distribution network in Hong 
Kong, as well as transmission networks in Shenzhen, China and 
North-eastern part of India, covering Assam, Nagaland and 
Manipur. Working near electricity supply lines can pose safety 
concerns. The Hong Kong and Mainland China operations 
conduct regular construction site inspections and provide 
cable plans and safety talks to road work contractors and 
site management personnel to enhance safety awareness at 
all locations.

EMF arising from power systems can be of public health 
concerns. CLP’s power supply equipment fully complies with 
the guidelines issued by the International Commission on Non-
Ionizing Radiation Protection. Regular EMF measurements 
of power supply equipment are carried out jointly with the 
Electrical and Mechanical Services Department of the Hong 
Kong Government. The measured EMF levels continue to be 
well below the guideline limits.

Regarding customer health and safety, CLP Power has 
customer service centres conveniently located in its supply 
areas in Hong Kong to provide assistance on product safety, as 
well as advise on energy-efficient products, energy-saving tips 
and other account management issues. In 2022, there were 
no reportable cases of CLP products affecting customer health 
and safety in Hong Kong.

Maintaining proper Health, Safety and Environment management practices for transmission towers is important to keep the general public safe.

Nuclear safety
Our approach
CLP is the minority owner of two nuclear power stations in 
Mainland China. The power stations have adopted defence-
in-depth principles to ensure multiple independent layers of 
safety protection.

SASB reference: IF-EU-540a.2

Nuclear risk management
The safe and steady operation of the two nuclear power 
stations remains a top priority. The defence-in-depth principle 
of safety is applied across the full spectrum of areas – 
from design, site selection, operation, radiation protection, 
environmental monitoring, to emergency preparedness. The 
safety principle of "As Low As Reasonably Achievable" is also 
applied to ensure robust radiation protection.

The two nuclear power stations have achieved good safety 
performance over the years. This achievement is a result of:

• Adopting best international practices, including the 
International Atomic Energy Agency Nuclear Safety 
Standards, in its operations;

• A well-trained and qualified workforce;

• Well-established safety practices and procedures; and

• Comprehensive risk analysis and mitigation.

Learn more about the contingency plan of Daya Bay

Nuclear waste management
Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (Daya Bay) follows 
national policy and international practices for nuclear waste 
management. The station stores its spent nuclear fuel onsite in 
dedicated storage facilities.

The back-end management of the fuel cycle remains onsite for 
a number of years before being passed on to a service provider 
licensed by the Chinese Government for reprocessing. The 
service provider is supervised by the National Nuclear Safety 
Administration and its environmental impact is monitored 
by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The policy in 
Mainland China on reprocessing spent nuclear fuel is similar to 
that of a number of European countries.

As the minority owner of Daya Bay, CLP is not in a position to 
report on the back-end management of the fuel cycle in China, 
including the status of the reprocessing plants for spent fuel.

Low- to intermediate-level solid radioactive waste is packed 
and stored in a dedicated facility onsite on an interim basis 

and is secured to prevent unauthorised access. The waste 
is transferred to a final repository operated by a service 
provider, using the shallow burial method commonly adopted 
in the United States, France and the United Kingdom. The 
operation of the offsite repository is under the supervision 
of the national nuclear regulator and relevant nuclear 
safety regulations.

Monitoring and follow-up
Radiation exposure for workers is closely monitored and 
managed by plant operators both collectively and at an 
individual level as part of operating protocols. Workers incur 
most of their radiation dosage during planned refuelling 
outages, when much of the work is undertaken at the nuclear 
generating units. The level of radiation dosage is typically 
associated with the number of planned outages carried out at 
the units, which require inspection and maintenance activities 
in radiation-controlled areas.

Training and awareness
An onsite training school provides professional training 
on operational procedures for nuclear sites. The training 
aims to enhance nuclear safety and systematically 
minimise human error. There is a once-every-five-years 
requalification mechanism to ensure operator professionalism 
and competency in plant operation.

In line with good business practice, Daya Bay has provisioned 
for the expenses associated with the future decommissioning 
of the plant as required by relevant laws and regulations.

Initiatives and progress
Daya Bay continued to operate smoothly in 2022. There was a 
Level “0” Licensing Operational Event which was below scale 
and with no safety significance in the year.

GRI reference: 306-3 (2016), 306-1, 306-2, 306-3

The average dose rate in 2022 was less than 0.4 mSv 
per person per year. For the purpose of comparison, the 
background radiation dose rate for Hong Kong is 2.4 mSv per 
person per year from the natural environment.

The charts below show the amount of spent nuclear fuel and 
low- to intermediate-level radioactive nuclear waste from 
Daya Bay over recent years. The amounts of both types of 
waste are related to the number of planned refuelling outages 
in each year.

Two planned refuelling outages were carried out in Daya Bay 
in 2022. Therefore, the total quantity of spent nuclear fuel 
generated was at an expected level.

Collective radiation dosage for workers

The collective radiation dosage for the year was 
720 man-mSv, greater than the 2021 level of 
642 man-mSv when there were two planned 
refuelling outages.

Bearing in mind different stakeholder interests, CLP emphasises value creation over the long 
term, and does this in a way that helps serve the communities in which it operates.
GRI reference: 201-1

One way to understand this emphasis is through the value created and distributed by CLP to different stakeholders. In 2022, 99.6% 
of the economic value generated by CLP was distributed to stakeholders, including employees, partners, capital providers and the 
community at large.

1 The system of rules applied in recording and reporting accident statistics complies with the International Labour Organization (ILO) Code of Practice on Recording 
and Notification of Occupational Accidents and Diseases.

2 Refers to the number of fatalities as a result of work-related injury.
3 Starting from 2021, the unit is changed from the number of cases to the number of personnel.
4 Refers to the number of fatal injuries per 200,000 work hours in the year.
5 Rates are normalised to 200,000 work hours, which approximately equals to the number of hours worked by 100 people in one year.
6 Starting from 2021, “Days Away From Work Injuries” replaces “Lost Time Injury”. Days Away From Work Injuries refers to the number of personnel who sustains 

work-related injury and is unfit to perform any work on any day after the occurrence of the injury. “Any day” is any calendar day which includes rest days, weekend 
days, leave days, public holidays or days after ceasing employment. It does not include the day the injury incident occurred. “Days Away From Work Injuries” excludes 
fatalities which were included in “Lost Time Injury”. Numbers prior to 2021 are the previously reported numbers for “Lost Time Injury”.

7 Refers to the number of Days Away From Work Injuries and Fatalities per 200,000 work hours in the year.
8 Refers to the number of personnel who sustains life threatening or life-altering work-related injury. It is a subset of Days Away From Work Injuries.
9 Refers to the number of Total Recordable Injuries per 200,000 work hours in the year. Total Recordable Injuries include Fatalities, Days Away From Work Injuries, 

Restricted Work Injuries, and Medical Treatment Injuries.
10Starting from 2021, “Work-related Ill Health” replaces “Occupational Disease”. Work-related Ill Health includes the diseases listed in the ILO List of Occupational 

Diseases, work-related mental illnesses and work-related disorders. Numbers prior to 2021 are the previously reported numbers for “Occupational Disease”.
11 Starting from 2021, “Lost Days” replaces “Days Lost”. “Lost Days” is the sum total of calendar days (consecutive or otherwise) after the days on which the work-related 

injuries and work-related ill health occurred. “Days Lost” accounts the working days instead of calendar days. Numbers prior to 2021 are the previously reported 
numbers for “Days Lost”.

12 19 out of 304 days were carried forward from one incident in 2020.
13 188 out of 443 days were carried forward from one incident in the past.
14 158 out of 464 days were carried forward from three incidents in the past.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting guideline
A Group-wide GHG Reporting Guideline was first developed in 
2007 to specify the collection and compilation methodology 
of the Group’s GHG data. The Guideline was developed 
with reference to the following international standards 
and guidelines:

• The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) of the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the 
World Resources Institute (WRI);

• The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Corporate Value Chain 
(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard;

• The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Technical Guidance for 
Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (Version 1);

• The 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories;

• Relevant IPCC Assessment Report;

• The International Standard for GHG Emissions ISO 14064-1: 
Greenhouse Gases; and

• Methodologies agreed with local authorities.

The CLP GHG Reporting Guideline is reviewed in accordance 
with CLP internal practices and updated with the latest 
references at least once every three years. The current 
Guideline was last updated in 2020.

CLP’s GHG emissions inventory covers six GHGs specified in 
the Kyoto Protocol, including carbon-dioxide (CO2), methane 
(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and 
sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are also 
included but not used in CLP’s operations. Nitrogen trifluoride 
(NF3), the seventh mandatory gas added under the second 
Kyoto Protocol, was also considered for inclusion, but after 
evaluation was deemed immaterial to CLP’s operations. 
The GHG reporting scope definitions for GHG emissions are 
available here.

Focus has been given to sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), an 
insulating gas commonly used in switchgears and transmission 
lines. CLP is aware of its high global warming potential and 
therefore is vigilant in controlling SF6 leakage throughout 
the life cycle of electrical equipment, and actively exploring 
ways to reduce the use of SF6 in its business. For example, 
in Hong Kong in 2022, a field trial on non-SF6 gas 
switchgears at distribution level has started and availability 

of proven non-SF6 gas equipment at transmission level will be 
closely monitored.

Compilation bases
CLP reports the GHG emissions of its generation and energy 
storage portfolio on three consolidation bases to provide a 
comprehensive overview of its carbon footprint and progress 
in decarbonisation efforts. The three bases are:

• Equity basis: This includes the electricity generated by 
CLP’s assets. It accounts for the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 
emissions according to CLP’s equity share in the portfolio. 
The equity basis reflects economic interest, indicating the 
extent of GHG risks and opportunities CLP has from assets 
in which it holds a majority or minority share.

• Equity and long-term capacity and energy purchases: This 
includes both electricity generated by CLP’s assets as well 
as the electricity purchased through capacity and energy 
purchase agreements. It allows stakeholders to better 
understand the GHG intensity of the electricity CLP delivers 
to customers. In addition to the GHG emissions from the 
equity basis, it also includes the direct GHG emissions from 
the generation of purchased electricity.

Purchase agreements help the Group meet local market 
needs and usually entail significant investment. To qualify for 
inclusion in this metric, these long-term capacity and energy 
purchase agreements must have a duration of at least five 
years and the equivalent capacity of 10MW or more.

• Operational control: This represents the total GHG 
emissions from generation assets where CLP has direct 
influence and control on operational matters. CLP has been 
disclosing its combined total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 
emissions on this basis for over a decade, and will continue 
to demonstrate its long-term progress.

Conscious of emissions along the value chain, in 2019, the 
Company conducted a review of its Scope 3 emissions and 
started to disclose Scope 3 emissions to present a more 
comprehensive picture of its footprint along the value chain. 
Scope 3 emissions typically represent less than 40% of CLP’s 
GHG emissions.

Calculation methodologies

Scope 1 & Scope 2 GHG emissions
The Scope 1 emissions and location-based Scope 2 emissions 
are calculated in accordance with CLP’s GHG Reporting 
Guideline outlined above.

Annually, CLP obtains emission factors from each business 
unit’s local government and authority in their respective 

jurisdictions. In cases where local emission factors are not 
available, other recognised sources are referenced.

Scope 3 GHG emissions
The table below summaries the Scope 3 categories that 
were identified as relevant to CLP, and how their emissions 
are calculated.

natural gas retail business, 
including the emissions from 
upstream gas production and 
transmission, and distribution 
leakage in the State 
pipeline systems.

• Assessed using the average-data method. The quantities of natural gas 
supplied are multiplied by State-based upstream emission factors to 
calculate the emissions.

• Emission factors source: Australia’s National Greenhouse Accounts 
Report 2022.

b) Non-products-related 
emissions relate to the 
upstream emissions of CLP’s 
purchased goods and services 
other than natural gas for 
retail business.

• Assessed using the spend-based method. Country-based World Input-
Output Database (WIOD) factors are applied to the financial spend on 
the purchase of non-product-related goods and services.

• Emission factors source: WIOD Release 2016.

2: Capital goods

Emissions from the 
extraction, production 
and transportation of 
capital goods purchased 
or acquired.

Relates to the upstream 
emissions of CLP’s purchased 
capital goods, mainly for 
infrastructure construction 
and facility upgrades.

• Assessed using the spend-based method. Country-based WIOD factors are 
applied to the financial spend on the purchase of capital goods.

• Emission factors source: WIOD Release 2016.

3: Fuel- and energy-
related activities

Emissions related to the 
extraction, production and 
transportation of fuels 
and energy purchased 
or acquired.

Includes the upstream 
emissions of purchased fuels 
and electricity for CLP's 
power generation.

• Assessed using the average-data method.

• Upstream emissions (Well-to-tank, WTT) of purchased fuels and electricity 
are calculated by using volumes of purchased fuels and electricity and 
country-based WTT emission factors, where available. Where such volumes 
are not available, the ratio of the WTT emission factor to direct emission 
factor for each fuel type is applied to the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of 
the generation assets.

• Emission factors source: Australia’s National Greenhouse Accounts 
Report 2022, 2022 UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for 
Company Reporting.

Includes the direct emissions 
from the generation of 
purchased electricity that is 
sold to CLP's customers.

Includes the upstream 
emissions from the generation 
of purchased electricity that is 
sold to CLP's customers.

• Direct emissions and upstream emissions from the generation of purchased 
electricity that is sold to CLP's customers are assessed using the supplier-
specific method. This involves using emissions data of generation assets 
whose capacity and energy are purchased by CLP to meet customer 
demand. The calculation multiplies the percentages of capacity and energy 
purchased by CLP with direct emissions and upstream emissions (WTT) of 
the generation assets.

• Emissions from the generation of purchased electricity that is sold to CLP's 
customers also include the emissions from the net electricity purchased 
by EnergyAustralia from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). 
This is assessed using the average-data method, which involves estimating

Glossary

Air emissions The emission of air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PMs).

Availability The fraction of a given operating period in which a generating unit is available without outages and capacity 
reductions. This is also known as the Equivalent Availability Factor.

Baseload An operating regime of power generation at a reasonably constant rate to serve continuous system load, and not 
designed to respond to peak demands or emergencies.

Capacity purchase Additional third-party owned power generation capacity contracted by CLP under long-term agreements to meet 
customer demand. Some of these agreements may confer CLP rights to use the generation assets and exercise 
dispatch control as if they belonged to the Group.

Capital investments Includes additions to fixed assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets, investments in and advances to joint 
ventures and associates, and acquisition of businesses. 

Carbon credit A carbon credit is a tradeable instrument which represents either: (a) a permit which gives the holder the right to 
emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent greenhouse gas (tCO2e) into the atmosphere; or (b) a certificate from 
a project that represents the removal or avoidance of one tCO2e from the atmosphere. 
CLP Carbon Credits (https://www.clpcarboncredits.com) are generated from renewable energy sources and can 
be used to offset carbon emissions generated by governments, organisations or individuals.

Carbon neutral When the greenhouse gas emissions associated with an activity or entity are balanced by carbon removal 
elsewhere, such as carbon credits, carbon sinks or storage, and renewable energy certificates.

Climate Action Finance 
Framework (CAFF)

Launched in 2017, CAFF supports the transition to a low-carbon economy by attracting socially responsible, 
sustainable financings, and to support CLP’s investments that reduce the carbon content of energy generated 
and increase the efficiency of energy usage. The CAFF formalises and governs project evaluation, management of 
proceeds and reporting for Climate Action Finance Transactions, including bonds, loans and other forms of finance.

Climate Vision 2050 CLP’s Climate Vision 2050 sets out the blueprint of the Group’s transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions 
leading up to mid-century. Launched in 2007 with a focus on the ambition to mitigate CLP’s climate impact, Climate 
Vision 2050 has been instrumental in informing CLP’s business strategy and guiding its investment decision-
making.

Combined-cycle gas 
turbine (CCGT)

A technology used in gas-fired generation to enable significantly higher efficiency by utilising residual heat from 
a gas turbine exhaust to run a steam turbine and generate additional electricity.

Decarbonisation Decarbonisation of the power sector primarily refers to the reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions from 
electricity generation, and providing lower-carbon energy services and solutions to customers. At CLP it is 
measured by the reduction in carbon intensity, which is expressed in kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour 
of electricity sent-out.

Decentralised 
generation / 
distributed generation

Refers to electrical generation and storage performed by a variety of technologies of a smaller scale located 
close to the load they serve. In contrast, centralised generation is the large-scale generation of electricity serving 
multi-loads connected to the transmission network.

Demand response Demand response programmes encourage participating customers to commit to short-term reductions in 
electricity demand, helping energy suppliers to keep the grid running optimally during high load periods.

Digitalisation The application of new information technologies including artificial intelligence and data analytics to help electric 
utilities develop new customer-centric services and improve operations.

Distributed energy Distributed energy includes power generated from sources such as solar panels and wind turbines located close 
to the users, as well as controllable loads or storage such as electric vehicles and batteries.

Electricity sent-out Gross electricity generated by a power plant less self-generated auxiliary power consumption, measured at the 
connecting point between the generating unit and transmission line.

Methodology

Energy-as-a-Service A business strategy of energy companies to provide a more diverse range of value-adding energy services and 
solutions such as consultancy, energy management and distributed energy resources to customers, in addition to 
basic utility services.

Energy attribute 
certificates (EACs)

EACs are a category of contractual instrument that conveys certain information (or attributes) about the energy 
generated, including the resources used to create it, the emissions associated with its production, the location of 
the facility that generated the unit of energy and when the unit of energy was produced. EACs are usually issued 
for renewable energy. Currently, CLP offers two types of EACs, namely Green Electricity Certificates (GECs) and 
Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). See definitions of both in this Glossary.

Energy purchase Electricity purchased by CLP to meet customer demand under long-term agreements from power plants not 
owned by CLP, and without existing capacity purchase agreements with the Group.

Energy security The uninterrupted availability of energy sources.

Energy transition The transition of the global energy sector from fossil-fuel based energy systems to low- or zero-carbon sources.

Energy 
transition enablers

Non-generation products or services that facilitate the energy transition, including energy storage, transmission 
and distribution, electric vehicle charging points and smart meters, amongst others.

Equity basis An approach set out by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard for an organisation to consolidate GHG emissions 
for the purpose of accounting and reporting GHG emissions. On this basis, the organisation accounts for GHG 
emissions from operations according to its equity share in the operations.

Feed-in Tariff (FiT) Payable by Hong Kong power companies under the SoC Agreement to purchase electricity from approved 
renewable energy projects. Find out more at https://www.clp.com.hk/en/business/low-carbon-solutions/
renewable-energy/feed-in-tariff-business

Flue gas desulphurisation 
(FGD) facility

Equipment used to remove sulphur oxides from the combustion gases of a boiler plant before discharge to 
the atmosphere.

Generation capacity The maximum amount of power that a generator is rated to produce. Also known as installed capacity or 
nameplate capacity.

Green Electricity 
Certificates (GECs)

GECs refer to the energy attribute corresponding to the electricity sold by renewable energy projects. In 
Mainland China, the origin of GECs are certified by National Energy Administration Renewable Information 
Management Centre.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) The emission of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect causing a changing climate. CLP’s GHG emissions 
inventory covers the six GHGs specified in the Kyoto Protocol. Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), the seventh mandatory 
gas added under the second Kyoto Protocol was deemed immaterial to CLP’s operations after an evaluation.

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard classifies an organisation’s GHG emissions into three ‘Scopes’. Scope 1 
emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from 
the generation of purchased energy. Scope 3 are indirect emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in the value 
chain of the organisation.

Just transition For energy companies, the transition to a net-zero economy directly impacts individuals, workers, and 
communities. A just transition seeks to mitigate negative impacts on people while effectively harnessing 
opportunities to deliver equitable and inclusive outcomes.

Megatrends Large, transformative global forces that define the future by having a far-reaching impact on business, economies, 
industries, societies and individuals. A megatrend is distinguished from other trends in that it cannot be stopped 
or significantly altered, even by powerful actors such as governments.

Megatrend analysis is an important tool for companies aiming to drive sustainable growth as competition 
increases and new disruptive ideas and concepts affect entire industries.

Microgrids Localised networks with generation, energy storage and load entities, that can operate in tandem with an existing 
grid or independently. They can potentially be deployed to meet the energy needs of remote areas cost-effectively, 
foregoing the expense of transmission grids.

National Electricity 
Market (NEM)

Australia’s NEM is a wholesale spot market connecting six regional market jurisdictions – Queensland, New South 
Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.
