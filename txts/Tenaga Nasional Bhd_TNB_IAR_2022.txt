28 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

OVERVIEW 

It	has	been	a	momentous	year	as	the	world	stepped	up	to	embrace	endemicity,	a	key	development	that	has	seen	businesses	and	societies	recovering	
both	in	strength	and	vibrancy.	The	return	to	normalcy	was	a	welcome	change	following	more	than	two	years	of	disruptions,	 lockdowns	and	strife	as	a	
result	of	the	COVID-19	pandemic.	

The	optimism	for	a	more	stable	and	predictable	operating	environment	was,	however,	disrupted	by	the	start	of	the	Russia	Ukraine	conflict	in	February	
2022,	which	threw	global	supply	chains	into	disarray	and	raised	commodity,	energy	and	food	prices.	Coupled	with	resurgent	consumer	demand,	this	led	
to	higher	inflation,	prompting	central	banks	all	over	the	world	to	respond	with	tighter	monetary	policies.	This	was	true	too,	in	Malaysia,	with	Bank	Negara	
Malaysia	raising	interest	rates	four	times	during	the	year	to	ease	inflation.	

Despite	this	backdrop,	Malaysia	was	still	able	to	record	economic	growth	of	8.7%,	an	impressive	effort	as	the	country	got	back	on	track,	free	from	the	
shackles	 of	 the	 pandemic.	With	 greater	 economic	 activity	 fuelling	 this	 growth,	 electricity	 demand	was	 also	 higher,	 registering	 a	 5.2%	year-on-year	
increase	in	group	demand	growth,	which	helped	TNB	deliver	robust	revenue	and	profits.	Higher	fuel	costs	persisted,	however,	exacerbated	by	the	Russia	
Ukraine	conflict,	which	remains	a	challenge	that	we	face	today.	

Nevertheless,	 at	TNB,	we	 remained	 steadfast	 in	our	 commitment	 to	meeting	 the	energy	needs	of	 industrial,	 commercial	 and	 residential	 customers	

amid	the	buoyant	economic	recovery.	The	significant	investments	we	made	over	the	years	to	diversify	energy	sources	as	well	as	grow	our	renewable	

energy	portfolio	enabled	us	to	continue	providing	sustainable	and	reliable	energy.	Our	efforts	were	recognised	by	our	customers	as	shown	by	consistent	

performance	for	two	consecutive	years	in	our	Customer	Satisfaction	Index	scores	of	87%	in	2022.	

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Shareholders, 

It gives me great 
honour to present to 
you Tenaga Nasional 
Berhad’s (TNB) 
Integrated Annual 
Report for the year 
2022.

FINANCIAL	STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

29TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

Energy	 Commission	 and	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Natural	 Resources,	 Energy	 and	

Climate	 Change	 to	 work	 together	 to	 ensure	 balanced	 and	 sustainable	

development	of	the	electricity	supply	industry	in	Malaysia.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

In	 the	 year	 under	 review,	 driven	 by	 higher	 consumption	 by	 industrial	 and	

commercial	customers,	we	saw	more	robust	economic	activities	throughout	

the	year.	While	this	demand	drove	our	revenues	higher,	we	recorded	a	lower	

profit	after	tax	of	RM3.56	billion	or	8%	lower	year-on-year	compared	to	the	

RM3.86	 billion	 reported	 in	 2021.	 This	was	 primarily	 due	 to	 a	 deferred	 tax	

movement	and	the	imposition	of	the	Prosperity	Tax.

Nevertheless,	we	 remained	committed	 to	our	dividend	policy	of	a	30%	to	 

60%	payout	ratio	based	on	Profit	After	Tax	and	Minority	Interest	(PATAMI).	

As	 such,	 the	 Board	 is	 pleased	 to	 declare	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 26.0	 sen	 per	

share.	Together	with	our	interim	dividend	of	20.0	sen	per	share	paid	on	14	

October	 2022,	 this	 brings	 our	 total	 dividend	 for	 the	 year	 to	 46.0	 sen	 per	

share	or	55.2%	of	PATAMI,	which	 is	higher	 than	 the	40.0	 sen	per	 share	or	

52.8%	of	PATAMI	for	2021.	

REIMAGINING SUSTAINABILITY – DRIVING THE ENERGY TRANSITION 

The	conversation	surrounding	climate	change	and	climate	action	continues	

to	 grow,	 both	 in	 terms	 of	 intensity	 and	 depth.	 The	 tone,	 as	 well,	 has	

become	far	more	serious	and	urgent	as	we	see	or	experience	firsthand,	the	

catastrophic	effects	of	extreme	weather	events	which	are	becoming	more	

frequent,	 damaging	 and	 severe.	 From	droughts,	 the	 continued	melting	of	

the	 ice	 caps,	 extreme	flooding	 and	wildfires,	 the	 year	 2022	was	 a	 year	 of	

extreme	weather	events.	

To	 bring	 it	 back	 to	 our	 own	 setting,	 Malaysia	 continues	 to	 suffer	

from	 perennial	 flooding	 as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 monsoon	 rains,	 which	 also	

affects	 TNB's	 operations	 and	 assets.	 However,	 the	 most	 significant	 

climate-change-related	incident	in	2022	was	the	extensive	damage	to	high	

voltage	transmission	towers	connected	to	the	Sultan	Mahmud	Power	Station	

at	 the	Kenyir	Dam	 in	Terengganu,	which	was	triggered	by	unprecedented	

landslides.	

This	underscores	how	critical	it	is	to	take	action	now	to	slow	global	warming.	

As an electricity utility with stakes across the whole value chain from 

generation	to	retail,	TNB	acknowledges	that	we	must	be	part	of	the	solution.	

Thus,	to	put	our	words	into	action,	in	August	2022,	we	announced	that	TNB	

would	commit	Capital	Expenditure	(CAPEX)	for	initiatives to	fast-track	our	

Energy	Transition	(ET)	Plan.	which	aspires	to	reduce	our	emissions	intensity	

to	net	zero	by	2050	in	a	responsible	and	sustainable manner.

Beyond	 our	 operational	 obligations,	 the	 Group	 has	 continued	 to	

advance	its	Reimagining	TNB	2025	strategy	and	taken	our	sustainability	

commitments	 one	 step	 further,	 by	 launching	 the	 blueprint	 that	 will	

enable	us	to	lead	the	nation's	energy	transition.

In	 staying	 true	 to	our	purpose	of	 building	 a	Better	World	 and	Brighter	

Lives,	we	 have	 continued	 to	 uplift	 the	welfare	of	 the	 communities	we	

serve	 through	 impactful	 educational	 and	 socioeconomic	 initiatives.

In	 2022,	 we	 continued	 to	 support	 the	 government’s	 extension	 of	

the	 electricity	 rebate	 programme,	 which	 was	 first	 launched	 during	

the	 pandemic	 and	 provides	 a	 RM40	monthly	 electricity	 bill	 rebate	 for	

underprivileged	and	poor	families.	

We also thank the Government for its support in approving the

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS



WE	ARE	TNB FROM OUR LEADERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY	STATEMENT

30 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

This	 represents	 a	 significant	 step	 forward	 for	 

us	 and	 the	 country	 as	 we	 commit	 our	 full	

support	 to	 taking	 the	 lead	 in	 driving	 the	

energy	 transition.	 In	 doing	 so,	 TNB’s	 ET	 Plan	

is	 the	 catalyst	 for	 the	 SP2050,	 providing	 the	

spark	 to	 accelerate	 decarbonisation	 and	 the	

sustainable	 growth	 of	 our	 grid,	 electrification	

and	 renewable	 energy.	 This	 ultimately	 

supports	 our	 Reimagining	 TNB	 strategic	

blueprint,	which	will	 enable	us	 to	 stay	 relevant	

and	 also	 puts	 sustainability	 front	 and	 centre	

in	 achieving	 our	 goal	 of	 being	 a	 leading	 global	

electricity	utility.	

The	 approach	 under	 the	 ET	 Plan	 will	 be	 more	

pervasive	and	will	move	at	a	 faster	pace	as	we	

plough	 in	 resources	 to	 decarbonise,	 digitalise	

and	 electrify	 across	 the	 entire	 value	 chain	 to	

generate	 cleaner	 power,	 create	more	 efficient	

cities	 and	 electrify	 the	 transportation	 sector.	

Other	 expected	 outcomes	will	 be	 a	 significant	

increase	 in	 renewable	 energy	 capacity	 and	 a	

stronger,	 more	 interconnected	 ASEAN	 grid.	

The	 plan	will	 also	 pursue	more	 efficient	 usage	

of	energy	through	smart	and	digital	technology,	

much	 wider	 use	 of	 batteries	 and	 a	 range	 of	

carbon	management	strategies.	

Although we are only at the start of our  

28-year	 journey,	 through	 our	 sustained	 efforts	

and	 by	 keeping	 in	mind	 the	 sobering	 reminder	 

that saving our planet is ultimately the 

responsibility	 of	 its	 tenants,	 I	 am	 optimistic	

that	 TNB	 will	 pull	 through	 and	 deliver	 on	 its	

aspirations.	

GOVERNANCE 

As	 we	 move	 forward	 in	 unison	 to	 achieve	 our	

sustainability	 aspirations,	 of	 equal	 importance	

is having the right governance structures 

to	 provide	 the	 appropriate	 oversight	 and	

guidance.	 In	 this	 context,	 we	 have	 established	

the	 Sustainability	 &	 Energy	 Transition	 Council	

(SETC),	which	 is	 a	merger	 of	 the	 Sustainability	

Development	 Council	 and	 the	 TNB	 Energy	

Transition	 Steering	 Council.	 This	 merger	

will	 enable	 TNB	 to	 better	 streamline	 the	

management	 of	 sustainability-related	 efforts	

and	initiatives.	The	Board,	too,	has	kept	abreast	

of	the	latest	developments	in	the	ESG	landscape,	

having	attended	a	range	of	sustainability-related	 

training	courses	as	well	as	ESG	forums	in	2022.	

GIVING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES 

At	 TNB,	 the	 needs	 of	 Malaysians	 have	 always	

been	close	 to	our	hearts.	 In	building	a	Brighter	

Community,	our	corporate	social	 responsibility	

efforts	 are	 focused	 on	 the	 three	 (3)	 pillars	 of	

education,	 socioeconomic	 and	 environment.	

This	 year,	 we	 continued	 to	 provide	 a	 range	 of	

educational	 opportunities,	 scholarships	 and	

direct	aid	to	the	underprivileged.

Through	 our	 education	 trust	 fund,	 Yayasan	

Tenaga	 Nasional	 (YTN),	 TNB	 offers	 a	 range	 of	

scholarships	 for	 students	 to	 pursue	 tertiary	

education	both	locally	and	internationally.	Over	

the	last	three	decades,	YTN	has	sponsored	more	

than	20,500	students,	providing	funding	of	more	

than	RM1.7	billion	through	initiatives	such	as	the	

TNB	Prime	Scholarship,	TNB	Shine	Sponsorship	

and	 the	My	Brighter	Future	programme	 for	 the	

B40	community.	 In	 2022	alone,	we	contributed	

RM107.81	 million	 to	 these	 scholarships	 and	

convertible	 loans	 programmes.	 We	 also	 set	

aside	RM1	million	in	2022	to	continue	our	Ceria	

Ke	Sekolah	programme,	benefiting	B40	students	

in	schools	in	55	locations	nationwide.	

In 2022, we forged a range 
of strategic partnerships 

to decarbonise the 
power sector and 

expand electrification 
infrastructure for 

transportation.

TNB	has	commenced	the	journey	under	the	ET	

Plan.	 In	 2022,	 we	 forged	 a	 range	 of	 strategic	

partnerships	 to	 decarbonise	 the	 power	 sector	

and	 expand	 electrification	 infrastructure	 for	

transportation.	 In	 addition,	 we	 are	 equipping	

greater numbers of customers with rooftop 

solar	PV,	investing	even	more	in	wind,	hydro	and	

solar	 energy	 capacity,	 strengthening	 the	 grid	

and	 expanding	 the	 regional	 interconnections	

within	ASEAN.	

TNB	plans	to	substantially	increase	its	renewable	energy	generation	portfolio	as	part	of	its	journey	towards	becoming	
coal-free by the year 2050.

rakyat	and	economic	growth.	As	a	caring	corporate	entity,	

we	 will	 implement	 this	 decision	 wholeheartedly	 to	 help	

Malaysians	cope	with	ever-increasing	cost	pressures.	

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

I	 wish	 to	 thank	 the	 Board	 of	 Directors	 for	 their	 support,	

wisdom	and	counsel	in	navigating	a	challenging	year.	I	must	

also	 acknowledge	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 Management	

Team,	 which	 continues	 to	 execute	 TNB’s	 strategic	

aspirations	 with	 dedication	 to	 deliver	 results.	 They	 are	

tirelessly	supported	by	our	employees	who	have	displayed	

extraordinary	resilience	throughout	these	turbulent	times.	 

I	 am	 highly	 appreciative	 of	 the	 dedicated	 efforts	 of	 our	

Warga	TNB	who	enable	us	to	serve	the	rakyat	every	single	

day.	

I	 express	 my	 appreciation	 to	 our	 stakeholders,	 including	

shareholders	 and	 industry	 partners,	 for	 their	 unswerving	

trust	in	our	operations	that	will	progressively	bring	TNB	to	

greater	 heights.	 We	 are	 most	 thankful	 to	 our	 customers	

who	we	continue	to	support	every	day	through	the	supply	

of	sustainable	and	reliable	energy.	

I	 also	bid	 farewell	 to	our	Chairman,	Dato’	 Sri	Hasan	Arifin,	 

who	ceased	to	hold	office	with	effect	from	1 January	2023.	 

Thank	 you,	 Dato’	 Sri,	 for	 your	 contribution	 to	 the	

organisation.	We	have	been	enriched	by	your	expertise	and	

guidance.

In	 closing,	 I	 recognise	 that	 I	 have	 taken	 the	 helm	 of	 the	

Board	of	the	largest	utility	in	Malaysia,	which	carries	with	it	 

a	huge	responsibility.	I	plan	to	utilise	all	that	I	have	learnt	in	

my	36	years	of	working	in	electricity	generation,	regulation	

and	 government	 to	 steer	 the	 organisation	 forward	 

alongside	my	 fellow	Board	members	and	the	Management	

Team.	

Thank	you.

TNB	 has	 also	 sought	 to	 train	 and	 reskill	 workers	 via	

the	TNB	Reskilling	Malaysia	 (TRM)	programme	at	our	

technical	training	institute	(ILSAS),	where	we	not	only	

train but also secure job placements for workers in 

electricity	industry-related	jobs.	In	2022,	we	expanded	

this	 to	 include	 roles	 in	 the	gig	 economy,	 recognising	

that	 labour	market	trends	have	evolved	with	the	rise	

of	digitalisation.	The	TRM	programme,	from	inception	

until	 December	 2022,	 has	 job-matched	 11,029	 job	

seekers	and	completed	8,090	traineeships.	

Our	socioeconomic	efforts	are	encapsulated	in	several	

programmes	 aimed	 at	 creating	 positive	 impacts	 on	

our	communities.	Through	the	Program	Mesra	Rakyat	

(PMR)	and	Program	Baiti	Jannati	(PBJ),	we	help	the	B40	

communities	and	hardcore	poor	to	build	or	 refurbish	

their	 own	 homes.	 In	 total,	 more	 than	 1,000	 families	

have	 received	 new	 or	 upgraded	 homes	 since	 these	

programmes	commenced.	We	also	continue	to	assist	

Institut	 Jantung	 Negara	 (IJN)	 and	 Yayasan	 Kebajikan	

Negara	 (YKN)	 in	 their	 efforts	 to	 provide	 temporary	

accommodation	 for	 family	 members	 accompanying	

patients	at	government	hospitals.	

I	am	also	proud	of	our	employees,	who	have	embodied	

our	 core	 value	 of	Mindfulness	 and	 taken	 strongly	 to	

the	Tabung	Warga	TNB	Prihatin,	which	enables	 them	

to	 contribute	money	 directly	 to	 our	 humanitarian	 or	

community	efforts.	

OUTLOOK 

Looking	 ahead,	 we	 step	 into	 2023	 with	 positive	

momentum although we recognise that Malaysia’s 

economic	 growth	 is	 set	 to	 moderate	 from	 the	 high	

achieved	in	2022	in	light	of	a	potential	global	recession.	

However,	 the	 forecast	 of	 economic	 growth	 of	 4.5%	

in	 2023	 does	 indicate	 that	 electricity	 demand	 will	

remain	 robust	 in	Malaysia.	As	such,	we	 remain	deeply	

committed	to	ensuring	reliable	supply	to	our	customers	

to	support	the	nation’s	continued	growth.	

With	 higher	 inflation	 affecting	 households	 and	

businesses,	 in	 late	2022	 the	government	announced	

the	 implementation	of	 a	 targeted	electricity	 subsidy	

scheme	for	domestic	users	to	continue	enjoying	tariff	

rebates	on	 their	electricity	bills	 and	did	not	 increase	

the	 surcharge	 on	 tariffs	 for	 a	 select	 group	 of	 small	

businesses	and	industries.	We	will	continue	to	support	

the	 government's	 continuous	 effort	 to	 manage	 the	

tariff	 within	 the	 framework	 of	 the	 ICPT	mechanism,	

while	balancing	the	need	for	affordable	tariffs	for	the	

Governance 

We	have	established	the

32 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

PRESIDENT/CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW

With	 the	 threat	 of	 the	 pandemic	 subsiding	 and	 the	 path	 towards	 economic	 recovery	 emerging,	 the	world	 looked	 set	 to	 navigate	 a	 year	with	 fewer	
uncertainties.	However,	within	a	matter	of	months,	the	world	shifted	from	one	of	its	most	significant	health	crises	to	a	global	energy	crisis,	sparked	by	
Russia’s	invasion	of	Ukraine.	Due	to	the	range	of	economic	sanctions	on	Russia,	global	supply	chains	that	were	on	the	precipice	of	recovering	from	the	
strains	of	the	pandemic	were	once	again	thrown	into	turmoil.	

This	severely	impacted	the	energy	markets	given	Russia’s	position	as	one	of	the	world’s	largest	exporters	of	fossil	fuels.	Prices	reached	multi-year	highs	
with	coal	and	gas	prices	increasing	by	83%	and	11%	year-on-year,	respectively.	Domestically,	Malaysia	was	not	spared	from	the	higher	prices	of	fuel,	
which	had	a	significant	impact	on	the	cost	of	generating	electricity.	Approximately	90%	of	Peninsular	Malaysia’s	electricity	is	generated	from	fossil	fuel	
sources,	which	is	predominantly	coal	and	gas,	with	fuel	costs	contributing	more	than	70%	to	generation	costs.	Despite	this,	we	continued	to	fulfil	our	
obligations	by	providing	reliable,	secure	and	affordable	supply	of	power	to	the	nation.

To	minimise	economic	disruptions,	governments	globally	have	chosen	to	prioritise	energy	security	by	ramping	up	generation	from	fossil-fuel	and	nuclear	
sources.	 Interestingly,	 the	 broader	 effect	 of	 elevated	 energy	 prices	 has	 led	 to	 accelerated	 investments	 into	 developing	 renewable	 and	 alternative	
sources	of	energy	to	reduce	the	dependence	on	imported	fuel	sources.	Likewise,	in	Malaysia,	the	Government	stepped	up	efforts	to	increase	the	use	of	
renewable	energy,	by	announcing	programmes	to	install	solar	panels	on	government	buildings,	the	development	of	solar	farms	and	other	initiatives	to	
support	the	nation's	energy	transition	journey.

Amid	 this	evolving	 landscape,	TNB	stepped	up	 to	not	only	 identify	 the	opportunities	within	our	value	chain	but	also	made	 further	headway	 into	 the	
green	and	renewable	energy	space.	While	the	higher	price	environment	has	certainly	impacted	TNB’s	costs	over	the	past	two	years,	we	recognise	that	
the	generation	mix	that	exists	in	Malaysia	today	was	the	generation	mix	that	exists	in	Malaysia	today	is	the	decision	that	the	nation	has	made	to	ensure	
security	of	supply	at	affordable	prices.	The	energy	crisis	has	thus	strengthened	our	resolve	to	accelerate	and	implement	a	pathway	to	a	cleaner	generation	
mix	by	2050.	

Dear Shareholders, 

The year 2022 was 
certainly a challenging 
one, but TNB was able 
to rise to the occasion 
and emerge stronger. 
We remained steadfast 
in growing our business 
sustainably while helping 
to steer Malaysia’s 
journey to a responsible 
energy transition.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 

Electricity	 demand	 in	 Peninsular	 Malaysia	 increased	

by	6.0%	year-on-year	on	the	back	of	higher	economic	

activity	as	industrial	and	commercial	activities	picked	

up	in	line	with	the	return	to	normalcy.	This	was	reflected	

in	Malaysia’s	Gross	Domestic	Product	growth	of	8.7%	

in	2022	compared	to	the	3.1%	recorded	in	2021.	

As	 a	 result	 of	 the	 stronger	 electricity	 demand,	 TNB	

recorded	total	revenue	of	RM50.9	billion	in	2022,	5.7%	

higher	year-on-year	from	the	RM48.1	billion	reported	

in	2021.	EBITDA	was	also	higher	by	10.9%	to	RM20.8	

billion	 compared	 to	 RM18.8	 billion	 in	 2021	 driven	 by	

higher	group	electricity	revenue	and	 lower	allowance	

for	 doubtful	 debts,	 contributed	 by	 improvement	 in	

collections.	Profit	after	tax	was	however	lower	by	8%	

to	 RM3.6	 billion	 compared	 to	 RM3.9	 billion	 in	 2021	

due	 to	 a	 deferred	 tax	movement	 of	 RM520.7	million

HIGHLIGHTS

OF THE YEAR

As a result 
of stronger 
electricity 

demand, TNB 
recorded total 

revenue of RM50.9 
billion in 2022

In	managing	the	higher	fuel	costs,	we	have	continued	

to work with the government in the implementation of 

the	Imbalance	Cost	Pass	Through	(ICPT)	mechanism.	

Under	this	mechanism,	the	government	has	provided	

direct	 payments	 to	 TNB	 to	 offset	 the	 higher	 fuel	

costs	 for	 generating	 electricity.	 This,	 in	 addition	 to	

the	prudent	management	of	our	working	capital,	has	

helped	 TNB	 to	 alleviate	 the	 pressure	 from	 high	 fuel	

prices.	

In	 terms	 of	 operational	 performance,	 I	 am	 pleased	

to	 report	 that	 we	 continue	 to	 maintain	 world-class	

standards	 of	 operational	 excellence.	 Our	 power	

plants	 recorded	 an	 availability	 factor	 of	 83.2%	

while	 our	 Transmission	 System	 Minutes,	 which	 is	 a	

benchmark	for	the	minutes	of	interruption	caused	by	

transmission,	was	0.2	minutes	 this	year.	The	System	

Average	 Interruption	 Duration	 Index	 (SAIDI)	 was

is	 a	 clear	 demonstration	 of	 the	 efforts	 put	 in	 by	 our	

workforce	 to	 operate	 and	 maintain	 our	 electricity	

supply	infrastructure	to	the	highest	of	standards.

PRESIDENT/CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW

In	terms	of	our	safety	performance,	our	Loss	Time	Injury	Frequency	(LTIF)	has	also	 improved	further	to	0.82	from	1.03	 in	FY2021.	While	we	recorded	 

zero	 fatalities	 among	 our	 workforce	 during	 the	 year,	 we	 regret	 to	 report	 that	 there	 were	 two	 (2)	 fatalities	 among	 our	 contractors.	 We	 are	 fully	 

committed	to	do	even	more	to	ensure	that	our	work	safety	culture	is	strengthened	while	consistently	implementing	safety	awareness	programmes	and	

compliance	to	safety	rules.

Our	operational	performance	also	influences	how	our	customers	perceive	us	and,	in	that	regard,	we	are	seeing	success	year	on	year.	In	2022,	we	retained	

our	 excellent	Customer	Satisfaction	 Index	 (CSI)	 at	 a	 score	 of	 87%.	 In	 addition,	 as	 a	 result	 of	 our	 consistent	 digitalisation	 and	outreach	 efforts,	 the	

myTNB	app	now	has	6.29	million	registered	customers,	a	14.3%	increase	from	the	year	before.	Mirroring	the	improvement	in	customer	satisfaction,	our	

Customer	Experience	Index	across	multiple	touchpoints	and	channels	are	overwhelmingly	positive,	recording	approval	ratings	of	above	90%	on	average.

CATALYSING THE ENERGY TRANSITION

At	the	core	of	it,	the	ET	plan	is	complementary	to	our	overarching	Reimagining	TNB	strategy,	as	it	marshals	our	resources	to	enable	us	to	expand	on	

and	develop	the	energy	transition	elements	present	within	the	four	pillars	of	the	strategy.	To	recap,	the	four	pillars	are,	Future	Generation	Sources,	

Gride	of	the	Future,	Winning	the	Customer	and	Future-Proof	Regulations.	TNB	has	achieved	significant	headway	in	the	year	under	review	across	all	

four	pillars	of	the	RT	strategy	while	advancing	the	energy	transition	agenda,	which	we	will	highlight	here.

In	considering	how	we	can	make	significant	contributions	towards	the	energy	transition	in	the	context	of	power	generation,	our	success	is	dependent	
on	how	quickly	we	can	decarbonise	electricity	generation.	 In	addition	to	adding	more	renewable	energy	capacity,	we	are	also	 focusing	on	the	early	
retirement	of	coal	plants,	the	repowering	of	plants	with	cleaner	fuel	and	green	technology	and	forging	strategic	technology	partnerships.	

In	the	context	of	retiring	coal	plants,	our	approach	is	to	repower	plants	retiring	before	2030	with	natural	gas	–	a	more	sustainable	alternative	to	coal	
and	where	possible,	with	an	added	hydrogen	co-firing	capability.	This	allows	for	a	gradual	yet	steady	transition	into	cleaner	energy,	while	reducing	the	
risks	associated	with	low	fuel	supply	and	the	energy	crisis.	In	addition,	the	early	retirement	of	our	coal	plants	takes	place	in	tandem	with	repowering	
efforts,	therefore	ensuring	that	revenues	are	not	impacted.	We	have	recently	received	a	Letter	of	Intent	(LOI)	from	the	Ministry	of	Natural	Resources,	
Environment	and	Climate	Change	for	the	development	of	a	2.1	GW	combined-cycle	power	plant	in	Kapar,	which	is	slated	for	a	commercial	operation	
date	by	2031.	Prior	to	that,	we	had	received	an	LOI	to	repower	the	retired	1,400	MW	Paka	gas	power	plant.	In	2021,	we	also	commissioned	the	1,440	MW	
Sultan	Ibrahim	Power	Plant	in	Pasir	Gudang,	Johor,	which	is	the	world's	first	commercial	power	plant	to	use	the	latest	and	most	technologically	efficient	
gas	turbines.

Future Generation Sources

Our Commitment to 2035

•	 Reduce	emission	intensity	by	35%

•	 Significant	renewable	generation	growth

•	 50%	reduction	in	coal	generation	capacity

Our Aspiration to 2050

• Achieve Net Zero GHG emission

•	 Invest	and	grow	our	emerging	green	technologies	including	

Hydrogen	and	Carbon	Capture	&	Utilisation	(CCU)

•	 Be	coal	free

OUR STRATEGIC PROGRESS

In	 2022,	 we	 have	 further	 fortified	 our	 Reimagining	 TNB	 (RT)	 strategy,	 setting	 us	 on	 a	 firmer	 trajectory	 to	 becoming	 a	 leading	 provider	 of	

sustainable	energy	solutions	in	Malaysia	and	internationally.	This	announcement	of	our	Energy	Transition	(ET)	Plan	in	2022	comes	at	a	time	when	

many	countries	and	utilities	begin	charting	their	own	pathways	towards	net	zero	commitments.	

As	a	commitment	to	our	ET	Plan,	while	driving	Malaysia's	own	energy	transition,	TNB	will	set	aside	significant	CAPEX	for	initiatives	to	fast-track	

TNB's	transition	to	net	zero	emissions	by	2050.	Ultimately,	we	have	an	eye	on	the	longer-term	future	of	TNB	and	these	investments	will	gradually	

shift	our	existing	portfolios	to	greener	ones,	for	a	more	sustainable	business	growth	of	TNB	while	creating	long-term	value	for	shareholders.

With	 regards	 to	 renewable	 energy,	 we	 have	made	 significant	 strides	 in	 advancing	 hydropower	 projects	 this	 year.	 Hydropower	 is	 a	 key	 renewable	 
energy	 in	Malaysia	especially	given	 its	 relative	abundance	and	developing	 it	provides	benefits	such	as	being	able	 to	 regulate	and	 reduce	the	 risk	of	
flooding	in	a	flood-prone	country	like	ours.	In	2022,	we	received	approval	from	the	Energy	Commission	for	our	Hydro	Life	Extension	Programme,	which	
covers	six	(6)	power	stations	in	the	Sungai	Perak	Hydro	Scheme	with	a	total	capacity	of	650.75	MW.	The	project	has	commenced	in	2022	with	a	total	
investment	of	RM5.8	billion	and	will	be	operated	under	a	new	power	purchase	agreement	for	40	years.	The	first	unit	is	expected	to	begin	commercial	
operations	in	2025.	Elsewhere	in	Malaysia,	we	have	commenced	the	construction	of	the	300	MW	Nenggiri	Hydroelectric	Power	Plant	which	is	scheduled	
for	commercial	operations	in	2027.	Installation	works	are	also	underway	on	the	Large	Scale	Solar	4	project	at	TNB	Bukit	Selambau	2,	which	will	add	50	
MW	of	RE	capacity.

Internationally,	 our	 United	 Kingdom	 (UK)	 -	 based	 subsidiary,	 Vantage	 RE,	 continues	 to	 expand	 its	 RE	 portfolio.	 Following	 our	 first	 foray	 into	 the	 
offshore	wind	market	last	year,	in	2022	we	completed	the	acquisition	of	a	100%	stake	in	a	97.3	MW	onshore	wind	portfolio	located	in	the	UK.	We	have	
also	ventured	 into	our	first	UK-	based	solar	greenfield	development	 for	 the	construction	and	commissioning	of	a	102	MW	solar	 farm.	The	contract	
was	signed	with	BELECTRIC	GmbH	and	also	includes	an	option	to	develop	a	65	MW	co-located	battery	energy	storage	system	(BESS).	We	believe	the	
benefits	 from	our	 international	business	goes	beyond	financial	gains	as	we	are	also	obtaining	new	 technologies	and	knowledge	 that	our	 seconded	
employees	will	bring	home	which	can	assist	with	the	energy	transition.	

Looking	ahead,	we	have	developed	a	strong	pipeline	of	approximately	4.4	GW	of	RE	capacity	globally	that	we	are	at	different	stages	of	exploring.	We	
will	continue	to	grow	our	RE	portfolio	with	quality	assets	both	here	in	Malaysia	and	in	the	UK	and	pursue	opportunities	in	the	strategic	regions	identified	
such	as	Europe,	Southeast	Asia,	and	the	broader	Asia	Pacific	region.	

PRESIDENT/CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW

In	the	year	under	review,	we	have	made	significant	progress	in	future-proofing	our	grid	network	and	strengthening	connections	with	our	ASEAN	peers.	
TNB	 advocates	 stronger	 interconnections	 to	 accelerate	 the	 energy	 transition	 as	 it	 provides	 greater	 energy	 security	 and	will	 enable	 the	 region	 to	
decarbonise	faster.	We	believe	more	can	be	done	in	this	area	to	realise	the	ASEAN	Power	Grid	(APG)	and	we	encourage	member	countries	of	ASEAN	to	
join	hands	to	fully	integrate	Southeast	Asia’s	power	grid	system.

One	of	the	key	milestones	in	our	interconnection	journey	this	year	was	the	successful	upgrade	of	the	electricity	interconnector	between	Malaysia	and	
Singapore.	First	established	in	1983,	the	interconnector	has	enabled	mutual	energy	transfer	between	Singapore	and	Malaysia	during	times	of	power	
outages.	Some	40	years	later,	the	upgraded	interconnector	can	now	accommodate	bidirectional	electricity	flows	of	around	1,000	megawatts	between	
both	countries,	double	its	earlier	capacity.

The	interconnector	 is	an	 important	part	of	the	Lao	PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore	Power	Integration	Project	(LTMS-PIP),	which	aims	to	facilitate	
cross-border	power	 trade	 and	 serves	 as	 a	 stepping	 stone	 towards	 the	broader	goal	 of	 the	APG.	Through	 the	LTMS-PIP,	 an	 agreement	was	 signed	
between	Singapore	and	Lao	PDR	to	import	100	MW	of	hydropower	from	Lao	PDR	to	Singapore	via	Thailand	and	Malaysia.	This	also	marks	the	first	time	
that	four	ASEAN	countries	have	engaged	in	multilateral	cross-border	electricity	trade.	Looking	ahead,	we	plan	to	explore	interconnection	collaborations	
with	countries	like	Thailand	and	Indonesia.

In	 the	 context	 of	 future-proofing	 our	 grid,	 an	 ongoing	 and	 crucial	 initiative	 is	 the	 installation	 of	 smart	 meters	 at	 customer	 premises	 as	 well	 as	
Distribution	 Automation	 (DA)	 systems	 in	 our	 grid.	 In	 2022,	 we	 installed	 more	 than	 800,000	 smart	 meters	 bringing	 the	 total	 number	 to	 over	 
2.6	million	meters,	 surpassing	our	 target	of	 2.4	million	meters.	These	 smart	meters	enable	 the	 full	 automation	of	 the	billing	process	 and	provides	
granular	information	that	empowers	customers	to	take	control	of	their	electricity	usage.	For	DA	systems,	in	2022	we	installed	and	commissioned	the	
systems	in	3,541	substations.	DA	systems	help	reduce	the	amount	of	time	and	manpower	needed	to	restore	the	distribution	network	in	the	event	of	
an	unplanned	outage.

As	a	result	of	our	efforts	this	year,	we	saw	our	Smart	Grid	Index	(SGI)	score	improving	to	71.4%	from	the	67.9%	achieved	in	2021.	Our	target	is	to	raise	
our	SGI	to	85%	by	2025	and	this	will	largely	be	influenced	by	our	progress	in	adding	more	smart	meters	and	DA	systems	to	our	grid.

Moving	forward,	we	have	allocated	a	total	amount	of	RM21	billion	between	2022	and	2024	to	be	invested	in	our	Grid	of	the	Future	programme	to	enhance	
Malaysia’s	 transmission	and	distribution	network	 readiness	and	 reliability.	We	are	also	on	 track	 in	 implementing	our	pilot	Pulau	Tenaga	Hijau	 (PTH)	
programme	in	Pulau	Redang	and	Pulau	Perhentian	that	will	showcase	how	the	combination	of	green	energy	sources	such	as	low-speed	wind	turbines,	
rooftop	solar	and	batteries	together	with	other	decarbonisation	efforts	can	bring	a	community	closer	to	net-zero.

Grid of the Future



WE	ARE	TNB FROM OUR LEADERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY	STATEMENT

36 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

PRESIDENT/CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW

At	 TNB,	 we	 fully	 recognise	 that	 the	 Energy	 Transition	 will	
require	close	collaboration	between	all	stakeholders	 involved	
in	the	value	chain.	This	is	why	we	strongly	believe	that	bringing	
our customers along on this journey is crucial to the overall 
viability	of	the	energy	transition.	As	the	sole	electricity	retailer	
and	 supplier	 to	 over	 10.6	 million	 customers	 throughout	
Peninsular	Malaysia	and	Sabah,	we	are	well-positioned	to	take	
on	the	role	to	electrify	the	transportation	sector	and	drive	the	
expansion	of	rooftop	solar	capacity	nationwide.

The	 decarbonisation	 of	 the	 transportation	 sector	 is	 integral	
to	 the	 success	 of	 the	 overall	 energy	 transition	 journey	 and	
we	 are	 keen	 to	 lead	 the	 acceleration	 of	 electric	 mobility	
adoption	in	Malaysia,	in	addition	to	our	focus	on	decarbonising	
the	 electricity	 sector.	 There	 is	 a	 potential	 market	 value	 of	 
RM1.3	 billion	 market	 in	 this	 space	 by	 2030	 and	 we	 will	 be	
investing	RM90	million	over	the	span	of	three	(3)	years	in	five	(5)	
focus	areas	to	accelerate	and	support	EV	adoption.	The	five	(5)	
focus	areas	include	building	charging	infrastructure,	reskilling	
and	 upskilling	 the	 workforce,	 TNB	 Fleet	 electrification,	
sponsoring	EV-related	studies	and	fostering	a	coalition	among	
EV	 sector	 players.	 This	 year,	 we	 have	 also	 signed	 eight	 (8)	
memoranda	of	understanding	(MoUs)	with	prominent	partners	
in	the	e-Mobility	space	to	stimulate	the	growth	of	the	Battery	
Electric	Vehicle	(BEV)	ecosystem.

Malaysia	has	seen	 impressive	growth	 in	EV	adoption	 in	2022,	
with	around	2,093	Battery	Electric	Vehicles	(BEVs)	on	the	road,	
an	 eight-fold	 increase	 from	2021,	 indicating	 strong	 demand.	
On	the	infrastructure	side,	the	number	of	public	Direct	Current	
(DC)	 fast	 EV	 chargers	 has	 also	 proliferated	 rapidly	 from	 two	
charging	points	 last	year	to	105	points	 in	2022.	This	 is	where	
TNB	 wants	 to	 be	 closely	 involved	 in	 the	 development	 of	 EV	
infrastructure	 and	 the	 EV	 ecosystem	 as	we	 aim	 to	 eliminate	
the	main	issue	of	range	anxiety	felt	by	BEV	owners.

Winning the Customer

We	have	since	put	our	EV	infrastructure	plan	in	motion	in	2022,	starting	with	the	introduction	of	the	Electron	brand	name	that	will	represent	TNB	in	
the	EV	space.	We	also	signed	an	agreement	with	Gamuda	Berhad	to	build	TNB	Electron	charging	stations	on	their	properties.

This	year,	we	have	identified	11	locations	in	the	country	to	deploy	22	Electron	EV	fast-charging	points,	with	10	of	these	chargers	being	located	along	
the	north-south	and	east	coast	highway	as	indicated	in	the	map.	Three	(3)	of	these	chargers	have	already	been	commissioned	in	early	2023.	

In	the	solar	PV	space,	we	are	encouraging	the	take	up	of	solar	PV	installations	throughout	our	customer	base	via	our	wholly	owned	subsidiary,	GSPARX,	
to	drive	the	energy	transition	and	assist	our	customers	in	their	own	decarbonisation	journey.	In	2022,	we	secured	240	MWp	of	rooftop	solar	PV	capacity	
for	customers	that	include	Universiti	Putra	Malaysia,	S	P	Setia,	SMART	Modular	and	FELDA.	Looking	ahead,	GSPARX	is	expected	to	have	385	MWp	of	
solar	PV	capacity	by	the	end	of	2023.

For	customers	who	are	unable	to	 install	 rooftop	solar	panels,	we	offer	the	Green	Electricity	Tariff	 (GET),	which	 is	available	on	a	subscription	basis,	
enabling	 subscribers	 to	use	electricity	generated	 from	 renewable	energy	 sources	 to	 reduce	 their	 carbon	 footprint.	 In	2022,	 there	were	a	 total	of	 
1,994	users	who	subscribed	to	the	4,000	GWh	that	was	on	offer.	This	quota	has	been	increased	to	6,600	GWh	in	2023.

PRESIDENT/CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW

Future-Proof Regulations

TNB	 plays	 a	 key	 role	 as	 the	 largest	 utility	 in	 Peninsular	 Malaysia	 in	

contributing	to	ideas	and	conversations	that	help	to	formulate	regulations	

and	policy	to	future-proof	the	electricity	supply	industry.	TNB	continues	

to	work	closely	with	 the	government	 in	 the	development	of	policy	 that	

helps	 to	 address	 the	 energy	 trilemma	 while	 ensuring	 a	 sustainable	

transition	towards	responsible	energy.	This	is	where	we	have	contributed	

to	the	establishment	of	the	National	Energy	Policy	that	was	announced	

in	September	2022	which	will	have	12	strategies	and	31	action	plans	to	

realise	Malaysia’s	Low-Carbon	Aspiration	2040.

At	 the	 industry	 level,	 TNB	 firmly	 supports	 the	 Malaysian	 Electricity	

Supply	Industry’s	(MESI)	strategy	to	evolve	in	response	to	the	emergence	

of	 disruptive	 technologies,	 particularly	 those	 using	 renewable	 energy	

sources	such	as	solar.	TNB	has	been	facilitating,	supporting,	and	engaging	

the	stakeholders	 in	the	development	of	the	future-proofing	MESI	study	

led	 by	MyPower.	 The	 study	 includes	 a	 roadmap	 and	 way	 forward	 plans	

that	 cover	 the	 landscape	 of	 the	 electricity	 industry	 and	 the	 readiness	

to	facilitate	the	developing	trend	of	new	technologies,	while	also	taking	

into	 account	 the	 future	 challenges	 concerning	 disruptive	 technologies	

(Decarbonisation,	Decentralisation	&	Digitisation).

TNB	 will	 continuously	 support	 the	 initiatives	 under	 the	 roadmap	 for	

Peninsular	 Malaysia.	 We	 are	 committed	 to	 serving	 the	 people	 and	 will	

continue	 to	 collaborate	 with	 the	 government	 to	 embark	 on	 the	 MESI	

roadmap.

OUTLOOK

As	we	look	ahead	to	2023,	the	world	is	preparing	itself	for	slower	economic	

growth	as	tighter	monetary	policy	implemented	throughout	2022	to	curb	

inflation	will	be	felt	more	heavily	and	is	likely	to	reduce	consumer	demand	

and	spending.	The	Russian-Ukraine	conflict,	which	is	a	year	old	now,	also	

has	 no	 end	 in	 sight	 and	 will	 continue	 to	 broadly	 impact	 energy	 prices.	

The	 International	 Monetary	 Fund	 predicts	 global	 economic	 growth	 to	

moderate	further	to	2.9%	from	the	3.4%	recorded	in	2022.	In	Malaysia,	the	

forecast	is	for	the	economy	to	grow	by	4.5%	in	2023.

With	this	in	mind,	we	expect	the	government	to	continue	to	prioritise	the	

rakyat’s	 well-being	with	 a	 particular	 focus	 on	 the	 cost	 of	 living.	We	will	

continue	 to	 support	 government	 efforts,	 especially	 in	 the	 provision	 of	

targeted	subsidies,	 to	keep	 the	economy	going	and	 to	help	 lighten	cost	

pressures	on	Malaysians.

On	the	business	front,	I	am	particularly	excited	about	the	future	of	EV.	With	

supportive	blueprints	and	policies	in	place,	we	are	committed	to	nurturing	

this	 nascent	 industry	 to	greater	 levels	of	maturity.	As	 the	 largest	utility	

in	Peninsular	Malaysia,	we	 recognise	our	crucial	 role	as	a	catalyst	 for	EV	

adoption,	especially	through	the	provision	of	EV	charging	infrastructure.	

From	 a	 broader	 perspective,	 the	 government	 has	 already	 set	 out	 a	

multitude	 of	 incentives	 to	 catalyse	 high-potential	 and	 high-growth	

areas	 such	 as	 energy	 storage,	 renewable	 energy,	 EVs	 and	 hydrogen	 to	

accelerate	the	nation’s	transition	towards	carbon-neutral	status	by	2050.	

Considering	these	opportunities,	I	believe	that	it	is	incumbent	upon	us	and	

other	corporations	to	step	up	to	meet	this	challenge.	On	this	note,	I	would	

like	to	put	out	a	formal	call	to	all	private	and	public	players	to	participate	

and	contribute	towards	the	nation’s	energy	transition	journey.	

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I	wish	to	thank	the	Board	of	Directors	for	their	wisdom	and	counsel	that	

has	guided	us	throughout	this	year.	I	also	want	to	recognise	the	efforts	of	

my	Management	Team	in	striving	to	achieve	our	Reimagining	TNB	goal	and	

making	significant	progress	in	this	regard.	Of	course,	none	of	this	would	be	

possible	without	the	strong	support	of	our	employees	who	have	delivered	

time	and	again,	even	through	the	most	challenging	of	times.

I	 also	 bid	 farewell	 to	 our	 previous	Chairman	Dato'	 Sri	Hasan	Arifin,	who	

stepped	down	on	1	January	2023.	Thank	you,	Dato’	Sri	for	your	contribution	

to	the	organisation,	we	have	certainly	been	enriched	by	your	expertise	and	

guidance.

On	behalf	of	TNB,	 I	warmly	welcome	Dato’	Abdul	Razak	bin	Abdul	Majid,	

the	newly	appointed	Chairman,	who	brings	with	him	extensive	experience	

in	electricity	generation,	 regulation	and	government	and	 I	 am	confident	

that	he	will	be	able	 to	bring	great	value	 to	 the	strategic	direction	of	 the	

Company.	I	look	forward	to	working	with	him	and	receiving	his	guidance	to	

elevate	TNB's	value	creation	journey.

While	 we	 look	 back	 at	 a	 stable	 year	 with	 gratitude,	 we	 also	 anticipate	

exciting	times	ahead.	It	is	only	through	the	dynamic	collaborations	that	we	

form	with	our	stakeholders,	 that	we	can	continue	 to	achieve	and	create	

long-term	value.	It	is	also	worth	noting	that	TNB	is	progressing	well	in	our	

strategy	to	accomplish	a	greener	and	more	sustainable	business	for	future	

generations.	We	are	confident	that	with	the	support	of	our	stakeholders,	

we	can	work	together	to	build	a	brighter	and	better	future.

Thank	you.

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

OVERVIEW 

Diversifying our generation sources into more sustainable options 

remains	 a	 key	 part	 of	 our	 Future	 Generation	 Sources	 pillar	 under	 our	

Reimagining	TNB	 strategy	 and	 is	 critical	 to	 our	 plans	 towards	Net	Zero	

by	2050.	We	see	a	 lot	of	potential	 for	TNB	to	grow	its	renewable	energy	

generation	internationally	and	will	continue	to	do	so,	especially	in	the	UK,	

where	we	have	already	established	Vantage	RE	Ltd.

At	 the	 same	 time,	 we	 intend	 to	 gradually	 decarbonise	 our	 domestic	

generation	 portfolio	 in	 Malaysia.	 We	 fully	 support	 our	 government's	

aspiration	 to	 gradually	 adopt	more	 renewable	 energy,	 while	 looking	 for	

ways	to	reduce	the	carbon	footprint	of	thermal	generation	through	new	

technologies	such	as	hydrogen,	ammonia	and	carbon	capture,	utilisation	

and	storage	(CCUS).

Ensuring	 the	operational	excellence	of	our	generating	fleet	 remains	 the	

key	driver	in	maximising	the	long-term	profitability	of	TNB.	This	will	require	

our	power	plants	to	perform	within	the	Power	Purchase	Agreements	(PPA)	

stipulations throughout their operational tenure in an environmentally 

sustainable	manner.	

The	 standards	 that	 we	 need	 to	 uphold	 include	 delivering	 high	 plant	

reliability	 and	 availability,	 optimising	 plant	 efficiency,	 optimising	

Operation	&	Maintenance	(O&M)	costs	and	ensuring	excellent	operational,	

safety,	 environmental	 and	 regulatory	 compliance	 while	 minimising	 any	

environmental	impacts.

In 2022, TNB produced a total of 105,273.8 

GWh of electricity, of which 88,343.2 GWh 

was generated from coal and gas sources and 

9,167.8 GWh from renewable energy sources. 

Total renewable energy (RE) made up 8.7% 

of the total electricity sent out in 2022. This 

was an increase from the 7.94% in 2021 and 

demonstrates our commitment to RE making 

up 40% of our total capacity mix by 2025.

FUTURE 
GENERATION 
SOURCES

With	the	aim	of	achieving	a	66%	RE	capacity	mix	by	2035,	TNB's	ambitious	target	showcases	its	unwavering	commitment	to	sustainability	and	leadership	 in	the	worldwide	shift	
towards clean energy sources.

DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS 

Key messages :

Viewed as non-core assets for TNB and TNB is currently 
pursuing an exit strategy for GEL and a value protection 

strategy for GEAS. Nevertheless, both GEL and GEAS have been 
performing above budget on a YoY basis at the EBITDA level.

TNB is keen on both developed and developing markets, which 
carry different risk-return tradeoffs. We are also moving 

upstream into greenfield development to maximise returns  
to shareholders.

Expanding Our Presence in the United Kingdom (UK)

Through	Vantage	RE	Ltd.,	TNB	 is	making	significant	 inroads	 into	the	UK’s	renewable	energy	market	which	continues	to	grow	 in	capacity.	

Vantage’s	 focus	 is	 in	 solar,	 onshore	wind,	 offshore	wind	 and	battery	 storage	where	 it	 now	has	 total	 gross	 capacity	of	 632	MW,	which	 is	

predominantly	solar.	Vantage	aims	to	rapidly	grow	its	portfolio	and	pipeline	of	RE	assets	in	the	UK	and	Europe,	which	will	help	support	TNB’s	

commitment	to	sustainable	energy.

Pursuing exit strategies to enable TNB to refocus its resources 
and capital into Renewable Energy (RE) in key markets, in line 

with TNB’s approved ‘Reimagining TNB Strategy’. 

Continuing to explore new markets for renewable energy 
opportunities.

WE	ARE	TNB FROM OUR LEADERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY	STATEMENT

40 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

THE UK'S ECONOMIC, ENERGY TRANSITION AND ELECTRICITY MARKET LANDSCAPE

The	United	Kingdom’s	economy	grew	by	4.0%	 in	2022,	moderating	 from	the	7.6%	achieved	 in	2021	as	 inflationary	pressures	 took	 the	

wind	out	of	consumer	demand.	Prospects	going	forward	into	2023	appear	to	be	challenging	as	well,	with	inflation	expected	to	average	at	

7.1%	throughout	the	year	and	the	expectation	of	a	recession.	The	Bank	of	England	is	expected	to	increase	interest	rates	further,	albeit	at	

a	slower	pace	than	what	occurred	in	2022.	However,	no	adverse	impact	is	anticipated	as	Vantage’s	subsidy	revenue	is	inflation-linked	and	

likely	to	offset	any	increase	in	cost	of	operations.

The	UK	government	introduced	the	Electricity	Generator	Levy	(EGL)	from	1	January	2023	to	31	March	2028.	There	will	be	a	new	45%	tax	

on	receipts	made	by	low-carbon	generators	above	a	benchmark	power	price	of	£75/MWh	(referred	to	as	Exceptional	Generation	Receipts),	

with	an	allowance	of	GBP10	mil	per	annum.	The	benchmark	price	will	be	indexed	against	the	CPI	from	2025	onwards	and	revenue	relating	

to	 sale	of	Renewables	Obligation	Certificates	 (ROCs),	REGOs	and	Feed-in-Tariff	payments	will	 be	excluded.	Vantage’s	 asset	wholesale	 

market	revenues	will	be	slightly	impacted	as	Vantage	has	managed	to	secure	above-average	prices	for	the	short-term	period.

In	terms	of	the	UK’s	energy	transition	journey,	in	2022,	about	31%	of	the	UK’s	electricity	was	generated	from	wind	(26.8%)	and	solar	(4.4%)	

and	there	are	plans	to	significantly	increase	both	wind	and	solar	capacity	over	the	next	few	years.	These	would	be	positive	developments	

for	Vantage	as	they	align	with	our	core	business	and	growth	ambitions.	From	a	policy	perspective,	the	UK	government	launched	the	Review	

of	Electricity	Market	Arrangements	(REMA)	in	2022	with	the	aim	of	enhancing	energy	security	and	reducing	electricity	costs	for	consumers.	 

A	potential	 outcome	of	 this	 review	 is	 a	 structural	 change	on	 how	electricity	 is	 priced,	which	would	 peg	 it	 to	more	 stable	 and	 cheaper	 

electricity	generated	from	renewables,	given	the	volatility	of	energy	prices	such	as	gas.	

The	UK	remains	the	key	focus	market	to	TNB	while	pursuing	our	expansion	in	the	European	RE	market.

Business Expansion

•	 Acquired	a	97.3	MW	operating	onshore	wind	portfolio	in	the	UK	on	1	April	2022.	

•	 Completed	first	greenfield	acquisition	–	a	101.7	MW	Ready-to-Build	(RTB)	solar	portfolio	with	an	option	to	develop	a	65	MW	Battery	Energy	

Storage	System	(BESS)	on	27	September	2022.	The	solar	portfolio	is	expected	to	commence	commercial	operations	by	Q1	2024.

•	 Increased	investment	pipeline	by	leveraging	our	wide	business	network	in	the	UK	and	new	markets	in	Spain,	Ireland	and	France.

Strategic Financial and Capital Management

•	 Completed	 a	 GBP275	 million	 financing	 exercise	 of	 our	 solar	 portfolio	 assets	 on	 23	 February	 2022,	 capitalising	 on	 the	 low	 interest	 rate	

environment.

•	 Completed	 a	 GBP72	 million	 refinance	 package	 with	 two	 major	 lenders	 in	 the	 UK	 for	 TNB’s	 offshore	 wind	 investment	 in	 Blyth	 Offshore	

Demonstrator	Limited	(BODL)	on	16	December	2022.

•	 Vantage	Solar	and	CEI	UK	have	locked	in	record	high	Renewable	Energy	Guarantees	of	Origin	(REGO)	prices	with	expected	upside	over	the	next	

five	years.

•	 Locked	in	higher	PPA	prices	on	a	year-on-year	basis	from	active	asset	management	for	the	existing	portfolio	as	a	result	of	the	high	wholesale

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

OUTLOOK

Going	 forward,	we	will	 prioritise	operational	 excellence	 in	meeting	all	 obligations	
stipulated	under	the	PPA	by	maintaining	high	availability,	reliability	and	efficiency	of	
our	key	generating	assets.	Being	the	largest	power	producer	in	Malaysia	by	installed	
capacity,	we	are	fully	cognisant	of	our	responsibility	to	lead	the	power	generation	
sector	 towards	mitigating	 climate	 change	 and	 contributing	 to	 the	 transition	 to	 a	
low-carbon	future,	in	line	with	TNB’s	Energy	Transition	and	Sustainability	Pathway	
(SP2050).

EExploring New Innovation

In	 exploring	 new	 ways	 to	 add	 clean	 energy	 to	 the	 grid,	 TNB,	 through	 its	
Research	arm	TNB	Research	Sdn.	Bhd.	(TNBR),	will	be	partnering	with	SEDANIA	
Technologies	(SEDANIA)	to	explore	the	potential	of	generating	electricity	from	
excess	water	in	dams	and	reservoirs	throughout	Malaysia.	

SEDANIA	 will	 utilise	 TNBR's	 energy-efficient	 micro-hydropower	 turbines	
to	 produce	 electricity	 from	 released	 water	 at	 dams.	 The	 first	 project	 will	
be	 undertaken	 at	 a	 dam	 project	 in	 Kota	 Tinggi,	 Johor	 and	 SEDANIA	 will	 be

EARLY RETIREMENT OF COAL PLANTS & REPOWERING WITH 
CLEANER FUEL SOURCES

TNB	 has	 taken	 significant	 measures	 to	 realise	 our	 end	 goal	 of	 net	
zero	 ambition	 by	 2050	 by	 exploring	 the	 viability	 of	 retiring	 selected	
coal	 plants	 ahead	 of	 its	 Power	 Purchase	 Agreement	 (PPA)	 expiration	
and	 repowering	 these	 retired	 plants	 with	 new,	 cleaner	 and	 greener	
technology.	While	 the	early	 retirement	 is	 still	 subject	 to	 shareholders'	
agreement	and	approvals	from	the	relevant	authorities	and	regulators,	
the	 aggressive	 strategy	 demonstrates	 the	 force	 and	 clarity	 of	 the	
Company's	decarbonisation	vision.

As	 part	 of	 our	 Energy	 Transition	 agenda,	 the	 Company	 has	 laid	 out	 a	
structured	 repowering	 strategy.	 For	 plants	 retiring	 before	 2030,	 the	
Company	 has	 planned	 to	 repower	 them	 using	 natural	 gas	 –	 a	 more	
sustainable	 alternative	 to	 coal	 –	 with	 an	 added	 hydrogen	 co-firing	
capability.	 This	 allows	 for	 a	 gradual	 yet	 steady	 transition	 to	 cleaner	
energy,	while	reducing	the	risks	associated	with	low	fuel	supply	and	the	
energy	 crisis.	We	have	 recently	 received	 a	 Letter	 of	 Intent	 (LOI)	 from	
the	 Ministry	 of	 Natural	 Resources,	 Environment	 and	 Climate	 Change	
for	the	development	of	a	2.1	GW	combined-cycle	power	plant	in	Kapar,	
which	 is	slated	for	a	commercial	operation	date	by	2031.	Prior	to	that,	
we	received	an	LOI	to	repower	the	retired	1,400	MW	Paka	gas-powered	
plant	with	the	intent	to	make	it	hydrogen-ready	by	2030.

Beyond	 this,	 we	 are	 exploring	 other	 solutions	 and	 technologies	 to	
enable	 low-carbon	 fuel	 sources	 to	 be	 deployed	 at	 coal-fired	 power	
plants	 to	help	us	decarbonise	 further.	A	key	step	we	have	 taken	 in	 this	
context	is	a	joint	collaboration	with	PETRONAS	Gas	and	IHI	Corporation	
for	 a	 feasibility	 study	 on	 ammonia	 co-combustion	 in	 coal-fired	 power	
generation	 systems.	 The	 feasibility	 study	 was	 successfully	 completed	
and	 in	addition,	 the	outcome	derived	 from	the	pilot-scaled	combustion	
testing	programme	at	TNBR	proved	the	feasibility	of	co-firing	ammonia	
within	 certain	 calorific	 ratios.	 Further	 research	 will	 be	 carried	 out	 to	
mitigate	pollutant	reductions.	

PROGRESS OF NENGGIRI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT

Hydropower	remains	a	mainstay	in	TNB’s	RE	journey	and	we	will	continue	
to	 prioritise	 this	 source	 of	 energy	 given	 the	 relative	 abundance	 of	
hydropower	resources	in	Malaysia.	In	2022,	we	began	constructing	the	
300	MW	Nenggiri	hydropower	plant	 in	Kelantan	and	we	have	achieved	
good	 progress	 thus	 far	 by	 reaching	 a	 22.9%	 completion	 rate	 as	 at	 
end-2022.	 The	 plant	 is	 expected	 to	 commence	 operations	 by	 the	 
middle	 of	 2027.	 To	 support	 the	 funding	 required	 for	 this	 project,	 
TNB	Power	Generation	Sdn.	Bhd.	or	TNB	Genco	tapped	into	the	Sukuk	
market	and	issued	a	RM1.5	billion	sustainability	Sukuk	in	June	2022.	The	
TNB	GenCo	Sustainability	Sukuk	Framework	also	earned	a	'Gold'	rating	
from	MARC	Ratings	Berhad.

Project	 Nenggiri	 is	 expected	 to	 make	 an	 impactful	 contribution	 to	
Malaysia’s aim of increasing the renewable energy share of the country’s 
power	 capacity	 mix	 to	 40%	 by	 2035.	 Generating	 power	 from	 this	
hydropower	plant	will	also	help	avoid	some	0.3	million	tons	of	emissions	
per	year,	equivalent	to	approximately	the	emissions	of	70,000	cars	per	
year.	Besides	electricity	generation,	the	project	 is	expected	to	benefit	
Kelantan	 in	 the	 area	 of	 flood	 mitigation,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 provision	 of	
cleaner	water	supply	and	raw	water	supply	for	 irrigation.	The	Nenggiri	
Dam	 will	 help	 reduce	 the	 severity	 of	 floods	 that	 affect	 Kelantan	 by	
doubling	 up	 as	 a	 water	 catchment	 and	 control	 system	 where	 water	
levels	in	the	main	reservoir	area	will	be	lowered	to	hold	rainwater	during	
the	monsoon	season.

While	 we	 recognise	 that	 the	 construction	 of	 the	 dam	 has	 impacted	
local	Orang	Asli	 communities,	we	have	successfully	engaged	with	 the	
impacted	 communities	 and	 will	 relocate	 them	 to	 new	 settlements,	
in	 addition	 to	 providing	 more	 secure	 sources	 of	 income	 for	 them.	
We	 believe	 that	 the	 building	 and	 completion	 of	 the	 plant	 will	 have	
a	 significantly	 positive	 impact	 on	 the	 wider	 economy	 through	 job	
opportunities,	 the	 creation	 of	 new	 industries	 and	 the	 reduction	 of	
flooding	during	the	monsoon	season.

responsible	 for	 the	financial	and	 technical	aspects	of	 the	project,	while	TNBR	
will	provide	technical	expertise	through	turbine	design	and	installation.	

The	micro-hydropower	turbines	have	the	potential	to	generate	up	to	305,000	
kilowatt-hours	of	electricity	per	year.	If	this	technology	is	deployed	to	the	over	 
70	 dams	 and	 reservoirs	 in	 Malaysia,	 it	 could	 potentially	 generate	 over	 
40	 gigawatt-hours	 per	 year,	 which	 can	 provide	 carbon-free	 electricity	 to	
approximately	10	thousand	homes.

In	the	international	markets,	we	are	focusing	on	building	up	our	pipeline	to	provide	
certainty	 in	 growth	 and	 enhancing	 our	 capability	 building	 in	 the	 greenfield	 and	
Corporate	Power	Purchase	Agreements	(CPPAs).

The	growth	opportunities	pursued	will	 see	balanced	capital	deployment	between	
operational	 and	greenfield	 asset	development	 to	 ensure	 investment	 returns	 and	
EBIT	growth	are	sustained.

We	 will	 continue	 to	 build	 on	 our	 existing	 presence	 in	 the	 UK	 and	 Malaysia	 and	 
pursue	opportunities	in	the	strategic	regions	identified	such	as	Europe,	Southeast	
Asia	and	the	broader	Asia	Pacific	region.

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

Grid	 forms	 the	 critical	 backbone	 and	 infrastructure	 required	 to	 the	
development	 of	 energy	 supply	 in	 the	 country,	 facilitating	 economic	
growth	and	rapid	development.	We	are	continuously	investing	in	our	Grid	
network	to	ensure	customers	have	reliable	access	to	energy	via	a	modern	
and	efficient	grid.	

OVERVIEW 

TNB	 is	 the	 primary	 owner	 of	 the	 national	 grid	 of	 Peninsular	 Malaysia	
and	Sabah	and	we	aspire	 to	be	 the	 leading	grid	entity	 that	 leverages	on	
innovation,	technology	and	expertise	to	grow	new	businesses.	

Our	 grid	 assets	 for	 Peninsular	 Malaysia	 are	 handled	 by	 our	 two	 core	 
divisions,	 Grid	 and	 Distribution	 (DN)	 and	 connects	 (Retail)	 million	
customers,	 including	 homes	 and	 businesses.	 Our	 high	 voltage	
transmission	 network	 is	 connected	 to	 Thailand’s	 EGAT	 grid	 system	 in	
the	north	via	HVDC	system	and	to	Singapore’s	grid	system	in	the	south	
through	an	AC	network.	

The	 state	 of	 Sabah	 and	 the	 Federal	 Territory	 of	 Labuan’s	 energy	
infrastructure	fall	under	the	portfolio	of	our	subsidiary,	Sabah	Electricity	
Sdn.	Bhd.	(SESB)	and	connects	(SESB)	million	customers,	including	homes	
and	businesses.

In	2022,	we	achieved	positive	operational	 results	 in	 terms	of	safety	and	
technical	 performance.	 The	 divisions	 improved	 the	 safety	 action	 plans	
by	working	 towards	 reducing	 and	mitigating	 risks	 that	 could	 contribute	
to	 fatal	 accidents.	We	 also	 encountered	 several	 events	 that	 challenged	
our	technical	operations,	which	we	managed	to	overcome	with	our	detail	
action	plans	to	restore	order	ahead	of	time	and	prepare	robust	mitigation	
to	avoid	recurrences.

As	a	step	towards	enhancing	the	reliability	and	security	of	supply	to	Penang	Island,	the	construction	of	275kV	lines	linking	PMU	New	Prai	to	PMU	The	Light	will	become	an	iconic	
landmark	in	the	country.	This	project	will	boost	industrial	growth	and	tourism	of	Penang	Island.

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

DDistribution Network Division (DN) – Distribution Network 

Our	DN	division	 is	 focused	on	 realising	our	 efforts	 to	modernise	our	distribution	network	 through	 the	RP2	extension’s	projects.	 Last	 year,	we	

implemented	our	Advanced	Metering	Infrastructure	(AMI),	which	surpassed	the	RP2	target	of	installing	2.4	million	meters	after	installing	2.6	million	

meters	by	the	end	of	2022.	

We	 also	 made	 deployment	 progress	 in	 2022	 by	 increasing	 climate	

resiliency	for	our	distribution	network	asset.	This	was	critically	needed,	

especially	due	to	the	flooding	season	which	annually	forces	the	closure	

of	 TNB’s	 substations	 in	 affected	 areas.	 Therefore,	 we	 built	 climate	

resiliency	 into	 the	 distribution	 network,	 especially	 in	 flood-prone	

areas.	For	example,	we	raised	substation	levels	at	high-risk	substations	

to	 overcome	 the	 issue	 of	 forced	 closures	 in	 areas	 with	 a	 history	 of	

flooding.

 

Aside	 from	 that,	 we	 implemented	 Distributed	 Automation	 (DA)	

integrated	 SCADA	 technology	 with	 field	 equipment	 technology	 to	

enable remote supply restoration in the event of power outages or to 

manage	network	uncertainties.

 

We	continued	 to	 implement	DA	systems	 in	 sensitive	 areas,	 including	

business	 centres	 and	 industrial	 zones,	 to	 expedite	 restoration	 time	

in	 the	 event	 of	 an	 outage.	 In	 2022,	 we	 successfully	 installed	 and	

commissioned	 several	 additional	 substations	 for	 the	 benefit	 of	 our	

customers.	

 

Smart	Grid	Award	winner	at	Power	Gen	Awards	by	Enlit	Asia	2022	–	Enlit	Asia	is	an	energy	seminar	focusing	on	initiatives	and	new	innovation	

by	energy	companies	with	electricity	as	the	main	energy	source	in	the	Asian	region.	

SESCO	Berhad	benchmarking	visit	–	A	delegation	from	SESCO	Berhad	visited	Wisma	TNB	for	a	learning	and	development	session	on	TNB’s	

AMI	project.	The	visit	generated	interest	from	our	stakeholder	to	consider	executing	the	AMI	project	in	Sarawak.	

TNB	represented	the	Malaysian	economy	at	the	64th	Asia	Pacific	Cooperation	(APEC)	Energy	Working	Group	and	Associated	Meetings	that	

was	hosted	by	the	Ministry	of	Energy	and	Natural	Resources	Malaysia	(KeTSA),	where	TNB	shared	insights	on	the	smart	meter	implementation	

that	is	currently	ongoing	in	Malaysia.

Knowledge-sharing	sessions	:

•	 Digital	sharing	session	with	Meralco,	Philippines	–	The	session	served	as	a	highly	insightful	forum	for	information	exchange	on	Meralco's	

pilot	Smart	Meters	installation	scheme	and	its	plans	for	mass	deployment.	

•	 AMI	team	webinars	and	workshops	–	To	play	our	role	in	the	ESG	agenda,	we	proactively	organised	a	webinar	on	‘Radio	Frequency	(RF)	

Radiation	:	Are	We	Safe?’	to	demystify	misinterpretations	of	radiation	effects	on	humans,	as	well	as	a	workshop	on	‘Smart	Meter	:	Study	

on	Consumer	Behavioural	Change’	with	University	Teknikal	Malaysia	Melaka	(UTeM).

This	 was	 supported	 through	 an	 Advanced	 Distribution	 Management	

System	(ADMS)	to	provide	higher	reliability,	 reduced	technical	 losses,	

enhanced	 work	 safety,	 shortened	 service	 restoration	 time	 during	

outages	 and	 increased	 grid	 resiliency	 to	 natural	 disasters	 and	 other	

threats	that	could	disrupt	the	flow	of	power	to	the	end	user.

 

TNB	 is	 also	 embarking	 on	 data	 analytics	 in	 order	 to	 gather	 insights	

by	 increasing	 our	 pool	 of	 data.	 These	 insights,	 from	 projects	 like	

Asset	 Performance	 Management	 System	 (APMS),	 i-NET	 (Integration	

Network	 Expansion	 Tool)	 or	 future	 known	 as	 Asset	 Investment	

Planning	Management	(AIPM),	help	improve	load	planning	prioritisation	

of	 projects	 and	 enable	 predictive	maintenance	 of	 assets	 to	 facilitate	

analysis	 operations,	 maintenance,	 risk	 mitigation,	 performance	 and	

sustainability	of	power	assets.

 

In	 June	2022,	DN	established	 a	Distributed	Generation	 (DG)	Hosting	

Capacity web portal which has a map view to assist potential 

Distributed	Energy	Resources	(DER)	developers	and	interested	parties	

in	determining	 the	availability	of	DER	connection	points	and	capacity

delivering	solutions	and	services	to	our	customers.	This	is	enabled	through	
a	bold	transformation	programme	to	create	long-term	value	creation	for	
our	 Customers,	 People	 &	 Shareholders,	 which	 comprises	 12	 strategic	
initiatives.	 We	 prioritise	 customer-centricity	 and	 close	 collaborations	
with	our	Retail	Partners	to	deliver	exceptional	customer	experiences	and	
achieve	our	position	as	a	Retailer	of	Choice	in	the	eyes	of	our	customers.

In	 ensuring	 that	 our	 Retail	 business	 model	 is	 future-ready,	 we	 equip	
our	 talents	 with	 forward-thinking	 values	 that	 will	 spur	 innovation	 and	
sustainable	 solutions.	 We	 acknowledge	 our	 employees	 as	 one	 of	 the	
organisation’s	greatest	assets	and	continuously	invest	in	their	knowledge

CContinuous Enrichment of Customer Experience and Engagement 

Our	ability	to	continue	delivering	excellent	customer	service	can	be	attributed	to	our	customer	strategies	that	focus	on	three	(3)	main	areas	:

Our	efforts	to	promote	affinity	for	EE	and	a	sustainable	way	of	 life	were	well	 received	by	our	customers	and	we	received	feedback	of	 improved	

satisfaction	with	a	score	of	8.8,	which	also	helped	89%	of	customers	adjust	their	consumption	behaviour.

In	terms	of	the	Customer	Experience	Index	(CEI),	we	achieved	more	than	90%	across	the	four	(4)	interaction	channels.

Unique Customer Segments

Our	 customer	 segments	 are	 divided	 into	 two	

categories,	 namely	 Government	 &	 Large	

Business	 (GLB)	 and	 Micro,	 Small	 and	 Medium	

Enterprise	(MSME)	&	Residential.

This	 has	 helped	us	 to	 tailor	 solutions	 that	 are	

appropriate	for	each	customer	segment.	

Our	 dedicated	 teams	 engage	 with	 customers	

via	 the	 Click,	 Call,	 Come-Over	 and	 Go-Over	

interaction	channels	to	reach	out,	communicate	

and	provide	tailored	solutions.

We	 demonstrate	 empathy	 and	 agility	 to	

our	 customers	 by	 going	 the	 extra	 mile	 and	

personalising	their	experiences.

We	 continue	 to	 drive	 affinity	 towards	 energy	

efficiency	 (EE)	and	a	smarter,	greener	 lifestyle	

as	 part	 of	 the	 Malaysia	 Energy	 Literacy	

Programme	(MELP)	via	both	mass	and	targeted

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

We	continued	our	efforts	to	increase	our	customers’	energy	literacy	and	energy	efficiency	through	our	programmes,	including	but	not	limited	to	:

Customer	Energy	Literacy	on	EE	campaigns	-	We	produced	seven	(7)	educational	videos	and	conducted	one	(1)	Facebook	live	session	
through	our	collaboration	with	Persatuan	Pengguna	Islam	Malaysia	(PPIM)	to	raise	awareness	related	to	EE	and	energy	lifestyles.	Under	
the	same	objective,	we	organised	a	sharing	session	for	the	Putrajaya	community	and	government	staff	via	online	platforms.	

Awareness	seminars	on	the	Connection	Charge	&	Connected	Load	Charge	policy	–	Organised	to	enhance	understanding	of	the	policy	
among	various	relevant	groups.

Electrical	 and	 gas	 safety	 seminars	 –	Our	 teams	 visited	 villages,	 in	 collaboration	with	 Jawatankuasa	 Pembangunan	 dan	 Keselamatan	
Kampung	(JPKK),	to	disseminate	safety	information,	including	risks	and	dangers	as	well	as	efficient	energy	usage.	For	instance,	the	TNB	
Perak	team	set	up	a	booth	to	interact	directly	with	communities	and	raise	awareness.

Kuasa	Di	 Tangan	 Anda	 ESG	 seminars	 –	 In	 collaboration	with	 various	 parties,	 including	 the	Ministry	 of	 Higher	 Education	 (MOHE),	 we	 
organised	ESG	seminars	at	various	educational	 institutions	and	ministries	to	educate	students	on	how	to	use	energy	more	wisely.	We	
also	leveraged	social	media	platforms	as	an	interactive	channel	to	attract	youngsters.

DDriving Green Solutions and Supporting the Growth of Non-Regulated Business 

We	 continue	 to	 support	 the	 Government’s	 green	 agenda	 to	 promote	 sustainable	 lifestyle	 through	 the	 expansion	 of	 green	 offerings.	 This	
commitment	 is	seen	from	the	high	take-up	for	rooftop	solar	via	NEM	3.0	(Rakyat,	GoMEn,	NOVA)	and	Green	Electricity	Tariff,	or	GET,	which	 is	a	
Government	initiative	to	provide	customers	the	option	of	green	electricity	coming	from	renewable	energy	sources	without	having	to	install	their	
own	rooftop	solar	or	other	renewable	energy	installations.

Our	wholly-owned	subsidiary,	GSPARX	Sdn.	Bhd.	(GSPARX),	enables	the	adoption	of	rooftop	solar	solutions	under	the	Net	Energy	Metering	(NEM)	
and	Supply	Agreement	with	Renewable	Energy	(SARE)	scheme,	registering	secured	projects	of	240	MWp	solar	capacity	in	2022.	

These	achievements	were	made	possible	through	various	collaborative	agreements,	including	but	not	limited	to	:

Collaboration	with	University	Putra	Malaysia	(UPM)	for	the	largest	solar	system	installation	at	16	sites	with	a	capacity	of	16.18	MWp	that	
was	completed	in	July	2022.

Rooftop	solar	installation	at	seven	(7)	identified	S	P	Setia	main	commercial	sites	with	10	MWp	of	solar	capacity.

Partnership	with	 SMART	Modular	 Technologies	 Inc.,	 the	 first	multinational	 corporation	 in	 Penang	 and	 the	 first	US-based	 electronics	
company	 in	Malaysia,	 to	 fulfil	 its	 ESG	 commitment	 in	 attaining	 100%	 electricity	 powered	 by	 renewable	 energy.	 80%	 of	 electricity	 is	
powered	via	subscription	to	GET,	with	a	total	subscription	of	6.96	GWh	annually,	with	the	remainder	from	a	rooftop	solar	PV	installation	by	
GSPARX	with	a	capacity	of	1,051	kWp.

Installation	of	rooftop	solar	at	14	FELDA	sites	with	a	total	capacity	of	1.6	MWp,	which	is	expected	to	be	completed	in	May	2023.

Another	wholly-owned	subsidiary	of	TNB,	TNBX	Sdn.	Bhd.	also	enabled	customers	to	meet	their	ESG	and	net	zero	targets	through	various	solutions	
developed	such	as	the	flagship	SARE,	Malaysia	Renewable	Energy	Certificates	(mRECs),	EV	charging	platforms	and	solar	insurance	(SuriaShield).

• A total of 138 MWp cumulative capacity of solar solutions has 
been	secured	through	SARE.

•	 With	 SARE,	 customers	 can	 acquire	 green	 solutions	 at	 no	
upfront	 cost	 and	 receive	 consolidated	 billing	 under	 one	 
TNB	bill.

•	 Registered	PV	Investors	(RPVIs)	will	enjoy	benefits	from	SARE	
such	as	ease	of	collection	and	customer	 retention	over	 the	
contracted	years.

Supply Agreement with  
Renewable Energy

•	 Under	 the	 national	 GET	 programme,	 residential	 and	 
non-residential	 customers	 fully	 subscribed	 to	 the	 bundled	
electricity	 and	 mREC	 quota	 of	 4,000	 GWh	 within	 the	 first	
three	months	of	launch.

•	 mRECs	provide	green	energy	options	 in	areas	where	 it	may	
not	 be	 suitable	 for	 renewable	 resources	 to	 be	 obtained	
onsite.

OUTLOOK

In	2023,	TNB	will	 reach	the	significant	milestone	of	10	million	customers	 in	Peninsular	Malaysia.	This	 is	a	meaningful	accomplishment	 for	TNB	as	we	

continue	to	provide	a	reliable	and	continuous	supply	of	electricity	while	also	enhancing	customer	experience.	

Going	 forward,	we	will	 continue	 to	advocate	 the	adoption	of	a	digital,	 smarter	and	greener	 lifestyle	with	great	convenience,	while	 improving	energy	

literacy	to	deliver	TNB’s	Energy	Transition	Plan	SP2050	goals.

We	shall	continue	to	focus	on	these	four	(4)	key	areas	to	win	our	customers	:

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

SSteady Embrace of Digitalisation

The	Retail	Division	 recognises	 that	digitalisation	 is	 a	 crucial	 component	 in	 achieving	TNB's	Net	Zero	2050	goals.	To	enhance	our	 services	 and	

reduce	our	carbon	footprint,	we	have	been	striving	to	increase	our	digital	capabilities.	Our	digital	platform,	myTNB,	has	seen	a	significant	increase	
in	connected	accounts,	growing	from	5.5	million	in	2021	to	6.29	million.

We	have	also	successfully	piloted	a	digital	billing	programme	in	Melaka	with	more	than	43,000	customers	opting	to	choose	e-Bills.	This	initiative	

has	helped	us	reduce	our	carbon	footprint	and	paper	usage,	further	contributing	to	our	environmental	goals.	Additionally,	myTNB's	Energy	Budget	

feature	has	enabled	customers	to	better	monitor	their	electricity	usage.	Out	of	the	184,000	accounts	using	this	feature,	174,000	(95%)	have	shown	

improvements	in	their	consumption	patterns,	which	have	helped	them	to	save	on	their	electricity	bills.	

In	addition,	our	digital	platform	for	businesses,	myTNBiz,	is	a	new	portal	equipped	with	service	offerings	like	bill	viewing	and	bulk	online	payment	

designed	for	TNB	business	customers,	such	as	individuals	with	businesses,	large	and	small	corporations/entrepreneurs,	contractors	and	developers.	

Since	its	release	on	9	April	2022,	myTNBiz	has	successfully	registered	4,055	bulk	billing	customers	on	the	platform.

•	 TNBX	 has	 empowered	 EV	 users	 to	 reload,	 reserve	 and	

recharge	 their	 vehicles	 from	 the	 EV	 charge	 points	 that	 are	

listed	on	the	GO	TO-U	mobile	app.	

	 EV	users	can	also	take	advantage	of	extra	services	like	battery	

health	checks,	regular	maintenance	and	customer	support.

EV Charging Platforms

•	 A	residential	solar	PV	insurance	plan	called	SuriaShield	offers	

thorough	protection	at	very	affordable	premiums.	

	 The	SuriaShield	Insurance	Policy	was	introduced	by	TNBX	to	

support	TNB's	aspiration	to	encourage green energy.

•	 The	 advantages	 of	 SuriaShield	 are	 hassle-free	 repair	 and	

restoration	 of	 solar	 PV	 systems	 and	 FiT	 loss	 of	 income	

protection/NEM	loss	of	savings	protection.

SuriaShield

We	are	also	enhancing	our	smart	meter	customer	offerings,	which	will	enable	near	real-time	information	on	electricity	consumption,	with	accurate	and	

timely	billing.	With	the	continued	growth	of	myTNB's	connected	accounts	and	the	success	of	digital	initiatives	such	as	the	Melaka	pilot	programme,	we	

are	on	track	to	becoming	a	more	sustainable	and	environmentally	friendly	organisation.	We	will	further	promote	digital	billing,	the	Energy	Budget	feature	

and	the	myTNBiz	portal	to	meet	our	customers'	evolving	needs.

TNB	recognises	the	importance	of	engaging	and	collaborating	with	these	

stakeholders	 to	 find	 solutions	 that	 support	 the	 growth	 of	 the	 industry	

in	 a	 sustainable	 and	 responsible	manner.	 This	 includes	working	 towards	

the	 energy	 transition	 and	 promoting	 the	 adoption	 of	 electric	 vehicles	

(EVs)	 to	 reduce	 carbon	emissions	 in	 the	 transportation	 sector.	 Through	

its	collaboration	with	the	government,	TNB	 is	committed	to	being	a	key	

player	in	building	a	more	sustainable	and	responsible	future	for	the	nation.

OVERVIEW 

In	2022,	TNB	continued	to	make	progress	in	adding	value	to	its	regulatory	

environment.	 During	 the	 year,	 we	 saw	 the	 ICPT	mechanism	 continuing	

to	 play	 an	 important	 role	 in	 balancing	 the	 needs	 of	 the	 rakyat	 against	

the	 resources	needed	 for	stable	electricity	supply.	TNB	also	progressed	

in	 building	 connections	 between	 ASEAN	 countries	 through	 the	 

Lao	 PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore	 Power	 Integration	 Project.	

Additionally,	TNB	contributed	to	Malaysia's	RE	sector	with	the	construction	

of	its	third	solar	power	plant,	TNB	Bukit	Selambau	2	and	the	Sungai	Perak	

Hydro	 Life	 Extension	 Programme.	 The	 launch	 of	 Malaysia's	 National	

Energy	Policy	has	paved	the	way	to	achieving	a	low-carbon	economy	and	

given	greater	 impetus	 to	TNB’s	own	Energy	Transition	Plan.	Finally,	TNB	

intensified	its	efforts	to	develop	the	EV	ecosystem	by	engaging	with	the	

government	and	industry	stakeholders	and	signing	several	MoUs.

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

TNB operates in a heavily regulated electricity 

supply industry landscape, where rules and 

regulations determined by the government 

and other regulatory authorities govern the 

way business is conducted.

FUTURE-PROOF 
REGULATIONS

In collaboration with TNB and various stakeholders, the Malaysia Energy Literacy Program (MELP) launched by Minister Nik Nazmi bin Nik Ahmad seeks to cultivate energy-sensitive 
consumers by raising awareness about the importance of energy and promoting public participation in energy management.

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

IImbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) Updates

Throughout	 2022,	 the	 ICPT	 mechanism,	 together	 with	 the	

government’s	 interventions,	was	 able	 strike	 the	 balance	 between	

protecting	consumers	from	high	fuel	prices	and	ensuring	that	TNB	

would	continue	to	have	the	resources	to	provide	reliable	electricity	

services	to	Malaysians.

Following	 on	 from	 the	 previous	 ICPT	 implementation	 from	 1	 July	

to	 31	December	 2021,	 the	 government	maintained	 the	 prevailing	

ICPT	 rebate	 of	 2.0	 sen/kWh	 for	 all	 domestic	 consumers	 and	 the	

surcharge	 of	 3.7	 sen/kWh	 for	 non-domestic	 customers	 for	 the	

period	1	January	to	30	June	2022.	The	ICPT	amount	for	the	period	 

1	January	to	30	June	2022	totalled	RM1.7	billion.

With	 the	 onset	 of	 the	 Russia-Ukraine	 conflict	 sending	 fuel	

prices	even	higher,	 the	 total	 ICPT	amount	 for	 the	period	1	July	 to	 

31	December	2022	was	RM7	billion,	where	 the	average	surcharge	

for	all	 customers	would	have	come	up	 to	11.8	sen/kWh.	However,	

after	 carefully	 considering	 the	challenges	and	difficulties	 faced	by	

the	nation,	especially	with	the	rise	in	the	average	cost	of	living,	the	

government	maintained	 the	same	 rebate	 for	domestic	customers	

and	 surcharge	 for	 non-domestic	 customers.	 This	 resulted	 in	 the	

government	providing	subsidies	to	TNB	amounting	to	RM5.8	billion.

FFuture-Proofing MESI

The	Future-Proofing	Malaysia	Electricity	Supply	Industry	(MESI)	Study	

is	 a	 crucial	 step	 going	 forward	 to	 ensure	 MESI	 continues	 to	 evolve,	

with	 the	 emphasis	 on	 three	 (3)	 main	 elements	 :	 consumer-centric,	

industry	resilience	and	agile	governance.	The	focus	on	people-friendly	

initiatives	and	economic	recovery	are	in	tandem	with	the	government's	

post-pandemic	priorities.	MyPOWER	is	currently	leading	the	study	with	

the	 aim	of	 achieving	 a	 balanced	 approach	 to	energy	 security,	 equity,	

sustainability,	 economic	 development	 and	 customer	 experience.	

The	study	includes	a	 long-term	roadmap	and	implementation	plan	to	

future-proof	the	industry	against	potential	challenges.

TNB	 has	 been	 proactively	 preparing	 for	 future	 scenario	 reforms	

since	 2015	 through	 its	 Reimagining	 TNB	 business	 strategy.	 The	

Sustainability	 Pathway	 2050	 ensures	 that	 TNB's	 business	 is	 

future-proofed	 by	 balancing	 the	 Energy	 Transition	 with	 financial	

sustainability	 and	 shareholder	 value	 protection.	 TNB	 is	 committed	

to	providing	 the	 rakyat	with	 a	better	world	 and	brighter	 life	 and	 fully	

supports	the	development	of	MESI	for	the	betterment	of	the	industry	

and	 the	 nation.	 TNB	 is	 excited	 to	 continue	 collaborating	 with	 the	

Ministry	 of	 Natural	 Resources,	 Environment	 and	 Climate	 Change	 

and	MyPOWER	during	the	 implementation	phases	of	 future-proofing	

MESI.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS

EEnhancing Malaysia’s RE Sector

TNB	continues	to	contribute	to	the	development	of	the	nation’s	RE	sector	in	line	with	the	Malaysia	Energy	Renewable	Roadmap	to	achieve	31%	

share	of	RE	in	the	national	energy	capacity	mix.	

In	2022,	we	commenced	work	on	TNB’s	third	solar	power	plant,	TNB	Bukit	Selambau	2,	which	is	expected	to	be	commissioned	on	31	December	

2023.	At	the	same	time,	work	on	TNB’s	Nenggiri	Hydro	Project	has	commenced	and	it	is	expected	to	be	commissioned	by	the	second	quarter	of	

2027	with	300	MW	capacity.	TNB	also	received	the	green	light	to	proceed	with	the	Sungai	Perak	Hydro	Life	Extension	Programme	to	uprate	and	

upgrade	the	Sungai	Perak	Hydroelectric	Scheme	with	a	capacity	of	650.75	MW.	The	refurbishment	works	will	commence	in	2024	and	commercial	

operations	are	expected	to	start	in	2025.

TNB	also	welcomes	the	government’s	move	to	introduce	the	Corporate	Green	Power	Programme	(CGPP)	which	will	enable	solar	energy	producers	

to	sell	RE	to	corporate	players	through	a	virtual	power	purchase	agreement	(VPPA).	The	CGPP	will	start	with	a	quota	of	600	MW	and	all	approved	

solar	energy	producers	must	have	their	power	assets	operational	by	2025	at	the	latest	before	they	can	start	bidding	to	sell	the	generated	energy	

to	the	grid.	TNB,	on	its	part,	will	pay	for	the	electricity	generated	while	the	corporate	consumer	will	sign	a	VPPA	with	the	solar	power	producer	to	

determine	volume	and	pricing.	The	corporate	consumer	will	then	obtain	the	RE	supply	through	TNB’s	grid	and	also	be	able	to	secure	a	renewable	

energy	certificate.	

We	believe	that	clean	energy	in	the	form	of	RE	is	the	future	of	the	power	generation	business.	Moving	forward,	TNB	will	continue	to	participate	in	

RE	initiatives	to	increase	penetration	to	the	grid.

OUTLOOK

As	a	responsible	and	forward-thinking	energy	company,	TNB	is	committed	to	supporting	the	government's	vision	of	a	sustainable	and	low-carbon	future	

for	Malaysia.	We	are	encouraged	by	the	initiatives	present	in	the	National	Energy	Policy	(NEP)	2022-2040	that	will	help	to	drive	the	energy	transition	and	

we	will	continue	to	forge	a	close	working	relationship	with	the	Government	to	ensure	regulatory	stability	and	the	opening	up	of	more	opportunities.	We	

will	also	continue	our	efforts	to	ensure	energy	reliability	while	balancing	energy	affordability	and	sustainability	in	addressing	the	Energy	Trilemma.

NNational Energy Policy

This	year,	Malaysia’s	energy	 industry	greeted	the	 launch	of	 the	National	Energy	Policy	 (NEP),	which	has	the	overall	aim	of	guaranteeing	energy	

supply	in	a	responsible	and	sustainable	way.	The	NEP	has	also	laid	out	the	roadmap	for	Malaysia	to	achieve	its	low-carbon	economy	aspirations.	

Many	initiatives	under	the	NEP	are	aligned	with	TNB’s	own	Reimagining	TNB	strategy,	Sustainability	Pathway	2050	and	Energy	Transition	Plan.	This	

is	important	to	ensure	that	we	are	moving	forward	in	the	right	direction	as	a	nation	given	our	position	as	the	largest	utility.

The	initiatives	under	the	NEP	that	TNB	is	already	actively	advancing	include	:

In	carrying	out	these	heavy	responsibilities,	we	have	also	endeavoured	to	keep	all	relevant	stakeholders	in	the	government	duly	updated	regarding	

our	plans	and	strategies.	We	also	continue	to	find	ways	to	assist	the	government	and	 its	agencies,	either	through	collaboration	or	through	the	

sharing	of	expertise	and	knowledge,	to	advance	the	nation’s	own	net	zero	aspirations.

MMalaysia Energy Literacy Programme (MELP)

In	2020,	TNB	embarked	on	the	Malaysia	Energy	Literacy	Program	(MELP)	to	educate	Malaysians	on	understanding	the	importance	of	energy	and	their	

role	in	managing	energy.	From	a	regulatory	perspective,	this	programme	serves	as	a	long-term	investment	in	creating	energy-literate	consumers	

who	have	a	good	understanding	of	the	challenges	and	opportunities	present	in	the	energy	industry	as	it	transitions.	With	a	literate	consumer	base	

that	will	also	comprise	government,	ministries,	regulators	and	members	of	Parliament,	decision-makers	will	be	able	to	make	informed	decisions	on	

energy-related	topics	and	policies.	Other	stakeholders	we	target	with	this	programme	include	key	thought	influencers,	school	students	and	the	

youth,	TNB	employees	and	the	media.

The	MELP	covers	topics	such	as	the	energy	value	chain,	renewable	energy	and	Malaysia	Energy	&	Supply	 Industry/Incentive-Based	Regulation/

Regulatory	 Period.	 Consumers	 are	 also	 being	 educated	 on	 the	 ICPT	 mechanism,	 smart	 meters,	 billing,	 safety	 and	 smart	 energy	 solutions,	 

in	addition	to	being	informed	on	topics	of	the	future	such	as	sustainability	and	the	energy	transition,	electric	vehicles,	telecommunications	and	

network	connectivity.

ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS

THE MARKET LANDSCAPE

As the nation moved beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, customers’ electricity demand 
in Peninsular Malaysia grew by 6.0% in 2022, driven by the resumption of economic 
activities. The supply side saw coal contributing to 55.9% of the generation mix, followed 
by gas at 37.2%, hydro at 5.2% and solar at 1.2%.

As	the	Malaysian	economy	is	going	through	the	process	of	recovering	from	the	impact	of	the	pandemic,	other	challenges	arose.	The	exposure	to	a	

tight	global	fuel	sources	situation,	as	well	as	a	series	of	unprecedented	supply	chain	disruptions	in	key	producing	countries,	impacted	the	electricity	

sector.	Shortage	of	gas	flows	to	Europe	due	to	the	prolonged	Russia-Ukraine	war,	followed	by	Europe’s	reversion	to	coal	power	plants,	propelled	global	

coal	prices	to	breach	all-time	highs	across	all	coal	 indices	 in	2022.	 In	addition,	production	cuts	by	members	of	 the	Organization	of	 the	Petroleum	

Exporting	Countries	(OPEC)	contributed	to	elevated	energy	prices.	

The	global	market	coal	price	 reached	an	all-time	high	above	USD	415/MT	 in	May	2022,	 trading	at	more	 than	 four	 (4)	 times	of	 the	base	coal	price	of	 

USD	79/MT	in	Regulatory	Period	3	(RP3).	As	generation	costs	made	up	65%	of	the	electricity	costs	in	the	tariff,	this	posed	a	challenge	to	the	system’s	

financial	sustainability.	Furthermore,	TNB’s	cash	flow	was	stressed	due	to	higher	payment	obligations	to	ensure	security	of	supply	to	customers.

Against	this	backdrop,	the	government	effectively	 implemented	the	 ICPT	mechanism	to	ensure	continuous	electricity	supply	to	the	rakyat.	Through	

this	mechanism,	the	volatility	of	the	market	fuel	price	was	mitigated.	On	24	June	2022,	the	government	provided	industry	stability	by	maintaining	the	

tariff	rates	for	all	customers,	i.e.	a	2	sen/kWh	rebate	for	domestic	customers	and	a	3.7	sen/kWh	surcharge	for	non-domestic	customers	for	the	period	 

1	July	until	31	December	2022.	This	was	made	possible	through	joint	funding	by	Kumpulan	Wang	Industri	Elektrik	(KWIE)	and	Tabung	Wang	COVID	under	

the	Ministry	of	Finance.

On	16	December	2022,	the	tariff	rate	was	maintained	for	domestic	and	Micro,	Small	and	Medium	Enterprises	(MSMEs)	and	all	Agricultural	customers	for	

the	period	1	January	2023	until	30	June	2023.	However,	the	ICPT	mechanism	has	passed	through	a	surcharge	of	20	sen/kWh	to	Other	Non-Domestic	

customers.	Efforts	were	also	taken	to	continuously	 increase	customers’	awareness	on	energy	efficiency	and	the	global	 trends	 impacting	 fuel	prices,	

to	 better	manage	 their	 electricity	 consumption.	Customers	were	 provided	with	 options	 to	 consider	 cost-effective	 renewable	 energy	 (RE)	 solutions	 

such	as	rooftop	solar.	We	saw	rooftop	solar	adoption	rising	during	the	period.

THE MARKET LANDSCAPE

The	Malaysian	government	continues	to	advance	the	nation’s	aspiration	to	

attain	net	zero	greenhouse	gas	(GHG)	emissions	by	2050.	One	of	the	most	

significant	developments	 in	2022	was	 the	establishment	of	 the	Ministry	

of	 Natural	 Resources,	 Environment	 and	 Climate	 Change	 (NRECC),	 an	

amalgamation	of	the	previous	Energy	and	Natural	Resources	Ministry	and	

the	Environment	and	Water	Ministry.

Under	 the	 same	 objective,	 the	 government	 launched	 the	 National	

Energy	 Policy	 (NEP)	 2022-2040,	 with	 the	 goal	 of	 driving	 the	 country	

towards	 benefiting	 from	 and	 embracing	 energy	 transition	 megatrends.	

The	 policy	 promotes	 sustainable	 energy	 development	 and	 addresses	

the	 challenges	 faced	 by	 the	 energy	 sector.	 This	 establishes	 a	 series	

of	 initiatives	 for	 achieving	 energy	 transition	 towards	 a	 sustainable,	 

low-carbon	 future,	 including	 the	 increase	of	 RE	generation	 sources	 and	

adoption	of	electric	mobility,	 reduction	of	coal	power	plant	capacity	and	

intensifying	 industrial,	 commercial	 and	 residential	 energy	 efficiency.	

These	 initiatives	were	strengthened	by	 the	 recently	 launched	Malaysian	

Energy	 Transition	 Outlook	 (METO),	 a	 collaborative	 study	 between	 the	

International	Renewable	Energy	Agency	(IRENA)	and	NRECC.	

DRIVING A RESPONSIBLE ENERGY TRANSITION

Key	 to	 supporting	 this	 transition	 is	 focusing	 on	 grid	 infrastructure	

investment	 and	deploying	 energy	 storage	 to	 accommodate	distributed,	

bi-directional	 and	 intermittent	 RE	 penetration.	 This	 includes	 the	

digitalisation	 and	 modernisation	 of	 the	 power	 system,	 making	 the	

grid	 smart	 and	 flexible.	 The	 journey	 of	 energy	 transition	 entails	 the	

development	 of	 future	 sustainable	 ecosystems	 such	 as	 the	 hydrogen	

economy	and	exploration	of	carbon	capture	and	storage	(CCUS).

TNB	 recognises	 that	 climate	 action	 is	multifaceted	 and	 that	 sources	 of	

emissions	 extend	 beyond	 the	 power	 generation	 industry.	 As	 a	 critical	 

player	 in	Malaysia’s	 energy	 sector	with	 a	 portfolio	 extending	 across	 the	

value	 chain,	 TNB	 is	 focused	on	 delivering	 the	 nation’s	 energy	 transition	

through	 RE,	 grid	 infrastructure	 and	 customer	 participation,	 including	

adoption	 of	 electric	mobility.	 In	 supporting	 the	 climate	 action	 strategic	

objective,	 TNB	 announced	 its	 Energy	 Transition	 Plan	 in	 August	 2022,	

aimed	 at	 achieving	 ESG	 targets	 and	 business	 growth.	 A	 successful	

and	 responsible	 energy	 transition	 is	 the	 catalyst	 for	 economic	 growth	

opportunities	and	long-term	sustainability	for	Malaysia.

DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE VALUE

WHAT MATTERS TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Our	 sustainability	 agenda	 focuses	on	matters	 outlined	 in	 our	materiality	
matrix	 that	 have	 been	 integrated	 into	 our	 strategy	 for	 value	 creation	
and	 growth.	 We	 envisage	 that	 the	 alignment	 of	 our	 strategic	 priorities	
will	enable	us	to	expand	the	value	we	create	for	our	stakeholders	and	the	
nation.	Every	 two	years,	we	conduct	a	comprehensive	analysis	 to	 review	
the	sustainability	issues	and	groups	of	stakeholders	relevant	to	the	Group	
to	ensure	that	any	significant	changes	in	the	internal	and	external	context	
are	 taken	 into	 consideration.	 This	 enables	 us	 to	 stay	 ahead	of	 emerging	
trends,	changing	customer	demands	and	other	operational	challenges.

A	 critical	 component	 of	 this	 process	 is	 stakeholder	 engagement,	 which	
enables	us	to	gain	a	better	understanding	of	the	issues	that	matter	most	to	
us	and	which	can	impact	our	ability	to	create	value	over	the	short,	medium	
or	long	term.	Stakeholder	engagement	also	helps	us	to	not	only	determine	
our	material	matters,	but	also	to	prioritise	them	based	on	their	significance.

We	 reviewed	 our	 materiality	 matters	 
against	 Bursa's	 Sustainability	 Reporting	
Guide	 (3rd	 Edition)	 and	 the	 GRI	 2021	
Standards.	 We	 further	 analysed	 industry	
trends,	 leading	 practices	 from	 peer	
benchmarking,	media	reviews	and	feedback	
from	 divisions	 that	 closely	 engage	 with	
external	 stakeholders.	 As	 a	 result,	 a	
refreshed	 inventory	 list	 of	 potential	
sustainability	matters	was	defined.

We	 circulated	 an	 internal	 survey	 to	 our	 business	 divisions,	
department	 units	 and	 subsidiaries.	 We	 also	 engaged	 with	
several	external	stakeholders	for	the	purpose	of	shortlisting	
and	 prioritising	 the	 Group's	 key	 stakeholder	 groups	 and	
material	matters.

Eight	 (8)	 key	 stakeholder	 groups	 were	 identified,	 while	 the	
materiality	 matters	 were	 prioritised	 based	 on	 TNB's	 ESG	
impacts	 and	 the	 level	 of	 influence	 on	 the	 assessments	 and	
decisions	of	stakeholders.

The	 key	 stakeholder	 groups	 and	
material	 matters	 were	 reviewed	
and	 validated	 by	 the	 Senior	
Management	 and	 Sustainability	
and	 Energy	 Transition	 Council	
(SETC).

This	year,	 in	view	of	the	enhancement	of	the	materiality	assessment	methodology	adopted,	the	number	of	material	matters	had	effectively	reduced	 
from	18	in	FY2021	to	10	in	FY2022,	with	the	objective	of	providing	better	focus	and	strategic	management	of	the	matters.	The	following	is	a	summary	of	
key	updates	:

•	 We	made	a	distinction	between	material	matters	that	are	fundamental	to	us	but	are	shared	across	multiple	business	sectors	and	strategic	matters	
that	have	implications	for	the	Group’s	transformation	and	business	model.

•	 Climate	Change	and	Emission	is	now	of	the	highest	priority	to	the	Group	as	its	importance	to	stakeholders	has	increased.
•	 Environmental-related	matters	remain	a	key	strategic	focus	for	TNB.

Enabling 
Functions

RESPONSIBLE GOVERNANCE AND STRENGTHENING BUSINESS RESILIENCE

In	order	to	remain	competitive	and	meet	the	expectations	of	our	stakeholders,	 it	 is	crucial	 for	TNB	to	develop	a	comprehensive	plan	that	prioritises	

sustainability	and	builds	resilience	towards	climate-related	risks.	In	pursuit	of	these	objectives,	TNB	has	identified	six	(6)	key	enablers	that	can	support	

the	execution	of	the	Energy	Transition	Plan	:

TNB	seeks	to	contribute	in	shaping	the	nation's	key	climate	policies	through	its	efforts	in	policy	advocacy	and	in	influencing	the	

wider	ecosystem	of	stakeholders	for	accelerated	climate	action.	Areas	of	advocacy	prioritised	are	incentivisation	of	emissions	

reductions	through	energy	efficiency,	renewable	energy	incentives	and	regulatory	measures,	amongst	others.	

Policy Advocacy

To	enhance	sustainability	management	throughout	the	TNB's	integrated	value	chain,	it	is	essential	to	establish	a	comprehensive	

sustainability	 framework	 that	 provides	 a	 directional	 reference	 for	 the	 Group.	 This	 includes	 collaborating	 to	 develop	 a	

sustainability	 framework	and	structure	 to	 support	business	entities'	 (BEs)	decarbonisation	efforts	and	shape	sustainability	

growth.	

Sustainability 
Framework

We	aim	to	secure	sustainable	financing	options	for	TNB's	decarbonisation	initiatives.	Our	investments	in	green	technologies	

and	infrastructure	as	well	as	renewable	energy	expansions	will	 leverage	on	structuring	innovative	ways	to	utilise	sustainable	

financing.

Funding the 
Journey

In	order	for	TNB	to	be	a	sustainability	leader,	we	have	to	drive	sustainability	within	our	supply	chain.	We	advocate	sustainability	

practices	to	our	suppliers	to	develop	a	green	and	resilient	supply	chain.	As	a	start,	TNB	will	engage	with	our	strategic	suppliers	

and	set	gradual	expectations	aligned	to	our	sustainability	goals	 in	respecting	human	rights,	 reducing	carbon	emissions	and	

environmental	 footprint,	 amongst	 others.	 This	 will	 improve	 transparency	 in	 emissions	 accounting	 and	 enable	 reductions	

within	our	Scope	3	emissions.	Recognising	the	struggles	faced	by	our	small	and	medium-sized	enterprise	vendors,	a	Vendor	

Management	 Programme	 will	 be	 launched	 to	 educate	 and	 develop	 vendor	 capabilities	 in	 relation	 to	 emissions	 reduction.	

Suppliers	will	 be	 assessed	 against	 a	 set	 of	 sustainability	 criteria	 aligned	 to	our	 sustainability	 goals	 during	pre-qualification	

stage	and	audits	during	project	delivery.	

Green  
Supply Chain

We	aim	to	invest	in	building	the	skills	and	knowledge	of	our	employees	to	enable	them	to	contribute	to	the	Energy	Transition	

Plan.	By	providing	training	on	sustainability,	promoting	cross-functional	collaboration	and	fostering	a	culture	of	sustainability	

throughout	the	organisation,	we	can	empower	our	employees	to	drive	the	energy	transition	initiatives.	We	will	continuously	

assess	capability	gaps	and	resource	capacity	requirements	throughout	our	journey	towards	Net	Zero	2050	aspiration.	

Capability  
Building

Digitalisation	 at	 TNB	 spans	 across	 three	 (3)	 dimensions	 :	 enabling	 a	 digital	 enterprise,	 adoption	 of	 digital	 solutions	 and	

promoting	digital	interactions.	Digital	solutions	allow	the	modernisation	of	the	grid	system	and	scaling	up	renewable	energy	

capacity	penetration	while	empowering	our	customers	through	digital	platforms.	In	FY2022,	we	upgraded	the	myTNB	platform	

by	adding	the	Energy	Budget	feature	to	enhance	customer	experience	and	established	an	EV	digital	platform	as	part	of	our	

aspiration	 of	 becoming	 a	 key	 EV	 player	 in	 Malaysia.	 TNB	will	 continue	 to	 develop	 digital	 capabiltiies	 and	 infrastructure	 to	

support	the	decarbonisation	efforts	across	our	business	entities.

TNB's	key	focus	is	to	accelerate	the	energy	transition	and	address	climate	

change	by	digitalising	 the	utilities	 industry,	utilising	efficient	 technology	

and	exploring	greener	energy	sources	for	enhanced	power	security.

GENERATION FUEL MIX

As part of its 12th	Malaysia	Plan,	 the	Malaysian	Government	has	pledged	

to	become	a	carbon-neutral	country	by	2050,	ahead	of	COP26.	To	achieve	

this	goal,	the	Government	has	committed	to	ending	the	construction	of	

new	coal-fired	power	plants.	As	a	result,	it	is	expected	that	the	proportion	

of	 electricity	 generated	 from	 coal	will	 decrease	 gradually	 in	 the	 coming	

years.

In	balancing	the	energy	trilemma,	the	Generation	Development	Plan	will	

be	based	on	a	guiding	principle	of	optimum	fuel	mix	to	achieve	a	Herfndahl-

Hirschman	Index	(HHI)	≤0.5.	This	would	ensure	optimum	power	security	by	

providing	adequate	diversification	of	fuel	and	resources.

TNB's	 generation	 fuel	 mix	 depends	 on	 the	 Peninsular	 Malaysia’s	

Generation	 Development	 Plan	 as	 approved	 by	 the	 Planning	 and	

Implementation	 Committee	 for	 Electricity	 Supply	 and	 Tariff	 (JPPPET),	

which	 is	 chaired	by	 the	Ministry	of	Natural	Resources,	Environment	and	

Climate	Change	(NRECC).	This	plan	is	developed	based	on	the	underlying	

principle	of	 balancing	 the	 security	of	 electricity	 supply,	 affordability	 and	

environmental	 sustainability.	 TNB’s	 target	 on	 renewable	 energy	 growth	

aligns	with	the	nation's	goal	of	increasing	renewable	energy	capacity	and	

reducing	the	greenhouse	gas	emission	intensity	of	GDP	by	45%	by	2030.

Our two-prong strategy in greening our generation mix emphasises 

on	 reducing	 our	 coal	 capacity	 in	 a	 gradual	manner	 while	 increasing	 our	

renewables	energy	portfolio.

SMART GRID

The	Grid	of	 the	Future	 (GoTF)	 strategy,	which	 is	 a	part	of	TNB's	Energy	

Transition	Plan,	aims	to	modernise	and	digitalise	our	grid	and	distribution	

infrastructures	to	support	increased	integration	of	distributed	generations	

and	renewables.	This	will	lead	to	enhanced	reliability	and	efficiency	of	our	

distribution	network	and	system	in	delivering	services	to	our	customers.	

This	 is	 achieved	 by	 better	 management	 of	 distributed	 generation	 and	

possible	interconnections	with	other	countries.	Additionally,	digitalisation	

opens	 up	 possibilities	 to	 offer	 new	 products	 and	 services	 to	 meet	 our	

customers’	needs	and	expectations.	

TNB	plans	to	invest	a	total	of	RM21	billion	of	Capital	Expenditure	(CAPEX)	

over	a	period	of	three	(3)	years	from	2022	until	2024	in	strengthening	the	

grid	and	reliability	of	energy	supply.

We	strive	to	meet	the	increasing	demand	for	cleaner	electricity	contributed	

by	 electrification	 and	population	growth	by	 accelerating	 the	 integration	

of	clean	energy	within	the	grid	infrastructure.	In	tandem	with	this,	we	are	

expanding	grid	accessibility	to	connect	new	loads	and	data	centres	from	

potential	customers	and	smart	cities	 in	new	development	areas	that	will	

also	spur	national	economic	growth.	

We	facilitate	customer	participation	from	two	(2)	dimensions	:	

a)	 Encouraging	efficient	electricity	usage;	and	

b)	 Self-generation	of	electricity.	We	enable	customers	to	optimise	their	

energy	 consumption	 using	 real-time	 electricity	 consumption	 data	

collected	from	Smart	Meters	and	fed	into	myTNB	app.	

The installation of rooftop solar at customer’s premises via initiatives 

such	as	Supply	Agreement	for	Renewable	Energy	(SARE)	and	GSPARX	to	

self-generate	electricity	on	the	other	hand	will	encourage	the	growth	of	

prosumers	among	TNB’s	customers.	

TNB	has	made	progress	 in	 integrating	renewable	energy	into	the	grid	by	

partnering	with	commercial	customers	to	provide	green	energy	solutions	

to	reduce	load	on	the	grid,	as	well	as	conducting	research	and	studies	to	

identify	suitable	renewable	energy	solutions	to	increase	RE	capacity.

SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS EXPANSION

Our	 aspiration	 to	 become	 a	 leading	 provider	

of sustainable energy solutions aligns with 

our	 Energy	 Transition	 Plan,	 which	 we	 believe	

will	 create	 value	 for	 our	 stakeholders,	 spur	

growth	 in	 the	 energy	 industry	 and	 enhance	

our	 customer	 experience	 through	 diversified	

products	 and	 services.	 To	 ensure	 successful	

delivery	 of	 these	 strategic	 outcomes,	 

we	 empower	 and	 provide	 support	 to	 relevant	

business	entities	to	enable	them	to	effectively	

execute	plans	and	initiatives.

TNB	 is	 fully	 committed	 to	 reduce	 35%	 of	 its	

carbon emission intensity by the year 2035 

via	 adoption	 of	 new	 emerging	 technologies	

such	as	ammonia,	biomass,	hydrogen	co-firing	

and	 Carbon	 Capture,	 Utilisation	 and	 Storage.	

These	 initiatives	were	 intensified	across	TNB's	

business	unit,	divisions	and	subsidiaries.

We	aim	to	deliver	our	SP2050	initiatives	through	

a	 multi-faceted	 approach.	 The	 areas	 of	 focus	 

for our energy transition strategy are as follows :

1)	 Reduce	Coal	Capacity	

2)	 Expand	 TNB's	 Low	 Carbon	 Generation	

Portfolio

3)	 Increase	 Adoption	 of	 Cleaner	 Fuel	 and	

Green Technology

4)	 Accelerate	 Green	 Technologies	 via	

Strategic Partnership

5)	 Increase	operational	efficiency	

With	regards	to	our	energy	transition	strategy,	

our primary goal is to maintain the highest 

level of reliability excellence in our generation 

capabilities.	 This	 will	 enable	 us	 to	 uphold	 the	

availability	 and	 reliability	 of	 our	 critical	 assets	

while	 transitioning	 towards	 more	 sustainable	

energy	sources.

Additionally,	 we	 strive	 to	 align	 our	 efforts	

with the objective of achieving net-zero 

emissions.	 In	 effort	 to	 reduce	 emission,	 TNB	

carbon	 management	 plan	 outlines	 three	 (3)	

key	 components	 :	 reduce,	 capture	 and	 offset	

emissions.

TNB's	multi-faceted	approach	towards	energy	transition	:	

On	 the	 domestic	 front,	 development	 of	 Nenggiri	 hydro	 plant	 is	 expected	 to	 commence	 

commercial	 operations	 in	 2027.	The	 hydro	plant	 is	 expected	 to	mitigate	 0.3	million	 tonnes	CO
2  

yearly.	 Furthermore,	 the	 Energy	 Commission	 (EC)	 has	 approved	 TNB's	 Hydro	 Life	 Extension	

Programme	 for	 six	 (6)	 stations	 in	 the	 Sungai	 Perak	 Power	 Stations	 (SSJ	 Sungai	 Perak),	 with	 an	

investment	 of	 RM5.8	 billion.	 This	 programme	 is	 set	 to	 begin	 in	 FY2022.	 As	 a	 result,	 we	 have	

increased	renewables	 installed	capacity	 to	3,780	MW	representing	a	growth	of	8%	compared	to	

FY2021.	Overall,	 these	domestic	and	 international	RE	developments	 reflect	our	commitment	 to	

expanding	its	renewable	energy	portfolio	and	contributing	to	a	more	sustainable	future.

On	 the	 international	 front,	 our	 New	 Energy	 Division	 (NED)	 was	 formed	 to	 venture	 and	 explore	

international	 opportunities.	 NED	 plans	 to	 expand	 renewable	 energy	 assets	 through	 strategic	

collaborations,	mergers	and	acquisitions	and	asset	development	with	 leading	 renewable	energy	

companies.	 We	 aim	 to	 realise	 our	 energy	 transition	 aspiration	 and	 provide	 better	 access	 to	

new	 technologies	 and	markets	while	 at	 the	 same	 time	 leveraging	 on	 opportunities	 to	 enhance	

capabilities	and	knowledge.

In	FY2022,	NED	made	significant	progress	 in	expanding	 its	 renewable	energy	portfolio.	Through	

its	subsidiary,	NED	has	acquired	CEI	UK	Ltd	and	added	97.3	MW	onshore	wind	portfolio	in	the	UK,	

increasing	Vantage's	installed	capacity	by	22%	to	530	MW.	In	addition,	GMR	Energy	Trading	Limited,	

another	shareholding	company	that	operates	in	India,	has	successfully	commissioned	the	180	MW	

Bajoli	Holi	hydro	power	plant	in	June	2022.	In	parallel,	TNB	leveraged	on	secondment	opportunities	

in	enhancing	our	people's	capabilities.	

As	 the	 ASEAN	 Power	 Grid	 strengthens	 the	 ties	 among	 ASEAN	 nations,	 TNB	 is	 simultaneously	

increasing	 its	 renewable	 energy	 presence	 in	 the	 ASEAN	markets	 through	 gas	 and	 hydropower	

projects	with	a	target	share	of	360	MW	share	by	2030	and	800	MW	capacity	by	2050.

DECARBONISATION THROUGH INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS : CARBON CAPTURE

TNB	holds	a	stake	in	offshore	wind	turbines	owned	by	Blyth	Offshore	Demonstrator	Ltd	(BODL)	through	its	wholly	
owned	subsidiary,	Vantage	RE	Ltd.

Being	a	prominent	power	utility	player,	we	acknowledge	the	significance	

of	tackling	climate-related	risks	for	business	resilience	and	addressing	the	

interests	of	our	stakeholders.	We	strive	to	minimise	our	carbon	footprint	

as	well	 as	 capitalising	on	decarbonisation	opportunities.	 In	 line	with	our	

net	 zero	 aspiration,	 we	 have	 designed	 a	 holistic	 carbon	 management	

strategy	 that	 focuses	 on	 reducing	 emissions,	 capturing	 emissions	 and	

offsetting	 remaining	 emissions,	 net	 of	 reductions,	 via	 high-quality	 and	

credible	carbon	credits.	

Since	 2011,	 TNB	 has	 been	 extensively	 involved	 in	 research	 and	

development	 (R&D)	 as	well	 as	 innovative	 projects	 to	 uncover	 promising	

initiatives	and	technologies	through	our	research	division,	TNB	Research	

1. Chemical Approach 

	 Our	research	focuses	on	optimisation	of	chemical-based	post	combustion	carbon	capture	process	to	reduce	the	energy	requirement	of	CCU.	We	

have	completed	five	(5)	projects	with	our	chemical-based	R&D	facilities.	

 

	 Through	R&D	at	our	pilot	plants,	we	are	able	to	absorb	90%	of	carbon	emissions	from	coal	fired	power	plant	flue	gas.	Reduction	of	energy	requirement	

was	also	observed	through	the	optimisation	of	capture	process.	We	hold	two	(2)	patents	and	numerous	publications	 in	relation	to	our	completed	

projects.	

Sdn.	Bhd.	While	amplifying	efforts	to	reduce	carbon	emissions,	in	tandem,	

TNB	 has	 recognised	 carbon	 capture	 and	 utilisation	 (CCU)	 as	 a	 critical	

solution	for	the	removal	of	emissions.	TNB	has	made	significant	progress

OUR RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

CLIMATE SCENARIO

Since	2021,	we	have	conducted	climate	scenario	analysis	with	reference	to	the	IPCC	RCP	scenarios	and	Network	of	Central	Banks	and	Supervisors	for	
Greening	the	Financial	System	(NGFS)	scenarios.	TNB’s	climate	change	scenario	analysis	considers	the	following	pathways	:

With	reference	to	the	scenario	pathways	above,	we	have	identified	both	climate-related	transition	and	physical	risks	and	opportunities	and	the	potential	
impact	on	our	business	across	our	operations	over	short-term,	medium-term	and	 long-term	horizon.	Overall,	TNB	will	 have	high	exposure	 to	most	
transition	risks	identified	by	2050	and	this	will	be	addressed	via	TNB's	Strategic	Pillars	to	ensure	TNB	maintains	its	competitive	edge	and	remains	resilient.

TRANSITION RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Transition	risk	refers	to	risks	related	to	the	transition	to	a	low-carbon	economy.	Given	Malaysia's	commitment	to	carbon	neutrality	by	2050,	policy	and	
regulatory	changes	are	expected	to	be	key	drivers	of	decarbonisation.	Due	to	the	nature	of	 long	asset	 life	of	our	utilities,	TNB	 is	exposed	to	the	key	
transition	risks	outlined	below.

WE	ARE	TNB FROM	OUR	LEADERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT

92 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

Based	on	the	physical	risk	assessment	conducted	in	2021,	risks	related	to	flood,	heat,	dry	spells	and	coastal	inundation	presents	the	highest	risk	to	TNB’s	

plants.	Floods	at	dam	catchments	increase	water	storage	in	the	hydropower	dams	and	subsequently	can	lead	to	dam	overflow	and	structure	failure.	On	

the	other	hand,	a	prolonged	dry	spell	will	reduce	the	water	storage	of	dams,	leading	to	insufficient	water	for	operating	hydropower	plants.	Meanwhile,	

both	floods	and	dry	spells	also	affect	the	operation	of	thermal	power	plants.	Dry	spells	will	disrupt	the	cooling	process	of	the	plants,	while	floods	will	affect	

the	infrastructure	at	the	plants.

In	FY2022,	we	delved	deeper	into	the	assessment	of	21	thermal	power	plants	and	12	hydropower	plants	in	Peninsular	Malaysia	against	these	risks	based	

on	the	RCP	6.0	rainfall	projection	and	RCP	8.5	coastal	 inundation	projection	to	comprehend	the	exposure	of	our	power	plants	and	substations	to	the	

effects	of	climate	change.	

With	the	high	exposure	of	our	plants	to	floods,	coastal	 inundation	and	dry	spells,	we	are	guided	by	our	current	adaptation	measures	to	minimise	the	

impact	of	these	risks.	With	the	possibility	of	increased	exposure	and	impact	severity,	we	are	committed	to	improve	our	adaptation	plans.

Our	current	adaptation	measures	include	:	

•	 An	 integrated	 catchment	 management	 policy,	 procedures	 and	 guidelines	 to	

regulate	power	supply	among	the	catchments	during	floods;

•	 Flood	drills	to	improve	the	standard	operating	procedures,	better	manage	critical	

situations	and	safely	restore	the	electricity	supply;

•	 Integrated	Community-Based	Disaster	Management	(ICBDM)	programme;

•	 Prompt	 shutdown	 of	 affected	 substations	 through	 early	 warning	 systems	 to	

avoid/prevent	damages;

•	 Installation	of	protective	measures	around	 the	substations	such	as	flood	walls,	

flood	gates,	flap	gates	and	pumping	systems	to	reduce	the	water	level	inside	the	

substation	area;	and

•	 Raised	heights	of	transmission	towers.

Our	current	adaptation	measures	include	:	

•	 Temporary	 storage	 tanks	 or/and	 alternative	 water	

sources	 (groundwater,	 treated	 saline	 water	 and	

recycled	 brackish	 groundwater	 and	 municipal	

wastewater)	 as	 an	 addition	 to	 the	 existing	 water	

sources	 and	 increasing	 storage	 volumes	 to	 ensure	

ample water supply to thermal power plants at all 

times.

Expansion	 of	 international	 RE	 asset	 is	 a	 top	 priority	

for	 TNB	 as	 a	 growth	 enabler	 that	 will	 help	 our	 business	

thrive	 in	 the	 long-term	 by	 significantly	 ramping	 up	 our	 

RE	 installed	 capacity	 to	 capture	 66%	 of	 capacity	 mix	

by	 2035.	 Our	 New	 Energy	 Division	 (NED)	 is	 positioned	

to	 grow	 RE	 portfolio	 in	 targeted	 international	 markets	

through	strategic	partnerships.	NED	oversees	two	(2)	key	

entities	 responsible	 to	explore	opportunities	at	different	

market	 regions;	 Vantage	 RE	 to	 focus	 on	 UK	 and	 Europe	

markets	and	TNB	Renewables	that	focus	on	the	domestic	

and	 Southeast	 Asia	 market.	 NED	 targets	 to	 achieve	 an	

installed	 capacity	 of	 renewable	 energy	 of	 14.3	 GW	 by	

2050	with	an	estimated	equity	investment	of	RM30	billion.	

Additionally,	 our	 subsidiary,	 Sabah	 Electricity	 Sdn.	 Bhd,	

(SESB)	has	set	a	target	of	110	MW	of	RE	installed	capacity	

by	2025	from	the	current	capacity	of	99.84	MW.	

In	 FY2022,	 Vantage	 RE	 has	 been	 awarded	 the	 

Right-To-Build	 (RTB)	 for	 the	 construction	 and	

commissioning	 of	 102	 MW	 solar	 farms	 in	 the	 UK.	 The	

project	 also	 includes	 an	 option	 to	 develop	 65	 MW	

co-located	 Battery	 Energy	 Storage	 Systems	 (BESS),	

which	 upon	 development	 may	 enhance	 TNB’s	 revenue	

streams through participation in ancillary services 

and	 the	 capacity	 market.	 This	 investment	 represents	

a	 significant	 milestone	 for	 TNB	 as	 it	 broadens	 into	 

RE	 greenfield	 development	 in	 the	 UK.	 The	 solar	 farms	

are	 expected	 to	 achieve	 Commercial	 Operation	 Date	

(COD)	 by	 Q1	 2024	 and	 will	 be	 built	 on	 two	 sites.	 This	

project	 will	 provide	 stable	 long-term	 revenues	 under	 a	 

15-year	 Contract-for-Difference	 (CfD)	 subsidy	 scheme.	

Upon	 its	 commissioning,	 it	 is	 forecasted	 to	 generate	

enough	clean	energy	to	meet	the	equivalent	annual	needs	

of	 over	 37,000	 homes	 and	 save	 over	 46,750	 tonnes	 of	 

CO

sites	also	offer	opportunities	for	environmental	initiatives	

to	 promote	 biodiversity	 net	 gains,	 supporting	 TNB’s	

wider	 biodiversity	 agenda.	 In	 2023,	 we	 will	 broaden	 our	

focus	 beyond	 ASEAN	 and	 explore	 potential	 projects	 in	 

Asia	 Pacific	 and	 Oceania	 to	 pursue	 opportunities	 in	

achieving	out	2025	RE	target.

OUR RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

Reduce Coal Generation Capacity

TNB	 has	 committed	 to	 no	 longer	 investing	 in	 greenfield	 coal	 plants.	 Jimah	 East	 Power	

Plant,	which	was	commissioned	in	2019,	is	the	last	coal	plant	in	our	generation	portfolio	

to	 be	 commissioned.	 The	 existing	 coal-fired	 plants	 will	 be	 phased	 out	 upon	 expiry	 of	

their	 Power	 Purchase	 Agreements	 (PPA),	 with	 consideration	 for	 early	 retirement.	 For	

plants	 retiring	 before	 2030,	 TNB	 has	 planned	 to	 re-power	 them	 using	 natural	 gas.	We	

have	 recently	 received	a	Letter	of	 Intent	 (LOI)	 from	 the	Ministry	of	Natural	Resources,	

Environment	and	Climate	Change	for	the	development	of	2.1	GW	combined-cycle	power	

plant	in	Kapar,	which	is	slated	for	a	commercial	operation	date	by	2031.	Prior	to	that,	we	

have	received	an	LOI	to	repower	the	retired	1,400	MW	Paka	gas	power	plant	with	cleaner	

technology.

Beyond	this,	we	are	exploring	other	solutions	and	technologies	to	enable	low-carbon	fuel	

sources	to	be	deployed	at	coal-fired	power	plants	to	help	us	decarbonise	further.	A	key	

step	we	have	taken	is	a	joint-collaboration	with	PETRONAS	Gas	and	IHI	Corporation	for	a	

feasibility	study	on	ammonia	co-combustion	in	coal-fired	power	generation	systems.	The	

feasibility	study	was	successfully	completed	and	the	outcome	derived	from	pilot-scaled	

combustion	testing	programme	at	TNBR	has	proven	the	feasibility	of	the	technology.	

Carbon Management 

TNB's	Carbon	Management	approach	focuses	on	three	(3)	key	pillars	-	Reduce Emission, 
Carbon Capture and Carbon Offset.	

1) Reduce Emission :	 TNB	 reduces	 emissions	 by	 reducing	 absolute	 emissions	 and	

emission	 intensity,	phasing	out	coal	 capacity,	 increasing	 renewable	energy	capacity	

generation	and	increasing	operational	efficiency	across	the	value	chain.

2) Carbon Capture :	We	have	identified	carbon	capture	and	storage	(CCS)	as	a	solution	

in	 decarbonising	 the	 power	 sector	 and	 we	 are	 committed	 to	 play	 an	 active	 role	

in	 advancing	 this	 technology.	 To	 demonstrate	 our	 commitment,	 TNB	 has	 inked	 a	

Memorandum	of	Understanding	(MoU)	with	PETRONAS	to	explore	the	application	of	

CCS	solutions	in	accordance	with	the	National	Energy	Policy	2022-2040.	In	preparation	

of	Malaysia's	carbon	taxonomy,	our	Universiti	Tenaga	Nasional	(UNITEN)	is	conducting	

a	study	on	carbon	market	opportunities.

3) Carbon Offset :	 Carbon	 credits	 enable	 a	 company	 to	 offset	 a	 portion	 of	 its	 carbon	

emissions.	 TNB's	 stance	 is	 to	 reduce	 and	 capture	 emissions	 before	 looking	 at	

purchasing	 viable,	 high	 quality	 carbon	 credits.	 Additionally,	 TNB	 is	 exploring	 the	

development	 of	 carbon	 credit	 through	 removal	 or	 avoidance	 projects.	 The	 sale	 of	

these	credits	can	then	be	used	to	support	the	energy	transition	at	TNB.

ENERGY TRANSITION PILLAR 2 : GRID OF THE FUTURE 

OUR RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

Smart Grid Enhances Grid Flexibility

TNB	will	 continue	 to	prioritise	 investing	 into	modernising	our	world	 class	national	grid	 into	Grid	

of	 the	 Future	 –	 a	 smart	 grid	which	 remains	 reliable,	 resilient,	 smart	with	 digital	 technology	 and	

flexible	in	meeting	the	country’s	needs	for	energy	transition.	A	smart	grid	is	an	advanced	electricity	

network	that	incorporates	the	use	of	digital	technologies	to	improve	the	efficiency,	reliability	and	

resilience	of	the	grid.	It	allows	for	two-way	communication	between	the	grid	and	Distributed	Energy	

Resources	 (DER),	 as	 well	 as	 real-time	monitoring	 and	 control	 of	 the	 electricity	 flow.	 Expanding	

regional	interconnection	allows	for	a	wider	reallocation	of	RE	resources	that	helps	decarbonise	the	

ASEAN	power	system.

Leveraging	on	the	smart	grid,	DER	can	provide	energy	to	the	grid	during	periods	of	high	demand	and	

absorb	excess	energy	during	periods	of	low	demand.	Also,	this	helps	to	balance	the	grid	and	reduce	

the	need	for	conventional	power	plants	to	ramp	up	or	down	production.	This	enables	the	grid	to	

allow	higher	penetration	rates	of	 intermittent	renewable	energy	sources,	 improve	the	efficiency	

of	energy	consumption	while	maintaining	the	high	performance	of	the	conventional	power	plants.

TNB	 is	 planning	 to	 invest	 a	 total	 of	 RM21	 billion	 capital	 over	 a	 period	 of	 3	 years	 until	 2024	 in	

strengthening	 the	grid	and	ensuring	 reliability	of	energy	supply.	Our	grid	 reliability	performance	

is	 exemplified	 by	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 recovery	 time	 has	 not	 surpassed	 our	most	 recent	 approved	

Guaranteed	Service	Levels	(GSL).

Hydrogen Fuel of the Future

TNB's	strategy	is	to	repower	retired	coal	and	gas	

plants	with	combined-cycle	gas	turbines	(CCGTs)	

equipped	 with	 hydrogen-ready	 technology,	 as	

hydrogen	 is	 regarded	 as	 the	 fuel	 of	 the	 future,	

particularly	 green	 hydrogen	 produced	 from	

renewable	energy	sources.	As	such,	a	sustainable	

and	economically	viable	supply	of	green	hydrogen	

is	 required.	 TNB	will	 undertake	 research	 on	 the	

production	of	green	hydrogen	using	electrolysers	

that	are	more	efficient	in	an	effort	to	reduce	the	

levelised	cost	of	energy	for	green	hydrogen.

In	parallel,	TNB	will	collaborate	with	PETRONAS	to	

develop	the	green	hydrogen	ecosystem	by	2030.	

The	 ecosystem	 includes	 the	 whole	 value	 chain	

from	the	supply	of	green	electricity,	electrolysers,	

compression,	storage	to	transportation.

Energy Storage Provides Security

To	support	the	National	Energy	Policy	2022-2040	

and	Malaysia’s	vision	 to	 include	more	 renewable	

energy	sources	 into	our	generation	mix,	battery	

storage	 plays	 a	 crucial	 role	 in	 our	 nation’s	 grid	

reliability.	By	storing	energy	during	period	of	low	

demand	 and	 releasing	 it	 during	 periods	 of	 high	

demand,	 battery	 storage	 can	 help	 to	 stabilise	

the	grid	and	improve	the	overall	efficiency	of	the	

power	system.	

TNBR	 has	 an	 ongoing	 pilot	 project	 for	 Virtual	

Power	 Plant	 (VPP)	 technology,	 which	 utilises	

software	 and	 energy	 storage	 to	 enable	 

peer-to-peer generation among energy 

prosumers	 and	 demand	 response	 control	 for	

system	 stability	 in	 the	 future.	 TNB	 and	 South	

Korean	 companies	 invested	 USD	 7	 million	 in	

R&D	 on	 this	 project	 in	 order	 to	 better	 regulate	

the supply of electricity from renewable sources 

during	peak	demand	on	the	national	grid.	The	VPP	

project	 involves	 installation	 of	 four	 (4)	 battery	

energy	 storage	 systems	 (BESS)	 with	 a	 total	 of	 

2	MW	capacity.	

CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENT

TNB is partnering with Microsoft Corp to collaborate on discovering and validating potential opportunities through 
a	series	of	projects	over	a	period	of	two	(2)	years,	to	accelerate	digital	transformation	to	support	TNB’s	Grid	of	the	
Future strategic pillar.

The MoU also covers digital skills and development initiatives for TNB employees where technical and digital 
competencies	 in	 using	Microsoft	 tools	 and	 cloud	 services	of	 varying	 complexity	will	 be	 provided	 for	 both	 IT	 and	 
non-IT roles within the Company.

TNB	is	ready	to	lead	Malaysia's	transition	towards	low-carbon	mobility.	Understanding	the	increasing	demand	for	electric	vehicles	and	the	current	state	

of	EV	infrastructure	in	Malaysia,	TNB	aspires	to	play	an	active	role	in	building	charging	infrastructure	within	strategic	locations	and	delivering	the	right	

type	of	charging	facilities	needed.	TNB	has	made	provisions	for	3,300	charging	points	across	the	country	by	2025	and	18,000	charging	points	by	2030.	

TNB	will	be	investing	RM22	million	in	2023	and	RM90	million	in	the	span	of	3	years	(2022-2024)	to	uplift	the	development	of	the	EV	ecosystem	in	Malaysia.	

TNBX	Sdn.	Bhd.	(TNBX)	plays	an	important	role	to	position	TNB	in	the	EV	marketplace	as	the	Charge	Point	Operator	(CPO),	while	Tenaga	Switchgear	

Sdn.	Bhd.	(TSG)	functions	as	a	manufacturer	of	equipment	and	charger	for	TNB	Electron	stations.	In	2023,	we	plan	to	deploy	EV	charging	stations	along	

Peninsular	Malaysia’s	highways	and	trunk	roads	to	enable	seamless	travels	for	Battery	Electric	Vehicle	(BEV)	owners	throughout	Peninsular	Malaysia.	

In	building	up	 the	EV	ecosystem,	we	have	 initiated	strategic	discussions	via	 various	platforms	 to	bring	EV	players	 together	and	collaborate	 towards

Energy Efficiency

TNB	 actively	 assesses	 and	 adopts	 efficient	 technologies	 and	 ensures	

that	 all	 plants	 are	properly	maintained	and	where	possible,	 upgraded	 to	

maintain	their	efficiency.	To	improve	energy	efficiency,	TNB	systematically	

assesses	 and	 adopts	 efficient	 technologies	 whilst	 pursuing	 operational	

excellence	 by	 undertaking	 plant-level	 business	 turnaround,	 improving	

the	overall	production	processes,	ensuring	all	power	plants	are	promptly	

overhauled	 and	 adequately	 maintained	 and	 implementing	 technical	

upgrades,	where	possible.	Increasing	energy	efficiency	enables	our	power	

plants	to	conserve	energy,	allowing	efficient	use	of	the	fuels	we	burn	and	

reduces	 our	 overall	 emission	 intensity.	 TNB's	 aim	 has	 always	 been	 to	

harness	as	much	energy	as	possible	 from	each	unit	of	 fuel	burned.	This	

will	 enable	 us	 to	 minimise	 our	 environmental	 footprint	 and	 fuel	 costs.	

To	 deliver	 a	 sustainable	 low	 carbon	 future,	 we	 have	 been	 modernising	

our	 fleet	 by	 retiring	 inefficient	 and	 ageing	Combined	Cycle	Gas	Turbine	

(CCGT)	plants	and	replacing	them	with	best-in-class	and	highly	efficient	

technologies.	 For	 example,	 our	 newest	 addition	 power	 plant	 that	 was	

commissioned	in	2021,	the	1,440	MW	Sultan	Ibrahim	Power	Plant	in	Pasir	

Gudang	utilises	the	first-of-its-kind	turbine	technology	with	a	net	thermal	

efficiency	of	60%,	thus	contributing	to	a	lower	carbon	footprint.

TNB	is	continuously	growing	and	expanding	its	energy	efficiency	expertise	

including	 conducting	 energy	 audits	 and	 integrating	 energy	 efficiency	

improvements.	This	service	 is	conducted	throughout	TNB’s	assets	such	

as	buildings,	fuel	stations	and	fuel	terminals	and	subsequently	integrates	

energy	efficiency	improvements.

Prosumers

Over	the	years,	through	various	RE	programmes	in	Malaysia,	we	have	seen	

an	 increasing	shift	 from	consumer	 to	prosumer.	An	electricity	prosumer	

refers	 to	 a	 consumer	who	 also	 generates	 their	 own	 electricity,	 typically	

through	the	adoption	of	rooftop	solar.	This	allows	for	a	more	efficient	and	

resilient	energy	system,	as	the	electricity	generated	by	prosumers	can	be	

used	to	meet	the	needs	of	their	own	households	or	businesses,	as	well	as	

to	supply	excess	electricity	to	the	grid	during	times	of	high	demand.	

With	TNB’s	strategic	pillar	of	Grid	of	the	Future,	the	smart	grid	is	expected	

to	be	able	to	support	a	higher	volume	of	bi-directional	power	sources	from	

prosumers’	own	distributed	energy	sources	and	renewable	energy.

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT

TNB	business	 entities	 are	 guided	 by	 the	TNB	Risk	Assessment	 Process	

that	 provides	 a	 structured	 approach	 to	 identify,	 analyse,	 evaluate	 and	

treat	 risks.	 TNB	 business	 entities	 apply	 the	 process	 in	 a	 systematic,	

iterative	and	collaborative	manner,	drawing	on	the	knowledge	and	views	of	

stakeholders	to	develop	their	respective	risk	profiles.	Climate	related	risks	

are	 integrated	 in	 our	 10	 strategic	 risks	 covering	 external,	 sustainability,	

market,	 customer,	 finance,	 capabilities	 and	 regulatory	 risk	 categories.	

Moreover,	 climate-related	 risks	 and	 opportunities	 are	 managed	 in	

accordance	with	the	ISO	14001:2018	Environmental	Management	System.

In	 addition	 to	 the	 above,	 climate	 related	 risks	 and	 opportunities	 are	

assessed	using	 scenario	 analysis,	 across	 short-term,	medium-term	and	

long-term	 horizons	 considering	 the	 expected	 lifetime	 of	 the	 assets	 or	

activities.	

In	managing	the	climate	risks	along	with	other	business	risks,	 the	Board	

Risk	Committee	(BRC)	oversees	the	establishment	and	implementation	of	

the	TNB	Risk	Management	Framework	that	is	embedded	into	the	culture,	

processes	and	structures	of	the	Group	and	is	responsive	to	changes	in	the	

business	environment.	Sustainability	and	climate	risks	are	included	as	part	

of	the	enterprise	risk	management	process.	

Following	the	TNB	Risk	Assessment	Process,	risks	identified	by	business	

entities	are	registered	and	monitored	through	the	TNB	Risk	 Information	

System	(TRIS),	an	online	real-time	tool	and	risk	database	that	is	accessible	

to	 all	 employees.	 Risks	 are	 reviewed	 annually	 by	 business	 entities	 with	

participation	and	eventual	approval	from	the	risk	owners.	

Half-year	 risk	 reports	 are	 submitted	 by	 business	 entities	 to	 the	 Risk	

Management	 Department	 for	 consolidation.	 Group-wide	 consolidated	

half-year	risk	reports,	which	include	reports	of	emerging	risks	and	climate	

related	risks,	are	deliberated	and	endorsed	by	the	Group	Risk	Management	

Working	Committee	(GRMWC)	for	onward	internal	dissemination.

Digital Platform

TNB	 complements	 its	 initiatives	 with	 digital	 platforms	 such	 as	 myTNB	

mobile	 application	 and	 TNBX	 EV	 application.	 These	 technologies	 are	

recognised	as	 the	key	milestone	of	empowering	customers	towards	the	

sustainable	energy	industry	of	the	future.

MINIMISING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

TNB	strives	to	minimise	the	environment	impacts	caused	by	our	business	

operations	and	value	chains,	in	line	with	our	commitment	to	progressively	

improve	our	environmental	performance.

GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The generation of electricity from our thermal plants inevitably leaves 

a	 large	 environmental	 impact,	 in	 the	 form	 of	 carbon	 release,	 water	

consumption	for	power	plants	and	fuel	consumption.	Our	environmental	

management	 is	 principally	 guided	 by	 TNB	 Environmental	 Policy	 which	

was	 reviewed	 in	 FY2021	 to	 reflect	 the	 latest	 changes	 in	 environmental	

requirement	and	emerging	issues.

The	Health,	Safety	and	Environmental	(HSE)	Council	oversees	the	Group's	

environmental	performance	and	compliance.

Six	 (6)	 divisions	 divisions	 in	 TNB	 have	 been	 certified	 ISO	 14001:2015	

compliant	 in	 Environmental	 Management	 System	 (EMS).	 We	 are	 also	

guided	by	TNB’s	Health	Safety	and	Environmental	Management	System	

(HSEMS)	 which	 outlines	 environmental	 risk	 identification	 and	 control	

requirements	 across	 all	 divisions,	 departments	 and	 business	 units	 in	

TNB.	 The	 introduction	 of	 HSEMS	 has	 strengthened	 the	 governance	 of	

environmental	management	across	the	Group.

Since	 2021,	 Guided	 Self-Regulation	 (GSR),	 the	 self-monitoring	

environmental	management	 tool,	has	been	 implemented	across	all	TNB	

divisions	and	subsidiaries.	The	GSR	scoresheet	has	been	analysed	for	gaps	

in	order	to	continuously	enhance	our	operations.

In	 supporting	 our	 Net	 Zero	 by	 2050	 aspiration,	 the	 Grid	 Division	

introduced	its	Grid	Green	Code	Conduct.	The	Green	Code	Conduct	shows	

our	commitment	towards	ESG	that	mirrors	our	efforts	to	create	a	greener	

future.	We	aim	to	lead	as	a	green	responsible	grid	owner	by	reducing	our	

climate	footprint	and	promoting	sustainability	through	the	supply	chain.

Our	 overall	 commitment	 towards	 reducing	 our	 environmental	

impact	 is	 encapsulated	 in	 our	 comprehensive	 environmental	

management	policies	and	guidelines	:

Our Approach and Key Highlights Our Performance in FY2022

Fuel Management

TNB	is	committed	to	ensuring	a	sustainable,	reliable	

and	cost-effective	fuel	supply	and	consumption	for	

power	generation.

In	line	with	SP2050,	TNBF	has	launched	an	in-house	

sustainability framework in December 2022 to be 

the	sustainable	fuel	thought	leader	and	supplier	for	

the	regulated	industry.

In	addition,	we	have	optimised	our	plants	to	ensure	

they	operate	at	optimal	efficiency.	

Fuel consumption from non-renewable sources to power the generation plants are shown 

below.	In	an	effort	to	reduce	coal	capacity,	we	continue	to	explore	the	viability	of	 increasing	

natural gas in our energy mix as a transition fuel while we research the commercialisation of 

green	fuel.	

Energy Management

At	 TNB,	 we	 integrate	 energy	 efficiency	 initiatives	

and	programmes	across	our	buildings.

TNB	 new	 buildings	 including	 Balai	 Islam	 and	 TNB	

Platinum	 campus	 incorporated	 energy	 efficiency	

design	 features	 as	 an	 effort	 to	 reduce	 our	 energy	

consumption.

There	is	a	slight	increase	in	total	energy	consumption	for	FY2022	compared	to	FY2021,	due	to	

increasing	business	operations	and	office	occupancy	post	COVID-19	pandemic.

which	are	 in	compliance	with	regulatory	requirements	

set	by	Department	of	Environment	(DOE).

We continuously improve our waste management 

process	through	site	inspection	and	internal	audit.	

In	 FY2022,	 we	 have	 developed	 our	 E-Waste	

Management	Policy	which	is	enforced	across	all	TNB	

premises.	 All	 electronic	 waste	 categorised	 under	

SW110	will	be	managed	and	disposed	in	accordance	

with	DOE	guidelines.	To	track	our	progress,	we	are	

in	 the	 process	 of	 developing	 an	 online	 reporting

In	 FY2022,	 we	 increased	 our	 efforts	 in	 conserving	
biodiversity	surrounding	our	operation	sites	:	

Nenggiri Hydroelectric Project
•	 TNB	 conducted	 a	 study	 on	 threatened	 flora	

species	 (based	 on	 the	 International	 Union	 for	
Conservation	 of	 Nature's	 (IUCN)	 Red	 List	 of	
Threatened	 Species)	 found	 at	 the	 project	 site	
area.

•	 TNB	has	also	developed	a	Wildlife	Management	
Plan	with	consultation	from	Jabatan	PERHILITAN	
that will outline implementation steps in 
monitoring	and	managing	wildlife.

Sungai Perak Hydroelectric Station – Temenggor 
Dam
•	 TNB	 conducted	 a	 study	 on	 threatened	 flora	

species	 based	 on	 the	 IUCN's	 Red	 List	 of	
Threatened	 Species	 found	 at	 the	 Temenggor	
Dam.

Cameron Highlands – Jor and Ringlet Lakes
•	 TNB	 is	 running	 a	 Pilot	Development	 of	Habitat	

Rehabilitation	 and	 Restoration	 for	 Sediment	
Deposit	Area	in	Cameron	Highlands.	This	project	
is in collaboration with the Pahang State Forestry 
Department	to	rehabilitate	and	restore	dredging	
disposal	sites	at	Jor	and	Ringlet	Lakes.

•	 The	pilot	development	aims	to	 identify	suitable	
tree	species	and	soil	treatment	required,	as	well	
as	 identification	 of	 routine	 practices	 that	 will	
enhance	tree	growth.

Bukit Selambau Large – Scale Solar (LSS) Plant
•	 TNB’s	 study	 to	 manage	 human-macaque	

conflict	 through	 Behavioral	 Ecology	 and	 DNA	
Metabarcoding	has	concluded	in	2022.

•	 The	 results	 of	 the	 study	 has	 allowed	 TNB	 to	
understand	 the	 daily	 activity,	 behaviour	 and	
dietary	requirements	of	the	macaques	which	will	
be	utilised	to	reduce	human-macaque	conflicts.	

Hulu Terengganu Hydroelectric Station
•	 TNB	conducts	annual	assessment	on	changes	in	

aquatic	life	population.
•	 The	 findings	 from	 the	 annual	 assessment	 are	

important	 for	 us	 to	 understand	 and	 evaluate	
impacts from the station’s operation to 
surrounding	aquatic	habitat.

EMPLOYMENT MANAGEMENT AND GROWTH

In	TNB,	our	people	stand	at	the	core	of	our	operations.	Their	efforts	and	

diligence	 in	 contributing	 towards	 TNB’s	 aspirations	 whilst	 upholding	

company	 values	 are	 highly	 appreciated.	 In	 FY2022,	 there	 has	 been	 a	

heightened	 awareness	 in	 operationalising	 the	 sustainability	 agenda	 in	

tandem	with	TNB’s	 journey	to	achieve	net	zero	emissions.	This	 requires	

more	proactive	initiatives	in	building	up	the	needed	talent	and	right	skillset	

for	our	employees.	Numerous	 initiatives	and	measures	have	been	put	 in	

place	to	retain	and	attract	employees.	Along	with	that,	we	aim	to	cultivate	

a	strong	culture	of	diversity,	professionalism,	leadership	and	competency	

in	our	workforce.

CREATING A CONDUCIVE WORKPLACE

In	 the	 countries	 where	 we	 operate,	 we	 comply	 with	 all	 relevant	 labour	

laws	and	we	support	 the	rights	of	 freedom	of	association	and	collective	

bargaining.	 Additionally,	 our	 executive	 and	 non-executive	 employees'	

rights	 are	 well-protected	 through	 our	 unions,	 which	 enable	 us	 to	

provide	 better	working	 conditions.	We	 uphold	 human	 rights	 by	 treating	

all	 employees	 with	 respect	 and	 have	 zero	 tolerance	 for	 discrimination,	

harassment,	or	bigotry,	ensuring	fair	and	humane	treatment	of	everyone.

From	 January	 until	 December	 2022,	 TNB	 conducted	 a	 pilot	 phase	 of	

TNB	 Ways	 of	 Working	 (TWoW),	 which	 involved	 more	 than	 8,500	 people	

from	 selected	 departments	 from	 eight	 (8)	 divisions	 and	 subsidiaries.	

Depending	 on	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 job	 (i.e.,	 field	 force,	 office-based	 or	 

customer-facing),	 a	 suitable	 hybrid	 work	 arrangement	 encompassing	

options	to	Work	In	Office	(WIO),	Work	From	Home	(WFH),	Work	Home	Based	

(WHB).	Three	 (3)	 key	elements	of	TWoW	 implementation	are	flexible	 and	

hybrid	working	location	(WIO	&	WFH),	flexible	and	staggered	working	hours,	

as	well	as	smart	casual	dress	code.	At	the	end	of	the	pilot	programme,	it	was	

approved	 for	 implementation	 throughout	 TNB	 effective	 1	 January	 2023.	

This	aligned	with	TNB’s	timeline	to	implement	flexible	working	throughout	

the	 organisation	 and	 to	 comply	 with	 the	 amendment	 of	 Malaysia's	

Employment	Act	1955	which	begins	in	January	2023.

TALENT RETENTION AND ATTRACTION

At	TNB,	we	value	the	retention	and	attraction	of	good	talent.	To	support	employees	in	working	as	effectively	and	efficiently	as	possible	in	line	with	TNB's	

business	strategic	objectives	and	goals,	we	developed	TNB	Performance	Management	as	an	integrated	and	continuous	approach.	In	promoting	healthy	

and	constructive	relationships	between	immediate	managers	and	subordinates,	performance	discussions	are	mandated	throughout	the	management	

cycle.	Through	 these	discussions,	 employees	 are	 empowered	 to	 constantly	 strive	 for	 improvement,	measure	progress	 and	work	 towards	 achieving	

better	career	progress.

Our	approach	in	managing	and	nurturing	our	human	resources	:

EMPLOYMENT MANAGEMENT AND GROWTH

Approach Key highlights for FY2022

We offer employees a 
competitive benefits 
package to maintain 
employee morale and 
attract and retain talent 

We	have	developed	a	compelling	Employee	Value	Proposition	(EVP)	which	is	a	competitive	remuneration	and	benefit	

package	that	supports	work-life	balance	as	well	as	the	mental	and	physical	health	of	our	employees	that	includes	:

•	 Competitive	benefits	package.

•	 Childcare	facilities	and	nurseries.

•	 Housing	accommodation	and	quarters	for	employees.

•	 Counselling	services.

•	 Sports	and	recreational	facilities.

•	 Career	and	development	opportunities.

•	 Religious	facilities.

•	 The	EVP	Policy	was	established	 in	April	2022	for	all	TNB	employees	and	serves	as	a	guide	and	reference	for	TNB	

subsidiaries	appointed	employees.

Employee engagement 
for open communication 
and sharing of different 
perspectives

•	 We	encourage	two-way	communication	with	our	employees	through	various	engagement	channels.	

•	 Grievance	mechanisms	are	outlined	 in	our	Grievance	policy	which	 is	supported	by	our	Whistleblowing	policy	and	

channels	such	as	the	Whistleblowing	Information	System	(WBIS).	This	serves	as	a	safe	platform	for	employees	to	

channel	their	feedback	and	concerns.

•	 Our	extensive	workforce	is	represented	by	three	(3)	Registered	Unions	and	two	(2)	Workers	Associations	comprising	

both	executives	and	non-executive	employees.	We	have	always	maintained	harmonious	relations	with	the	unions	

and	are	pleased	to	note	that	our	union	leaders	are	actively	involved	in	all	employee	engagement	sessions	such	as	

labs,	syndications,	joint	meetings	and	technical/field	trips.

•	 Through	 our	 biannual	 Employee	 Engagement	 Survey	 (EES)	 and	 Culture	 Barometer,	 we	 are	 able	 to	 gain	 an	

understanding	of	our	strengths	and	areas	for	improvement.	Our	engagement	scores	have	been	improving	across	

all	surveys	conducted.	The	EES	and	Culture	Barometer	conducted	in	December	2022	received	a	score	of	86.6%	in	

comparison	to	the	previous	score	of	85%	in	2021.

•	 In	FY2022,	we	have	maintained	a	 low	 turnover	 rate	of	3.93%	which	 reaffirms	our	exemplary	efforts	 in	employee	

management.

Hiring of gig workers 
(On Demand Free Agents)

•	 TNB	has	started	the	hiring	of	gig	workers,	providing	flexible	short	term	employment	opportunities	since	2018.

•	 TNB	On	Demand	Free	Agent	(ODFA)	guideline	was	developed	to	specify	the	provisions	for	appointment	of	ODFA	in	

TNB.	This	guideline	does	not	apply	to	TNB’s	subsidiaries	but	may	be	used	as	a	reference,	subject	to	their	respective	

terms	and	conditions.

•	 An	ODFA	refers	to	a	free	agent,	freelancer,	or	gigger	hired	by	TNB	on	a	contract	for	service	basis.	The	establishment	

of	this	contract	for	service	is	between	TNB	and	the	respective	appointed	ODFA	individual.

•	 An	appointed	ODFA	is	not	considered	as	an	employee	and	is	therefore	not	covered	under	the	Industrial	Relations	

Act	and	Employee	Act.

Using digital platforms 
to attract talented 
workforce

•	 We	have	conducted	talent	and	workplace	showcase	under	Employee	Branding	strategy	such	as	promotion	through	

social	media	platforms	and	participation	in	industry	awards	events.

•	 We	also	engaged	with	 future	talents	 through	our	postings	on	social	media	via	 Instagram@electrifyingcareers	 to	

showcase	TNB's	initiatives	as	well	as	to	promote	job	openings	to	the	public.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 

Employee	 engagement	 is	 an	 essential	 aspect	 that	 drives	 TNB's	 success.	We	 believe	 that	 engaged	 employees	 are	more	motivated,	 productive	 and	

committed	 to	delivering	 their	 tasks	and	 roles.	They	 feel	 appreciated	and	are	willing	 to	go	 the	extra	mile	 to	perform	their	 job	and	duties,	 resulting	 in	

improved	work	quality,	customer	service,	work	efficiency	and	performance,	as	well	as	a	healthy	work	culture.	Furthermore,	engaged	employees	are	likely	

to	stay	with	the	Company,	reducing	turnover	and	serving	as	TNB's	ambassadors	and	advocates.	Formal	and	informal	engagement	sessions	are	conducted	

across	different	levels	of	employees,	supplemented	by	communication	through	various	print,	social	media	and	audio-visual	channels,	both	online	and	

offline.	

This	year,	we	conducted	TNB	Employee	Engagement	Survey	(EES)	and	Culture	Barometer	as	a	form	of	employee	pulse	check	to	assess	and	measure	the	

awareness,	understanding,	attitude	and	ambassadorship	amongst	our	employees	towards	the	TNB	Identity,	which	consists	of	TNB’s	Purpose,	Aspiration	

and	Core	Values.	This	survey,	which	was	initiated	in	2020,	also	focused	on	measuring	the	extent	of	our	employees'	engagement	with	TNB.	The	survey	

also	served	its	purpose	to	identify	the	efficacy	of	programmes	and	initiatives	that	have	been	organised	to	drive	High	Performance	Culture	in	TNB.	By	

soliciting	feedback	from	the	employees	and	taking	their	suggestions	into	account,	we	aim	to	continuously	foster	a	culture	that	is	more	responsive	to	the	

needs	and	concerns	of	our	employees.	

Following	the	result	of	the	survey,	a	workshop	was	conducted	with	representatives	from	each	division,	department	and	subsidiaries	to	look	for	trends	

and	patterns	in	the	survey	results	and	identify	areas	for	improvements	to	increase	employee	engagement.	Based	on	the	results	of	the	survey	and	the	

areas	identified	for	improvements,	each	representative	is	responsible	to	develop	a	plan	to	address	the	issues	and	enhance	employee	engagement.	The	

plan	is	aligned	together	with	the	initiatives	and	programmes	planned	to	drive	High	Performance	Culture	within	TNB.	Additionally,	constant	follow	up	and	

measure	of	progress	was	done	to	ensure	initiatives	and	programmes	were	executed	accordingly.

In	FY2022,	the	Intervention	Stop	Work	(ISW)	guidelines	was	put	into	effect,	allowing	all	employees	
and	contractors	to	take	responsibility	for	their	safety	and	trigger	a	stop	work	intervention	under	
unsafe	work	conditions.	The	guidelines	mandates	employees	and	contractors	to	identify	unsafe	
work	behaviour,	conditions,	or	activities	that	do	not	follow	existing	compliance	requirements.	

TNB	 introduced	 the	 HSE	 Wallet	 Application	 to	 enable	 easier	 and	 timely	 reporting	 of	 these	
potential	 incidents.	 A	 total	 of	 263,900	 reports	 has	 been	 lodged,	 indicating	 that	 awareness	 on	
employee	safety	and	wellbeing	continues	to	be	taken	seriously.	These	 initiatives	have	received	
positive	reviews	from	our	workforce,	as	 it	has	helped	to	keep	them	safe	throughout	their	 time

PRIORITISING PEOPLE : SAFEGUARDING SAFETY AND WELL-BEING

At	TNB,	we	place	high	importance	in	ensuring	the	safety	of	our	employees	and	providing	them	with	a	safe	working	environment.	This	can	be	seen	clearly	
through	the	improvement	of	our	HSE	performance	in	FY2022,	where	we	successfully	achieved	our	target	of	reducing	LTIF	to	<1.00,	recording	LTIF	of	0.82	
in	FY2022	compared	to	1.03	in	FY2021.	TNB	also	recorded	zero	(0)	employee	fatalities	and	two	(2)	contractor	fatalities	when	conducting	operations	on	
sites	last	year.	This	can	be	attributed	to	the	effectiveness	of	the	many	guidelines,	policies	and	training	undertaken	by	the	Group	HSE	to	safeguard	our	
employees	that	is	in	line	with	our	values	in	ensuring	the	well-being	for	all.

IMPLEMENTING SAFETY CULTURE

We	believe	that	safety	at	our	workplace	goes	beyond	standards	and	policies	and	should	be	embedded	as	a	culture	within	our	organisation.	In	2021,	we	

attained	our	targeted	Proactive	Safety	Culture	Level	whereby	our	Safety	Culture	Assessment	(SCA)	score	was	4.02.	The	assessment	is	due	every	two	

years,	with	the	next	assessment	due	in	year	2023,	holding	the	aim	to	achieve	a	higher	score.

FY2022 Approach Key Highlights

Tenaga Safety Culture We	have	implemented	nine	(9)	Safety	Culture	Values	Activation	&	Spiritual	hour	sessions	in	FY2022	focusing	on	divisions	

and	subsidiaries	that	have	recorded	fatality	cases,	LTIF	more	than	1.0	and	high	numbers	of	compounds	issued	in	the	

previous	year.	This	is	to	instil	and	sustain	the	safety	culture	values	of	Nampak,	Dengar	&	Rasa	Selamat	(NDRS)	in	the	

hearts	and	minds	of	employees	at	all	times.

We	 have	 implemented,	 the	 NDRS	 Awards	 recognition	 program	 i.e	 NDRS	 League	 Awards,	 PI	 Reporting	 Awards,	

Authorised	Person	(AP)	&	Competent	Person	(CP)	Awards	as	well	as	the	Best	Safety	Health	Committee	(SHC)	Awards	to	

recognise	the	efforts	and	contributions	of	our	employees	in	elevating	HSE	performance.	

A	new	initiative	introduced	under	the	NDRS	(Education)	is	the	HSE	Culture	Change	Agent	(HSE	CCA)	programme	which	

was	 launched	by	 the	HSE	Department	of	TGBS	 in	 collaboration	with	TNB	 ILSAS	on	20	 June	2022.	The	objective	of	

implementing	this	programme	is	to	inculcate	the	HSE	culture	among	all	TNB	employees	and	subsidiaries.	The	appointed	

HSE	CCA	will	play	a	role	as	a	liaison	for	interaction	and	communication	of	the	HSE	culture,	monitor	and	evaluate	aspects	

of	safety	 in	the	workplace	and	support	and	encourage	the	 implementation	of	HSE	 initiatives.	A	total	of	51	HSE	CCA	

were	appointed.	A	comprehensive	plan	covering	governance,	engagements	and	promotion,	competency,	rewards	and	

recognition	were	crafted	with	HSE	CCA	to	ensure	the	sustainability	and	expansion	of	this	programme	in	TNB.

FY2022 Approach Key Highlights

Risk Assessment In	 TNB,	 all	 work-related	 hazards	 are	 identified,	 its	 related	 risks	 are	 assessed	 and	 relevant	 controls	 to	 eliminate	
hazards	and	 reduce	 risks	are	determined.	This	 is	performed	throughout	 the	Company	with	 reference	to	 the	Hazard	
Identification,	 Risk	 Assessment	 and	Determining	 Control	 (HIRADC)	 procedure.	 To	 determine	 the	 controls	 required	
to	eliminate	hazards	and	 reduce	 risks,	a	hierarchy	of	controls	such	as	elimination,	substitution,	engineering	control,	
administrative	control	and	Personal	Protective	Equipment	(PPE)	 is	used.	The	effectiveness	of	the	risk	assessment	 is	
reviewed	annually,	or	when	there	are	incidents	and	changes	in	work	processes.	Additionally,	PI	reported	in	the	digital	
platform	also	will	be	assessed	to	alleviate	any	potential	risk.

The	Hazard	Identification,	Risk	Assessment	and	Risk	Control	(HIRARC)	was	developed	based	on	the	HIRARC	Guideline	
from	 Malaysia’s	 Department	 of	 Occupational	 Safety	 and	 Health	 (DOSH).	 Training	 on	 HIRARC	 was	 conducted	
periodically	with	employee	&	employer	representatives.	Gaps	from	these	risk	assessments	were	translated	as	 input	
for	 improvement	 in	 the	 future.	 Additionally,	 any	 industrial	 hygiene	 and	 occupational	 health	 assessments	 like	 the	  
CHRA,	NRA	and	ERA	are	conducted	by	competent	persons	registered	with	DOSH.

These	gaps	from	risk	assessments	are	evaluated	through	the	HSE	management	system	(HSEMS)	audit,	inspection	and	
enforcement	activities.	Gaps	identified	during	the	audit,	inspection	and	enforcement	activities	are	closely	followed	up	
using	NCR	online	system.	All	these	findings	are	presented	in	the	quarterly	DOSH	meetings.

Risk assessments conducted by TNB include conducting :

•	 HSE	Risk	Assessment	(HSERA),	Environmental	Impact	Assessment	(EIA),	Quantitative	Risk	Assessment	(QRA),	Fire	
Risk	Assessment	(FRA)	and	Process	Hazard	Analysis	(PHA)	as	a	standard	procedure.

•	 Chemical	Health	Risk	Assessment	(CHRA)	for	any	work	activities	that	relates	to	hazardous	chemicals.
•	 Noise	Risk	Assessment	(NRA)	to	identify	work	related	activities	with	exposure	to	noise.	
•	 Ergonomic	Risk	Assessment	(ERA)	to	identify	ergonomic	related	risks	at	the	workplace.

Improvements on 
Ergonomic Risk 
Assessment (ERA)

As	we	have	almost	20,000	employees	using	 computers	 as	daily,	HSE	has	developed	an	e-learning	module	on	office	
ergonomics	 in	 the	 TNB	 Learning	 Management	 System	 (LMS)	 to	 educate	 all	 TNB	 office	 workers	 to	 improve	 their	
posture	 when	 using	 computers	 at	 workstations.	 This	 will	 help	 TNB	 staff	 to	 maintain	 good	 physical	 health.	 As	 of	  
31	December	2022,	11,693	TNB	staff	have	completed	the	e-learning	module.	In	order	to	tighten	TNB’s	HSE	standard,	
new	specifications	for	office	workstations	have	been	developed	in	collaboration	with	TNB	Property	Service	Department	
(PSD)	to	ensure	the	new	TNB	Platinum	Campus,	Bangsar	is	provided	with	the	highest	ergonomic	standard	workstation.

Improvements on 
Chemical Health Risk 
Assessment (CHRA)

Completion	and	rolldown	of	Online	Chemical	Register	is	a	best	practised	initiative	in	ensuring	only	approved	chemicals	
are	used	 in	TNB	operations.	Three	 (3)	divisions	 in	TNB	have	been	approved	by	JKKP	Malaysia	 to	 implement	Generic	
Chemical	Health	Risk	Assessment	(CHRA).

Health, Safety and 
Environmental 
Management System 
(HSEMS)

We	are	guided	by	TNB’s	Safety	and	Health	Policy	 to	 implement	our	safety	governance	 framework.	The	TNB	Health,	

Safety	and	Environment	Management	System	 (HSEMS)	has	progressively	been	cascaded	across	divisions	 to	ensure	

standardisation	of	HSE	management	and	governance	across	the	Group.	

Since	the	introduction	of	HSEMS	in	year	2019,	rolldown	to	divisions	and	subsidiaries	are	still	ongoing.	Along	with	that,	

HSE	Corporate	Audit	 has	 been	 conducted	 at	 a	 few	divisions/departments	 to	measure	 compliance	 status	 based	on	

HSEMS	elements.	

The	TNB	Group	HSE	Council,	which	 is	 supported	by	 division-level	HSE	Committees,	 convenes	quarterly	 to	 discuss	

safety	performance,	mitigation	measures	and	the	overall	strategic	direction	for	HSE	management	at	TNB.

Key highlights for FY2022 include :

•	 HSE	Corporate	audit	has	been	conducted	for	TNB	divisions	to	measure	compliance	based	on	HSEMS	elements.

•	 TNB	Stop	Work	Policy	has	been	reviewed	and	endorsed	by	our	CEO	on	30	August	2022.

•	 Three	(3)	TNB	HSE	Council	was	held	quarterly	as	a	form	of	HSE	top	management	review	platform.	The	1st,	2nd	and	3rd 

meeting	was	conducted	on	4	February	2022,	28	April	2022	and	31	October	2022.	

•	 Contractors	 under	 the	 Distribution	 Network	 Division	 are	 required	 to	 provide	 safety	 quality	 assurance	 through	  

self-declaration	of	safety	compliance	before	commencing	work.

Accident reduction 
programmes 

The	TNB	Safety	Information	System	(TSIS)	captures	reports	of	incidents	and	near	misses	which	are	then	investigated	

for	corrective	and	preventive	actions	for	 improvement	to	be	 identified	and	taken.	The	 Intervention	Stop	Work	 (ISW)	

programme	was	developed	to	ensure	our	workers	are	able	to	safely	remove	themselves	from	work	situations	that	they	

believe	could	cause	injury	or	ill	health.

Key highlights for FY2022 include :

•	 Endorsement	of	Intervention	Stop	Work	(ISW)	guideline.	Through	this	guideline,	all	TNB	employees	and	contractors	

can	 rightfully	 issue	 a	 stop	 work	 order	 at	 any	 premise	 or	 workspace,	 given	 that	 any	 unsafe	 behaviour,	 unsafe	

conditions,	or	regulatory	non-compliance	are	detected.	

• Ops Sikap	is	an	initiative	that	has	been	proposed	during	HSE	Lab	2022.	The	purpose	of	implementing	this	initiative	is	

among	the	identified	quick	wins	to	maintain	LTIF	performance	until	the	end	of	2022	by	monitoring	HSE	compliance	

at	work	sites.	In	FY2022,	15	inspections	were	carried	out	and	four	(4)	stop	work	orders	were	issued.	The	results	of	

this	initiative	showed	positive	outcomes	as	the	LTIF	ratings	in	November	2022	stood	at	0.86	and	decreased	to	0.82	

in	December	2022.	HSE	Compliance	among	staff	has	improved	over	time.	However,	there	is	still	a	 lot	of	room	for	

improvement	for	HSE	compliance	by	contractors.	All	staff	and	contractors	are	encouraged	to	continue	practicing	

safe	work	practises	to	reduce	the	risk	of	accidents	at	the	work	site.	

•	 A	 webinar	 on	 Fatigue	 Management	 was	 held	 to	 educate	 staff	 on	 ways	 to	 manage	 fatigue	 and	 work	 stress	 to	

subsequently	improve	their	work	quality.

•	 SUTRa	 (Station	Under	The	Radar)	 is	a	new	 initiative	 introduced	to	assist	business	units,	zones	and	sub-zones	 to	

increase	the	 level	of	compliance	with	 legislation	and	Distribution	Network's	 (DN)	 internal	directives	 towards	 the	

achievement	of	 zero	 fatal	 accidents	 in	DN.	 It	was	carried	out	 in	 key	 locations,	namely	Kelantan	and	Kedah.	This	

initiative	resulted	in	TNB	receiving	no	compounds	or	lawsuits	in	year	2022	in	these	locations.

We	intensified	our	flood	preparations	as	the	country	received	warnings	of	flash	floods	across	the	country	from	the	Department	of	Meteorology.	Since	

July	2022,	we	undertook	efforts	to	reduce	water	levels	in	hydroelectric	dams,	construct	retaining	walls	at	the	entrance	of	main	intake	substations	

and	raise	the	level	of	equipment	platforms	at	identified	flood	prone	areas.	These	steps	will	assist	in	preventing	flood	damage	to	TNB's	operations.	

Machinery	and	assets,	 such	as	mobile	 and	portable	generators,	were	also	put	on	standby	and	 ready	 to	be	deployed	when	needed.	Additionally,	

employees	undergo	flood	response	training	even	before	the	start	of	the	monsoon	season	to	ensure	that	they	are	able	to	handle	unprecedented	

situations	in	case	of	emergency.	Personnel	from	DN	division	were	engaged	as	part	of	the	Security	Emergency	Team	to	provide	round-the-clock	

assistance	to	affected	customers.	

As	flood	levels	rose	in	several	areas	of	Peninsular	Malaysia,	we	took	proactive	measures	to	shut	down	affected	power	substations,	due	to	safety	

considerations.	We	are	saddened	to	report	that	an	incident	involving	electrocution	of	three	(3)	people	occurred	on	19	December	2022.	This	incident	

happened	while	they	were	wading	floodwaters	near	their	house	in	Tumpat,	Kelantan.	Members	of	the	public	are	reminded	to	exercise	caution	to	

avert	electrical	hazards	during	floods	and	report	to	TNB	for	further	action.	We	have	also	published	flood	safety	guidelines	on	our	online	platform	for

EMERGENCY RESPONSE – FLOOD

This	year,	an	isolated	case	of	blackout	caused	by	equipment	failure	in	one	of	our	substations	had	caused	blackouts	in	several	parts	of	the	country.	The	

blackout	occurred	in	July	and	had	affected	our	customers	in	several	areas	of	Klang	Valley,	Negeri	Sembilan,	Penang,	Pahang	and	Johor.	Power	was	

restored	within	20	minutes	from	the	occurrence	of	the	incident.	The	quick	restoration	of	power	supply	proved	that	TNB's	continued	improvement	

of	the	national	grid	supply,	including	our	smart	grid,	is	able	to	overcome	problems	of	power	supply	efficiently.	An	investigation	was	carried	out	by	

Energy	Commission	on	this	incident	and	has	confirmed	that	TNB	was	clear	from	any	misconduct	and	adheres	to	its	best	practices	and	maintenance	

schedule.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE – EQUIPMENT FAILURE

On	18	April	2021,	a	fatality	incident	involving	Distribution	Network	division’s	field	crew	member	occurred	in	Kuala	Lipis,	Pahang.	The	crew	member	

was	electrocuted	while	working	on	an	electric	pole.	The	victim	was	given	emergency	CPR	rescue	until	paramedics	arrived.	The	victim	was	rushed	to	

the	hospital	for	further	treatment	and	passed	away	on	the	same	day.	

Measures	were	quickly	taken	to	ensure	no	reoccurrence	of	a	similar	incident.	whereby	all	DN	division	workers	were	ordered	to	stand	down	by	Chief	

Distribution	Network	Officer	(CDNO).	An	Incident	Alert	report	was	issued	on	the	next	day	together	with	a	stop	work	order	also	issued	for	all	electrical	

work	by	DN	division	nationwide	to	ensure	the	safety	of	workers	while	tools	and	equipment	were	inspected.	

The	incident	case	has	since	been	concluded.	Contributions	from	Tabung	Prihatin	DN	were	channelled	to	the	victim’s	family	by	Head	of	Zone	Asset	

(HoZA)	East	on	29	April	2021	to	assist	the	family.

ENHANCING THE WELL-BEING OF ORANG ASLI COMMUNITIES

As	 part	 of	 TNB’s	 continuous	 goals	 to	 build	 sustainable	 communities,	

we	 have	 launched	 a	 new	 initiative	 to	 provide	 scholarships	 to	Orang	Asli	

children.	 This	 special	 scholarship	 will	 provide	 monetary	 assistance	 to	

help	Orang	Asli	children	from	B40	households	to	further	their	studies	up	

to	tertiary	level.	It	is	also	part	of	TNB’s	commitment	to	improve	the	lives	

of	Orang	Asli	settlement	communities	living	near	TNB	operation	centres.	 

The	 Jabatan	 Kemajuan	 Orang	 Asli	 (JAKOA)	 were	 roped	 in	 to	 propose	

potential	 scholarship	 receivers	 and	 10	 students	 were	 chosen	 to	 be	 

enrolled	 into	 business	 and	 accounting	 programmes	 at	 Diploma	 levels	

in	 UNITEN’s	 Sultan	 Haji	 Ahmad	 Shah	 Campus	 (KSHAS).	 Through	 this	

initiative,	TNB	aspire	to	uplift	the	communities	through	higher	education	

and	open	up	a	more	job	opportunities	in	order	to	deliver	improvement	in	

socioeconomic	levels,	towards	a	better	future.	

In	 addition	 to	 our	 decarbonisation	 initiative,	 Nenggiri	 Hydroelectric	

Project	 (HEP)	 engaged	 the	 local	 communities	 including	 the	 Orang	

Asli	 communities	 residing	 in	 Gua	 Musang,	 Kelantan	 with	 the	 aim	 to	

positively	 impact	 these	 communities	 in	our	operating	 areas.	During	 the	 

development	 phase,	 we	 will	 continue	 to	 ensure	 that	 their	 welfare	 and	 

well-being	 are	 addressed	 within	 our	 best	 capabilities.	 The	 project	 will	

address	several	issues	that	have	been	plaguing	the	area,	such	as	reducing	

the	 impacts	 of	 floods	 in	 the	 state,	 improving	 irrigation	 systems	 and	 

clean	 water	 supply,	 as	 well	 as	 better	 access	 to	 amenities,	 jobs	

and	 entrepreneurial	 opportunities.	 TNB	 continues	 to	 engage	 with	

stakeholders,	 such	 as	 local	 communities	 and	 regulators	 to	 ensure	 their	

interests	and	concerns	are	communicated	and	taken	care	of.	This	project	

will	 also	 align	with	 the	 government’s	 agenda	 of	 increasing	 green	 power

We	strive	to	accelerate	growth	in	local	communities	by	conducting	initiatives	parallel	to	the	needs	of	the	people.	

Rural Electrification (BELB) Programme

TNB,	with	 support	 from	Ministry	 of	 Rural	And	Regional	Development,	 supplies	 power	 to	 rural	

areas	 such	 as	 villages	 and	 Indigenous	People	 settlements	 that	 are	 not	within	 the	operational	

area	of	local	authorities	through	the	Rural	Electrification	Programme	(BELB).	We	connect	these	

villages	 to	our	grid	 lines,	where	possible.	 For	 settlements	 too	 remote	 to	be	connected	 to	our	

grid	lines,	we	utilise	off-grid	alternatives	such	as	solar	hybrids,	generator	sets	and	mini	hydro.	In	

FY2022,	we	have	improved	connectivity	of	around	18	villages.

Sumbangan Komputer Riba Terpakai

This	initiative	was	introduced	to	provide	laptops	and	tablets	to	students	from	low-income	families.	TNB	contributed	RM40,700	for	this	initiative.

Village Street Lighting (LJK) Programme

The	 government	 introduced	 the	 Village	 Street	 Lighting	 (LJK)	 programme	 in	 2002	 with	 the	

purpose	 to	 ensure	 public	 areas	 in	 remote	 villages	 are	well	 lit	 at	 night,	 facilitating	 community	

safety.	Since	2002,	420,696	streetlights	were	successfully	installed.

Pos Kawalan Tempat Kejadian (PKTK) in Lembah Bertam, Cameron Highlands

As	a	contribution	to	the	local	community	of	Lembah	Bertam,	Cameron	Highlands,	TNB	allocated	RM2.58	million	to	construct	a	multipurpose	hall	

that	will	serve	as	a	community	centre	and	emergency	assembly	point	for	the	local	community	during	floods	or	other	natural	disasters.	This	hall	

includes	facilities	such	as	a	covered	futsal	court,	operations	room	and	prayer	room.	The	facility,	which	will	be	managed	by	the	Cameron	Highlands

Home for the Needy

Through	our	Home	for	the	Needy	programme,	we	have	helped	refurbish	and	build	new	homes	

for	 40	 families,	 mainly	 B40	 communities	 and	 hardcore	 poor	 including	 single	 parents,	 senior	

citizens	and	differently-able	 individuals.	 In	 FY2022,	we	spent	RM1.26	million	on	 this	 initiative.	

This	programme	is	carried	out	under	two	(2)	concurrent	projects	namely	Program	Baiti	Jannati	

(PBJ)	and	Program	Mesra	Rakyat	(PMR).	To	date,	we	have	contributed	more	than	RM31.11	million

WE	ARE	TNB FROM	OUR	LEADERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY	STATEMENT

160 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present 
the Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement for 
2022. 
Together with our Corporate Governance 
Report,	 which	 is	 available	 on	 our	 corporate	
website,	 these	 statements	 explain	 how	 we	 as	
a	 Board	 have	 assessed	 the	 Group's	 operating	
environment	 and	 taken	 informed	 decisions	 to	
secure	 a	 sustainable	 and	 leading	 position	 on	
behalf	of	our	key	stakeholders,	all	underpinned	
by	 a	 long-standing	 and	 deeply	 embedded	
commitment	 to	 high	 standards	 of	 corporate	
governance.	 The	 strength	 of	 the	 Board’s	
leadership	is	assessed	through	the	clarity	of	the	
actions	we	 take	and	 transparency	surrounding	
the	 standards,	 processes	 and	 culture	 we	
ultimately	set.	

ENGAGING AND RECONNECTING

Throughout	 the	 pandemic,	 virtual	 channels	
worked	 well	 and	 are	 continued	 to	 be	 used	 in	
the	 Company	 as	 we	 responded	 to	 employee	
feedback	on	the	benefits	of	our	hybrid	approach	
to	work,	enabled	by	technology.	

We	 have	 resumed	 hybrid	 meetings	 for	 the	
Board	 in	2022	and	for	many	of	our	shareholder	
engagements.	 The	 2023	 Annual	 General	
Meeting	 (AGM)	 will	 be	 held	 virtually	 and	 I	 look	
forward	to	meeting	those	of	you	who	are	able	to	
attend	and	answering	questions	 from	those	of	
you	who	join	us	virtually.	

The	 Board	 takes	 very	 seriously	 the	 views	
of	 employees,	 shareholders	 and	 wider	
stakeholders	 to	 ensure	 we	 are	 pursuing	
actions that are acceptable to those we work 
with.	 This	 is	 evidenced	 across	 this	 Integrated	
Annual	Report	–	the	network	in	which	we	gather	
relevant	insights	is	extensive.	At	Board	level,	we	
enhance	 our	 understanding	 of	 views	 through	
work	which	complements	the	daily	contact	our	
businesses	have.	

The	 Board	 agenda	 further	 includes	 a	
stakeholder	 assessment	 of	 our	 strategy,	 an	
annual	 update	 on	 supply	 chains,	 confirmation	
of	sustainability	priorities	and	an	annual	report	
of	 key	 stakeholder	 work.	 Specifically,	 in	 2022,	
we	considered	the	development	of	our	Energy	
Transition	Plan,	 the	Board	of	Directors'	 Fit	 and	

Proper	 Policy	 and	 the	 wider	 issue	 of	 energy	
affordability,	to	name	just	a	few	examples.	

DRIVING SUSTAINABILITY 

Our	commitment	to	Environmental,	Social	and	
Governance	 (ESG),	 on	 which	 there	 has	 been	
considerable	focus	during	the	year,	continues	to	
be	central	to	the	way	we	operate.	 In	particular,	
ESG	 targets	 are	 now	 included	 as	 a	 measure	
within our performance targets by way of an 
ESG	scorecard.	We	have	endeavoured	to	further	
enhance	our	reporting	in	this	area	and	have	now	
aligned	our	reporting	with	the	Global	Reporting	
Initiative	 (GRI)	 index	 in	 addition	 to	 the	 Task	
Force	on	Climate-related	Financial	Disclosures	
(TCFD)	 recommendations.	 Further	 details	 of	
the	 Company’s	 approach	 to	 ESG	 and	 activity	
during	the	year	are	included	in	the	section	of	this	
report	 entitled	 “Sustainability	 Statement”	 on	
pages	65-136	and	in	our	separate	Sustainability	
Report.	

EFFECTIVENESS 

As	 Chairman,	 I	 am	 responsible	 for	 providing	
leadership	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 Board	 operates	
effectively.	 I	 have	 been	 supported	 in	 this	 by	
all	 the	 Directors.	 The	 annual	 reviews	 of	 Board	
effectiveness	 help	 the	 Board	 to	 consider	 how	
it	 operates	 and	 how	 its	 operations	 can	 be	
improved.	This	year,	the	review	was	undertaken	
internally	 and	 the	 findings	 of	 this	 review	 have	
provided	 us	 with	 ideas	 to	 further	 improve	
the	 manner	 in	 which	 the	 Board	 operates.	
This	 review,	 together	 with	 progress	 against	
recommendations	from	evaluations	undertaken	
in	2021,	are	set	out	on	page	178.	

BOARD CHANGES 

The	 Board	 continuously	 seeks	 to	 ensure	 it	
has	 an	 appropriate	 mix	 of	 diversity,	 skills,	
experience	 and	 expertise	 to	 enable	 it	 to	
discharge	 its	 responsibilities	 effectively	 and	
to	 be	 well	 equipped	 in	 assisting	 the	 Company	
in	 navigating	 the	 range	 of	 opportunities	 and	
challenges	ahead.	

In	 view	 of	 the	 need	 to	 ensure	 that	 there	 are	
proper processes to manage succession issues 
at	 the	 Board	 level,	 an	 appropriate	 process	 for	
the	 selection,	 nomination	 and	 appointment	 of	
suitable	 candidates	 to	 the	Board	has	been	put	
in	place.	

The	 Board	 Nomination	 and	 Remuneration	
Committee	 (BNRC)	 is	 entrusted	 with	 the	

responsibility	 of	 assessing	 and	 considering	
the	 capabilities,	 commitment	 and	 qualities	
of	 candidates	 to	 be	 appointed	 as	 Board	
Members	 and	 Committee	 Members,	 taking	
into	 account	 the	 diversity,	 required	 mix	 of	
skills,	 fit	 and	 proper	 assessment,	 background,	 
experience/expertise/knowledge	 relevant	 to	
the	Company’s	business,	existing	commitment	
and	 potential	 conflict	 of	 interest	 prior	 to	
recommending	candidates	to	the	Board.	

The	 Board	 may	 appoint	 a	 new	 Director	
either	 to	 fill	 a	 casual	 vacancy	 or	 to	 add	 to	 the	
existing	 Directors.	 The	 Minister	 of	 Finance	
(Incorporated)	 (MoF	 Inc.),	 being	 the	 Special	
Shareholder	 of	 TNB,	 possesses	 the	 right	 to	
appoint	up	to	six	 (6)	Directors.	The	Company’s	
Constitution	provides	 that	 the	Company	must	
have	 at	 least	 two	 (2)	 Directors	 but	 not	 more	
than	12	Directors.	

Currently,	 there	 are	 11	 members	 on	 the	
Board,	 excluding	 the	 Alternate	 Director;	 one	
(1)	 Executive	 Director	 and	 10	 Non-Executive	
Directors,	 six	 (6)	 of	 whom	 are	 Independent	
Directors.	

These	Independent	Directors	are	considered	by	
the	 Board	 to	 be	 independent	 of	 Management	
and	 free	 of	 any	 business	 or	 other	 relationship	
or	circumstance	that	could	materially	 interfere	
with	 the	 exercise	 of	 objective,	 unfettered	
or	 independent	 judgement.	 The	 Board	 has	
continued	 to	 reshape	 its	membership	 through	
the	 right	 balance	of	 experience,	 expertise	 and	
fresh	thinking.	

To	 date,	 there	 are	 several	 movements	
of	 the	 Board.	 The	 Board	 welcomed	 
Dato'	 Abdul	 Razak	 bin	 Abdul	 Majid	 who	 was	
appointed	 as	 Chairman/Non-Independent	
Non-Executive	Director,	 with	 the	 concurrence	
of	 MoF	 Inc.,	 with	 effect	 from	 27	 March	 2023	
in	 place	 of	 Dato’	 Sri	 Hasan	 bin	 Arifin	 who	 had	
ceased	office	with	effect	from	1	January	2023.	

With	 36	 years	 of	 working	 experience	 in	 TNB,	
his	 understanding	 and	 knowledge	 of	 the	
Company’s	 operations	 and	 the	 industry	 will	
facilitate	 effective	 decision-making	 by	 the	
Board.	 Further	 to	 that,	 his	 qualifications	 and	
experience	 fills	 the	 gap	 identified	 through	 the	
Board	 Skills	 Matrix,	 of	 having	 a	 Director	 with	
technical	experience	on	the	Board.	His	extensive	
knowledge,	 experience	 and	 reputation	 in	 the	 
energy-related	 industry	 is	 incomparable	 and	
the	Board	believes	that	he	will	not	only	continue	
the	 great	 work	 of	 his	 predecessors	 but	 also

transparency	 and	 accountability.	His	wealth	 of

initiatives	of	the	TNB	Energy	Transition	Plan.

Prior	 to	 that,	 the	 Board	 on	 20	 March	 2023	
approved	 the	 appointment	 of	 Rohaya	 binti	
Mohammad	 Yusof	 as	 a	 Non-Independent	 
Non-Executive	 Director,	 representing	 the	
Employees	 Provident	 Fund	 (EPF),	 a	 major	
shareholder	of	TNB.	

She	 is	the	Chief	 Investment	Officer	of	EPF	and	
has a wealth of experience in areas of corporate 
finance,	 investment	 banking,	 capital	 markets	
and	private	markets,	both	domestic	and	global.	
She	 is	 an	 Associate	Member	 of	 CPA,	 Australia	
and	also	sits	on	the	boards	of	Malaysia	Airports	
Holdings	 Berhad,	 United	 Plantations	 Berhad	
and	Yinson	Holdings	Berhad.

The	 Board	 on	 10	 April	 2023	 had	 approved	 on	
the	appointment	of	Datin	Rashidah	binti	Mohd	
Sies,	 with	 the	 concurrence	 of	 MoF	 Inc.	 as	 
Non-Independent	 Non-Executive	 Director	 of	
TNB.	 She	 is	 the	 Deputy	 Secretary	 General	 of	
Treasury	(Management)	Ministry	of	Finance.	

The	 cessation	 of	 office	 of	 Datuk	 Seri	 Asri	
bin	 Hamidin	 @	 Hamidon	 as	 an	 Appointed	 
Director/Non-Independent	 Non-Executive	
Director	 of	 TNB	 took	 effect	 from	 5	 January	
2023.	 Concurrently,	 he	 also	 ceased	 as	 the	
Chairman	 of	 Board	 Tender	 Committee	 (BTC)	
and	 a	 member	 of	 the	 BNRC	 and	 Board	 Long	
Term	 Incentive	 Plan	 Committee	 (BLTIP)	 on	
the	 same	 day.	 Faisal	 @	 Pisal	 bin	 Abdul	 Ghani,	
his	 Alternate	 Director,	 had	 ceased	 office	 in	
accordance	with	Clause	61(2)	of	the	Company’s	
Constitution	with	effect	from	5	January	2023.	

In	 addition	 to	 the	 above,	Datuk	Lau	Beng	Wei,	
an	 Independent	 Non-Executive	 Director,	 had	
resigned	with	effect	from	6	March	2023.

The	 Board	 of	 Directors	 of	 TNB	 would	 like	 to	
express its appreciation to Dato’ Sri Hasan bin 
Arifin,	Datuk	Seri	Asri	bin	Hamidin	@	Hamidon,	
Datuk	 Lau	 Beng	 Wei	 and	 Faisal	 @	 Pisal	 bin	
Abdul	Ghani	for	their	contribution	and	services	
rendered	to	the	Company	during	their	tenure	as	
Company	Directors.	With	deep	regret	we	report	
the	 demise	 of	 Dato’	 Ir.	 Nawawi	 bin	 Ahmad,	
an	 Independent	 Non-Executive	 Director,	 on	
28	 November	 2022.	 The	 Board	 of	 Directors	
expresses	 its	 gratitude	 and	 appreciation	 for	
the	guidance	and	contribution	given	by	the	late	
Dato’	Ir.	Nawawi	bin	Ahmad	to	the	Board	during	

DATO’ ABDUL RAZAK BIN ABDUL MAJID 
Chairman

his	tenure	as	a	Director.	He	was	the	Chairman	of	
Board	Integrity	Committee	(BIC)	and	Member	of	
BTC,	BNRC	and	BLTIP.	His	stewardship,	integrity	
and	wisdom	will	be	deeply	missed.	

The	 Board	 fulfils	 Practice	 5.2	 of	 the	Malaysian	
Code	 of	 Corporate	 Governance	 2021	 (MCCG)	
for Large Companies having a majority of 
Independent	 Directors,	 with	 the	 number	
exceeding	 the	 minimum	 requirement	 as	
prescribed	 by	 the	 Main	 Market	 Listing	
Requirements	 of	 Bursa	 Malaysia	 Securities	
Berhad	(MMLR).	

The	 Board/BNRC	 continuously	 reviews	 the	
Board	Skills	Matrix,	which	serves	to	identify	the	
skills,	 knowledge,	 experience	 and	 capabilities	
desired	of	 the	Board	to	enable	 it	 to	meet	both	
current	and	future	challenges	to	the	Company.	
It	 reflects	 the	 appropriate	 mix	 of	 skills,	
expertise	 and	 experience	 required	 to	 address	
existing	and	emerging	business	and	governance	
issues,	to	enable	Directors	to	effectively	review	
Management’s	performance.	

The	 Board	 approved	 the	 BNRC’s	
recommendation	 that	 in	 order	 to	 strengthen	
the	 Board’s	 composition	 to	 be	more	 dynamic,	
the	 skills	 and	 gaps	 that	 have	 been	 identified	
as	 critical	 and	 need	 to	 be	 filled	 are	 technical	
experience,	 international	 business	 experience	
and	customer	centricity.	The	Board	agreed	that	
all	Directors	appointed	during	the	Financial	Year	
under	review	had	met	the	required	skills.	

The	 Board	 believes	 that	 it	 presently	 has	 an	
appropriate	 balance	 of	 skills,	 experience,	
knowledge	 and	 independence	 to	 deliver	 the	
Group’s	strategy,	to	enable	the	Non-Executive	
Directors	 to	 effectively	 challenge	 the	 views	 of	
Management	and	to	satisfy	the	requirements	of	
good	governance.	

DIVERSITY 

The	 Board	 is	 committed	 in	 ensuring	 the	
diversity	of	the	Company’s	senior	management	
and	 annually	 reviews	 its	 recommendations	
on	 diversity	 for	 senior	 management	 roles.	
It	 recognises	 that	 there	 is	 more	 to	 do,	 not	
just	 at	 the	 Board	 level,	 but	 also	 at	 the	 Senior	
Leadership	level.	

While	the	women	representation	on	the	Board	
had	increased,	culminating,	to	date,	with	six	(6)	
members	of	the	Board	or	55%,	we	recognise	we	
still	 have	more	 to	 do,	 not	 least	with	 regard	 to	
other	areas	of	diversity	at	the	Board	level.	

Women	now	comprise	21%	of	the	organisation.	
While	 our	 gender	 balance	 differs	 based	 on	
specific	 roles,	 geographies	 and	 bands,	 we	 are	
pleased	 that	 female	 representation	 in	 our	
leadership	 has	 increased	 to	 26%	 compared	 to	
21%	in	the	previous	Financial	Year.	

While	 good	 progress	 is	 being	 made	 across	
the	 Group	 in	 many	 aspects	 of	 diversity	 and	
inclusion,	 sustainable	 change	 requires	 a	 
long-term	 perspective	 and	 this	 continues	 to	
be	 a	 key	 focus	 for	 the	 Company.	 The	 Board	
will	continue	to	address	diversity	and	 inclusion	
when	considering	refreshment	of	the	Board.	

FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE 

In	 August	 2021,	 the	 Group	 announced	 its	 net	
zero	 ambitions,	 representing	 the	 optimum	
growth	 pathway	 identified	 by	 the	 Board	 to	
capitalise on the opportunities across the 
value	 chain	 in	 which	 TNB	 participates.	 In	 all	
our	 deliberations,	 we	 focused	 on	 long-term	
success,	 financial	 resilience	 and	 shareholder	
value	 and	 ensured	 thorough	 debate	 based	 on	
robust inputs which capture all of the available 
information.	

The	Board	Committees'	support	has	been	strong	
and	 provided	 in	 multiple	 ways.	 The	 BNRC	 has	
overseen	 proposed	 updates	 to	 Remuneration	
Policy	 to	 align	 with	 our	 growth	 ambitions,	 in	
addition	 to	 championing	 talent	 and	 capability	
across	 our	most	 important	 asset,	 people.	 The	
Board	 Risk	 Committee	 (BRC)	 has	 monitored	
the	 development	 of	 our	 risk	 and	 opportunity	
reporting	 under	 the	 TCFD	 framework.	 As	
indicated	last	year,	the	Sustainability	and	Energy	
Transition	Council	 (SETC)	has	progressed	in	 its	
ESG	 role,	 deepening	 its	 focus	on	performance	
across	 ESG	 indices	 and	 reviewing	 climate	
resilience	and	adaptation	plans.

LOOKING FORWARD 

The	 Board	 will	 continue	 to	 focus	 on	 the	 key	
issues,	 challenge	 the	 Group’s	 leadership	 and	
collectively	seek	to	make	informed	decisions.	In	
an	ever-changing	world,	we	pledge	to	you	that	
whatever	lies	ahead,	we	have	the	best	interests	
of	 the	 Company,	 its	 customers	 and	 its	 people	
central	to	our	deliberations.

WE	ARE	TNB FROM	OUR	LEADERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY	STATEMENT

164 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

PRINCIPLE A : 
BOARD LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 

A	 strong	 sustainability	 governance	 and	 leadership	 structure	 are	 vital	

to	 spearhead	 our	 sustainability	 agenda	 and	 provide	 us	 with	 clear	 and	

definitive	guidance	to	achieve	our	net	zero	aspirations.	Our	sustainability	

governance	 is	 an	 expansion	 of	 TNB’s	Governance	Model	 that	 is	 aligned	

with	the	principles	of	the	MCCG.

We believe that a robust sustainability governance framework 

underpinned	 by	 a	 supportive	 leadership	 structure	 are	 key	 components	

to	 ensure	 our	 sustainability	 agenda	 can	 be	 materialised	 through	

informative	 and	 comprehensive	 decision-making.	 Our	 sustainability	

governance	 is	 an	 essential	 part	 of	 TNB	 Group	 Governance	 Platform,	

which	 is	 the	 framework	 of	 TNB	 management	 committees	 and	 

subcommittees.

Our	sustainability	governance	framework	was	reformed	in	Financial	Year	 

(FY)	 2022	 through	 the	 formation	 of	 the	 Sustainability	 and	 Energy	

Transition	 Council	 (SETC),	 with	 the	 objective	 of	 deliberating	

on	 energy	 transition	 initiatives	 to	 coordinate	 and	 oversee	

TNB's	 Energy	 Transition	 Plan	 and	 providing	 a	 platform	 for	

discussion	 on	 the	 sustainability	 agenda,	 development	 and	

implementation.	 This	 includes	 the	 energy	 transition	 direction	 and	 

climate-related	matters.	The	SETC	has	combined	the	roles	of	the	former	

Sustainability	 Development	 Council	 (SDC)	 and	 the	 former	 TNB	 Energy	

Transition	Steering	Committee	(TEXC).

SETC	key	roles	include	:

•	 Determining	 sustainability	 visions,	 targets	 and	 commitments	 that	

align	 with	 and	 support	 TNB's	 overarching	 sustainability	 pillars	 as	

well	 as	 coordinating	and	 integrating	 the	organisation's	 sustainability	

commitments.

•	 Proactively	 addressing	 sustainability	 challenges,	 including	 

climate-related	matters,	faced	by	the	organisation.

•	 Influencing	sustainability	outcomes	in	the	areas	of	ESG	by	creating	a	

framework,	disclosing	 information	and	 implementing	policies	related	

to	climate-related	matters.

•	 Communicating	with	internal	and	external	parties,	including	the	Board,	

investors,	 financiers,	 insurers,	 regulators	 and	 the	 government	 on	

sustainability	matters.

•	 Establishing	 Energy	 Transition	 related	 programmes	 and	 their	 goals	

and	objectives	and	shaping	energy	transition	outcomes	that	align	with	

TNB's	corporate	strategy,	fostering	growth	and	creating	value	for	the	

organisation.

The	SETC	meeting	 is	conducted	monthly,	chaired	by	the	President/CEO	 

and	 composed	 of	 TNB's	 corporate	 senior	 management	 team.	 They	

then	 escalate	 the	Group's	 strategic	 direction	 for	 sustainability	 to	 other	

committees	 and/or	 the	 Board	 of	 Directors	 for	 approval.	 The	 Board	

establishes	the	direction	for	incorporating	sustainability	into	the	strategic	

direction,	 operational	 performance	 of	 the	 organisation	with	 the	 goal	 of	

developing	and	preserving	shareholder	value.	

Our Sustainability Governance Structure

REMUNERATION POLICIES 

The	 Board,	 with	 the	 assistance	 of	 the	 BNRC,	 reviews	 the	 overall	 

remuneration	 policy	 for	 Non-Executive	 Directors,	 Executive	 Directors	

and	 Top	 Management.	 The	 policy	 aims	 to	 attract,	 retain	 and	 motivate	

executives	and	Directors	who	will	create	sustainable	value	and	generate	

returns	 for	 the	 Company.	 The	 remuneration	 package	 is	 structured	 to	

link	 rewards	 to	 corporate	 and	 individual	 performance,	 reflecting	 the	

contributions	towards	the	Group’s	achievements	for	the	year.	

To	 ensure	 accountability	 from	 all	 management	 levels	 and	 to	 steer	 the	

Group's	 sustainability	 performance,	 performance	 objectives	 relating	 to	

sustainability,	including	ESG	rating,	health	and	safety	measures,	integrity

RISK MANAGEMENT

Approved	 by	 the	BRC	 in	 FY2019,	 our	 Risk	Management	 Framework	was	 developed	 in	 line	with	 ISO	31000:2018	Risk	Management	 –	Guidelines.	 The	

purpose	is	to	provide	a	structured	and	consistent	approach	to	risk	management,	comprising	the	assessment	of	sustainability-related	risks	for	informed	

decision-making.	

Our	risk	management	and	internal	control	systems	are	designed	to	manage	risks	within	acceptable	levels	as	opposed	to	eliminate	risks.	We	regularly	

review	 our	 risks	 to	 ensure	 their	 relevance	 to	 the	 Group.	 The	 Board	 and	 Management	 also	 review	 and	 approve	 policies,	 codes	 and	 procedures	 to	

consistently	enhance	risk	mitigation.

UPHOLDING A STRONG SENSE OF INTEGRITY

At	TNB	Group,	we	maintain	high	standards	of	integrity	and	go	beyond	compliance	to	establish	a	culture	of	excellence	and	integrity,	which	is	ingrained	as	

a	Core	Value	in	our	TNB	Reimagining	Culture	initiative.

Key	highlights	and	initiatives	for	FY2022	:

Key Activities Description

Zero-tolerance rule

The	zero-tolerance	rule	towards	bribery	and	corruption	was	maintained.	Avenue	to	report	suspicious	and	unethical	conduct	is	outlined	in	our	

Whistleblowing	Policy.

TNB’s Risk Management Framework

Our	Risk	Management	Framework	 is	 in	 line	with	 ISO	31000:2018	Risk	Management	–	Guidelines	and	provides	a	 structured	approach	 to	 risk	

management,	comprising	the	assessment	of	sustainability-related	risks	for	informed	decision-making.

TNB Corporate Integrity Management System (TCIMS) and Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) Implementation (ISO 37001 Certified)

1.	We	conducted	10	Fraud	and	Bribery	Workshops.

2.	We	conducted	four	(4)	sessions	of	Internal	Auditors	Training.

3.	A	series	of	consultation	sessions	on	ABMS	and	TCIMS	was	held	for	TNB’s	subsidiaries.

4.	ILSAS	was	certified	with	ISO	37001	by	SIRIM	in	2022.

5.	The	Retail	Division	maintained	its	ISO	37001	certification.

Three (3) Integrity Mandatory Requirements

All	employees	are	required	to	sign	the	Integrity	Pledge,	declare	any	conflicts	of	 interest	and	complete	the	Integrity	E-Learning	Module	on	an 

annual	basis.	

Collaboration with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC)

On	4	October	2022,	we	signed	a	Memorandum	of	Understanding	(MoU)	with	the	MACC	to	enhance	our	bilateral	cooperation.	 In	addition,	we	

also	pledged	to	uphold	ethical	standards	by	signing	the	Corruption	Free	Pledge	(Ikrar Bebas Rasuah)	with	MACC	at	our	headquarters,	which	was	

followed	by	similar	ceremonies	in	seven	(7)	other	states.

Moving	 forward,	 we	 intend	 to	 introduce	 our	 Code	 of	 Business	 Ethics	 (COBE)	 and	 Organisational	 Anti-Corruption	 Plan.	 To	 further	 reinforce	 the	

institutionalisation	of	 integrity	 in	TNB,	our	Management	has	 incorporated	 the	 Integrity	Health	 Index	 (IHI)	as	part	of	 its	Key	Performance	 Indicator	 in	

FY2022.

TNB Integrity Health Index

In	 FY2022,	we	 conducted	 an	 internal	 survey	 to	 evaluate	TNB’s	 integrity	 practices,	which	 saw	a	 high	 level	 of	 participation	 from	19,989	 staff	

members.	The	results	of	the	survey	were	impressive,	with	TNB	achieving	a	score	of	79.36%,	indicating	that	the	organisation	is	committed	to	

maintaining	the	highest	ethical	standards	in	its	operations.	The	score	reflects	the	effectiveness	of	TNB's	policies	and	practices	in	promoting	

ethical	behaviour	and	ensuring	compliance	with	regulations	and	standards.

Integrity Engagement Programme (IEP)
We	collaborated	with	MACC	in	2022	to	conduct	six	(6)	sessions	of	Anti-Corruption	Programmes	and	activities.	As	part	of	our	efforts	to	combat	

corruption,	TNB	established	a	comprehensive	Training	and	Communication	Plan	(TCP)	that	includes	18	activities.

BOARD LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS

GOVERNANCE

The	 Board	 is	 committed	 to	 strategically	 integrating	
sustainability	 across	 TNB’s	 business	 and	 advancing	 our	
sustainability	efforts,	including	climate	action.	TNB’s	Board	
will	 deliberate	 and	 approve	 the	 sustainability	 strategy	
and	 pathway,	 while	 also	 overseeing	 TNB's	 sustainability	
implementation	 and	 performance.	 This	 will	 include	 the	
materiality	 assessment,	 the	 scenario	 analysis	 study	 and	
Sustainability	Pathway	(SP)	2050.	SETC	and	the	respective	
Management Committees are responsible for managing 
sustainability	 and	 climate	 risks	 and	 opportunities,	 as	
well	 as	monitoring	 the	performance	of	 related	 initiatives	
rolled	 out	 by	TNB,	with	 oversight	 from	 the	 Board.	 TNB’s	
Sustainability	 Governance	 outlines	 clear	 roles	 and	
responsibilities	 in	 relation	 to	 sustainability	 and	 climate	
action	for	each	level	of	leadership.

The	BRC	oversees	the	establishment	and	implementation	
of	 the	 risk	management	 framework	 that	 is	 embedded	 in	
the	 culture,	 processes	 and	 structures	 of	 the	 Group	 and	
is	 responsive	 to	 changes	 in	 the	 business	 environment.	
Sustainability	and	climate	risks	are	included	as	part	of	the	
enterprise	risk	management	process.

The	principles	to	guide	climate	action,	particularly	on	GHG	
emissions,	 are	 covered	 under	 our	 Environmental	 Policy,	
Environmental	 Management	 System	 and	 Sustainability	
Energy	 Management	 (SEM)	 Framework	 based	 on	 the	 
ISO	 50001:2011	 Energy	 Management	 System,	 ASEAN

OPERATIONS OF THE BOARD

Prior	 to	 each	 Board	meeting,	 the	 Board	 receives	 the	Chairman	 Reports	 of	 each	 Board	
Committee	on	their	deliberations	and	recommendations	for	each	meeting.	This	ensures	
that	 each	 Director	 is	 informed	 of	 the	 decisions	made,	 including	 the	 views	 raised.	 The	
Chairman	 of	 each	 Board	 Committee	 then	 tables	 to	 the	 Board	 its	 report	 and	 present	
the	 Committee’s	 recommendation	 for	 the	 Board’s	 approval	 accordingly.	 This	 permits	
the	Board	 to	express	 its	views	on	all	deliberations	of	 the	Committees.	All	deliberations	
and	 recommendations	must	 be	minuted	 and	 approved	 by	 each	 Board	 Committee	 and	
confirmed	by	the	Chairman	at	their	respective	Board	Committee	meetings.

Under	the	guidance	of	the	Chairman,	all	matters	placed	before	the	Board	are	discussed	
openly.	Presentations	and	advice	are	received	frequently	from	Senior	Executives	within	
the	Group	and	from	external	advisers	(if	any)	to	facilitate	the	decision-making	of	the	Board.	
In	the	year	under	review,	the	Board	considered	a	wide	range	of	matters	in	order	to	meet	
its	obligations	with	discussions	revolving	around	strategy,	sustainability	and	operations	
of	the	Group,	including	that	of	both	main	operating	subsidiaries,	financial	aspects	of	the	
Group	and	on	legal,	compliance,	governance	and	risk	matters.	The	Board	and	Committees	
meetings	were	held	via	online	and	hybrid	mode	throughout	the	Financial	Year.	

BOARD COMPOSITION AND INDEPENDENCE

The	Board	has	reviewed	the	independence	of	each	Independent	Non-Executive	Director.	
None	of	the	 Independent	Non-Executive	Directors	who	served	during	the	year	had	any	
material	business	or	other	relationship	with	the	Group	and	there	were	no	other	matters	 
that	were	 likely	 to	 affect	 their	 independence	of	 character	 and	 judgement	 as	 guided	by	 
the	 MMLR.	 The	 Board	 recognises	 that	 in	 view	 of	 the	 characteristics	 of	 independence	
set	 out	 in	 the	 MCCG,	 length	 of	 service	 is	 an	 important	 factor	 when	 considering	 the	
independence	of	Independent	Non-Executive	Directors.

The	 Board	 adopts	 a	 policy	 that	 limits	 the	 tenure	 of	 its	 Independent	 Non-Executive	
Directors	to	nine	(9)	years	without	further	extension,	pursuant	to	Step	Up	5.4	of	MCCG.	
Currently,	 none	of	 the	 Independent	Non-Executive	Directors	 has	 served	 the	Board	 for	
more	than	nine	(9)	years.

Formulating, reviewing and approving the Company’s strategic business plan
Material Matters Reserved for the Board

Matters Considered by the Board

The	 Board	 plays	 a	 pivotal	 role	 in	 reviewing	

the	 Company’s	 strategic	 direction	 and	

approving corporate strategic initiatives 

developed	 by	 the	 Management.	 The	 Board	

deliberates	annually	the	Company’s	strategic	

and	 business	 plan	 as	 proposed	 by	 the	

Management,	 including	 the	 annual	 capital	

and	 revenue	 budget	 for	 the	 ensuing	 year	

as	 well	 as	 the	 KPIs.	 This	 ensures	 that	 the	

KPIs	 correspond	with	 the	Company’s	 annual	

strategic	 and	 business	 plan.	 The	 Board	

reviews	and	deliberates	on	the	Management’s	

views/assumptions	 in	 ensuring	 the	 best	

decisions	 are	 reached	 after	 considering	 all	

relevant	aspects.

A	 separate	 and	 informal	 session	 between	

the	 Board	 and	 Top	 Management,	 known	 as	

the	 Board	 Breakout	 Session	 (BBO),	 serves	

as	a	platform	for	the	Board	and	Management	

to	 deliberate	 and	 exchange	 views	 as	

well as opinions in formulating strategic  

plans/issues	 and	 to	 chart	 the	 direction	 of	 

the	 Group,	 including	 the	 reporting	 of	 its	

progress.	 The	 BBO	 is	 coordinated	 by	 the	

Company	 Secretary's	 Office,	 with	 the	

engagement	 of	 the	 respective	 Divisions,	 as	

and	when	the	need	arises.

Half-year reviews of the business plan 

and	 the	 budget	 were	 conducted	 whereby	

comparisons	of	approved	targets	against	the	

Company’s	actual	performance	were	made.

During	 the	 Financial	 Year	 under	 review,	

three	 (3)	 BBOs	 were	 held,	 focusing	 on	 the	

way	 forward	 for	 the	 TNB	 ESG	 Strategy	 :	 

Net	 Zero	 Commitment	 and	 Pathways	

as	 well	 as	 the	 Regulatory	 Period	 3	 

(RP3)	 (2022-2024)	 Roll-Down	 for	 the	

Company.

During	 the	 BBOs,	 the	 Management	

shared	 with	 the	 Board	 that	 to	 achieve	 our	

Sustainability	Pathway	aspiration	and	targets,	

TNB	 is	 working	 on	 a	 smooth	 transition	 to	

2050	 with	 sustained	 business	 growth.	 This	

transition calls for actionable items that 

take	 into	 account	 two	 (2)	 key	objectives,	 i.e.	

making	the	core	sustainable	and	building	new	

sustainable	 businesses.	With	Net	 Zero	 2050	

as	TNB’s	 aspiration,	more	details	 on	 the	 low	

carbon	pathway	are	required.

The	Management	also	shared	with	the	Board	

the	outcomes	and	current	progress	of	TNB's	

Sustainability	 Pathway.	 Our	 net	 zero	 goal	

requires	 commitment	 to	 these	 changes.	

TNB	had	seriously	considered	of	how	to	best	

manage	 risk	and	achieve	 the	best	outcomes	

for	TNB,	TNB	Power	Generation	Sdn.	Bhd.,	the	

investors	and	Malaysia.

The	 Management	 also	 shared	 the	 outcome	

of	 RP2	 Performances,	 RP3	 Key	 Parameters	

and	 held	 discussions	 on	 RP3	 Risks	 and	

Opportunities as well as value creation 

priorities	in	RP3.

The	 Board	 will	 deliberate	 and	 approve	 the	

sustainability	 strategy	 and	 pathway	 forward,	

while	 also	 overseeing	 TNB's	 sustainability	

implementation	and	performance.	

More information on the Strategic Direction 

is	available	 in	From	Our	Leadership	on	pages	 

38-63	of	this	report.

Based	on	the	evaluation	for	the	Financial	Year	

under	review,	the	Board	collectively	concurred	

that	it	has	reviewed	the	Company’s	strategic	

and	 financial	 plan	 as	 well	 as	 monitored	 its	

implementation,	 including	 the	 setting	 of	

suitable KPIs in achieving the Company’s 

objectives.

Matters Considered by the Board

The	President/CEO	is	responsible	for	managing	the	day-to-day	operations	of	the	Company	and	implementing	the	Group	strategies	and	policies	
as	agreed	by	 the	Board.	 In	doing	so,	he	 is	well	 supported	by	 the	 respective	Management	Committees.	The	performance	of	Management	 is

progress	of	Company’s	strategic	initiatives	and	critical	operational	issues	as	well	as	the	Group’s	performance	based	on	approved	KPIs.

The	 Board,	 assisted	 by	 the	 BNRC,	 is	
responsible	 for	 developing	 plans	 to	 identify	
the	 necessary	 and	 desirable	 competencies	
and	 skills	 of	 Directors	 and	 succession	 plans	
to	 ensure	 there	 is	 appropriate	 dynamics	 of	
skills,	 experience,	 expertise	 and	 diversity	 on	
the	 Board.	 In	 addition,	 the	 Board/BNRC	 also	
oversees	 the	 appointment	 and	 succession	
planning	of	the	Top	Management.

The	selection	of	candidates	and	appointment	
of	 Independent	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 by	
the	Board/BNRC	are	made	with	the	assistance	
of	 an	 independent	 consultant,	 whenever	
necessary.

During	 the	 Financial	 Year	 under	 review,	
there were several changes to the 
Board.	 This	 includes	 the	 departures	 of	 
Dato’	 Sri	 Hasan	 bin	 Arifin	 as	 
Chairman/Non-Independent	 Non-Executive

PRINCIPLE A : 
BOARD LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS

SUPPLY OF INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO ADVICE

A	 Pre-Board	 meeting	 is	 held	 prior	 to	 any	 Board	 meeting	 for	 the	
Management	 to	 provide	 the	Chairman	with	 insights	 into	 the	 papers	
that	 will	 be	 deliberated.	 The	 agenda	 of	 Board	 meetings	 is	 drawn	
up	 upon	 consultation	 between	 the	 Chairman,	 President/CEO	 and	
Company	Secretary	at	the	Pre-Board	meeting.	Copies	of	the	agenda	
and	Board	papers	 are	 circulated	 to	Board	Members	via	 an	 advanced	
meeting	 software	 which	 allows	 the	 Directors	 to	 securely	 access,	
read	and	review	Board/Committees	Documents	and	collaborate	with	
Directors	 and	 the	Company	Secretary	 electronically	 at	 least	 five	 (5)	
working	days	prior	to	the	meetings.

Aside	 from	 Board	 papers,	 presentations	 are	 provided	 by	 the	
Management	to	better	facilitate	the	discussion	of	the	subject	matter.	
This	permits	prior	 review	by	 the	Directors	and,	 if	 necessary,	 further	
clarification	and	additional	 information	are	sought	upon	deliberation	
to	facilitate	informed	decision-making.	The	core	activities	of	the	Board	
and	 its	Committees	 are	well	 documented	and	planned	on	 a	 forward	
agenda.	A	list	of	matters	arising	from	each	meeting	is	maintained	and	
followed	up	at	subsequent	meetings.

The	Company	Secretary	 advises	 the	Board	 on	 governance	matters,	
ensuring	 good	 information	 flows	 within	 the	 Board,	 its	 Committees,	
the	 GEMC	 and	 senior	 management.	 The	 Company	 Secretary	
is	 responsible	 for	 ensuring	 the	 Board	 complies	 with	 all	 relevant	
processes	 and	 for	 assessing	 compliance	with	 the	MMLR,	Corporate	
Disclosure	 Guidance,	 the	 MCCG	 and	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2016.	 An	
important	 part	 of	 this	 is	 effective	 collaboration	 with	 other	 parties	
across	all	Group	functions.	Good	training,	regular	discussions	on	key	
issues	and	support	 from	those	 in	areas	of	 critical	operational	 risk	 in	
evaluating	areas	for	change	are	also	imperative.

The	 Board	 and	 each	 Director	 are	 at	 liberty	 to	 obtain	 external	
independent	 or	 professional	 advice	 as	 deemed	 appropriate	 at	 the	
Company’s	 expense	 to	 assist	 with	 decision-making.	 This	 includes	
the	attendance	of	external	advisers	at	meetings	and	seeking	required	
information	from	any	member	of	the	Group’s	workforce.

RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

Clause	 64(1)	 of	 the	 Company’s	 Constitution	 provides,	 among	 others,	 that	
one-third	(1/3)	of	the	Directors	at	the	time	being	of	whom	have	been	longest	
in	office	shall	retire	by	rotation	at	the	AGM	of	the	Company	and	shall	be	eligible	
for	re-election.

Clause	63(2)	of	the	Company’s	Constitution	provides,	among	others,	that	the	
Directors	shall	have	power	at	any	time	and	from	time	to	time	to	appoint	any	
other	person	to	be	a	Director	of	 the	Company	either	to	fill	a	casual	vacancy	
or	 as	 an	 addition	 to	 the	 existing	Directors.	 Any	Director	 so	 appointed	 shall	
hold	office	only	until	the	next	following	AGM	of	the	Company	and	shall	then	be	
eligible	for	re-election.

Juniwati	Rahmat	Hussin,	Gopala	Krishnan	K.Sundaram	and	Datuk	Rawisandran	
a/l	 Narayanan	 are	 retiring	 by	 rotation	 in	 accordance	 with	 Clause	 64(1)	 of	 
the	Company’s	Constitution	and	being	eligible,	have	offered	themselves	 for	
re-election.

The	 Board	 recognises	 that	 the	 Directors’	 performance	 are	 used	 as	 basis	
in	 recommending	 their	 re-election	 to	 the	 shareholders.	 This,	 in	 turn,	 is	
determined	 through	 their	 annual	evaluation	and	 independence	assessment,	
which	are	assessed	by	the	BNRC	before	any	recommendation	is	made	to	the	
Board	for	deliberation	and	approval.

Based	 on	 the	 annual	 independence	 assessment	 undertaken	 by	 the	
Independent	 Directors	 of	 whom	 are	 retiring	 at	 the	 coming	 AGM,	 namely	
Juniwati	Rahmat	Hussin,	Gopala	Krishnan	K.Sundaram	and	Datuk	Rawisandran	
a/l	Narayanan,	the	BNRC/Board	are	satisfied	that	these	Independent	Directors	
have	complied	with	the	independence	criteria	as	prescribed	by	the	MMLR	and	
continue	to	bring	independent	and	objective	judgement	to	the	Board.

They	have	exercised	 the	duty	of	 care	and	diligence	as	Directors	 in	 the	best	
interest	 of	 the	 Company,	 its	 shareholders	 and	 stakeholders.	 All	 retiring	
Directors	named	above,	through	the	Board	Evaluation	Assessment	including	
Self	and	Peer	Assessment,	have	met	the	performance	criteria	required	of	an	
effective	and	high-performance	Board.

In	 respect	 of	 the	 new	 appointments	made	 to	 the	 Board,	Dato'	 Abdul	 Razak	
bin	Abdul	Majid,	Datin	Rashidah	binti	Mohd	Sies	and	Rohaya	binti	Mohammad	
Yusof	shall	retire	at	the	forthcoming	AGM	in	accordance	with	Clause	63(2)	of	
the	Company's	Constitution	and	being	eligible,	have	offered	themselves	 for	
re-election.

Dato'	 Abdul	 Razak	 bin	 Abdul	 Majid	 and	 Datin	 Rashidah	 binti	 Mohd	 Sies	 are	
the	 Appointed	 Directors	 by	 MoF	 Inc.,	 while	 Rohaya	 binti	 Mohammad	 Yusof	
represents	the	EPF.

In	 addition,	 all	 retiring	 Directors	 have	 declared	 that	 they	 did	 not	 have	 any	
existing	or	potential	conflict	of	 interest	within	or	outside	the	Company	that	
could	affect	the	execution	of	their	roles	as	Company	Directors.

Having	considered	their	fit	and	proper	assessment,	due	diligence	for	the	newly	
appointed	Directors,	professionalism,	vast	experience,	material	relationship,	
competency,	commitment	and	 individuals’	 contributions	 in	performing	 their	
respective	duties,	the	Board	and	the	BNRC	are	satisfied	that	all	Directors	who	
are	standing	for	re-election	at	the	33rd	AGM	have	met	the	Board’s	expectation	
by	continuously	discharging	their	duties	diligently	as	Company	Directors.

With	that,	upon	the	BNRC’s	assessment,	the	Board	resolved	to	support	and	
recommend	the	re-election	of	each	Director	who	is	retiring	at	the	upcoming	
33rd	AGM.

DIRECTORS’ DEVELOPMENT AND INDUCTION

To	 assist	 the	 Board	 in	 undertaking	 its	 responsibilities,	 a	 programme	 of	

training	and	development	is	available	to	all	Directors,	with	training	needs	

assessed	as	part	of	the	Board	evaluation	procedure.	The	Board	programme	

includes	regular	presentations	from	Management	and	informal	meetings	

to	build	understanding	of	the	business	and	sector,	or	in	areas	recognised	

as	 being	 technically	 complex.	 Such	 training	 is	 intended	 to	 support	 a	

deeper	understanding	as	well	as	equipping	the	Non-Executive	Directors	

with	 insight	 into	how	TNB’s	approach	compares	with	the	practices	of	 its	

peers.	All	new	Directors	receive	a	comprehensive	and	tailored	 induction	

programme,	 including	 meetings	 with	 Top	 Management,	 site	 visits	 and	

briefings	on	key	operational	matters,	Board	procedures	and	governance	

matters.

The	 existing	 Directors	 excluding	 the	 Alternate	 Director	 had	 attended	

their	Mandatory	Accreditation	Programme	for	Directors	of	Public	Listed	

Companies	 (MAPs)	 as	 prescribed	 under	 Paragraph	 15.08	 and	 Practice	

Note	5	by	the	MMLR.

The	 Company	 Secretary’s	 Office	 facilitates	 the	 Board	 in	 organising	

internal	and	arranging	external	programmes/seminars	that	are	relevant	to	

the	Directors.	These	include	the	annual	Board	Development	Programme	

(BDP)	 which	 is	 organised	 in-house	 as	 part	 of	 TNB’s	 Board	 Continuing	

Development	Programme.

BDP	2022	was	held	virtually	in	collaboration	with	PricewaterhouseCoopers	

Risk	 Services	 Sdn.	 Bhd.	 with	 the	 topic	 “Information	 Technology	 &	

Operational	Technology”.	 It	was	held	on	18	October	2022	and	attended	

by	the	Board	and	Top	Management.	The	topic	was	relevant	following	the	

trends	 observed	 post	 the	 COVID-19	 pandemic	 as	 it	 became	 endemic,	

where	cyber	threats	grew	pervasive	due	to	widespread	internet	access.	

Subsequent	to	that,	the	Integrity	Department,	assisted	by	the	Company	

Secretary’s	 Office,	 organised	 a	 specific	 programme,	 “Corporate	

Liabilities”,	 presented	 virtually	 by	 Herbert	 Smith	 Freehills,	 Malaysia,	 on	 

26	 September	 2022	 for	 the	 Board	 and	 Top	Management	 to	 provide	 the	

latest	developments	in	Corporate	Liability	in	accordance	with	Section	17A	

of	the	Malaysian	Anti-Corruption	Commission	Act	2009.	This	was	 in	 line	

with	 the	Training	Communication	Plan	2022	approved	by	 the	BIC,	which	

required	TNB's	Integrity	Department	to	organise	specific	training	for	the	

Board	and	Top	Management	once	in	the	third	quarter	of	2022.	

On	 1	 November	 2022,	 TNB	 Group	 Human	 Resource	 Division	 in	

collaboration	with	 the	Company	Secretary’s	Office	held	 the	Successors	

Engagement	Programme	with	 the	Board	 and	Top	Management	with	 the	

theme	“Realising	Sustainability	Through	Diversity”	which	focused	on	the	

development	 of	 Women's	 Leadership	 through	 discussion	 on	 the	 role,	

development	 and	 leadership	 among	 women	 to	 achieve	 the	 Company's	

goals	and	aspirations.	The	theme	was	chosen	to	support	the	Company's	

efforts	 to	 empower	 the	 Diversity	 and	 Inclusion	 element.	 Through	 this	

session	 the	 Board	 and	 Top	 Management	 were	 able	 to	 interact	 with	

potential	 successors	 and	 were	 exposed	 to	 the	 role	 and	 importance	 of	

women's	development	in	TNB.

To	date,	the	following	Directors’	Induction	Programmes	were	held	:

•	 Integrity	 Department	 :	 Overview	 Briefing	 by	 Chief	 Integrity	 &	

Development	Officer

•	 Real	Estate	Ventures	:	Overview	Briefing	by	Head,	Real	Estate	Ventures

During	 the	 Financial	 Year	 under	 review,	 the	 Directors	 attended,	 among	

others,	the	following	conferences	and	professional	trainings	:

BOARD EVALUATION

The	Board	recognises	that	an	objective	and	well-managed	board	evaluation	

process	 can	 lead	 to	 substantial	 improvement	 in	 Board	 effectiveness,	

bringing	 significant	 benefits	 to	 the	 Company.	 This	 is	 achieved	 through	

annual	 performance	 evaluations,	 induction	 programmes	 for	 new	 Board	

members	and	ongoing	Board	development	activities.

TNB	supports	Practice	6.1	of	MCCG	whereby	 for	Large	Companies,	 the	

Board	 engages	 independent	 experts	 at	 least	 every	 three	 (3)	 years	 to	

facilitate	 objective	 and	 candid	 Board	 evaluations.	 The	 last	 assessment	

carried	out	by	the	independent	expert,	Willis	Towers	Watson	(WTW),	was	

in	2021.

2022 BOARD EVALUATION ASSESSMENT RESULTS

The	 2022	 BEA	was	 conducted	 internally	 and	 facilitated	 by	 the	 Company	
Secretary	 through	 questionnaires	 guided	 by	 the	 Bursa	 Corporate	
Governance	Guide	(4th	Edition).	The	questionnaires	for	the	2022	BEA	were	
divided	into	several	sections	:

•	 Questionnaire	Relating	to	ESG	or	Sustainability
•	 Board	&	Board	Committees	Effectiveness	Assessment
•	 Directors	and	Board	Committee	Members’	Self	and	Peer	Assessment	

(SPA),	including	Fit	&	Proper	Assessment
•	 Board	Audit	Committee	Evaluation
•	 Board	Audit	Committee	Members’	SPA

The	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Board	 is	 assessed	 in	 the	 areas	 of	 the	 
Board’s	 responsibilities	 and	 composition,	 Quality	 of	 Information	 and	
Decision-making,	 Boardroom	 Activities	 and	 Board’s	 Relationship	 with	
the	 Management	 as	 well	 as	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Chairman	 and	 the	
President/CEO.

The	 assessment	of	 individual	Directors’	 contribution	 and	performance	 is	
conducted	 based	 on	 performance	 criteria	 which	 are	 incorporated	 in	 the	
Directors’	SPA	questionnaires.	This	included,	among	others	:

•	 will	and	ability	to	critically	challenge	and	ask	the	right	questions
•	 confidence	to	stand	up	for	a	point	of	view	and	offer	advice/guidance
•	 character	 and	 integrity	 in	 dealing	 with	 potential	 conflict	 of	 interest	

situations
•	 calibre	and	personality
• commitment to serve the Company
•	 due	diligence	and	integrity
•	 fit	and	proper
•	 independence	and	objectivity
•	 skills	and	competencies
•	 contribution	and	performance

Performance	evaluations	of	the	Board	include	reviews	of	its	performance	in	
addressing	the	Company’s	material	sustainability	risks	and	opportunities.

The	effectiveness	of	Board	Committees	 is	assessed	 in	terms	of	structure	
and	 processes,	 accountabilities	 and	 responsibilities,	 as	 well	 as	 the	
effectiveness	of	the	Chairmen	of	the	respective	Board	Committees.	The	SPA	
for	the	Board	Committee	members	is	similar	to	the	Directors’	SPA,	which	is	
intended	to	assess	their	contribution,	performance,	calibre	and	personality	
in	 relation	 to	 the	 skills,	 experience	 and	 other	 qualities	 they	 bring	 to	 the	 
Board/Board	Committees.

The	SPA	also	examines	the	ability	of	each	Board	or	Committee	member	to	
give	 input	at	meetings	and	to	demonstrate	a	high	 level	of	professionalism	
and	integrity	in	the	decision-making	process.	It	also	takes	into	account	the	
ability	of	each	 individual	member	 to	exercise	 independent	 judgement	and	
demonstrate	objectivity	and	clarity	of	thought	on	issues	during	deliberations	
at	meetings,	provide	logical	honest	opinion	and	offer	practical	and	realistic	
advice	to	the	discussions.	

Based	on	the	2022	BEA	results,	the	overall	ratings	for	the	2022	BEA	were	in	
average	of	4.0,	 indicating	that	the	performances	of	the	Board,	each	Board	
Committees,	individual	Directors	and	members	of	each	Board	Committees	
had	been	satisfactory.	Each	Director	was	generally	effective	in	discharging	
his/her	duties/responsibility.	

It	was	clear	that	the	effectiveness	of	both	the	Chairman	and	President/CEO	 
is	 reflective	 of	 the	 Board’s	 confidence	 in	 them,	 indicating	 strong	 and	
effective	leadership	in	spearheading	the	Company’s	direction.

The	Board	is	seen	to	be	effective	and	ensures	the	integrity	of	the	Company	is	
aligned	with	regulatory	requirements,	internal	standards	and	best	practices.	 
The	 Board	 is	 committed	 to	 its	 fiduciary	 duties	 and	 assumes	 the	 core	
responsibilities	 of	 reviewing	 and	 monitoring	 the	 Group’s	 strategic	 plan,	
overseeing	and	evaluating	the	conduct	of	the	Group’s	business	and	establishing	
sound	risk	management	and	internal	control	frameworks	for	the	Group.	

Based	 on	 2021	 BEA	 findings,	 the	 Board	 recognised	 the	 need	 to	
continuously	 strengthen	 its	 composition	 in	 terms	 of	 diversity,	 in	 line	
with	 its	 strategic	 direction	 and	 enhance	 the	 succession	 planning	 of	 the	 
Board/Top	 Management.	 Based	 on	 the	 2022	 BEA	 findings,	 areas	 that	 
required	ongoing	attention	for	continuous	improvement	were	sustainability	
strategies	 and	 Directors'	 trainings	 need	 to	 be	 tailored	 according	 to	 the	
Directors'	need.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND TOP MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION

The	 remuneration	 package	 for	 the	 Executive	 Director	 is	 structured	 to	 link	 rewards	 to	
corporate	and	 individual	performance.	 It	comprises	salary,	allowances,	bonuses	and	other	
customary	 benefits	 as	 accorded	 by	 comparable	 companies.	 A	 significant	 portion	 of	 an	
Executive	 Director’s	 compensation	 package	 has	 been	 made	 variable	 and	 is	 determined	
by	 performance	 during	 the	 year	 against	 individual	 KPIs	 in	 a	 scorecard	 aligned	 with	 the	
corporate	 objectives	 as	 approved	 by	 the	 Board.	 The	 Executive	 Director	 recuses	 himself	
from	deliberation	and	voting	on	his	remuneration	at	Board	meetings.

The	 BNRC	 reviews	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 Executive	 Director	 annually	 and	 submits	 
views/recommendations	 to	 the	Board	on	adjustments	 in	 remuneration	and/or	 rewards	 to	
reflect	 the	 Executive	Director’s	 contributions	 towards	 the	Group’s	 achievements	 for	 the	
year.

The	key	elements	of	remuneration	package	for	Top	Management	are	structured	into	three	
(3)	 components	 namely	 (i)	 the	 base	 salary,	 fixed	 allowances	 and	 benefits,	 (ii)	 Short	 Term	
Incentive	(STI)	and	(iii)	Long	Term	Incentive	Plan	(LTIP).

The	base	salary	needs	to	be	competitive	enough	to	attract	and	retain	the	relevant	talents,	
and	is	determined	by	the	scope	of	work,	experience	and	expected	performance	of	a	talent.	
The	fixed	allowances	are	for	certain	benefits	in	cash	and	are	not	linked	to	the	base	salary.

STI	 is	based	on	yearly	performance	and	paid	as	bonuses,	subject	to	the	profitability	of	the	
Company	 and	 the	 performance	 of	 Top	Management.	 Performance	 is	measured	 based	 on	
quantitative	targets	and	their	alignment	to	the	values	the	Company	stands	for,	which	would	
be	qualitative	 in	nature.	The	LTIP	 is	 to	 retain	and	 reward	Top	Management	 to	see	out	 the	
growth	and	business	strategy	aligning	with	the	long-term	success	of	the	Company.

In	 summary,	 TNB	 strongly	 believes	 in	 performance	 culture	 and	 the	 remuneration	 policy	
serves to pay competitively for sustainable performance while being in line with the 
shareholders’	interest.

The	Company	 has	 opted	 not	 to	 disclose	 the	 components	 of	 the	 remuneration	 of	 its	 Top	
Management	as	per	Practice	8.2	of	MCCG,	as	such	disclosure	may	bring	disadvantages	to	
the	Company’s	business	interest.	This	is	further	explained	in	the	CG	Report.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION

The	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 are	 remunerated	 through	 fixed	 monthly	 fees,	 meeting	
allowances	 and	 benefits-in-kind,	 inclusive	 of	 the	 reimbursement	 of	 utilities	 bills	 and	 
business	peripherals.

The	 level	 of	 remuneration	 of	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 reflects	 the	 current	 demanding	
challenges	in	discharging	their	fiduciary	duties,	roles	and	responsibilities,	whether	individually	
or	collectively,	as	well	as	the	complexity	of	the	Company’s	operations	and	the	industry.	The	
Non-Executive	Directors’	remuneration/benefits	have	remain	unchanged	since	2013.

In	 2021	WTW,	 as	 an	 independent	 expert,	 conducted	 a	 holistic	 and	 independent	 review	of	
TNB's	 Non-Executive	 Directors’	 remuneration	 to	 determine	 its	 market	 competitiveness	
in	Malaysia.	Based	on	the	findings,	the	structure	of	Non-Executive	Directors’	remuneration	
(including	benefits)	was	generally	aligned	with	the	market	practice	and	was	recommended	to	
be	retained	and	reviewed	in	three	(3)	years’	time.

OUR REMUNERATION APPROACH

The	 Board,	 through	 the	 BNRC,	 is	 to	 determine	
an appropriate remuneration policy that aligns 
remuneration	 with	 strategy	 to	 drive	 the	 long-term	
success	of	the	Company	and	ensures	that	the	Company	
may	 continue	 to	 attract,	 retain	 and	 motivate	 quality	
leaders.

The	 Directors’	 Remuneration	 Policy	 is	 shaped	 by	 the	
following	underlying	principles	:

Alignment with strategy and 
business objectives

Alignment with shareholders’ 
interest

Long-term success of the Company

Consistency and transparency

Reward performance with 
competitive remuneration

Alignment with market/industry 
practices

Support Company values

PRINCIPLE B : 
EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

ETHICS, INTEGRITY & TRUST

In	2017,	TNB	was	one	of	the	first	listed	corporation	to	embark	on	the	ISO	37001:2016	Anti-Bribery	Management	System	(ABMS)	certification.	Towards	
achieving	the	certification,	TNB	launched	the	TNB	Corporate	Integrity	Management	System	(TCIMS)	to	drive	an	integrity-based	culture	and	a	high	level	of	
compliance	with	local	and	international	anti-bribery	standards.	On	15	November	2018,	TNB	was	awarded	with	the	ABMS	Certification	from	SIRIM	and	to	
further	reinforce	this	culture,	launched	the	TCIMS	Handbook.	TNB	has	a	well	thought	out	set	of	Shared	Values	made	publicly	available	and	communicated	
to	the	workforce.	First	among	the	TNB	Shared	Values	is	Integrity.	The	three	(3)	behaviours	of	Integrity	are	:

3 BEHAVIOURS OF INTEGRITY

BEHAVIOUR 1
We	uphold	the	highest	ethical	

standards	and	do	what	is	right,	

all the time

BEHAVIOUR 2
We	are	fair,	honest	and	

transparent in everything  

we	do

BEHAVIOUR 3
We always seek to achieve 

mutual	benefit	for	the	country,	

Company	and	customers

 

The	Handbook	covers	five	(5)	TCIMS	policies,	namely	the	Anti-Bribery	Policy;	
the	Gifts,	Hospitality	and	Related	Benefits	Policy;	the	Conflicts	of	 Interest	
Policy;	 the	 Whistleblowing	 Policy;	 and	 the	 Integrity	 Pact	 and	 Committee	
Integrity	Pledges	Policy.	

In	 2022,	 TNB	 reviewed	 the	 four	 (4)	 main	 policies	 to	 reflect	 the	 current	
policies,	circulars	and	practices.	The	reviewed	policies	are	as	follows	:

(i)	 Anti-Bribery	Policy
(ii)	 Gifts,	Hospitality	and	Related	Benefits	Policy
(iii)	 Conflict	of	Interest	Policy
(iv)	Whistleblowing	Policy.

During	 the	 Financial	 Year	 under	 review,	 a	 surveillance	 audit	 by	 SIRIM	was	
conducted	 involving	 the	 Procurement	 &	 Supply	Chain	Division,	 the	 Retail	
Division	and	two	(2)	wholly-owned	subsidiaries	of	TNB,	namely	Tenaga	Cable	
Industries	Sdn.	Bhd.	and	TNB	Repair	and	Maintenance	Sdn.	Bhd.	where	all	
the	entities	successfully	retained	the	ISO	37001	Anti-Bribery	Management	
System	 certification	 by	 SIRIM.	 One	 of	 TNB	 subsidiary,	 TNB	 Integrated	
Learning	 Solution	 Sdn.	 Bhd.	 (ILSAS)	 was	 also	 certified	 with	 ISO	 37001	 
Anti-Bribery	Management	System	by	SIRIM.

In	 2022,	 TNB	 signed	 a	 Memorandum	 of	 Understanding	 (MoU)	 with	 the	
Malaysian	Anti-Corruption	Commission	(MACC)	and	signed	the	Corruption	
Free	Pledge.	This	pledge	emphasises	the	pledges	and	promises	made	by	the	
leadership	of	TNB	and	its	staff	voluntarily	in	their	capacity	as	an	organisation	
to	ensure	that	each	of	us	will	be	more	responsible	in	carrying	out	our	duties	
and	curbing	corruption.

TNB	also	conducted	the	Integrity	Health	Survey	in	2022	through	UNITEN	
Research	&	Development	Sdn.	Bhd.	and	based	on	the	survey	TNB	received	
a	79.36%	score.	Based	on	this	score,	TNB	was	categorized	as	world	class	
best	 practices	 according	 to	 the	 Global	 Ethics	 &	 Integrity	 Benchmarks	
2020	by	Joan	Elise	Dubinsky	and	Alan	Richter.	TNB	has	also	established	
a	 systematic	 approach	 through	 the	Annual	Training	and	Communication	
Plan	 (TCP)	 for	 the	areas	of	 improvement	 identified	through	the	 Integrity	
Health	Survey	conducted	in	2021.	

In	 2022,	 all	 activities	 under	 the	 TCP	 were	 successfully	 completed,	 
including	training	for	Board	of	Directors.	A	series	of	trainings	&	awareness	
sessions	 were	 conducted	 during	 the	 Financial	 Year	 by	 the	 Integrity	
Department	 to	 better	 equip	 the	 Company	 for	 the	 implementation	 of	 
Section	 17A	 of	 the	 Malaysian	 Anti-Corruption	 Commission	 (MACC)	 Act	
2009.	These	included	the	following	:

-	 10	sessions	of	Fraud	and	Bribery	Risk	Management	Workshops
-	 All	staff	and	active	vendors/business	partners/associates	were	required	

to	complete	the	Integrity	E-learning
-	 All	staff	are	required	to	sign	the	integrity	pledge	and	declare	any	conflicts	

of	interest	via	Employee	Self	Services	Online	System	annually
-	 ISO	37001	Internal	Audit	was	carried	out	Company-wide
-	 TNB	Integrity	Health	Index	(IHI)	was	established	to	access	and	capture	

relevant	information	on	different	attributes	and	dimensions	of	Integrity	
Health	status	and	performance	of	the	Integrity	Health	system

-	 19,989	 staff	 participated	 in	 the	 IHI	 survey	 FY2022	 and	 the	 score	was	
79.36%

-	 Published	18	Integrity	bulletins	and	articles

In	 2022,	 TNB	 was	 named	 among	 the	 top	 five	 Gold	 winners	 of	 the	 2022	
National	Integrity,	Governance	and	Anti-Corruption	Award	(AIGA).	It	marks	
TNB's	achievements	in	their	commitment	to	the	Environmental,	Social	and	
Governance	 (ESG)	 agenda,	 particularly	 in	 governance	 and	 the	 personal	
integrity	of	employees,	through	improving	organisational	integrity.

LIMITS OF AUTHORITY

The	 Limits	 of	 Authority	 outlines	 principles	 to	 govern	 decision-making	 
within	 the	 Group,	 including	 appropriate	 escalation	 and	 reporting	 to	 the	
Board.	 The	 Board	 has	 also	 delegated	 to	 the	 President/CEO	 and	 through	
the	 President/CEO	 to	 other	 Executives,	 responsibility	 to	 manage	 the	
Company’s	 day-to-day	 activities.	 The	 Limits	 of	 Authority	 encompasses	
both	monetary	and	non-monetary	limits	of	authority	for	recommending	and	
approving	 operational	 and	 management	 decision-making	 activities	 prior	 
to	 their	 execution.	 This	 allows	 for	 balanced	 effective	 oversight	 with	
appropriate	empowerment	and	accountability	of	the	Management.

by	 the	Companies	Commission	of	Malaysia.	Each	Non-Executive	Director	
is	 supplied	with	 the	Non-Executive	Directors’	Handbook	 as	 reference	 for	
their	professional	responsibilities	as	well	as	the	terms	and	conditions	of	their	
service.	The	Non-Executive	Directors’	Handbook	is	updated	as	and	when	the	
need	arises	to	reflect	any	changes	to	the	applicable	rules	and	regulations	as	
well	as	in	the	policies/procedures	that	govern	the	conduct	of	the	Directors.

TNB	 has	 a	 Code	 of	 Ethics	 to	 govern	 the	 conduct	 of	 its	 employees.	 The	
provisions	set	out	 in	 the	Code	of	Ethics	ensure	compliance	with	 laws	and	
regulations,	 sound	 employment	 practices,	 confidentiality	 and	 privacy.	
It	 also	 includes	 provisions	 on	 conflicts	 of	 interest,	 giving	 and	 accepting	
business	 courtesies	 and	 the	 protection	 and	 proper	 use	 of	 TNB’s	 assets	 
and	 resources.	 TNB’s	 Code	 of	 Ethics	 also	 defines	 how	TNB	 relates	 to	 its	
shareholders,	 employees,	 customers,	 suppliers	 and	 the	 communities	 in	
which	it	operates.	It	includes	TNB’s	general	principles	on	business	integrity.	
All	 employees	 are	 expected	 to	 conduct	 business	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	
applicable	 laws,	 rules	 and	 regulations	 and	 in	 a	manner	 that	 enhances	 and	 
protects	the	reputation	of	TNB.	

TNB’s	Procurement	Code	of	Conduct	guides	TNB’s	Directors	and	employees	
as	 well	 as	 all	 existing	 and	 potential	 suppliers/contractors,	 including	 their	
directors	 and	 employees.	 TNB	 believes	 that	 all	 supplier/contractor	
relationships	 should	 be	 based	 on	 principles	 of	 good	 governance	 such	 as	
integrity,	accountability,	fairness	and	a	zero-tolerance	rule	towards	bribery	
and	 corruption.	 These	 principles	 are	 enforced	 in	 the	 Procurement	 Code	
of	Conduct,	which	 is	 constantly	 revised	 to	 reflect	 changes	 in	 regulations,	
reputational	demands	and	business	challenges.	

The	Procurement	&	Supply	Chain	Policy	and	Procedures	provides	a	set	of	
general	policy	and	procedures	as	guidance	in	executing	procurement	within	
TNB.	 The	 Policy	 and	 Procedures	 enables	 TNB	 to	 obtain	 the	 best	 value	 in	
procurement,	 adopt	 leading	 business	 practices,	 advance	 TNB’s	 business	
priorities,	add	value	to	customers	and	uphold	good	corporate	governance.	
TNB’s	Code	of	Ethics	and	Procurement	Code	of	Conduct	are	available	in	their	
respective	sections	of	the	Company’s	website	at	www.tnb.com.my.	

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

To	foster	ethical	and	independent	decision-making,	the	Company	requires	
Directors	with	 any	 direct	 or	 indirect	 interest	 in	 a	 proposal	 or	 transaction	
being	considered	by	the	Board	or	 its	Committees	to	declare	that	 interest	 
and	recuse	himself/herself	from	the	deliberations.	The	affected	Director	will	
take	no	part	in	the	decision-making.	As	initiated	by	the	Procurement	&	Supply	
Chain Division in collaboration with the Integrity Department to further 
strengthen	our	 integrity	 and	 transparency	 in	 dealing	with	 the	Company’s	
procurement	activities,	at	each	Board	meeting,	each	Director	shall	sign	an	
Integrity	 Pact,	 declaring	 his/her	 interest	 involving	 procurement/matters	 
to	be	discussed	at	the	meeting,	to	prevent	corruption,	conflict	of	 interest	
and	to	maintain	confidentiality	of	information.

The	Whistleblowing	Procedure	embodies	TNB’s	commitment	to	maintaining	
an	 open	 working	 environment	 in	 which	 employees,	 contractors	 and	 
members	of	 the	public	 are	 able	 to	 report	 instances	of	 unethical,	 unlawful	
or	 undesirable	 conduct	 on	 a	 confidential	 basis	 without	 any	 fear	 of

MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS

As	 of	 31	 December	 2022,	 the	 BAC	 comprises	 six	 (6)	 members,	 all	 of	 whom	 are	 Independent	 
Non-Executive	Directors.	This	 composition	 is	 aligned	with	Paragraph	15.09	 (1)	 (a)	 and	 (b)	 of	 the	Bursa	
Malaysia	 Securities	 Berhad	 Main	 Market	 Listing	 Requirements	 (MMLR),	 which	 states	 that	 the	 Audit

is	to	meet	at	least	six	(6)	times	a	year.	Attendance	at	all	meetings	met	the	requisite	quorum	as	stipulated	
in	the	BAC	ToR.	The	Company	Secretary,	who	is	the	Secretary	to	the	BAC,	and	the	Chief	Internal	Auditor	
(CIA)	were	in	attendance	during	the	meetings.	The	President/CEO	and	other	officers	were	invited	to	the

After	each	meeting,	the	BAC	Chairman	submits	a	report	on	matters	deliberated	to	the	Board	of	Directors’	
meeting	for	information	and	attention.	Matters	reserved	for	the	Board’s	approval	are	tabled	at	the	TNB	
Board	meetings.	Action	sheets	are	issued	by	the	Company	Secretary	on	the	decisions	made	and	actions	
required.	These	are	circulated	to	Management	and	relevant	parties	for	their	actions.

MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE BRC

The	BRC,	 assisted	 by	 the	Chief	 Risk	Officer	 and	 the	 Risk	Management

TNB RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

The	 BRC	 had	 approved	 the	 TNB	 Risk	 Management	 Framework	 that	

provides	a	structured	and	consistent	approach	to	risk	management	across	

the	Group.	The	 implementation	of	 the	 framework	 is	governed	 through	

the	TNB	risk	governance	documents,	which	are	guidance	documents	for	

the	business	entities	across	the	Group	to	 implement	and	 integrate	risk	

management	into	its	business	operations	for	informed	decision-making	

and	to	achieve	objectives	and	targets.	These	risk	governance	documents	

are	reviewed	annually	with	the	criteria	for	revision	and	levels	of	approving	

authority	clearly	stated	to	ensure	the	documents	are	robust,	practical	for	

implementation	and	reflective	of	the	internal	and	external	context.

RISK GOVERNANCE

The	 TNB	 Risk	 Management	 Structure	 described	 in	 the	 TNB	 Risk	

Management Framework governs the risk management implementation 

in	 the	 Group.	 The	 oversight	 role	 is	 executed	 by	 the	 TNB	 Board	 of	

Directors	and	the	BRC,	whilst	cross-functional	risk	management	matters	

are	 deliberated	 at	 the	 Group	 Risk	 Management	 Working	 Committee	

(GRMWC)	 and	 Subsidiaries	 Risk	 Management	 Working	 Committee

the	 TNB	 Risk	 Management	 Framework	 is	 effectively	 implemented	 in	

business	entities	and	sufficient	resources	are	committed	for	continuous	

improvement	and	integration	of	risk	management	in	business	processes.	

The	 BRC	 had	 approved	 the	 TNB	 3-Year	 Cycle	 Risk	 Governance	 Plan	

for	 implementation	 from	 FY2022	 to	 FY2024.	 This	 plan	 is	 implemented	

by	 RMD	 to	 assist	 the	 BRC	 in	 ensuring	 that	 TNB	 business	 entities	 are	

effectively	 implementing	 the	TNB	Risk	Management	 Framework	 and	 is	

embedded	into	the	culture,	processes	and	structures	of	the	Group.	The	

plan	outlines	 three	 (3)	 risk	governance	activities,	which	are	 risk	 review,	

risk	maturity	assessment	and	desktop	risk	assessment.	Over	a	span	of	 

three	 (3)	 years,	 the	 risk	 governance	 activities	 shall	 be	 completed	 for	

identified	 business	 entities	 in	 the	 Group.	 According	 to	 plan,	 RMD	 in	

collaboration	with	TNB	business	entities	conducted	15	risk	reviews,	five	

(5)	 risk	 maturity	 assessments	 and	 eight	 (8)	 desktop	 risk	 assessments	

in	 FY2022.	 Recommendations	 for	 improvement	 were	 deliberated	 with	

the respective business entity to strengthen the implementation 

and	 integration	 of	 risk	 management	 in	 day-to-day	 operations	 and	 

decision-making.	

TNB STRATEGIC RISKS

The	BRC	had	approved	revisions	 to	 the	TNB	Strategic	Risks	 in	FY2022.	

These	strategic	risks	are	assessed	in	the	context	of	the	Reimagining	TNB	

strategy	and	long-term	objectives.	The	annual	revision	ensures	that	the	

strategic	 risk	 exposures	 of	 the	 Group	 are	 comprehensively	 assessed	

in	 view	 of	 changes	 in	 the	 external	 and	 internal	 environments	 and	 are	

mitigated	accordingly.	The	TNB	Strategic	Risks	cover	risk	areas	related	

to	 the	 external	 context,	 sustainability,	 regulatory,	 market,	 customer,	

finance	and	capabilities.	

KEY OPERATING RISKS

The	 BRC	 deliberated	 the	 key	 operating	 risks	 of	 nine	 (9)	 TNB	 business	

entities	 in	FY2022.	Based	on	an	annual	schedule,	a	TNB	business	entity	

tables	 its	operational	 risk	profile	 to	 the	BRC,	highlighting	 key	 risks	 and	

mitigations	 taken	 to	address	 root	causes,	emerging	 risks	 related	 to	 its	

business	 and	 lessons	 learned	 from	 risk	 events	 that	 are	 communicated	

to	employees	to	strengthen	the	risk	management	culture.	Direction	and	

advice	 from	the	BRC	were	duly	noted	 for	progressive	 improvements	 in	

embedding	 risk	 management	 principles	 in	 day-to-day	 operations	 and	

decision-making	at	the	respective	business	entity.	

Additionally,	the	BRC	deliberated	on	reports	of	specific	risk	exposures	in	

the	areas	of	 safety	and	security,	 floods,	 legal	 and	compliance	and	data	

management.	

TNB RISK DASHBOARD

The	BRC	deliberated	the	Key	Risk	 Indicators	 (KRIs)	 that	are	 reported	 in	

the	TNB	Risk	Dashboard.	These	KRIs	provide	early	warning	of	increasing	

risk	exposures	and	potential	risk	events	and	are	developed	in	alignment	

with	the	risk	appetite	of	 the	BRC	and	Management.	The	BRC	approved	

the annual revisions of the KRIs to ensure the KRIs are relevant to current 

business	strategies	and	risk	exposures	of	the	Group.	

The	status	of	the	KRIs	 is	reported	quarterly	 in	the	TNB	Risk	Dashboard	

and	reflects	the	risk	exposures	of	the	Group	according	to	five	(5)	impact	

areas,	 which	 are	 operations,	 financial	 standing,	 reputation,	 regulatory	

and	 international	 investment.	 The	 quarterly	 reporting	 and	 monitoring	

of KRIs ensures that actions are taken in a timely manner when risks are 

outside	tolerable	ranges.

WE	ARE	TNB FROM	OUR	LEADERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY	STATEMENT

188 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

REPORTING

The	BRC	jointly	reviewed	and	endorsed	the	Statement	of	Risk	Management	

and	 Internal	 Control	 with	 the	 Board	 Audit	 Committee,	 which	 was	 

thereafter	approved	by	 the	Board	 for	 reporting	 in	 the	TNB	 Integrated	

Annual	Report.	The	statement	reports	the	risk	management	practices	

and	 internal	controls	 implemented	 in	 the	Group	as	well	as	assurances	

from	 the	President/CEO	and	Chief	 Financial	Officer	 to	 the	Board	 that	

the	Group’s	risk	management	and	internal	control	system	is	operating	

adequately	and	effectively,	in	all	material	aspects.

Business	entities	across	the	Group	submitted	two	half-year	risk	reports	

to	the	RMD	according	to	the	TNB	Risk	Report	Guide.	Each	business	entity	

reported	its	risk	profile,	key	mitigations,	KRIs,	lessons	learned	from	risk	

events	and	emerging	 risks	unique	 to	 its	business	and	RMD	thereafter	

collated	and	reported	the	TNB	Half-Year	Risk	Reports	to	Management	

for	 a	 holistic	 perspective	 of	 the	 Group’s	 strategic,	 operational	 and	

emerging	risks.	

CAPABILITY BUILDING

The	BRC	mandated	for	risk	practitioners	in	the	Group	to	be	adequately	

trained	 and	 certified	 by	 recognised	 local	 or	 international	 professional	 

bodies	 to	 ensure	 quality	 risk	 management	 practices	 are	 effectively	

implemented	 at	 all	 levels.	 Risk	management	 trainings	 at	 fundamental	

and	 intermediate	 levels	 are	 conducted	 by	 the	 RMD	 and	 administered	

by	the	TNB	Integrated	Learning	Solutions	Sdn.	Bhd.	(ILSAS)	to	increase	

the	 risk	 competency	 of	 employees	 across	 the	 Group.	 In	 FY2022,	 

55	executives	completed	the	 fundamental	module	with	70	executives	

at	 the	 intermediate	 level.	 Additionally,	 in	 a	 collaborative	 effort	

between	 RMD	 and	 the	 business	 entities,	 six	 (6)	 risk	 management	

webinars	 were	 conducted	 that	 engaged	 458	 employees	 in	 total.	

These webinars aim to strengthen employees’ risk-thinking  

mindset	 through	 practical	 applications	 of	 the	 TNB	 Risk	 Management	

and	TNB	Business	Continuity	Management	frameworks.

The	Risk	Manager	Circle,	of	which	the	RMD	is	secretariat,	is	a	community	

of risk practitioners from across the Group with the aim of promoting 

capability	enhancement	among	peers.	The	Circle	collaborates	quarterly	

to	 spearhead	 risk	 initiatives	 and	 share	 knowledge	 and	 feedback	 on	

effective	practices	and	 lessons	 learnt,	drawing	from	their	experiences	

in	implementing	risk	management	at	respective	business	entities.

COMMUNICATION 

The	BRC	continually	communicates	its	tone	from	the	top,	emphasising	

the	importance	of	effective	risk	management	and	a	strong	risk	culture.	

Pre-pandemic,	an	annual	 risk	 forum	was	conducted	 in-person	for	 that	

purpose.	However,	 in	FY2022,	a	video	of	BRC	members	was	produced	

for	 the	 same	 purpose	 and	 communicated	 to	 Management	 and	

employees	 at	 relevant	 platforms	 such	 as	management	meetings	 and	

risk	 conferences.	 In	 2023,	 BRC	will	 continue	 to	 communicate	 its	 tone	

from	the	top	through	the	annual	risk	forum.	

The	tone	from	the	top	on	risk	management	and	its	benefits	was	further	

cascaded	by	Management	to	employees	via	videos	of	each	member	of	

Management	 that	were	 produced	 and	 uploaded	 into	TNB	 intranet	 for	

easy	viewing,	downloading	and	sharing.	

In	 addition,	 five	 (5)	 risk	 conferences	 were	 organised	 by	 the	 RMD	 in	

FY2022	with	total	participation	from	approximately	466	executives	and	 

non-executives.	 These	 events	 were	 organised	 once	 restrictions	

were	 relaxed	 post-pandemic	 and	 the	 face-to-face	 interactions	 were	 

well-received	 by	 the	 participants	 and	 achieved	 the	 objective	 driving	

the	message	on	the	importance	of	integrating	risk	management	in	daily	

operations	and	decision-making.	

BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT

The	BRC	deliberated	the	TNB	Business	Continuity	Management	(BCM)	

Framework	 and	 its	 implementation	 in	 the	 Group.	 The	 framework	

provides	 a	 structured	 approach	 in	managing	 business	 continuity	 that	

enables	 prompt,	 coordinated	 and	 effective	 response	 to	 a	 crisis	 and	

maintains continuity of essential activities as well as protecting human 

life,	assets,	reputation	and	the	environment.	The	framework	is	the	focal	

point	 of	 reference	 for	 business	 entities	 to	 formulate	 and	 implement	

relevant	business	continuity	strategies	tailored	to	respective	business	

objectives	and	critical	functions.

The	 BRC	 emphasised	 the	 importance	 of	 enhancing	 preparedness	

through	drills	of	various	scenarios	and	close	collaboration	with	external	

stakeholders	 to	 ensure	 prompt	 and	 adequate	 response	 when	 crisis	

occurs.	The	RMD,	as	the	Corporate	BCM	Secretariat,	under	the	leadership	

of	 the	TNB	Corporate	BCM	Steering	Committee,	carried	out	 three	 (3)	

drills	 in	FY2022	with	involvement	from	Management	and	support	from	

BCM	practitioners	across	the	Group.	In	addition,	drills	to	test	readiness	

of	 business	 entities	 in	 crisis	 scenarios	 such	 as	 floods	 and	dam	safety	

were	 carried	out	 according	 to	plan	 and	 improvements	 identified	 from	 

post-mortems	were	implemented	to	close	gaps.	

CONCLUSION

The	BRC	continues	to	diligently	exercise	its	risk	oversight	responsibilities	

by ensuring that risk management is an integral part of strategic 

planning	 and	 decision-making	 for	 the	 achievement	 of	 the	 Group’s	

strategic	outcomes	and	long-term	objectives.	

This	 statement	 was	 made	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 resolution	 of	 the	

Board	of	Directors	dated	20	March	2023.

TNB’s	 internal	 audit	 function,	 which	 is	 under	 the	 purview	 of	 Group	

Internal	Audit	Department	(GIA),	is	established	by	the	Board	to	provide	

independent,	objective	assurance	and	consulting	services	designed	to	

add	value	and	improve	TNB’s	operations.	

GIA	 assists	 TNB	 in	 accomplishing	 its	 business	 objectives	 by	 bringing	

a	 systematic,	 disciplined	 approach	 to	 evaluate	 and	 improve	 the	

effectiveness	of	governance,	risk	management	and	control	processes.	

GIA	reports	directly	to	the	Board	Audit	Committee	(BAC)	to	preserve	its	 

independence	 and	 objectivity	 and	 administratively	 to	 President/CEO	 

to	enable	the	required	stature	to	fulfil	its	responsibilities.	

GIA	is	led	by	Lizah	Abd	Wahab,	who	was	appointed	as	the	Chief	Internal	

Auditor	 (CIA)	on	1	April	2021.	She	holds	a	Bachelor	of	Accounting	and	

Finance	 degree	 from	 Manchester	 Metropolitan	 University,	 United	

Kingdom	 and	 a	 Master	 of	 Business	 Administration	 from	 Universiti	

Tenaga	 Nasional	 and	 Graduate	 Certificate	 in	 Management	 from	 the	

University	of	Melbourne.	Additionally,	she	is	a	Certified	Internal	Auditor	

and	obtained	a	Certification	of	Risk	Management	Assurance	 from	 the	

Institute	of	Internal	Auditors	(IIA).	She	brings	over	20	years	of	experience	

in	internal	auditing	at	various	areas	or	functions	within	TNB.	

PRACTICES AND FRAMEWORK

GIA	 endeavours	 to	 protect	 and	 enhance	 organisational	 value	 by	

providing	 risk-based	 and	 objective	 assurance,	 advice	 and	 insight	

through	innovative	solutions.

GIA	 is	 guided	 by	 the	 Internal	 Control	 Framework	 of	 Committee	 of	

Sponsoring	 Organisation	 of	 the	 Treadway	 Commission	 (COSO)	 and	

Control	Objectives	for	Information	and	Related	Technology	(COBIT)	in	

assessing	and	reporting	the	adequacy	and	effectiveness	of	the	design	

and	 implementation	 of	 the	 organisation’s	 overall	 system	 of	 internal	

control,	risk	management	and	governance.

GIA’s	 processes	 and	 activities	 are	 governed	 by	 the	 standards	

and	 principles	 outlined	 in	 the	 International	 Professional	 Practices	

Framework	 (IPPF)	 issued	 by	 IIA,	 which	 comprises	 Core	 Principles	 for	

the	Professional	Practice	of	 Internal	Auditing,	 International	Standards	

for	the	Professional	Practice	of	Internal	Auditing,	Definition	of	Internal	

Auditing	 and	 Code	 of	 Ethics.	 The	 effectiveness	 and	 quality	 of	 the	 

internal	audit	 function	are	assessed	externally	at	 least	every	three	 (3)	

years	and	the	report	is	presented	to	the	BAC.	

SCOPE AND COVERAGE

GIA’s	responsibilities	and	scope	of	internal	audit	activities	are	outlined	in	

the	Internal	Audit	Charter	which	was	approved	by	the	BAC.	The	Internal	

Audit	Charter	 is	 reviewed	annually	 to	ensure	 relevance	and	alignment	

with	the	requirements	of	IPPF.

GIA	 continues	 to	 formulate	 the	 annual	 audit	 plan	 using	 a	 risk-based	

approach,	 taking	 into	 consideration	 TNB’s	 risk	 profile,	 strategic	

objectives,	 regulatory	 requirements	 as	 well	 as	 inputs	 from	 BAC	 and	

senior	management.

Beginning	 FY2022,	 GIA	 introduced	 the	 thematic	 auditing	 approach	

where	 audits	were	 clustered	 into	 predetermined	 high-risk	 areas.	 The	

review	for	each	theme	was	carried	out	across	TNB	and	its	subsidiaries	

to	 provide	 assurance	 on	 the	 overall	 governance	 and	 state	 of	 internal	

controls	for	the	audit	area.	

During	FY2022,	GIA	 issued	a	total	of	143	reports	arising	from	planned	

audits,	 follow-up	 audits	 and	 quality	 assurance	 reviews.	 Audit	 findings	

were	 presented	 to	 the	 BAC	 for	 deliberation	 and	 where	 relevant,	 the	

BAC	 requested	 Management	 to	 rectify	 the	 weaknesses	 based	 on	

recommendations	 provided	 by	 GIA.	 Subsequently,	 GIA	 monitored	

the	 implementation	of	 corrective	 actions	 through	 an	online	 platform,	

the	Audit	Management	System	and	reports	the	status	to	the	BAC	and	

Management	on	a	quarterly	basis.

GIA	 has	 categorised	 the	 areas	 of	 review	 according	 to	 five	 (5)	 audit	

hotspots	 based	 on	 the	 current	 trends,	 changes	 in	 risk	 landscape	 and	

revolving	 roles	 of	 internal	 auditors.	 Among	 the	 key	 areas	 reviewed	

during	FY2022	include	:

In	addition	to	the	above,	34%	(21	auditors)	are	 in	the	midst	of	pursuing	

their	professional	certifications	at	various	levels.	

GIA	commits	 to	ensure	that	 the	 level	of	auditors’	skills,	knowledge	and	

competencies	are	maintained	as	reflected	in	the	Internal	Audit	Charter.	

These	are	accomplished	through	the	following	:

•	 Involvement	of	auditors	 in	national	conferences	and	trainings	 in	the	

areas	of	auditing,	strategic	initiatives,	leadership	and	communication,	

business	acumen,	data	analytics	and	personal	development.

•	 Participation	 in	environmental,	 social	and	governance	 (ESG)	 related	

trainings	to	gain	understanding	and	insights	on	fundamentals	of	ESG	

and	 roles	on	 internal	auditor	 in	providing	ESG-related	assurance,	 in	

line	with	the	global	trend	on	sustainability	landscape.	

•	 Maintain	corporate	membership	status	in	IIA	Malaysia,	which	provides	

access	to	 internal	auditors	for	trainings,	reading	materials	and	audit	

resources	and	current	happenings	in	audit	fraternity.	

As	 of	 31	 December	 2022,	 GIA	 incurred	 a	 total	 cost	 of	 RM222,955	 on	

internal	 and	 external	 trainings/conferences	 to	 enhance	 auditors’	 skills,	

knowledge	and	competencies.

We	have	a	well-established	programme	of	engaging	with	a	wide	range	of	stakeholders	who	are	key	to	the	successful	delivery	of	our	strategy.	These	
include	shareholders,	the	government,	regulators,	environmental	bodies	and	trade	unions.	We	know	that	actions	taken	today	will	shape	the	longer-term	
performance	of	TNB	and	determine	our	impact	on	the	wider	world,	including	our	contribution	to	action	on	climate	change.	Such	engagement	broadens	
our	understanding	of	the	issues	we	take	into	account,	informs	our	decision-making	and	helps	to	protect	the	long-term	interests	of	stakeholders.

The	Board	 is	 responsible	 for	engagement	with	stakeholders	and	ensures	 that	appropriate	Board	 time	 is	given	 to	discussing	 their	concerns	and	 that

196 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

We	value	and	facilitate	a	direct,	two-way	dialogue	with	the	shareholders	and	

investors.	It	is	our	top	priority	to	provide	relevant	information	to	shareholders,	

listen	to	and	understand	their	perspectives	and	respond	to	their	feedback.	

Our	 AGM	 plays	 an	 important	 role	 in	 providing	 the	 shareholders	 with	 an	

opportunity	 to	communicate	directly	with	 the	Chairman	and	President/CEO	

about	the	business,	governance,	financial	performance	and	prospects.	It	also	

provides	an	opportunity	for	shareholders	to	raise	questions	for	the	Board,	Top	

Management	and	the	External	Auditors	on	the	management	and	performance	

of	the	Company.	

The	Board	ensures	that	shareholders	are	given	sufficient	notice	and	time	to	

consider	 the	 resolutions	 that	will	 be	 tabled	 and	 discussed	 at	 the	AGM.	 The	

AGM	Notice	 includes	explanatory	notes	 that	 contain	 further	 information	on	

the	proposed	resolutions.	 It	has	been	the	Company’s	practice	since	2017	as	

per	 the	MCCG,	 to	 issue	out	 the	Notice	of	AGM	to	 the	shareholders	at	 least	 

28	days	prior	to	the	meeting.	

TNB	hosted	 its	 32nd	 AGM	on	 2	 June	 2022	 virtually	 via	 Remote	 Participation	

and	Voting	(RPV)	at	Dewan	Seminar,	Kompleks	Balai	Islam	An-Nur,	Ibu	Pejabat	

Tenaga	 Nasional	 Berhad,	 No.	 129,	 Jalan	 Bangsar,	 59200	 Kuala	 Lumpur,	

Malaysia,	the	Broadcast	Venue.	Holding	a	virtual	AGM	allows	our	shareholders	

with	the	opportunity	to	participate	in	the	AGM	regardless	of	their	geographical	

differences.	

A	 dedicated	 link	 was	 created	 in	 our	 website	 within	 a	 stipulated	 timeframe	

so	as	to	provide	the	shareholders	with	all	 information	they	needed	to	attend	

the	meeting,	including	our	virtual	AGM	online	guide	on	how	to	use	the	online	

facility.	

In	 line	with	the	Group’s	commitment	 in	promoting	ESG	as	well	as	to	achieve	

greater	 cost	 efficiencies,	 TNB	 encouraged	 its	 shareholders	 to	 go	 paperless	

and	 to	 access	 the	 digital	 copy	 of	 TNB’s	 Integrated	 Annual	 Report	 2021	 by	

downloading	 it	 from	 the	 Company’s	 website.	 Aside	 from	 that,	 TNB	 issued	

out	 postcards	 with	 QR	 code	 to	 the	 shareholders,	 consisting	 the	 Notice	 of	

32nd	AGM,	Administrative	Details	of	the	32nd	AGM,	 Integrated	Annual	Report	

2021	 and	 Proxy	 Form	 to	 the	 shareholders,	 which	 were	 also	 available	 at	 the	

Company’s	website.

A	total	of	1,598	shareholders	and	proxies	representing	3,786,076,952	ordinary	

shares	 participated	 online	 in	 TNB	 Virtual	 32nd	 AGM	 as	 per	 the	 Attendance	

Record	 issued	 by	 TNB	 Share	 Registrar.	 All	 Directors	 attended	 the	 AGM,	

including	 the	 Chairmen	 of	 respective	 Board	 Committees.	 The	 Engagement	

Partner	 of	 PricewaterhouseCoopers	 PLT	 (PwC)	 was	 also	 in	 attendance	 at	

the	AGM	to	answer	shareholders’	questions	on	the	conduct	of	the	audit,	the	

preparation	and	content	of	the	audit	report,	the	accounting	policies	adopted	

by	the	Company	and	the	independence	of	auditors	in	the	audit	process.

Shareholders	were	 provided	with	 similar	 opportunities	 online	 as	 they	would	

have	had	attending	the	AGM	in	person.	They	were	able	to	view	presentation	

on	 the	 Company’s	 financial	 and	 technical/operational	 highlights	 by	 the	 

President/	 CEO,	 as	 well	 as	 vote	 and	 ask	 questions	 during	 the	 meeting.	 

During	 the	 Meeting,	 the	 Chairman	 encouraged	 the	 shareholders	 to	 post	

questions	to	the	Board	and	Management	on	the	proposed	resolutions	tabled	

at	 the	AGM.	All	 questions	 submitted	during	 the	meeting	were	 answered	by	 

the	 President/CEO,	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer	 and	 Company	 Secretary	 

accordingly	during	the	meeting.

The 32nd	 AGM	 was	 conducted	 online	 via	 BoardRoom’s	 LUMI	 AGM.	 

Shareholders/proxies	 were	 able	 to	 view	 the	 live	 webcast	 of	 the	 AGM	

proceedings,	 post	 questions	 to	 the	 Board/Management	 and	 submit	 their	

votes	 in	 real-time	 whilst	 the	 meeting	 was	 in	 progress.	 The	 procedures	 for	 

RPV	 facilities	 were	 explained	 in	 the	 Administrative	 Details	 of	 32nd AGM  

issued	to	the	shareholders	on	29	April	2022.

All resolutions of 32nd	AGM	were	tabled	and	approved	by	the	shareholders.	All	

resolutions	were	voted	by	poll	and	the	results	were	validated	by	Boardroom	

Corporate	Services	Sdn.	Bhd.,	 the	 independent	scrutineer	appointed	by	 the	

Company.	 The	 outcomes	 of	 poll	 voting	were	 announced	 to	 the	market	 and	

posted	on	the	Company’s	website	on	the	same	day	of	the	AGM.

The	 minutes	 of	 meeting	 was	 made	 available	 on	 TNB’s	 website	 at	 

www.tnb.com.my	no	later	than	30	business	days	after	the	AGM.

related	queries	and	feedback	at	tenaga_ird@tnb.com.my.

ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY

Year	 2022	 was	 a	 challenging	 year	 as	 the	 country's	 economic	

environment	 remained	 fragile	 due	 to	 the	 emergence	 of	 the	

Omicron	 variant,	 higher	 fuel	 prices	 and	 widespread	 global	

inflation.	 Nevertheless,	 the	 IR	 team	 continued	 to	 maintain	 an	

active	dialogue	with	the	investment	community	through	various	

available	meeting	platforms.

During	 the	 year,	 the	 number	 of	 engagements	 with	 analysts	

and	 investors	 was	 598	 through	 a	 planned	 investor	 relations	

programme,	 i.e.	 investor	 conferences/non-deal	 roadshows	

and	corporate	days,	engagement	sessions	with	the	investment	

community	 through	 one-on-one/group	 meetings,	 analyst	

briefings	 for	 financial	 results	 as	 well	 as	 engagement	 through

Auditors.	The	Board	has	set	a	policy	on	External	Auditors	which	stipulates	
the	guidelines	and	procedures	 for	 the	Board	and	 the	BAC	to	assess	and	
monitor	the	performance	and	independence	of	the	External	Auditors.

The	policy	covers	Selection	and	Appointment,	Independence,	Conflict	of	
Interest,	 Non-Audit	 Services,	 Rotation	 of	 Audit	 Partner	 (applies	 to	 lead	
audit	 engagement	 partner),	 Annual	 Reporting,	 Annual	 Assessment	 and	
Audit	Fees.

The	appointed	Audit	Partner	by	the	External	Auditors	is	subject	to	rotation	
at	 least	 every	 five	 (5)	 Financial	 Years,	 and	 a	 two	 (2)	 year	 gap	 before	
returning	as	Audit	Partner	for	the	engagement.

The	External	Auditors	can	also	be	engaged	to	perform	non-audit	services	
provided	such	services	do	not	impair	either	in	fact	or	appearance	the	auditors’	 

objectivity,	 judgment	 or	 independence.	 The	 External	 Auditors	 are	
required	to	provide	their	written	assurance	of	meeting	the	independence	
requirements	 for	 each	 non-audit	 service	 undertaken	 by	 them	 for	 TNB	
Group.

The	prohibition	of	non-audit	services	is	based	on	three	(3)	basic	principles,	
that	 the	 External	 Auditors	 cannot	 function	 in	 the	 role	 of	 Management;	
cannot	audit	their	own	work;	and	cannot	serve	in	an	advocacy	role	of	TNB	
Group.

The	External	Auditors	shall	observe	and	comply	with	the	By-Laws	of	MIA	
in	relation	to	the	provision	of	non-audit	services	and,	 if	necessary,	apply	
safeguards	as	stipulated	in	the	By-Laws	of	MIA.

The	 Board,	 through	 the	 BAC,	 at	 its	 meeting	 on	 24	 February	 2022	 had	
approved	 the	 review	 of	 External	 Auditors	 Policy	 in	 accordance	 with	
Practice	9.2	of	the	MCCG,	whereby	the	BAC	has	a	policy	that	requires	a	
former	partner	of	 the	External	Auditors	of	TNB	to	observe	a	cooling-off	
period	of	at	least	three	(3)	years	before	being	appointed	as	a	member	of	
the	BAC.	Apart	from	that,	the	said	review	also	is	in	line	with	the	inclusion	
of	Guidance	9.3	of	the	MCCG,	of	which	the	annual	assessment	of	External	
Auditors	 should	 also	 consider	 information	 presented	 in	 the	 Annual	
Transparency	Report	of	the	audit	firm.

The	BAC	assists	the	Board	in	assessing	whether	the	independence	of	the	External	Auditors	has	been	maintained,	having	regard	to	any	non-audit	related	

services.	The	BAC	considered	the	provision	of	non-audit	fees	by	the	External	Auditors	for	the	non-audit	services	provided	to	the	Group	and	the	Company	

during	the	Financial	Year	and	concluded	that	the	provision	of	these	fees	does	not	compromise	or	impair	the	External	Auditors’	independence	or	objectivity.

The	amount	of	Audit	and	Non-Audit	Fees	paid	or	payable	to	PwC	or	its	affiliates	by	the	Company	and	TNB	Group	for	the	Financial	Year	ended	31	December	

2022 is as follows :

Group
RM million

Company 
RM million

Statutory	Audit 8.5 1.4

Audit	Related	Services 1.9 1.4

Total 10.4 2.8

Non-Audit	Services	:

-	 Tax	Related	Services 0.2 0.1

-	 Other	Non-Audit	Services 1.5 0.2

Total 1.7 0.3

The	Non-Audit	Fees	did	not	exceed	50%	of	the	Audit	Fees	for	the	Financial	

Year	under	review,	in	line	with	TNB’s	External	Auditors	Policy.	

All	 services	 were	 procured	 competitively	 in	 accordance	 with	 TNB’s	

Procurement	&	Supply	Chain	Policy	and	Procedures	and	External	Auditors	

Policy.	Non-audit	services	can	be	offered	by	the	External	Auditors	of	the	

Group	if	there	are	clear	efficiencies	and	value	added	benefits	to	the	Group.	

Based	on	the	External	Auditors	Assessment	Results	for	the	Financial	Year	

2022,	 overall,	 the	 Company	 was	 highly	 satisfied/satisfied,	 with	 a	 score	

of	93.3%,	a	 slight	decrease	of	2.8%	compared	 to	 the	previous	Financial	

Year,	with	the	services	provided	by	PwC	in	term	of	quality,	sufficiency	of	

resources,	communication	and	interaction	and	independence,	objectivity	

and	professional	skepticism.	All	comments	made	were	forwarded	to	PwC	

in	order	to	further	improve	their	services.	

With	 that,	 the	 Board/BAC	 are	 satisfied	 with	 the	 quality	 of	 service,	

sufficiency	 of	 resources,	 communication	 and	 interaction	 and	

independence,	objectivity	and	professional	skepticism	demonstrated	by	

PwC	in	carrying	out	its	duties	as	External	Auditors.	

Being	 satisfied	 with	 the	 External	 Auditors’	 performance,	 the	 Board	

recommends	their	re-appointment	for	shareholders’	approval	at	the	AGM.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
AND INTERNAL CONTROL

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

Risk	 management	 in	 TNB	 is	 governed	 by	 the	 TNB	 Risk	 Management	

Framework,	 which	 adopts	 the	 principles	 and	 guidelines	 set	 out	 in	 

ISO	 31000:2018,	 ‘Risk	 Management	 -	 Guidelines’.	 This	 framework	

provides	 a	 structured	 and	 consistent	 approach	 for	 risk	 management	

implementation	across	the	Group.	The	purpose	of	risk	management	is	to	

create	and	protect	value	and	this	is	exemplified	through	each	element	in	

the	TNB	Risk	Management	Framework.	

The	framework	has	been	approved	by	the	Board	Risk	Committee	(BRC)	and	

is	 reviewed	 annually.	 The	 implementation	of	 the	TNB	Risk	Management	

Framework	is	documented	through	six	risk	governance	documents,	which	

are	the	TNB	Risk	Management	Framework,	TNB	Risk	Management	Policy,	

TNB	 Risk	 Assessment	 Process,	 Risk	 Review,	 Risk	 Report	 and	 Key	 Risk	

Indicator.	

The	TNB	Risk	Management	Framework	document	describes	 the	 criteria	

and	 frequency	 of	 revision	 of	 these	 risk	 governance	 documents	 and	 the	

levels	of	approving	authority	to	ensure	the	documents	are	robust,	practical	

for	implementation	and	reflective	of	the	internal	and	external	context.	In	

the	year	under	 review,	 revisions	 for	clarity	 in	 the	TNB	Risk	Management	

Framework	 document	 were	 deliberated	 on	 and	 approved	 by	 the	 Group	

Risk	Management	Working	Committee	(GRMWC).

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY

The	TNB	Risk	Management	Policy	is	a	statement	of	the	overall	intention	and	

direction	of	the	Group	on	risk	management.	It	describes	the	commitment	 

of	 the	 Group	 to	 assessing	 risks	 in	 alignment	 with	 business	 objectives,	

integrating	 risk	 management	 in	 all	 decision-making	 processes,	

anticipating	 potential	 risks	 in	 response	 to	 changes	 in	 the	 internal	 and	

external	environments	and	ensuring	that	risk	information	is	communicated	

through	a	clear	and	robust	monitoring	and	reporting	structure.	

The	policy	emphasises	the	role	of	all	TNB	employees,	who	are	responsible	

and	accountable	for	managing	risks	related	to	their	actions	and	decisions	

by	taking	all	reasonable	care	to	minimise	losses,	maximise	opportunities	

and	ensure	TNB’s	reputation	is	upheld.

204 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
AND INTERNAL CONTROL

LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT

The	 TNB	 Risk	 Management	 Structure	 depicts	 the	 leadership	 and	 commitment	 of	 the	 Board	 and	

Management	in	the	escalation	and	cascading	of	risk	information	across	all	levels.	

The	 establishment	 of	 the	 BRC	 reaffirms	

the	 Board’s	 commitment	 to	 ensuring	 that	

the	 Group	 has	 in	 place	 a	 sound	 and	 robust	

enterprise	 risk	 management	 framework	 and	

that	 the	 framework	 has	 been	 effectively	

implemented	 to	 enhance	 the	 Group’s	 ability	

to	achieve	its	strategic	objectives.	The	BRC	is	

supported	by	Management	through	the	Group	

Executive	 Management	 Committee	 chaired	

by	 the	 President/Chief	 Executive	Officer,	 the	 

cross-functional	GRMWC	and	Subsidiaries	Risk	

Management	 Working	 Committee	 (SRMWC),	

as well as the Risk Management Department 

led	 by	 the	 Chief	 Risk	 Officer.	 Assurances	

are	 provided	 to	 the	 Board	 and	 Management	

through	internal	and	external	audits.	

In	 the	 year	 under	 review,	 the	 BRC	 convened	

seven	 sittings	 to	 deliberate	 risk	 issues	 and	

key	 risk	 indicators,	 as	 well	 as	 reviewing	

the	 effectiveness	 of	 appropriate	 systems	

to	 manage	 risks.	 The	 business	 entities	

provided	 assurances	 to	 the	 BRC	 of	 their	 risk	 

management	 and	 internal	 controls,	 assisting	

the	 Board	 in	 its	 decision-making,	 especially	

in the management of potential risks that 

could	 prevent	 the	 Group	 from	 achieving	 its	

objectives.

RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 

TNB	business	entities	are	guided	by	the	TNB	Risk	Assessment	Process	that	provides	a	structured	approach	to	 identifying,	analysing,	evaluating	and	

treating	 risks.	 TNB	business	 entities	 apply	 the	 process	 in	 a	 systematic,	 iterative	 and	 collaborative	manner,	 drawing	 on	 the	 knowledge	 and	 views	 of	

stakeholders	to	develop	their	respective	risk	profiles.	

The	TNB	Risk	Assessment	Process	was	applied	in	the	assessment	of	the	TNB	Strategic	Risks	that	could	prevent	the	Group	from	achieving	its	Reimagining	

TNB	strategies,	considering	internal	and	external	factors.	Annual	revisions	of	these	risks	were	approved	by	the	BRC	in	the	year	under	review	and	the	10	

TNB	Strategic	Risks	are	described	below	:

CATEGORY NO. RISK

External 1. Catastrophic disruptions from external factors 
TNB	 business	 entities	 are	 exposed	 to	 unpredictable	 external	 events	 that	 could	 catastrophically	 impact	 business	

operations,	profitability	and	reputation.	Examples	of	external	 factors	are	pandemics,	cybersecurity	attacks,	economic	

trade	wars,	extreme	weather	events,	etc.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
AND INTERNAL CONTROL

CATEGORY NO. RISK

Sustainability 2. Inability to keep pace with Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) developments and transitions globally 
It	 is	vital	 that	TNB	aligns	 itself	with	global	ESG	commitments	and	frameworks	to	 fulfil	 its	purpose	of	brightening	 lives	

through	innovative	and	sustainable	solutions	for	a	better	world.	Failure	to	do	so	could	erode	market	confidence	in	TNB	as	

a	sustainable	company,	adversely	affecting	employee	morale	and	damaging	TNB’s	reputation.

Regulatory 3. Unfavourable energy transition & climate change policies & regulations 
TNB	has	established	its	Reimagining	TNB	aspiration,	strategies	and	targets	to	be	met	in	2025,	anchored	on	the	energy	

transition	theme.	Changes	in	policies	and	regulations	relating	to	energy	transition	and	climate	change	may	impact	TNB’s	

ability	to	achieve	the	2025	aspiration	and	targets.

4. Unfavourable ESI regulatory implementation and outcomes
The	energy	sector	is	a	highly	regulated	sector,	and	any	changes	in	regulations	will	heavily	impact	our	business	continuity.	

TNB’s	regulated	business	is	dependent	on	favourable	decisions	arising	from	other	regulated	policies	and	directions,	e.g.	

ICPT,	Annual	Regulatory	Adjustment,	political	scenario,	MESI	reform,	etc.

5. Regulatory uncertainty
Due	to	their	nature	of	business,	TNB	business	entities	are	susceptible	 to	decisions	by	 regulatory	stakeholders	at	 the	

federal,	state	and	international	levels.	Business	operations	may	be	delayed	or	encumbered	due	to	measures	and	decisions	

in	relation	to	investment	and	divestment,	use	of	natural	resources,	right-of-way,	etc.

Market 6. Unable to be competitive in non-regulated business (international & domestic)
TNB	 is	 diversifying	 its	 business	 into	 non-regulated	 segments,	 both	 domestically	 and	 internationally.	However,	 these	

markets	are	highly	competitive	and	challenging,	making	it	difficult	for	TNB	to	participate	in	and	compete.

Customers 7. Inability to remain as the electricity provider of choice for customers
TNB	supplies	electricity	to	the	entire	nation	and	needs	to	continue	doing	so	in	a	reliable,	safe	and	high-quality	manner	

to	retain	the	trust	and	confidence	of	customers.	Failure	to	deliver	the	above	could	lead	to	customer	dissatisfaction	and	

disengagement,	inability	to	capture	potential	business	growth	and	a	negative	image	and	reputation.

Finance 8. Ineffective capital allocation to maximise value creation
Effective	sourcing	and	allocation	of	funds	is	important	to	enhance	operational	efficiency,	growth	and	financial	stability	to	

ensure	fair	returns	to	shareholders.	Ineffectiveness	could	lead	to	missed	opportunities,	reduction	of	financial	profits	and	

decreased	market	confidence.

Capabilities 9. Gaps in workforce capabilities to deliver Reimagining TNB strategy and sustainability aspiration
It	 is	 critical	 for	TNB	 to	develop	 and	deploy	new	 institutional	 capabilities	 to	 the	 right	 areas	 in	 the	organisation	 and	 to	

increase	workforce	diversity	(skill	sets,	exposure,	gender,	etc.)	in	line	with	TNB’s	sustainability	aspiration.	Failure	to	close	

the	capabilities	gap	could	impact	TNB’s	ability	to	achieve	its	long-term	strategy	and	aspirations.

10. Failure to ingrain TNB culture in employees’ behaviour in supporting Reimagining TNB strategy and sustainability 
aspiration
Culture	moulds	the	direction,	beliefs	and	shared	values	that	shape	employee	perception,	behaviour	and	understanding	

across	all	levels	in	TNB,	including	the	Board.	Failure	to	effectively	ingrain	the	Reimagining	Culture	values	in	the	organisation	

and	processes	may	result	in	lower	productivity,	fraud	and	bribery,	a	silo	mentality,	etc.



WE	ARE	TNB FROM	OUR	LEADERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY	STATEMENT

206 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

REVIEW, MONITOR AND REPORT

The	BRC	 approved	 the	TNB	Three-Year	Cycle	Risk	Governance	Plan	 for	

implementation	 from	 FY2022	 to	 FY2024.	 This	 plan	 was	 implemented	

by	the	Risk	Management	Department	to	assist	the	BRC	 in	ensuring	that	

TNB	 business	 entities	 have	 in	 place	 a	 sound	 and	 robust	 enterprise	 risk	

management	 framework	 which	 is	 being	 implemented	 effectively.	 The	

plan	 outlines	 three	 (3)	 risk	 governance	 activities,	 which	 are	 risk	 review,	

risk	 maturity	 assessment	 and	 desktop	 risk	 assessment.	 In	 accordance	

with	 the	 plan,	 the	 Risk	 Management	 Department,	 in	 collaboration	 with	

TNB	 business	 entities,	 conducted	 15	 risk	 reviews,	 five	 (5)	 risk	maturity	

assessments	 and	 eight	 (8)	 desktop	 risk	 assessments	 in	 the	 year	 under	

review.	

As	per	the	TNB	Risk	Management	Framework,	TNB	business	entities	are	

responsible	 for	 assessing	 their	 respective	 risks	 and	 registering	 them	 in	

the	 TNB	 Risk	 Information	 System	 (TRIS),	 a	 centralised	 online	 real-time	

tool	and	database,	for	monitoring	and	reporting.	Risks	are	also	reviewed	

annually	by	the	business	entities	with	participation	and	eventual	approval	

from	the	risk	owners.	

Half-yearly	risk	reports	are	submitted	by	the	business	entities	to	the	Risk	

Management	 Department	 for	 consolidation.	 Group-wide	 consolidated	 

half-yearly	 risk	 reports,	 which	 include	 reports	 of	 emerging	 risks,	

are	 deliberated	 on	 and	 endorsed	 by	 the	 GRMWC	 for	 onward	 internal	

dissemination.	

KEY RISK INDICATORS

Key	 Risk	 Indicators	 (KRIs)	 that	 provide	 early	 warning	 of	 increasing	 risk	

exposures	and	potential	risk	events	have	been	developed	by	the	business	

entities.	These	KRIs	are	developed	with	the	risk	appetite	of	the	BRC	and	

TNB	Management	in	mind.	The	status	of	KRIs	is	reported	quarterly	to	the	

BRC,	GRMWC	and	SRMWC	and	mitigating	measures	are	deliberated	on	to	

prevent	risk	exposures	from	escalating	beyond	tolerable	levels.	

The	KRIs	are	escalated	and	reported	to	the	BRC	to	monitor	risks	that	would	

impact	five	(5)	areas,	which	are	operations,	financial	standing,	regulatory,	

reputation	 and	 international	 investment.	 Other	 operational	 KRIs	 that	

are	 deliberated	 on	 by	 the	 GRMWC	 and	 SRMWC	 enable	 inter-business	

collaboration	to	mitigate	risks	from	a	Group-wide	perspective.	

The	KRIs	are	 reviewed	annually	 for	 relevancy	and	adequacy,	 considering	 

short-	and	long-term	business	objectives	and	changes	in	the	internal	and	

external	environments.	

COMMUNICATION & INTEGRATION

The	 business	 entities	 regularly	 communicate	with	 internal	 and	 external	

stakeholders	 with	 up-to-date	 risk	 information	 and	 timely	 feedback	 is	

collated	 for	 continual	 improvement.	 It	 is	 the	 role	 of	 the	 business	 entity	

to	 ensure	 risk	management	 forms	 part	 of	 and	 is	 not	 separate	 from,	 its	

objectives,	 governance,	 leadership	 and	 commitment,	 operations	 and	

performance	management.

In	the	year	under	review,	five	(5)	risk	conferences	were	organised	by	the	

Risk Management Department with total participation from approximately 

466	TNB	 executives	 and	 non-executives.	 These	 events	were	 organised	

once	 restrictions	 were	 relaxed	 post-pandemic	 and	 the	 face-to-face	

interactions	were	well	received	by	participants	and	achieved	the	objective	

of	driving	the	message	on	the	importance	of	integrating	risk	management	

in	daily	operations	and	decision-making.	

Additionally,	webinars	continued	to	be	conducted	in	collaboration	with	the	

TNB	business	entities	and	in	the	year	under	review,	458	employees	were	

engaged	 through	 six	 (6)	webinars.	 These	webinars	 aimed	 to	 strengthen	

employees’	 risk-thinking	 mindsets	 through	 practical	 applications	 of	

the	 TNB	 Risk	 Management	 and	 TNB	 Business	 Continuity	 Management	

frameworks.	

The	 BRC	 continually	 communicates	 its	 tone	 from	 the	 top,	 emphasising	

the	 importance	 of	 effective	 risk	 management	 and	 strong	 risk	 culture.	 

Pre-pandemic,	 an	 annual	 risk	 forum	 held	 with	 the	 BRC	 was	 conducted	 

in-person	for	that	purpose.	However,	in	FY2022,	a	video	of	BRC	members	

was	produced	for	the	same	purpose	and	communicated	to	Management	

and	employees	through	relevant	platforms	such	as	management	meetings	

and	risk	conferences.	 In	2023,	the	BRC	will	continue	to	communicate	 its	

tone	from	the	top	through	the	annual	risk	forum.	

The	tone	 from	the	top	on	risk	management	and	 its	benefits	was	 further	

cascaded	 by	Management	 to	 employees	 via	 videos	 of	 each	member	 of	

Management	that	were	produced	and	uploaded	to	TNB's	intranet	for	easy	

viewing,	downloading	and	sharing.	

In	 collaboration	 with	 TNB	 Integrated	 Learning	 Solution	 (ILSAS),	 the	

centre	 for	 energy	 learning,	 advisory,	 services	 and	 consultancy,	 the	 Risk	

Management	 Department	 continued	 to	 drive	 risk	management	 training	

modules	 at	 the	 fundamental	 and	 intermediate	 levels.	 In	 the	 year	 under	

review,	a	total	of	55	employees	completed	the	fundamental	module	and	

70	 employees	 completed	 the	 intermediate	module.	 In	 addition,	 five	 (5)

Malaysia	(ARiMM)	and	were	recognised	as	Certified	Risk	Managers.	

CULTURE

The	 risk	 culture	 described	 in	 the	 TNB	 Risk	 Management	 Framework	 is	

aligned	with	the	six	 (6)	TNB	core	values	and	behaviours.	The	application	

of	these	core	values	and	behaviours	are	described	in	a	risk	management	

context	 to	 provide	 clear	 guidance	 and	 communicate	 the	 expected	

behaviour	of	employees	in	building	a	sustainable	risk	culture.

The	procedures	for	critical	functions	and	key	activities	are	documented,	

communicated	 to	 employees	 and	 periodically	 reviewed.	 Relevant	

business	entities	have	been	consistently	maintaining	their	certifications	

in	 ISO	 9001,	 ISO	 14001,	 ISO	 27001,	 ISO	 37001,	 ISO	 45001	 and	 

ISO	 55001.	 Internal	 audits	 are	 conducted	 to	 ensure	 compliance	 with	

relevant	standards	and	procedures.	

STRATEGIC PLANNING AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT CYCLE

A	 holistic	 strategic	 planning	 process	 is	 integral	 to	 providing	 focus	 and	

alignment	between	aspiration,	strategies,	performance	management	and	

the	desired	strategic	outcomes.	The	Strategic	Planning	and	Performance	

Management	 (SPPM)	 cycle	 approved	 by	 the	 Board	 depicts	 a	 5-part	

cycle	 that	 integrates	 the	 capital	 and	 budget	 allocation	 process	 with	

the	 performance	 management	 cycle.	 It	 includes	 the	 identification	 of	 

strategy-driven	 Key	 Performance	 Indicators	 (KPIs)	 based	 on	 long-term	

business	plans	and	annual	operating	plans,	which	are	thereafter	cascaded	

to	all	levels	of	employees.	The	strategy-driven	KPI	methodology	is	derived	

from	 the	 Balanced	 Scorecard	 concept	 that	 focuses	 on	 performance	

measures	from	four	perspectives,	which	are	financial,	customer,	 internal	

process	and	learning	and	growth.

are	embedded	in	business	operations.	These	policies	and	procedures	are	consistently	reviewed	for	relevance	and	effectiveness.	

Among	others,	the	Group	policies	and	procedures	in	place	are	:

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK

TNB	Group	Financial	Policies	and	Procedures	(GFPP)	serve	as	a	compulsory	

source	of	reference	for	the	Group	in	conducting	its	operations	to	manage	

associated	 risks.	 The	 Group	 has	 acted	 in	 accordance	 with	 generally	

accepted	 accounting	 principles	 and	 the	 Malaysian	 Financial	 Reporting	

Standards.	Periodic	reviews	of	actual	performance	versus	budgets,	targets	

and	performance	in	prior	periods	for	key	functions	and	major	initiatives	are	

carried	out	and	appropriate	mitigating	and	follow-up	actions	are	taken.	

The	Board	Audit	Committee	(BAC)	reviews	the	Group’s	quarterly	financial	

performance	 together	 with	 TNB	 Management	 and	 this	 is	 subsequently	

reported	to	the	Board.	The	quarterly	reviews	enable	the	BAC	to	deliberate	

on	and	assess	the	Group’s	financial	results	and	operational	performance.	

TNB	 continues	 to	 proactively	 engage	 with	 relevant	 stakeholders	 for	

smooth	 implementation	 of	 the	 IBR	 framework.	 The	 performance	 of	

the	 regulated	 business	 is	 meticulously	 monitored	 through	 the	 IBR	

performance	indicators	and	dashboards.	These	are	reported	regularly	to	

relevant	decision-making	committees	to	ensure	effective	implementation	

of	the	IBR	framework,	as	well	as	to	the	Energy	Commission	in	compliance	

with	the	IBR	guidelines.

for	 the	 Utilities	 Sector	 (Electricity)	 Version	 2.0	
(Code	 of	 Practice),	 which	 serves	 as	 a	 guide	 for	 the

educating	 and	 communicating	 the	 requirements	 of	
the	PDPA	and	the	Code	of	Practice	across	the	Group	
to	 heighten	 awareness	 and	 compliance,	 as	 well	 as	
enhancing	controls.

TNB Corporate Integrity Management System 

The	 TNB	 Corporate	 Integrity	 Management	 System	
(TCIMS)	 is	 in	 place	 to	 improve	 the	 integrity	 culture	
in	 the	 Group,	 reduce	 the	 impact	 of	 corruption	
or	 mismanagement	 and	 position	 TNB	 at	 par	
internationally	 through	 a	 strategic	 and	 structured	
integrity	management	system.	TNB	is	certified	with	
ISO	37001:2016	Anti-Bribery	Management	Systems	
and	has	put	in	place	a	management	system	designed	
to	 help	 prevent,	 detect	 and	 respond	 to	 bribery	
and	 comply	 with	 anti-bribery	 laws	 and	 voluntary	
commitments	 applicable	 to	 its	 activities.	 Annually,	
TNB	 employees	 complete	 the	 Integrity	 Pledge	 and	
Conflict	 of	 Interest	 declarations	 via	 the	 Employee	
Self	 Service	 system	 and	 the	 Integrity	 E-learning	
module	 via	 the	 People	 Matters	 Better	 Brighter	
system.

In	 addition,	 the	 Integrity	 Department	 designs	 and	
implements	 an	 annual	 training	 and	 communication	

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT

Job	descriptions	and	responsibilities	of	approved	positions	are	clearly	defined	and	communicated	
through	 the	 internal	 online	 platform,	 People	 Matters.	 Workforce	 requirements	 planning	 is	
carried	out	and	led	by	Group	Human	Resource,	mirroring	the	budget	planning	cycle	with	the	aim	
of	optimising	staffing	levels	and	increasing	productivity.	Employee	training	needs	are	regularly	
assessed	and	various	programmes	are	in	place	to	address	competency	gaps.

Moreover,	 effective	 succession	 management	 improves	 organisational	 ability	 to	 maintain	
continuity	of	operations	with	minimal	disruption	and	benefits	both	the	employees	by	preparing	
them	 to	 be	 strong	 talents	 and	 the	 organisation	 by	 facilitating	 smooth	 transitions.	 The	 TNB	
Succession Management Framework aims to ensure the succession management strategy is 
agile	 and	 in	 line	with	 current	 and	 projected	 business	 objectives	 by	 defining	 critical	 positions,	
nominating	and	evaluating	talents,	identifying	development	needs	and	reviewing	and	adapting	
to	business	needs.	

HEALTHCARE & WELLNESS MANAGEMENT

The	TNB	Total	Wellness	Programme,	which	aims	to	educate	and	influence	employees	towards	a	
healthy	lifestyle	and	work-life	balance,	continues	to	be	implemented	through	the	'Vibrant	Living	
–	Healthier.	Together'	initiative.	This	initiative	focuses	on	six	(6)	scopes,	which	are	healthy	diet,	
no	 smoking/vaping,	 active	 lifestyle,	 weight	management,	 basic	 health	 screening	 and	mental	
well-being.	 Weekly	 “Wellness	 Wednesday”	 health	 talks	 and	 awareness	 sessions	 conducted	
online	are	open	to	all	employees	and	retirees	with	the	aim	of	increasing	awareness	on	common	
health	issues	and	encouraging	healthier	habits.

TNB DIGITAL STRATEGY

The	TNB	Digital	Strategy	was	established	to	lay	the	necessary	digital	foundations	and	direction	in	
supporting	the	RT	strategies.	The	digital	strategy	is	implemented	through	five	(5)	streams	:	first,	
identifying	the	digital	vision	and	value	 levers	for	ten	key	business	entities;	second,	developing	
a	clear	plan	for	attracting	and	developing	the	right	digital	talents	and	for	cultural	change;	third,	
enhancing	digital	architecture	readiness	to	support	business	imperatives;	fourth,	establishing	a	
digital	operating	model,	factory	and	skills	hub	to	host	critical	in-demand	skills	and	fifth,	building	
a	governance	and	value	realisation	framework.	

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

Leveraging	 information	 and	 communications	 technology	 is	 vital	 in	 promoting	 effective	 and	
efficient	business	operations	as	well	as	timely	and	accurate	communications	with	 internal	and	
external	stakeholders.

plan	to	ensure	a	comprehensive	and	diversified	approach	in	institutionalising	
the	 integrity	culture	 in	TNB.	Highlights	of	 the	 training	and	communication	
plan	include	an	Integrity	Day,	 integrity	e-learning	for	staff	and	vendors	and	
joint	 programmes	 with	 the	 Malaysian	 Anti-Corruption	 Commission.	 The	
progress	 of	 the	 plan	 is	 updated	 to	 the	 Board	 Integrity	 Committee	 on	 a	
quarterly	basis,	which	is	a	part	of	the	monitoring	and	reporting	mechanism	
in	place	for	integrity	development.	

TENAGA SAFETY CULTURE 

The Tenaga Safety Culture programme aims to inculcate safety as part 
of	 the	 everyday	working	 culture,	 transforming	 it	 from	 a	mere	 compliance	
activity.	 It	 is	 based	 on	 four	 core	 behaviours,	which	 are	 ‘Assess’,	 ‘Comply’,	
‘Intervene’	and	‘Actively	Caring’.	Various	initiatives	are	implemented	to	instil	
these	core	behaviours	in	each	employee,	including	from	a	spiritual	approach	
to	align	good	safety	practices	with	religious	teachings.	With	the	convenience	
of	 a	 mobile	 application	 called	 HSE	 Wallet	 that	 was	 developed	 in-house,	
employees	are	encouraged	to	proactively	observe	and	report	unsafe	acts	or	
conditions	as	potential	incidents	and	notices,	compounds	or	lawsuits.	

The Nampak, Dengar & Rasa Selamat	 (NDRS)	 programme	 was	 launched	
to	 reinforce	 strong	 safety	 culture	 values	 in	 all	 employees.	 The	 NDRS	
programme	 encourages	 employees	 to	 be	 sensitive	 to	 their	 surroundings,	
evaluate	potential	health	and	safety	risks,	comply	with	safety	requirements	
and	 take	 proactive	 action	 to	 prevent	 risks	 from	materialising.	 The	 NDRS	
framework	 includes	three	elements,	which	are	engineering,	education	and	
enforcement	and	is	supported	by	a	consequence	management	process	that	
rewards	safe	behaviour	and	practices	and	penalises	non-compliance.	

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

With	regard	to	customer-centricity,	a	variety	of	channels,	utilising	the	'Click,	 
Call,	Come	Over'	platform,	are	made	available	to	customers.	The	platform	
covers	a	wide	 range	of	 touchpoints	 that	enable	quality	 solutions,	 services	
and	 continuous	 interaction	 options	 to	 enhance	 customer	 experience.	 A	
systematic	 approach	 is	 in	 place	 for	 timely	 resolution	 of	 feedback	 such	 as	
service	requests,	complaints,	comments,	enquiries	and	concerns.	In	addition,	
the	myTNB	web	portal	and	mobile	application	are	available	to	customers	to	
manage	their	electricity	account(s)	in	one	location.	myTNB	allows	customers	
to	make	express	payment	of	electricity	bills	without	needing	to	log	in.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT

The	TNB	Business	Continuity	Management	(BCM)	Framework	was	developed	
in	 alignment	 with	 ISO	 22301:2019	 Security	 and	 Resilience	 –	 Business	
Continuity	 Management	 Systems.	 The	 framework	 provides	 a	 structured	
approach	 to	 managing	 business	 continuity	 in	 the	 Group,	 allowing	 for	 a	
quick,	coordinated	and	effective	response	to	a	crisis	while	maintaining	the	
continuity	of	essential	activities	and	protecting	human	life,	assets,	reputation	
and	the	environment.	The	framework	is	the	focal	point	of	reference	for	the	
business	entities	to	formulate	and	implement	business	continuity	strategies	
tailored	to	their	respective	business	objectives	and	critical	functions.	

The	 preparedness	 and	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Corporate	 Crisis	 Command	
Structure,	 of	 which	 the	 President/Chief	 Executive	 Officer	 and	 TNB	
Management	 are	 members,	 is	 tested	 annually	 through	 planned	 drills.	

The	 Board	 has	 obtained	 assurances	 from	 the	 President/Chief	 Executive	
Officer	 and	Chief	 Financial	Officer	 that	 the	Group’s	 risk	management	 and	
internal	control	system	is	operating	adequately	and	effectively,	in	all	material	
aspects.	Where	weaknesses	were	 identified,	 rectification	steps	have	been	
put	in	place.	

The	 Board	 is	 of	 the	 view	 that	 the	 risk	 management	 and	 internal	 control	
system	in	place	for	the	year	under	review	and	up	to	the	date	of	approval	of	this	
statement	for	 inclusion	into	the	annual	report	is	adequate	and	effective	to	
safeguard	shareholders’	investments,	the	interests	of	customers,	regulators	
and	employees	and	the	Group’s	assets.

CONCLUSION

As	 required	 by	 Paragraph	 15.23	 of	 the	 Bursa	 Malaysia	 Securities	 Berhad	
Main	 Market	 Listing	 Requirements,	 the	 external	 auditors	 have	 reviewed	
this	 Statement	 on	 Risk	 Management	 and	 Internal	 Control.	 Their	 limited	
assurance	 review	was	performed	 in	 accordance	with	Audit	 and	Assurance	
Practice	Guide	 (AAPG)	3	 issued	by	the	Malaysian	 Institute	of	Accountants.	
AAPG	3	 does	 not	 require	 the	 external	 auditors	 to	 form	an	opinion	on	 the	
adequacy	 and	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 risk	management	 and	 internal	 control	
systems	of	the	Group.	

This	statement	 is	made	 in	accordance	with	 the	 resolution	of	 the	Board	of	
Directors	dated	20	March	2023.

REVIEW OF THE STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITOR

Improvements	 identified	 in	 drill	 post-mortems	 are	 implemented	 to	
enhance	 capabilities	 and	 readiness.	 Additionally,	 in	 preparation	 for	 the	
anticipated	monsoon	season,	drills	with	flood	scenarios	were	conducted	at	
state	and	regional	levels	in	collaboration	with	the	relevant	business	entities	
to	enhance	coordination	and	resiliency.	Specific	business	continuity	plans	
were	also	developed	and	tested	to	ensure	available	and	reliable	electricity	
supply	throughout	the	period	of	the	nation’s	15th	General	Election.

To	further	strengthen	prompt	and	coordinated	response	during	crises,	in	the	 
year	 under	 review,	 strategic	 engagements	 were	 carried	 out	 with	
relevant	 government	 agencies.	 Knowledge	 exchange	 engagements	with	
government	agencies	such	as	the	National	Security	Council	and	National	
Disaster	 Management	 Agency	 (NADMA)	 were	 mutually	 beneficial	 in	
ensuring	effective	and	efficient	response	and	recovery	to	crises	affecting	
the	nation.	A	key	outcome	of	the	engagements	was	a	successful	tabletop	
exercise	 carried	 out	 in	 collaboration	 with	 NADMA	 in	 September	 2022,	
replicating	 the	 landslide	 crisis	 at	 Kenyir	 that	 occurred	 in	 February	 2022,	
with	the	objective	of	enhancing	preparedness	and	coordination	between	
relevant	parties	at	the	state	and	federal	levels.	

The	 TNB	 BCM	 Framework	 and	 continuity	 strategies	 at	 corporate	 and	
business entity levels were essential in the management of crises in the 
year	under	review	such	as	the	pandemic,	floods,	landslides	and	electricity	
supply	interruptions.	In	the	management	of	these	crises,	key	information	
was	escalated	to	the	Corporate	Crisis	Management	Team	chaired	by	the	
President/Chief	 Executive	 Officer	 via	 dashboard	 reporting	 at	 regular	
intervals.

STATUTORY INFORMATION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(a) Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps:

(i) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of provision for doubtful debts and 

satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate provision had been made for doubtful debts; and

(ii) to ensure that any current assets, which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business, including the values of current assets 

as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an amount which the current assets might be 

expected so to realise.

(b) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:

(i) which would render the amount written off for bad debts or the amount of the provision for doubtful debts inadequate to any substantial 

extent; or

(ii) which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading; or

(iii) which have arisen and would render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company 

misleading or inappropriate.

(c) At the date of this report:

(i) there are no charges on the assets of the Group and of the Company which have arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the 

liabilities of any other person; and

(ii) there are no contingent liabilities in the Group and in the Company which have arisen since the end of the financial year.

 

(d) No contingent or other liability of any company in the Group has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve 

months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may affect the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to 

meet their obligations when they fall due.

(e) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements of 

the Group and of the Company which would render any amount stated in the respective financial statements misleading.

(f) In the opinion of the Directors:

(i) the results of the operations of the Group and of the Company during the financial year were not substantially affected by any item,  

transaction or event of a material and unusual nature; and

(ii) there has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report any item, transaction or event of a material 

and unusual nature likely to affect substantially the results of the operations of the Group and of the Company for the financial year in which 

this report is made.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2022

1 GENERAL INFORMATION

 The Group and the Company are primarily involved in the business of the generation, transmission, distribution and sales of electricity and those 
tabulated in Note 7 to these financial statements, which also includes the details of the subsidiaries of the Group.

 There have been no significant changes in these activities of the Group and of the Company during the financial year.

 The Group and the Company follow the Incentive Based Regulation (‘IBR’) framework for the regulated business.

 The Company is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia and is listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities 
Berhad.

 The address of the registered office of the Company is Pejabat Setiausaha Syarikat, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (‘TNB’), Tingkat 16, Tower A, TNB 
Platinum, No. 3, Jalan Bukit Pantai, Bangsar, 59100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

 The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been approved for issuance in accordance with a resolution of Board of Directors on 
20 March 2023.

2 BASIS OF PREPARATION 

 The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘MFRS’), International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. 
The Directors continue to consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

 The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in Note 3 and respective notes in the 
financial statements.

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. It also requires Directors to exercise their judgement in the 
process of applying the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgements are based on the Directors’ 
best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas 
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

(a) Amendments to published standards that are effective and applicable to the Group and the Company.

 Effective for financial year beginning on 1 January 2022:

Amendments to MFRS 3 Business Combinations Reference to the Conceptual Framework

Amendments to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments Fees in the ‘10 per cent’ test for Derecognition of Financial 

Liabilities 

Amendments to MFRS 16 Leases COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021

Amendments to MFRS 116 Property, Plant and Equipment Proceeds before Intended Use

Amendments to MFRS 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 

Contingent Assets 

Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract

 
 The amendments to published standards listed above did not have any significant impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are 

not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

 The adoption of the above applicable new standard and amendments to published standards are not expected to have a material impact on 
the financial statements of the Group and of the Company.

 Based on the assessments performed, adoption of MFRS 17 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group and therefore, it will be applied prospectively.

 There are no other standards, amendments and improvements to published standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not 
effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group and the Company. 

3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Unless otherwise stated, the following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in 
relation to the financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

(a) Subsidiaries and basis of consolidation

(i) Subsidiaries

 Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when:
• exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity;
• has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity; and
• the existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered only when such rights are substantive when assessing control.

 In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. On 
disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts are included in the statement 
of profit or loss.

3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(a) Subsidiaries and basis of consolidation (continued)

(ii) Basis of consolidation

 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. The characteristics of 
those financial statements are:
• the financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company.
• subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date 

that such control ceases. 
• intragroup balances, transactions and unrealised gains or losses are eliminated in full. 
• uniform accounting policies are adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar 

circumstances.

 The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The 
consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and 
fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets 
acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their 
fair value at the acquisition date.

 
 In a business combination achieved in stages, the carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is 

remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

 The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any NCI in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous 
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If 
this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the gain is recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss. Refer to Note 10 for accounting policy on goodwill.

 NCI is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group 
measures any NCI in the acquiree either at fair value or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. At the 
end of the reporting period, NCI consists of amount calculated on the date of combinations and its share of changes in the subsidiary’s 
equity since the date of combination.

 All earnings and losses of the subsidiary are attributed to the parent and the NCI, even if the attribution of losses to the NCI results in a 
debit balance in the shareholders’ equity.

(iii) Changes in ownership interest

 When the Group ceases to consolidate because of loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with 
the change in carrying amount recognised in the statement of profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the 
purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts 
previously recognised in OCI in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or 
liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in OCI are reclassified to statement of profit or loss. Gains or losses on 
the disposal of subsidiaries include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the subsidiaries sold.

(b) Transactions with NCI

 Transactions with NCI that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in 
ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and NCI to reflect their relative interests in the 
subsidiary. Any differences between the amount of the adjustment to NCI and any consideration paid or received are recognised in equity 
attributable to owners of the Group.

3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(c) Impairment of non-financial assets

 Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss for the amount by which the carrying 
amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and its value in use 
(‘VIU’). For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). 

 Non-financial assets other than goodwill previously impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Any 
subsequent increase in recoverable amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

(d) Research and development

 Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss as an expense as incurred.

 Expenditure on development activities, whereby the application research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or 
substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised only when all of the following criteria are fulfilled:
(i) it is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
(ii) management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
(iii) there is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
(iv) it can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
(v) adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available; and
(vi) the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured.

 Capitalised development costs are recognised as intangible assets and amortised from the point at which the asset is ready for use on a 
straight line method over its useful life.

 The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overheads costs that are directly attributable to preparing the 
assets for its intended use. Other development expenditure is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred. Development costs 
previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

 All other significant accounting policies are disclosed in their respective notes.

4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

 Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

 The Group and the Company make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely 
equate to the related actual results. To enhance the information content of the estimates, certain key variables that are anticipated to have a 
material impact on the Group’s and the Company’s results and financial positions are tested for sensitivity to changes in the underlying parameters.

 The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are outlined below:
(a) Impairment of associates

 The Group and the Company assess impairment of its investment in associates whenever the events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e. the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is measured 
at the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and its VIU. The VIU is the net present value of the projected future cash flow derived from the 
investment discounted at an appropriate discount rate. Projected future cash flows are based on the Group’s estimates calculated based on 
historical, sector and industry trends, general market and economic conditions, changes in technology and other available information. The 
assumptions used, results and sensitivity of the impairment assessments are disclosed in Note 9.

4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

 The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are outlined below: (continued)
(b) Impairment of intangible assets

 The Group tests intangible assets which includes goodwill for impairment annually in accordance with its accounting policy and whenever 
events or change in circumstances indicate that this is necessary within the financial period. This requires an estimation of the VIU of the cash 
generating unit (‘CGU’) to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the VIU requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future 
cash flows from the CGU to the Group and also to apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
The assumptions used, results and sensitivity of the impairment assessment of goodwill are disclosed in Note 10.

(c) Measurement of expected credit loss (‘ECL’) allowance for financial assets

 The loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group and the Company 
use judgements in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Group’s and the Company’s 
past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Details of key assumptions 
and inputs used are disclosed in Note 45.

(d) Restoration costs of leased assets

 The Group recognises a provision for restoration costs for leased assets where contracts contain an obligation to remove the asset after 
the end of the contract and to restore the site to its original condition. The estimates of the restoration costs are based on the quoted 
price given by the external contractor for a particular asset. The provision recognised is the present value of the estimated restoration costs 
discounted using a risk free pre-tax rate. An amount equivalent to the provision is recognised within PPE and ROU assets depending on which 
category the underlying asset is recognised, and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount on 
the provision is included in finance cost. The details of the provision are as disclosed in Note 28.

(e) Estimation of income taxes

(i) Income tax

 Income tax is estimated based on the rules governed under the Income Tax Act, 1967.

 Differences in determining the capital allowances, deductibility of certain expenses and subsequent utilisation of reinvestment 
allowance may arise during the estimation of the provision for income tax between tax calculated at the statement of financial position 
date, and the final submission to the tax authority as a result of obtaining further detailed information that may become available 
subsequent to the statement of financial position date.

 Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact 
the income tax provisions and deferred tax balance in the period in which such determination is made.

 The Group and the Company have recorded tax recoverable for which the Group and the Company believe that there is a reasonable basis 
for recognition. Where the final tax outcome of this matter is different from the amount that was initially recorded, such difference may 
cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the tax recoverable balance recorded in the period in which such determination 
is made.

 Reinvestment allowance (‘RIA’) litigation

 The Company and the Inland Revenue Board (‘IRB’) have entered into varies of litigation cases in respect of the Company’s eligibility for 
RIA. The details of the cases are as disclosed in Note 42.

 As at 31 December 2022, the Group and the Company recorded a tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million from the IRB arising from:
• Resubmission of tax computations for the Years of Assessment (‘YAs’) 2003 to 2006 and 2008 to 2012 pursuant to the explicit 

approval given by the IRB on 21 January 2013 on the eligibility of the Company in claiming the RIA; and
• The payment which had been made to IRB in December 2020 in respect of YAs 2016 and 2017.

4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

 The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are outlined below: (continued)
(e) Estimation of income taxes (continued)

(i) Income tax (continued)

 The Group and the Company have not recorded the potential additional tax liability arising from the tax impact if the RIA claimed is 
disallowed and the Company loses its litigation. The realisation of this tax recoverable and the potential tax liability are dependent on 
the outcome of judgement on the RIA claims by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax (‘SCIT’) and by the Kuala Lumpur High Court, 
including the subsequent notice of appeal filed by IRB before the Court of Appeal.

 The Directors have performed an assessment on the tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million and the potential tax liability based on legal 
view obtained from external legal counsel and the facts surrounding its RIA claims. The Directors have exercised judgement that there 
is sufficient evidence and case law to support the Company’s appeal against the Notices.

(ii) Deferred tax assets

 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences or unused tax losses can be utilised. This involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the 
particular entity in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, as disclosed in Note 12.

(f) Post-employment employee benefits

 The Group and the Company provide both Retirement Benefit Plan and Post Retirement Medical Plan for certain employees. The present value 
of the employee benefits obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using certain assumptions. 
The key assumptions used in determining the net cost/(income) for the employee benefits include discount rate, medical claim inflation rate 
and salary increment rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of employee benefits obligations, as disclosed 
in Note 24.

• Discount rate

 The Group and the Company determine the appropriate discount rate at the end of each financial period. This is the interest rate 
that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension 
obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group and the Company consider the interest rates of high-quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating 
the terms of the related employee benefits obligations.

• Medical claim inflation rate

 The medical claim inflation rate for general practitioner, hospitalisation, specialist and dialysis medical claims, as determined by the 
Group and the Company are based on the annualised increase in average claims over the past 5 years.

• Salary increment rate

 The salary increment rate for employees receiving the Retirement Benefit Plan as determined by the Group and the Company is based 
on the average salary increment rate for the past 13 years and considerations for price inflation, real salary increase, promotions and 
Collective Agreement (‘CA’) negotiation.

(g) Group’s sustainability pathway consideration
 
 The Group’s sustainability pathway is to reduce emission intensity by 35.0% and halve coal generation capacity by 2035; and aspire to achieve 

net zero emissions and be coal free by 2050. Based on this sustainability pathway, the Group has assessed whether climate change risks 
have affected the reasonable and supportable assumption used to estimate the cash flow projections and the estimated useful lives of the 
generation assets. The revisions and assessments in relation to the climate change and sustainability pathway do not have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group and the Company other than as disclosed in Note 9.

5 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (‘PPE’)

Accounting Policy

PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 

attributable to the construction or acquisition of the items and bringing them to the location and condition so as to render them operational in 

the manner intended by the Group and the Company and allocated according to its components.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 

future economic benefits associated with the items can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.

The cost of major overhaul/inspection is recognised in the asset’s carrying amount as a replacement and the remaining carrying amount of the 

previous major overhaul/inspection is derecognised.

Major spare parts and standby equipment are recognised as assets when the Group and the Company expect to use for more than one period. 

Similarly, if the spare parts and servicing equipment can be used only in connection with an item of PPE, they are accounted for as PPE.

Gains or losses on disposal of PPE are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are recognised in statement of profit or loss.

Freehold land and capital work-in-progress are not depreciated. Other PPE are depreciated on the straight line method to allocate the cost to 

their residual values over their estimated useful lives, summarised as follows:

Buildings and civil works 10 - 100 years

Plant and machinery 3 - 50 years

Lines and distribution mains 10 - 50 years

Distribution services 25 years

Meters  10 - 15 years

Public lighting 15 - 25 years

Furniture, fittings and office equipment 3 - 15 years

Motor vehicles 5 - 15 years

Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis.

At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indications 

exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised if the 

carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount (Note 3(c)).

During the financial year 2021, the Group has revised the estimated useful lives of generation assets based on the trend within the power 

generation industry and the Group’s sustainability pathway. Accordingly, the useful lives of the gas-fired power plants’ plant and machinery 

and hydro power plant dams have been extended for additional 5 years and 40 years respectively, based on the track records and research 

information available. There was a revision to the useful lives of the coal-fired power plants related assets which is in line with the Group’s 

aspiration to discontinue coal plants.

6 RIGHT-OF-USE (‘ROU’) ASSETS

Accounting Policy

A lease is a contract, or part of a contract, whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 

period of time in exchange for consideration.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group and the Company assess whether:

• The contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or 

represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier (‘lessor’) has a substantive substitution right, then 

the asset is not identified;

• The customer (‘lessee’) has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of 

use; and

• The customer (‘lessee’) has the right to direct the use of the asset. In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the 

asset is used is predetermined, the customer (‘lessee’) has the right to direct the use of the asset if either the customer (‘lessee’) has the 

right to operate the asset; or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.

The Group and the Company as lessees

The Group and the Company lease various buildings, plant and machinery, furniture and fittings, office equipment and motor vehicles. These 

leases have tenures between 1 and 25 years. Lease terms are generally negotiated on an individual basis. As for leasehold land, the remaining 

period of the respective leases ranges from 4 to 99 years.

(i) Initial recognition

 The Group and the Company recognise a ROU asset and a lease liability for all leases conveying the right to control the use of an identified 

asset for a period of time.

 The ROU assets recognised by the Group and the Company are initially recorded at cost, which comprise the following:

• The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;

• Any lease payments made on or before the commencement date of the lease, less any lease incentives received;

• Any initial direct costs incurred by the Group and the Company; and

• An estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group and the Company in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the 

site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the lessor.

 The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are 

discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

 Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

• Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

• Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;

• Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

• The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and

• Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

6 RIGHT-OF-USE (‘ROU’) ASSETS (CONTINUED)

Accounting Policy (continued)

The Group and the Company as lessees (continued)

(ii) Subsequent measurement

 After initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure ROU assets at cost:

• Less any accumulated depreciation;

• Less any accumulated impairment losses; and

• Adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities.

 The Group and the Company measure the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, 

reducing the carrying amount to reflect lease payments made, and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessments or 

lease modifications. The interest on the lease liability is recognised as finance cost in the statement of profit or loss.

(iii) Extension and termination options

 Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. In determining the 

lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not 

exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is 

reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).

 The assessment of reasonable certainty is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects 

this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.

The Group and the Company have elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets. 

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group and the Company apply MFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the 

contract based on the stand-alone selling prices.

A ROU asset and its corresponding lease liability are recognised at the date the leased asset is available for used by the Group and the Company. 

Each lease payment is allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to statement of profit or loss over the 

lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The ROU asset is 

depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exist, an 

analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 

amount exceeds the recoverable amount (Note 3(c)).

8 JOINT ARRANGEMENTS

Accounting Policy

A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which there is contractually agreed sharing of control by the Group with one or more parties 

where decisions about the relevant activities relating to the joint arrangement require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 

The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to 

the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the joint venturers have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint 

operations are joint arrangements whereby the Company has the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. In respect of its interests 

in joint operations, the Company shall recognise in its financial statements the assets that it controls and the expenses and liabilities that it 

incurs and its share of the income that it earns from the sale of goods or services.

The Group’s interest in joint ventures is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.

Equity accounting involves recognising in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of OCI and consolidated 

statement of changes in equity, the Group’s share of profits less losses of the joint ventures based on the latest audited financial statements 

or management accounts of the joint ventures, made up to the financial year end of the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 

results and net assets of the joint ventures to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group. The Group’s investments in 

joint ventures are recorded at cost inclusive of goodwill and adjusted thereafter for accumulated impairment losses and the post-acquisition 

change in the Group’s share of net assets of the joint ventures.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in joint ventures. 

Unrealised losses are also eliminated on the same basis but only to the extent of the costs that can be recovered, and the balances that provide 

evidence of reduction in net realisable value or an impairment of the asset transferred are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit 

or loss.

9 ASSOCIATES

Accounting Policy

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a shareholding 

of between 20.0% and 50.0% of the voting rights.

Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting and are initially 

recognised at cost. Equity accounting is discontinued when the Group ceases to have significant influence over the associates.

The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, and its share of  

post-acquisition movements in OCI are recognised in OCI. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying 

amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interests in the associate, including any 

long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, 

unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports 

profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised. 

The Group’s investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses (Note 3(c)).

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised in the Group’s 

financial statements only for the unrelated investor’s interests in the associates. The accounting policies of associates are adjusted where 

necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Accounting Policy (continued)

Dilution of gains and losses in associates are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously 

recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit or loss where appropriate.

(a) During the financial year 2021, the Group through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vantage RE Ltd., acquired 49.0% stake in an offshore wind 

farm company, Blyth Offshore Demonstrator Limited (‘BODL’) from EDF Renewables, a subsidiary of the French utility company, Électricité de 

France for a purchase consideration of RM674.7 million as disclosed in Note 48. 

(b) (i) Impairment assessment for Lumut Maritime Terminal Sdn. Bhd. (‘LMT’)

 2022

 During the financial year, the Group had undertaken the impairment assessment of its investment in LMT, an associate. LMT’s main 

business activity is to provide operation and maintenance services to Lekir Bulk Terminal (‘LBT’), the port that handles coal deliveries 

for two of the coal-fired power plants in Manjung area. In tandem with the Group’s sustainability pathway, the extension of the Power 

Purchase Agreement (‘PPA’) for the coal-fired power plants are not probable. This would lead to a loss of expected future revenue 

stream for LMT. Based on the impairment assessment, the carrying amount of the Group’s investment in LMT as at 31 December 2022 

exceeded its recoverable amount by RM68.6 million (2021: NIL), hence an impairment loss was recognised.

 Key assumptions used

 The recoverable amount was determined based on VIU calculations, which applied a discounted cash flow model of LMT for the 

remaining operation and maintenance contract period which expires on 2042 and its other sources of income. The cash flows used in 

the calculations are the most recent forecasts and projections approved by the Board of Directors and management of LMT.

 The key assumptions used in determining the VIU were:

2022
%

Terminal growth rate 2.0

Cost of equity 9.0

(b) (i) Impairment assessment for Lumut Maritime Terminal Sdn. Bhd. (‘LMT’) (continued)

 The cash flows were discounted using cost of equity based on the risk specific to the industry. The key assumptions includes optimisation 

of LMT’s assets and no new source of business.

 The Group’s review includes impact assessment of changes in key assumptions. The effects of the movement in the key assumptions 

to the recoverable amount are as follows:

(b) (ii)  Impairment assessment for GMR Energy Limited (‘GEL’)

 2022

 The value of the investment in associate has been fully written down in the previous financial year.

 The Group has reviewed the basis of the impairment parameter used in 2021. It was concluded that there was no material change in the 

base case assumptions that would require an adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. 

 2021 

 The Group had undertaken the impairment assessment of its investment in GEL. During the financial year 2021, amid a prolonged 

COVID-19 and additional indications such as poor outlook of thermal plants in India as initiatives were renewable energy focused, tight 

gas supply and the non-recoverability of regulatory claims caused by uncertainty from the Government of India. An impairment charge 

of RM291.8 million was recognised as at 31 December 2021 as its recoverable amount was lower than the carrying amount.

 Key assumptions used

 The recoverable amount was determined based on VIU calculations, which applied a discounted cash flow model of GEL Group for the 

period of the remaining useful lives of the respective power plants which range between 14 to 23 years. The cash flows used in the 

calculations are the most recent forecasts and projections approved by the Board of Directors and management of GEL Group.

 The key assumptions used in determining the VIU were:

2021

Number of operating plants 3

Average Plant Load Factor (%) 80.0 – 85.0

Cost of equity (%) 12.8 – 14.0

 The cash flows were discounted using cost of equity based on the risk specific to the plants. The key assumptions take into account the 

macroeconomic environment in India and the type of plant.

 There were 2 plants that were not operating and have been considered for disposal, which contributed to a reduction in the recoverable 

amount of GEL.

In 2010, a subsidiary of GEL was granted a refund of customs duty which was paid earlier towards the 
import of plant and machinery. In 2011, the subsidiary received an intimation from the Office of the 
Joint Director General of Foreign Trade (‘DGFT’) for cancellation of duty drawback refund order granted 
thereby seeking refund of the amount that has been received earlier.

Based on expert opinion, the management is confident that the duty drawback refund granted earlier 
was appropriate and that the cancellation of the duty drawback refund is not tenable. During the 
financial year ended 31 March 2015, the matter has been transferred to the Hon‘ble Supreme Court of 
India and will be concluded along with other similar cases if it is pending finalisation.

10 INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Accounting Policy

Goodwill

Goodwill arises from a business combination and represents the excess of the aggregate of fair value of consideration transferred, the amount 

of any NCI in the acquiree and the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net identifiable assets 

acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. If the fair value of consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net 

identifiable assets of the acquire in the case of a bargain purchase, the resulting gain is recognised in statement of profit or loss.

Goodwill is recognised in the statement of financial position as non-current asset at cost less accumulated impairment losses and tested 

for impairment annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the 

CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill 

is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The carrying 

value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of VIU and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment 

is recognised immediately to the statement of profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 

include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity disposed.

Rights to build 

The rights to build are stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The rights to build are considered to have a 

finite life and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future economic benefits of the asset. The asset is reviewed 

annually for adjustments to the useful economic life and any indications of impairment. Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying 

value of the intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

Subsequent costs involved in renewing or maintaining the rights to build are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.

 Impairment assessment for goodwill

 The carrying value of goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU including goodwill, is determined based on 

its VIU. This VIU calculation applies a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on forecast approved by management. The 

forecasts reflect management’s expectations of revenue growth, operating costs and margins for the CGUs based on current assessment of 

market share, expectations of market and industry growth. 

 The discount rate applied to the cash flow forecast refers to the industry’s pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (‘WACC’).

 Impairment assessment for goodwill (continued)

(a) Local investments and operations goodwill 

 The discounted cash flow model used cash flow projections which covered a five-year period and cash flows beyond the projection years are 

extrapolated using an estimated terminal growth rate.

 The following key assumptions have been applied in the VIU calculation:

2022
%

2021
%

Revenue growth rate 1.8 2.1

Pre-tax discount rate 8.1 9.9

Terminal growth rate 1.8 1.4

 Based on the Group’s assessment, no impairment losses were required as at 31 December 2022 as the recoverable amount exceeded the 

carrying amount.

 

 The Group’s review includes an impact assessment of changes in key assumptions used. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, it was 

concluded that no reasonable change in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to exceed its recoverable 

amount.

(b) Foreign investments and operations goodwill

 The discounted cash flow model used cash flow projections which covered a 28-year period (2021: 29-year period).

 The following key assumptions has been applied in the VIU calculation:

2022
%

2021
%

Revenue growth rate (3.2) (1.6)

Pre-tax discount rate 7.8 4.4

 The Group tests whether the goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. The Group has determined the recoverable amount of 

foreign CGU by assessing the VIU of the underlying assets. Based on the impairment assessment, the carrying value of the goodwill as at 31 

December 2022 exceeded its recoverable amount by RM22.7 mil (2021: NIL), mainly due to the lower revenue growth forecast.

Net total (8,442.8) (7,805.6) (6,640.3) (6,265.3)

 

Accounting Policy

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 

financial statements including those arising from business combinations. Deferred tax is not recognised on goodwill and those arising from 

initial recognition of an asset or liability which at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 

differences, unused tax losses and unutilised tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on 

investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled 

and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Tax benefit from reinvestment allowance is recognised when the tax credit is utilised and no deferred tax asset is recognised when the tax 

credit is receivable.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the end of the reporting period and are 

expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

The Group and the Company will recognise a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability for any temporary differences arising on initial 

recognition of a lease transaction. Where applicable, a deferred tax asset is recognised as the Group and the Company is able to benefit from 

the tax deductions in the future. Any differences between the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability will be recognised in the profit and 

loss. Upon adopting the amendments, the Group and the Company do not expect material adjustments to the retained earnings as the initial 

recognition of the lease transactions gave rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.

Accounting Policy

The Group and the Company as lessors

When the Group and the Company act as lessors, they determine at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group and the Company make an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and 

rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; otherwise, then it is an operating 

lease.

Operating leases

Leases where the Group and the Company retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as 

operating leases. The Group and the Company recognise lease payments received under operating leases as operating income on a straight-

line basis over the lease term.

Finance leases

If the Group and the Company transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased assets, leases are classified 

as finance leases. The Group and the Company derecognise the leased assets and recognise the net investment in the lease as a receivable. 

The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income 

is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.

The Group and the Company as lessees

The accounting policy on ROU assets and lease liabilities for lessees are disclosed in Note 6.

15 LEASES

(a) Finance lease receivables

Accounting Policy

(a) Contract cost assets – Costs to fulfil a contract

 The Group recognises a contract cost that relates directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract as an asset when the cost generates 

or enhances resources of the Group which will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and it is expected to be 

recovered.

 These contract costs are initially measured at cost and amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of revenue 

recognition to which the asset relates. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the carrying amount of 

the contract cost exceeds the expected revenue less expected cost that will be incurred. Where the impairment condition no longer 

exists or has improved, the impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract cost does not exceed the 

amount that would have been recognised had there been no impairment loss recognised previously.

(b) Trade contract assets

 A trade contract asset is recognised when the Group’s and the Company’s rights to consideration are conditional on something other than 

the passage of time. A contract asset is subject to impairment in accordance to MFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (Note 45). Typically, the 

amount will be billed within 30 days of the supply of electricity for electricity customers and 60 to 180 days for satisfying the performance 

obligation for other revenue streams. An assessment of electricity supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading 

and the financial year end of the Group and the Company (unread and unbilled) was made and it is recognised as trade contract assets. 

Payment is expected within 30 days from the billing date for all trade receivables.

16 FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FVOCI (CONTINUED)

 The Group and the Company have irrevocably elected non-trading equity securities above at initial recognition to present its fair value changes in 

OCI. The Group and the Company consider this classification to be more relevant as these instruments are strategic investments of the Group and 

of the Company and not held for trading purposes.

 During the financial year, there were dividend income recognised and no investment was disposed. The details of the financial assets at FVOCI are

Accounting Policy (continued)

(c) Trade contract liabilities

 A trade contract liability represents the obligation of the Group and of the Company to transfer goods or services to a customer for which 

consideration has been received (or the amount is due) from the customers.

 Trade contract liabilities primarily relate to contributions paid by electricity customers for the construction of electricity network assets. 

The customers’ contributions are expected to be recognised as revenue over a period of 20 years, being the estimated average useful life 

of the electricity network assets used to connect the customers to the electricity supply.

 Other trade contract liabilities within the Group are relating to students fees. All other trade contract liabilities are expected to be 

recognised as revenue over the next 12 months.

(d) Non trade contract assets and liabilities

 Non trade contract balances are pertaining to insurance and reinsurance contracts which are recognised in accordance to MFRS 4 

‘Insurance Contracts’.

 Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from ceding insurers by agreeing to compensate the ceding insurance 

if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the ceding insurers are classified as insurance contracts.

 Assets, liabilities and expenses arising from ceded reinsurance contracts are presented separately from the related assets, liabilities, 

income and expenses from the related insurance contracts because reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Group from its direct 

obligations to its insured.

 Reinsurers’ share of insurance contract liabilities, written premiums ceded to reinsurers, reinsurers’ share of change in the reserve for 

unearned premiums and outstanding claims are recognised in the same accounting period as the original policy to which the reinsurance 

relates and are presented on the statement of financial position on a gross basis.

 Reinsurance assets include reinsurers’ share of insurance contract liabilities and balances due from reinsurers. The amounts recognised 

as reinsurers’ share of insurance contract liabilities are measured on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of the liabilities held 

in respect of the related insurance contracts.

 Reinsurance assets are assessed for impairment at each date of the statement of financial position. Such assets are deemed impaired if 

there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after its initial recognition, that the Group may not recover all amounts 

due and that the event has a reliably measurable impact of the amount that the Group will receive from the reinsurer. The impairment loss 

is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

 In respect of the supply of electricity, the Group and the Company applied the practical expedient to not disclose information related to the

20  INVENTORIES

Accounting Policy

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Cost of work-in-progress and finished goods comprise raw materials, direct labour and a proportion of the production overheads. Cost is 

determined on the weighted average basis and comprises all costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 

present location and condition.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses.

Accounting Policy

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Other receivables 

generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group and the Company. If collection is expected in one year or 

less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current 

assets.

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, which is the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain 

significant financing components. The Group and the Company hold the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash 

flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment is determined 

based on the ECL model and is further disclosed in Note 45.

23 PAYABLES

Accounting Policy

Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 

Other payables generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group and the Company. Trade and other payables 

are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they 

are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, which is the fair value of the 

consideration to be paid in the future for the goods and services received.

Provisions are recognised when the Group and the Company have a present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is 

probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and reliable estimates of the amounts can be made. Where the 

Group and the Company expect a provision to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only 

when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar 

obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A 

provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

24 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Accounting Policy

The Group and the Company have various post-employment benefit schemes which are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. A 

defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and the Company pay fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) on a 

mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis and the Group and the Company have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions 

if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior periods.

Defined contribution plans

The Group’s and the Company’s contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit or loss in the financial 

year to which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group and the Company have no further payment obligations.

Defined benefit plans

The Group and the Company make contributions to the Company’s Retirement Benefit Plan, a defined benefit plan and an approved fund 

independent of the Company’s finances. A book provision is also provided by the Group and the Company as the contribution rate required 

to fund the benefits under the said plan is in excess of the Inland Revenue maximum limit. The Group and the Company also provided for a  

Post-Retirement Medical Plan for certain employees, which is unfunded.

The liability in respect of a defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date 

minus the fair value of plan assets. The Group and the Company determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value 

of any plan assets with sufficient regularity such that the amounts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from the 

amounts that would be determined at the end of the reporting date.

The defined benefit obligation, calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method, is determined by an independent actuarial firm, considering 

the estimated future cash outflows using market yields at the statement of financial position date of high-quality corporate bonds which have 

currency and terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability.

The current service cost of the defined benefit plan reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee services in 

the current year. It is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as employee benefits expense.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefits obligation and the fair value of plan 

assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience 

adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly to the OCI in the period in which they arise. The actuarial gains and 

losses are not subsequently reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.

(i) Retirement Benefit Trust Fund (‘RBTF’)

 The Group and the Company operate a final salary defined benefit plan. The benefit is made as lump sum payment at retirement or earlier 

exits due to death and early retirement. The RBTF has been closed to new entrants since January 2008. Currently, there is no minimum 

funding requirement under the law.

 The RBTF exposes the Group and the Company to risks from interest rates from defined benefit being greater than expected due to 

assumptions such as salary increment or turnover rates not being borne out. The RBTF is also exposed to investment risks in relation to 

the assets of the plan.

 The funding of the RBTF is based on recommendation of the actuary and approved by the Group and the Company. The contributions by 

the Group and the Company are based on 6.0% (2021: 6.0%) of the annual basic salaries of the members. The employees are not required 

to contribute to the plan.

financial year.

(ii) Post-Retirement Medical Benefit Scheme (‘PRMBS’)

 The Group and the Company operate a post-retirement medical benefits plan in Malaysia. The PRMBS is closed to new entrants. There is 

no minimum funding requirement under the current law. The PRMBS is unfunded.

 The PRMBS exposes the Group and the Company to risks from interest rates and from defined benefits being greater than expected due 

to assumptions such as projection of medical benefit costs and mortality not being borne out.

26 BORROWINGS

Accounting Policy

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised 

cost using the effective interest method, any differences between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value are recognised 

in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group and the Company have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability 

for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.

Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the Group issues equity instruments to a debt holder to extinguish all or part of 

the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognised in statement of comprehensive income, which is measured as the difference 

between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued, if any.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or 

all of the facilities will be drawdown. The transaction costs are amortised over the tenure of the loan and recognised in the statement of profit 

or loss.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 

a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets. All other borrowing costs are 

recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

Government loans, where the interest rate is below the market interest rate, the differential between the initial carrying value of the loan based 

on market rate and the Government rate is recognised as a deferred income and is credited to the statement of profit or loss over the period 

necessary to match the interest costs.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 

from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

27 GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT GRANTS

Accounting Policy

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair values where there is a reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and the 

Group will comply with all its corresponding terms and conditions.

Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period necessary to match them 

with the costs they are intended to compensate.

Government grants relating to construction of PPE are included in non-current liabilities as deferred income and are credited to the statement 

of profit or loss on the straight line method over the expected lives of the related assets.

A subsidiary of the Group obtained Government loans where the interest rate is below the market rate of interest. The differential between 

the initial carrying value of the loan based on market rate and the Government rate is recognised as a deferred income and is credited to the 

statement of profit or loss over the period necessary to match the interest costs.

31 REVENUE

Accounting Policy

Revenue which represents income arising in the course of the Group’s and the Company’s ordinary activities is recognised by reference to 

each distinct performance obligation promised in the contracts with customers. Revenue from contracts with customers is measured at its 

transaction price, being the amount of consideration which the Group and the Company expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring 

promised goods or services to a customer, net of goods and service tax, returns, rebates and discounts. Transaction price is allocated to 

each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each distinct good or services promised in the contract. 

Depending on the substance of the respective contract with the customer, revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, 

which may be at a point in time or over time.

The Group and the Company do not expect any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the 

customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group and the Company do not adjust any of the transaction 

prices for the time value of money.

(a) Electricity revenue

 Revenue from the supply of electricity in Peninsular Malaysia (since 2014), Sabah and Wilayah Persekutuan Labuan (since 2022) is regulated 

based on certain formulae and parameters as set out in the regulatory implementation guidance under the IBR framework and as agreed 

with the regulators. The allowed revenue in each year is calculated as the sum of actual revenue earned and any applicable adjustments, 

such as those related to the Annual Regulatory Adjustment (‘ARA’), allowance or top-up by the Government and other income adjustment 

mechanisms as described in the Guidelines on Electricity Tariff Determination. 

 The contract with customers is for the supply of electricity based on tariff rates as set out in the provision of the Electricity Supply Act 

1990. Collection of the contract consideration from customers is considered probable.

 The promise to supply electricity represents a promise to transfer a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and that have 

the same pattern of transfer to the customer. The performance obligation to deliver electricity is satisfied over time as the customers 

simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided by the Group’s and the Company’s performance. Hence, electricity revenue 

is recognised over time by the Group and the Company when electricity is consumed by customers.

31 REVENUE (CONTINUED)

Accounting Policy (continued)

(a) Electricity revenue (continued)

 Generally, customers are billed monthly. As the amount at which the Group and the Company have a right to invoice corresponds directly 

with the value to the customer, the revenue from electricity sales is also recognised monthly. Payment should be made by customers 

within 30 days from the date the bill is issued. An interest charge will be imposed if payment is made later than 30 days after the bill date. 

 Electricity revenue includes an estimated value of the electricity consumed by customers from the date of their last meter reading and 

the reporting period end. Accrued unbilled revenues recognised as contract assets are reversed in the following month when actual 

billings occur.

 Other income which is earned from services not directly related to electricity supply but are provided using the assets and/or staff of a 

licensee is deducted from the revenues to be earned from regulated tariffs.

 

(b) Goods and services

(i) Sale of goods

 Sale of goods is recognised when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer 

and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the 

products have been transported to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, 

and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, 

or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.

 Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated discounts. Accumulated 

experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to 

the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales 

are made with a credit term of an average between 30 to 60 days, which is consistent with market practice. The Group’s obligation 

to repair or replace faulty products under the standard warranty terms is recognised as a provision.

 A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because 

only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

(ii) Rendering of services

 Revenue from providing services is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised based 

on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided because the 

customer received and uses the benefits simultaneously.

 In cases of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered exceed 

the payments, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognised.

 If the contract includes hourly fees, revenue is recognised at the amount to which the Group has a right to invoice. The amounts 

are billed within 60 to 180 days from satisfying the performance obligations and payment is expected within 30 days from the billing 

date.

322 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

31 REVENUE (CONTINUED)

Accounting Policy (continued)
 

(c) Construction contracts

 Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over time or at a point in time in accordance with performance obligations being 

satisfied. Where revenue is recognised over time, the satisfaction of performance obligation is by reference to the stage of completion 

which is assessed by reference to the contract costs incurred over the total estimated costs for each contract as at the reporting date. 

Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the assets. The related costs are recognised in 

the statement of profit or loss when they are incurred.

 Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation 

based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margin. 

If contracts include sale of goods as a separate performance obligation, revenue from this sale is recognised at a point in time when the 

goods are delivered, the legal title has passed and the customer has accepted the goods. 

 When the consideration of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of 

contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the statement of 

profit or loss.

 Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or 

decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that 

give rise to the revision become known by management. 

 The amounts will be billed within 60 to 180 days from satisfying the performance obligations and payment is expected within 30 days 

from billing date. Advances received are included in contract liabilities.

(d) Customers’ contributions

 Contributions received from customers in the form of cash and/or PPE in respect of capital contributions for the construction of assets, 

used to connect the customers to a network or to provide them with the service, is included in the revenue.

 The customers’ contributions are viewed as indirectly related to the promise of providing supply of electricity to the customers. Supply 

of electricity and customers’ contributions are not distinct because the customers cannot benefit from these two services on their 

own. The connection infrastructures are to fulfil the obligation to supply electricity to the customers. Both the supply of electricity and 

customers’ contributions are substantially the same, and have the same pattern of transfer to the customers.

 Therefore, connection and the supply of electricity are one performance obligation. It is considered as part of the transaction price for 

the overall service provided to the customers and is recognised over time. The customers’ contributions are deferred and recognised 

over the period the constructed assets are used to provide electricity to the customers. The contributions are recognised as contract 

liabilities and amortised over 20 years, being the estimated average useful life of the assets.

 The revenue of the Group and of the Company are predominantly derived in Malaysia.

32 IMBALANCE COST PASS-THROUGH (‘ICPT’) UNDER RECOVERY

Accounting Policy

ICPT, a mechanism established under the IBR framework allows the Group and the Company to pass through the volatility in fuel and other 

generation specific costs (termed as the ‘Single Buyer Generation Cost’) to the customers, such that the Group and the Company remain 

financially neutral. The Group’s and the Company’s claims and undertakings under the ICPT mechanism are such that any over or under 

recovery of these costs would be payable to or reimbursable from the Government. Upon approval by the Government, the agreed over or 

under recovery costs will be adjusted in the billing to customers, as ICPT rebate or surcharge. Actual base tariff billed to the customers remains 

unchanged.

The ICPT over or under recovery is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, presented separately from revenue.

 The Group and the Company operate an equity-settled share-based compensation plan under which the entity receives services from employees 
as consideration for equity instruments of the Group.

 The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the Company’s shares is recognised as an expense in the statement 
of profit or loss over the vesting period of the grant, with a corresponding increase in share-based payment reserve in equity.

 The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted.

 Non-market vesting conditions are included in the assumptions to arrive at the number of shares that are expected to vest. At the end of the 
reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to be vested. The impact of the revision of original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to share-based payment reserve in equity.

 The fair value of shares granted to employees of subsidiaries is allocated to the subsidiaries.

 The Company implemented a LTIP on 30 April 2015 for a period of 10 years. The LTIP is governed by the by-laws, which was approved by the 
shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 18 December 2014. LTIP is intended to allow the Company to award the grant of new shares 
to be vested to selected employees for the attainment of identified performance objectives.

(a) The main features of the LTIP

 The LTIP comprises a Restricted Share Grant (‘RS Grant’) and a Performance Share Grant (‘PS Grant’). The main difference in the features 
of the RS Grant and the PS Grant is the eligibility of the selected employees in terms of their job grades in the Group and the performance 
targets and/or performance conditions to be met prior to the offer and vesting of the grant to the selected employees.

 The details of the grant are as follows:
(i) RS Grant

 The RS Grant is a restricted share grant for all eligible employees selected on a basis designated by the LTIP Committee. The RS Grant 
will be awarded annually to the selected employees to be vested over a period of 3 years on a pro-rata basis and after fulfilment of 
individual performance targets based on the Group’s performance management system (such as individual performance rating) and 
certain performance conditions (such as financial targets) as determined by the LTIP Committee from time to time at its discretion in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTIP.

(ii) PS Grant

 The PS Grant is a performance share grant for senior executives of the Group and the Executive Director as well as key employees of 
the Group selected on a basis designated by the LTIP Committee. The PS Grant will be awarded annually to the selected employees to 
be vested at the end of the 3-year period and after fulfilment of certain performance targets and/or conditions at the time of grant and 
vesting, which may include, among other factors, total shareholders’ return and the long term financial performance targets/ratios of 
the Group as determined by the LTIP Committee from time to time at its discretion in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
LTIP. At the point of vesting, the final award of the PS Grant is based on a multiple of the initial grant whereby the multiple is determined 
according to the performance targets and/or conditions. In the event the performance targets and/or conditions are not met by the 
selected employees, the grant will not be vested to them at the end of the performance period.

 The new ordinary shares to be allotted and issued upon the vesting of the ordinary shares pursuant to the RS Grant and PS Grant will not 
be subjected to any retention period or restriction on transfer.

 In implementing the LTIP, the grant will be satisfied by way of allotment and issuance of new ordinary shares to the respective RS and PS 
grantees upon vesting of the grant.

 The new ordinary shares to be allotted and issued pursuant to the LTIP shall, upon allotment and issuance, rank equally in all respects with the 
then existing issued ordinary shares. 

 The new ordinary shares to be allotted and issued pursuant to the vesting of the grant under the LTIP shall not be entitled to any dividends, 
rights, allotments and/or any other distributions, for which the entitlement date is prior to the date on which the new ordinary shares are 
credited into the Central Depository System (‘CDS’) accounts of the respective grantees upon vesting of the grant under the LTIP.

(f) Alteration of share capital and adjustment

 If the LTIP Committee so decides (but not otherwise), in the event of any alteration in the capital structure of the Company during the  
duration of LTIP, which expires on 29 April 2025, such corresponding alterations (if any) may be made to the LTIP in:
(i) The number of unvested new ordinary shares comprised in a grant; and/or
(ii) The method and/or manner in the vesting of the new ordinary shares comprised in a grant.

36 FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSS

Accounting Policy

(a) Functional and presentation currency

 Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 

environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (‘RM’), 

which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.

332 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

36 FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSS (CONTINUED)

Accounting Policy (continued)

(b) Transactions and balances

 Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. However, exchange differences are deferred in OCI when they are attributable to items 
that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation.

(c) Group companies

 The results and financial positions of the Group’s entities that have functional currencies which are different from the presentation 
currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 

statement of financial position;
(ii) Income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and OCI are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is 

not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and

(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.

 Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising on these items are recognised in OCI.

 On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to shareholders’ 
equity.

 On the disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss 
of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a joint venture that includes a 
foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), the cumulative 
amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation recognised in OCI, and accumulated in the separate component of 
equity, are reclassified from equity to statement of profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 

 In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the 
proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences recognised in OCI are re-attributed to NCI in that foreign operation, and are 
not recognised in the statement of profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (that is, reductions in the Group’s ownership interest in 
associates or joint ventures that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control) the proportionate share of the 
accumulated exchange difference is reclassified to statement of profit or loss.

Accounting Policy

Finance income are interests received from investments or financial instruments.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowing pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 

from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

Finance income is calculated by applying the effective interest method to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except for financial 

assets that subsequently become credit impaired. For credit impaired financial assets the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying 

amount of the financial assets (after deduction of the loss allowances). 

The accounting policy on fair value changes are as per disclosed in Note 45.

General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are 

capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Qualifying assets are assets that 

necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they 

are incurred.

Accounting policy on finance charges for lease liabilities and government grants are disclosed in Notes 15 and Note 27, respectively.

38 TAXATION AND ZAKAT

Accounting Policy

(a) Income tax

 Current tax expense is determined by the expected income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the financial year and is 

measured using the applicable tax rates according to the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in 

the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate the taxable profits.

 Management periodically evaluates the positions taken in its tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations 

are subject to interpretation. Provisions are established where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax 

authorities.

 Tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in OCI. In this case, the 

item is recognised in OCI, net of tax.

 The Group and the Company recognise non-current tax recoverable on an undiscounted basis.

(b) Zakat

 The Group and the Company recognise its obligation towards the payment of zakat on business income in the statement of profit or loss. 

Zakat payment is an obligation and is accrued based on 2.5% of profit before tax and determined according to the percentage of Muslim 

shareholding in the Company.

 The taxation and zakat for the Group and the Company comprise:

42 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Accounting Policy

The Group and the Company do not recognise contingent assets and liabilities other than those arising from business combinations, but 

disclose its existence in the financial statements. A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence 

will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and of the 

Company or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 

obligation. A contingent liability also arises in the extremely rare case where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be 

measured reliably. However, contingent liabilities do not include financial guarantee contracts. A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises 

from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the 

control of the Group and of the Company. The Group and the Company do not recognise contingent assets but disclose its existence where 

inflows of economic benefits are probable, but not certain.

Determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities is based on the Group’s and the Company’s view of the expected outcome of the 

contingencies after consulting legal counsel for litigation cases and internal and external experts to the Group and the Company for matters in 

the ordinary course of business.

 Claims by third parties include claims by contractors, consumers and former employees. These claims are being addressed and the Directors are of 

the opinion that their ultimate resolution will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Group. 

 On 7 December 2016, the Company and the IRB entered into a consent judgement before the Kuala Lumpur High Court to substitute the judicial 

review proceedings with regard to the notices of additional assessment dated 23 November 2015 for the YAs 2013 and 2014 amounting to 

RM2,068.2 million (‘Notices’) arising from the disallowance of the Company’s RIA claims by filing an appeal to the SCIT.

 

 The consent judgement also provides that the IRB will not commence any proceedings relating to the Notices until this matter is determined by the 

SCIT and by the High Court, if there is a subsequent appeal by either party. On 15 December 2016, the Company filed notices of appeal against the 

Notices to the SCIT according to Section 99(1) of the Income Tax Act 1967. The appeals have since been registered before the SCIT.

 Meanwhile, for the notices of additional assessment issued for the YAs 2015, 2016 and 2017, on 30 December 2020 amounting to RM3,977.9 million 

(‘Notices’), both the Company and IRB have recorded a consent order. Pursuant to the consent order, the Court has granted a stay of proceedings 

against the enforcement of the IRB’s Notices until the disposal of the judicial review application. Subsequently, the High Court has fixed a new 

hearing date on 22 May 2023.

 With regards to the notice of additional assessment for the YA 2018, on 21 January 2021 amounting to RM1,812.5 million, both the Company and 

IRB have recorded a consent order. Pursuant to the consent order, the High Court has granted a stay of proceedings against the enforcement of the 

IRB’s notice of additional assessment. Subsequently on 13 January 2022, the High Court heard the Company’s judicial review application and on 8 

February 2022, the High Court had allowed with cost, the Company’s judicial review application to set aside the IRB’s notice of additional assessment 

dated 13 July 2020 for YA 2018. The High Court agreed with the Company’s submission that the Company is in the business of manufacturing 

electricity and as such, the Company is entitled to claim RA on the capital expenditure which was incurred in YA 2018 in the course of expanding, 

modernising and automating the Company’s business. Consequently, on 8 February 2022, the IRB had filed a notice of appeal before the Court of 

Appeal against the decision of the High Court. Subsequent to the case management on 7 March 2023, the Court of Appeal has vacated the hearing 

date which was initially fixed on 21 March 2023 and fixed a new hearing date on 19 September 2023.

 The Company has obtained legal advice from its tax solicitors on the merits of the cases mentioned above and on this basis the Directors are of the 

opinion that no provision is required in the financial statements for the potential tax liability up to the reporting date.

 On 29 October 2021, the IRB had disallowed the interest expenses incurred by Kapar Energy Ventures Sdn Bhd’s (‘KEV’) in relation to the Redeemable 

Unsecured Loan Stock granted to KEV by the Company and Malakoff Corporation Berhad under Section 33(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1967 and 

KEV's revision of revenue for the YAs 2004 to 2009. As a result thereof, the IRB had issued notices of assessment (‘Notices’) for the YAs 2011, 2012 

and 2014 and notices of additional assessment for the YAs 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 amounting in aggregate to RM595.9 million.

42 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)

 On 16 November 2021, KEV had commenced a judicial review against the Minister of Finance at the High Court to challenge the matters arising 

from the said Notices. The High Court fixed the hearing of the application for leave for judicial review on 10 February 2022. Due to the request of 

the Attorney General Chamber to vacate the hearing for leave for judicial review on 10 February 2022, the High Court proceeded to fix the hearing 

for leave for judicial review on 27 June 2022. The High Court has granted an extension of the interim stay on the enforcement of the Notices until 

27 June 2022.

 In view of the ongoing out-of-court settlement negotiations between IRB and KEV, the High Court had successively vacated the hearing for KEV’s 

application of leave for judicial review scheduled on 27 June 2022, 18 August 2022, 13 September 2022, 24 November 2022, 3 January 2023 and 15 

March 2023. The High Court has fixed a new date for the case management on 13 April 2023 for the parties to update the Court on the status of the 

settlement. Correspondingly, the High Court has granted an extension of the interim stay on the enforcement of the Notices until 13 April 2023.

 Based on the legal advice obtained from its tax solicitors, KEV is of the view that it has a good basis in law to contend that the said Notices were 

incorrectly raised by the IRB and further taking into consideration that the matter is in the finalisation stage, no provision is required in the financial 

statements for the potential tax liability up to the reporting date.

 Notwithstanding the two tax litigation matters above, the Company continued to claim the RIA for YAs 2020, 2021 and 2022 whilst KEV continued 

to claim tax deductions for YAs 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as permitted by the law.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2022

WE ARE TNB FROM OUR LEADERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT

342 TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD • Integrated Annual Report 2022

Accounting Policy

Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below:

Financial assets

(a) Classification

 The Group and the Company classify its financial assets in the following categories: at amortised cost (‘AC’), at FVOCI or FVTPL. The 
classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

(i) Financial assets at AC:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows; and
• The contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

(ii) Financial assets at FVOCI:
• Equity securities which are not held for trading, and which the Group and the Company have irrevocably elected at initial 

recognition to recognise in this category. These are strategic investments and the Group and the Company consider this 
classification to be more relevant; and

• Debt securities where the contractual cash flows are solely principal and interest and the objective of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s business model is achieved both by collecting cash flows and selling financial assets.

(iii) Financial assets at FVTPL:
• Debt instruments that do not qualify for measurement at either AC or FVOCI;
• Equity instruments that are held for trading; and
• Equity instruments for which the Group and the Company have not elected to recognise fair value gains and losses through 

OCI.

 The Group and the Company reclassify debt instruments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

(b) Recognition and derecognition

 Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, the date on which the Group and the Company commit 
to purchase or sell the assets. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group and the Company have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

(c) Measurement

(i) Initial recognition

 On initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset 
not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial 
assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in the statement of profit or loss.

 Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely 
payment of principal and interest.

Financial assets (continued)

(c) Measurement (continued)

(ii) Subsequent measurement

• Debt instruments

 Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s and the Company’s business model for managing the 
asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group and the 
Company classify its debt instruments:
- AC: Interest income from financial assets at AC is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. 

Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. Impairment losses are 
presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVOCI: Movements in the carrying amount of debt instruments classified under FVOCI are taken through OCI. Upon 
derecognition of the assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement 
of profit or loss. The interest income from these financial assets is included in the finance income using the effective 
interest rate method. The foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment expenses are presented as a separate line 
item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVTPL: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. A gain or loss on debt 
instruments which are measured at FVTPL are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

• Equity instruments

 The Group and the Company have elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity instruments in OCI. The fair value 
gains and losses of these instruments will not be reclassified subsequently to the statement of profit or loss. Dividends 
from such investments are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as other income. Impairment losses (and reversal of 
impairment losses) on equity instruments measured at FVOCI are also reported as other changes in fair value.

(d) Impairment

 The Group and the Company assess on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at 
AC and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

 The Group and the Company have the following financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:
(i) Trade receivables
(ii) Trade contract assets
(iii) Non trade receivables:

• intercompany balances
• amounts due from associates/joint ventures
• rechargeable job orders (‘RJO’) debtors 
• sundry deposits for rental spaces
• rental receivables
• staff loans/advances
• investment in unquoted debt securities

(iv) Financial guarantee contracts issued

Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below: (continued)

Financial assets (continued)

(d) Impairment (continued)

 While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9, the identified impairment loss is immaterial.

 ECL represents a probability-weighted estimate of the difference between the present value of the cash flows according to the 
contract and present value of the cash flows the Group and the Company are expected to receive, over the remaining life of the financial 
instruments. For financial guarantee contracts, the ECL is the difference between the expected payments to be reimbursed to the holder 
of the guaranteed debt instrument less any amounts that the Company expects to receive from the holder, the debtor or any other party.

 The measurement of ECL reflects:
(i) An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
(ii) The time value of money; and 
(iii) Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, 

current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

 For trade receivables, trade contract assets and lease receivables, the Group and the Company apply the MFRS 9 simplified approach, 
which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables, except for those which are in default 
or credit impaired are assessed individually.

 For non trade receivables, at each reporting date the Group and the Company measure ECL through a loss allowance at an amount equal 
to 12 months ECL if credit risk on a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition.

 The Group and the Company use the three-stage approach for non trade receivables which reflect their credit risks and how the loss 
allowances are determined for each of those stages. Summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group’s and the Company’s ECL 
model for non trade receivables are as follows:

Types of non trade
 receivables

Stage 1 
Low credit risk 
(12 months ECL Model)

Stage 2 
Significant increase in credit 
risk (Lifetime ECL Model)

Stage 3 
Credit impaired 
(Lifetime ECL Model)

• Intercompany balances Positive operating cash flows/
Net assets (Total Assets - Total 
Liabilities)/Subsidiaries with 
assets under construction

 When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating 
ECL, the Group and the Company consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost 
or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s and the Company’s historical 
experience and informed credit assessment including forward looking information, where available. 

 The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or fully) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of 
recovery. This is generally the case when either the Group or the Company determine that the debtor does not have assets or sources 
of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subjected to the write off. However, financial assets that are 
written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s and the Company’s procedures for recovery 
of amounts due.

Accounting Policy (continued)

Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below: (continued)

Financial liabilities

The Group and the Company classify its financial liabilities at AC or at FVTPL. 

Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offsetted and the net amounts are presented in the statement of financial position (‘SOFP’) when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of 
business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.

Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Group or the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a 
loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair 
value and subsequently at the higher of;
(i) The amount determined in accordance with the ECL model; and
(ii) The amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles 

of MFRS 15.

The fair value of financial guarantees is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between the contractual payments 
under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to 
a third party for assuming the obligations.

Where guarantees in relation to loans or other payables of associates are provided for no compensation, the fair values are accounted for as 
contributions and recognised as part of the cost of the investment.

(b) Financial risk management

 The Group and the Company have exposures to the following risks embedded in its financial instruments:

• Credit risk;

• Liquidity risk; and

• Market risk.

 Credit risk

 Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 

its contractual obligations. The Group’s and the Company’s exposures to credit risk arise principally from its receivables from customers, 

investment in unquoted debt securities, deposits, bank and cash balances and derivative financial instruments. In addition, the Company’s 

exposure to credit risk arises principally from loans and advances to subsidiaries and financial guarantees given to banks in respect of banking 

facilities granted to certain subsidiaries and an associate.

Group and the Company have no major significant concentration of credit risk due to their diverse customer base. An impairment 

has been made for estimated unrecoverable amounts, determined by reference to past default experience of individual debtors and 

collection portfolios.

 The Group and the Company apply MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss 

allowance for all trade receivables and trade contract assets.

 For certain large customers with high risk of default, the Group and the Company assessed the risk of loss for each customer individually 

based on their financial information, past trend of payments and external credit ratings, where applicable.

 To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and trade contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk  

characteristics and the days past due. The trade contract assets that relate to unbilled customers have substantial same risk 

characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group and the Company have therefore concluded that 

the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates of the trade contract assets.

 Impairment losses (continued)

 The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 14 months and the corresponding historical credit 

losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on 

macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group and the Company have identified 

growth rates of real Gross Domestic Product (‘GDP’) of Malaysia to be the most relevant factor, and accordingly, adjusts the historical 

loss rates based on the expected changes in this factor. As at 31 December 2022, for non-government customers, a combination of 

growth rates of real GDP and inflation rates were identified as the most relevant factors.

 On that basis, the loss allowance was determined for both trade receivables and trade contract assets as reflected in the earlier tables.

 The opening loss allowances for trade receivables and trade contract assets reconciled to the closing loss allowances are as follows:

 Trade receivables are secured by deposits in the form of cash and bank guarantees. ECL is not provided on receivable balances fully 

secured by deposits. The deposit amounts are reviewed on an individual basis periodically.

 Individual receivables which were known to be uncollectible were written off by reducing the carrying amount directly.

 Impairment losses on trade receivables and trade contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. 

Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

(ii) Investment in unquoted debt securities, deposits, bank and cash balances, derivative financial instruments and financial assets at 

FVTPL

 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

 Investments, deposits, bank and cash balances, derivative financial instruments and financial assets measured at FVTPL are liquid 

securities and mainly with reputable financial institutions.

 Investment in unquoted debt securities are investment in an associate’s financial instruments. The credit risk of this associate is 

monitored on a quarterly basis and the loss allowances are provided for accordingly.

 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

 The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts in the SOFP.

 In view of the sound credit rating of counterparties, the Group and the Company do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its 

obligations. The Group and the Company do not have overdue investments that have not been impaired.

 The investments, deposits, cash and bank balances and derivative financial instruments are unsecured.

 Bank and cash balances are held with banks and financial institutions which have lower credit risks. In addition, some of the bank balances 

are insured by Government agencies. Consequently, the Group and the Company are of the view that the loss allowance is not material 

and hence, it is not provided for.

 The total investment in unquoted debt securities and the impairment provided are as follows:

 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

 The Company provides unsecured loans and advances to subsidiaries. The Company monitors the results of the subsidiaries 

regularly.

 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

 At the end of the financial year, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the SOFP.

 The total amounts due from subsidiaries and impairment provided are as follows:

 Impairment losses

 Generally, the Company considers loans and advances to subsidiaries having low credit risk. The Company assumes that there is 

a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary’s financial position deteriorates significantly based on stages determined 

in the accounting policy part (d) of this note. As the Company is able to determine the timing of payments of the subsidiaries’ 

balances when they are payable, the Company considers the amount payable to be in default when the subsidiaries are not able to 

pay when demanded. The Company considers a subsidiary’s balances to be impaired when the subsidiary is:

- unlikely to repay its payables to the Company in full; 

- having prolonged negative operating cash flows and is in net tangible liabilities position; or

- a dormant entity or has a history of default.

 At the end of the financial year, there was no indication that the amounts due from the subsidiaries are not recoverable other than 

those which have already been impaired. The Company does not specifically monitor the ageing of advances to the subsidiaries.

 During the financial year, there has been reversal of loss allowances due to repayments received from subsidiaries.

• Other non trade receivables, amounts due from associates and joint ventures

 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

 Credit risk on other non trade receivables are mainly arising from RJO debtors which are receivables from specific works requested 

by customers. 

 Credit risk also arises from sundry deposits for rental of office spaces from third parties and rental receivables. The Company 

manages the credit risk together with the specific leasing arrangements.

 Staff advances and staff loans have low credit risk as these are mostly provided to existing staff. These balances are managed on 

a monthly basis.

 Amounts due from associates and joint ventures are mostly due to transactions within the Group and have a low credit risk. These 

balances are managed on a monthly basis.

 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

 At the end of the financial year, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statement of 

financial position.

 The Company receives down payments, LOUs or indents for RJO debtors where works are requested by customers. In cases of 

RJO debtors arising from accidental damages to the Company’s assets whereby the third party is identifiable, these amounts are 

fully impaired as there is very low prospect of recovery.

 

 The Company receives deposits from third parties for rental of office spaces. 

 For staff loans and staff advances, any repayment is done through monthly payroll deductions.

 Impairment losses

 The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary or associate has indication of defaulting on 

its banking facilities. The Company considers a financial guarantee to be credit impaired when the subsidiary or associate is unlikely to 

repay its credit obligation to the bank in full.

 The Company determines the probability of default of the guaranteed loans individually using internal information available.

 Loss allowance has been recognised mainly arising from the financial guarantee provided by the Group in 2016 to support the loan 

facility offered to İç Anadolu Doğalgaz Elektrik Üretim ve Ticaret A.Ş. (‘ICAN’), a subsidiary of Gama Enerji. The ECL is determined based 

on an internal assessment of Gama Enerji’s debt servicing ability taking into account of the current adverse macroeconomic conditions 

in Türkiye. The impairment loss for financial guarantees for the Group and the Company are in Stage 3.

(b) Financial risk management (continued)

 Liquidity risk

 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s and the 

Company’s exposures to liquidity risk arise principally from its various payables, loans and borrowings. The Group and the Company monitor 

rolling forecasts of the Group’s and of the Company’s liquidity requirements.

 As of 31 December 2022, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded their current assets by RM1,434.6 million (2021: RM6,950.5 million), 

mainly due to consumer deposits amounting to RM7,185.7 million (2021: RM6,685.1 million).

 Based on the Company’s cash flow forecast for the next 12 months which takes into account the expected revenue growth rates, customer 

collection trends, low rate of termination of electricity account that would crystallise the entire consumer deposits above and one-off 

transactions. The Company expects to be able to generate sufficient internal cash flows from operations for the next 12 months from the 

reporting date to meet operational and financing needs as and when they fall due.

 In addition, as at 31 December 2022, the Company have undrawn borrowing facilities amounting to RM10,815.6 million (2021: RM9,911.0 

million) to support any cash shortfall while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn borrowing facilities at all times to ensure the 

Company have the financial flexibility.

 Surplus cash of the Group and of the Company is invested in profit bearing current accounts, money market deposits and other instruments 

with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity level to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the cash flow forecasts and to 

enable the Group and the Company to discharge liabilities in the normal course of business.

(b) Financial risk management (continued)

 Market risk

 Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other prices will affect the Group’s and 

the Company’s financial positions or cash flows.

(i) Foreign currency risk

 The Group and the Company are exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies 

other than the respective functional currencies of the Group and of the Company. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily 

USD, JPY and GBP.

 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

 The Group and the Company are required to hedge a minimum of 50.0% of TNB’s known foreign currency exposure up to 12 months 

period. The Group and the Company use forward exchange contracts and maintain foreign currency floats to hedge its foreign currency 

risk.

 Exposure to foreign currency risk

 The currency exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group and of the Company at the end of the financial year, 

expressed in MYR (if not defined, Malaysian Ringgit) currency units, are as follows:

USD 
RM’million

(i) Foreign currency risk (continued)

 Currency risk sensitivity analysis

 A 10.0% strengthening of the foreign currencies against RM at the end of the financial year would have decreased post-tax profit or loss 

by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remained constant and ignores 

any impact of forecasted sales and purchases.

GBP (276.9) (333.2)

Company

USD (621.6) (654.3)

JPY (137.4) (208.7)

 A 10.0% weakening of the foreign currencies against RM at the end of the financial year would have had equal but opposite effect on the 

above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remained constant.

 Foreign currency risk for the Group and the Company which have a functional currency other than USD, JPY and GBP are not material 

and hence, sensitivity analysis is not presented.

(ii) Interest rate risk

 The Group’s and the Company’s investments in fixed rate debt securities and its fixed rate borrowings are not exposed to a significant 

risk of change in their fair values due to changes in interest rates. The Group’s and the Company’s variable rate borrowings are exposed 

to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Investment in equity securities and short term receivables and payables 

are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

 Market risk (continued)

(ii) Interest rate risk (continued)

Exposure to interest rate risk

 The interest rate profile of the Group’s and of the Company’s significant interest-bearing financial instruments, based on carrying 

amounts as at the end of the financial year were:

Group Company

2022 
RM’million

2021 
RM’million

2022

Financial liabilities 95,678.8 78,477.5 110,037.0 96,226.8

Floating rate instrument:

Financial liabilities 1,481.8 2,442.6 0 0

 The financial assets are not sensitive to interest rate changes.

 A 5.0% change in the interest rates of the financial liabilities with floating interest rates at the end of the financial year would have 

affected the Group’s and the Company’s profit or loss and equity by RM0.1 million (2021: RM0.1 million). This analysis assumes that all 

other variables, in particular foreign currency rates remained constant.

(iii) Other price risk

 Other price risk arises from the Group’s and the Company’s investments in equity securities, debt securities and unit trust funds.

 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

 The Group and the Company are exposed to price risk because the investments held are classified on the statement of financial position 

as FVOCI and FVTPL. The Group and the Company mainly invest in unit trust funds, primarily in short term deposits as underlying 

instruments with minimal price risk.

(b) Financial risk management (continued)

 Fair value of financial instruments (continued)

(i) Policy on transfer between levels

 The fair value of an asset to be transferred between levels is determined as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that 

caused the transfer.

 There were no transfers between levels during the financial year.

(ii) Level 1 fair value

 Level 1 fair value is derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access 

at the measurement date.

(iii) Level 2 fair value

 Level 2 fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the financial assets 

or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.

 Derivative financial instruments

 The fair value is estimated by the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual 

maturity of the contract.

 Non-derivative financial instruments

 Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purpose, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash 

flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the end of the reporting period.

(iv) Level 3 fair value

 Level 3 fair values for the financial assets and liabilities are estimated using unobservable inputs.

(v) Interest rates used to determine fair value

 The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, when applicable, ranging between 0.1% to 8.0% (2021: 0.1% to 8.0%).

 Although the Group and the Company believe that their estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or 

assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value.

 The favourable and unfavourable effects of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been calculated by recalibrating the 

model values using expected cash flows and risk-adjusted discount rates based on the probability weighted average of the Group’s and 

of the Company’s ranges of possible outcomes.

46 CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

 The Group’s and the Company’s main objective of capital management is to safeguard the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going 

concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group and the Company will also strive to maintain an 

optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

 For the purpose of sustaining or changing the capital structure, the Group and the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 

issue new shares or return capital to shareholders.

 In order to be consistent with industry norms, the Group and the Company monitor its capital structure on the basis of the gearing ratio. This 

ratio is calculated as total borrowings divided by capital employed. Total borrowings include non-current borrowings, current borrowings and hire 

purchase as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position. Capital employed is the summation of total equity and total borrowings.

TO THE MEMBERS OF TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD (INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA) (REGISTRATION NO. 199001009294 (200866-W))

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Our opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) give a true and fair view of the 

financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2022, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial 

year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the 

Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

What we have audited

We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 

2022 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and 

statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary 

of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 222 to 381.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities 

under those standards are further described in the “Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence and other ethical responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian 

Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional 

Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 

the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

Our audit approach

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements of the Group and of 

the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates 

that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 

management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk 

of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into 

account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company 

operate.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group 

and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and

of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 

Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matters

Revenue recognition for sales of electricity

Refer to Note 31 – Revenue

Sales of electricity of RM49,702.3 million and RM46,650.4 million is the 
most significant component of the Group’s and the Company’s revenue, 
respectively, for the financial year ended 31 December 2022.

Revenue from sales of electricity is based on the end customers’ 
consumption and the related tariff rates, which are governed by the 
Incentive Based Regulations imposed by the Energy Commission.

We focused on the revenue recognition for sales of electricity as it 
involves the use of complex billing and accounting systems to process 
large volumes of data with different tariffs based on respective customer 
categories and consumption.

We performed the following audit procedures:

• Tested the overall information technology general controls of the 
billing and accounting systems recording the revenue transactions;

• Tested the application controls within the billing systems over the 
following:
- maintenance of tariff rates in the billing systems;
- accuracy of calculation of amounts billed to customers; and
- recording of revenue transactions.

• Tested the billings and revenue adjustments on a sampling basis to 
assess whether the revenue recognised and revenue adjustments are 
valid and recorded accurately; and

• Examined the correspondence with the Energy Commission and 
assessed whether there were any material matters that would affect 
revenue recognition.

Based on the above procedures performed, we did not find any material 
exceptions.

Reinvestment allowance (‘RIA’) claims

Refer to Note 4 – Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements and  
Note 42 – Contingent Liabilities

The Inland Revenue Board (‘IRB’) had disallowed the Company’s RIA 
claims for the Years of Assessment (‘YAs’) 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 
and 2018 and had issued notices of additional assessments (‘Notices’) to 
the Company, amounting in aggregate to RM7,858.6 million.

As at 31 December 2022, the Group and Company recorded a tax 
recoverable of RM3,522.4 million and have not recorded the potential tax 
liabilities arising from the tax impact if the RIA claims are disallowed and 
the Company loses its appeal. Based on the legal advice obtained from its 
tax solicitors on the merits of the cases, the Directors are of the opinion 
that no provision is required in the financial statements for the potential 
tax liability up to the reporting date.

We focused on this area due to the inherent uncertainties involved in 
the outcome of judgement on the RIA by the Special Commissioners of 
Income Tax and by the Kuala Lumpur High Court, including the subsequent 
notice of appeal filed by IRB before the Court of Appeal.

We performed the following audit procedures:

• Evaluated the Directors’ assessment on the basis of recoverability 
of the tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million in respect of RIA and 
the potential tax liabilities in respect of RIA by the IRB by assessing 
the independent legal confirmations obtained from management’s 
external legal counsel; and

• Examined the correspondence between the Company and the tax 
authority and assessed the matters in dispute based on advice from 
our tax experts to review the basis of applying the relevant tax laws.

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material 
exceptions to the Directors’ judgement in the treatment of the tax 
recoverable balance and the potential tax liabilities.

Assessment on carrying value of post-employment benefits

Refer to Note 4 – Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements and Note 
24 – Employee Benefits

As at 31 December 2022, the Group and Company recorded  
post-employment benefits of RM11,558.2 million and RM10,904.1 million, 
respectively.

Management assessed the present value of post-employment 
benefit plans by relying on the actuarial valuation reports from an 
actuary. The actuarial valuation reports estimated the present value of  
post-employment benefit plans based on key assumptions that  
comprised expected rate of salary increases, medical cost inflation and 
discount rates.

We focused on this area because of the significant estimates made by 
management in determining the present value of post-employment 
benefit plans.

We performed the following audit procedures:

• Obtained an understanding of the terms and conditions of the  
post-employment benefit plans; and

• Tested the present value of post-employment benefit plans based on 
the actuarial valuation reports by performing the following:
- Discussed with the actuary on the valuation method used and 

checked that the valuation method is acceptable in accordance with 
MFRS 119 ‘Employee Benefits’;

- Discussed with the actuary on the key assumptions used in the 
actuarial valuation and checked the reasonableness by comparing to 
historical data;

- Checked the reasonableness of the discount rates with the 
assistance of our valuation experts by comparing to market yields of 
high quality government securities at the reporting date;

- Checked the membership data used in the actuarial models through 
inspection of payroll personnel files and other supporting documents; 
and 

- Compared the fair value of plan assets based on the actuary report 
against the trustee’s report.

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material 
exceptions to the Directors' estimates of the post-employment benefits 
carrying value.

Assessment of funding requirements and ability to meet the short 
term obligations

Refer to Note 45(b) – Financial Instruments - Financial Risk Management - 
Liquidity risk

As at 31 December 2022, the Company was in a net current liabilities 
(‘NCL’) position of RM1,434.6 million.

The cash flow forecast has been prepared for the next 12 months for 
the Company, taking into account the expected revenue growth rates, 
customer collection trends, low rate of termination of electricity account 
that would crystallise the entire consumer deposit which amounts 
to RM7,185.7 million and any one-off transactions within the next 12 
months. Based on the cash flow forecast, the Company is able to generate 
sufficient internal cash flows from operations for the next 12 months 
from the reporting date to meet operational and financing needs as and 
when they fall due. In addition, as at 31 December 2022, the Company 
also has undrawn borrowing facilities amounting to RM10,815.6 million.

We focused on this area due to the inherent uncertainties and the 
judgement taken by management in forecasting future cash flows and 
determining the availability of financing to fund the operations of the 
Company for the next 12 months. 

We performed the following audit procedures:

• Assessed the reliability of management’s cash flow forecast for the 
Company over the period of 12 months from the date of the financial 
statements against previous forecasted results;

• Discussed with management on key assumptions used in the cash 
flow forecast, including the expected revenue growth rates, customer 
collection trends, low rate of termination of electricity account 
that would crystallise the entire consumer deposit and significant 
transactions that may occur within the next 12 months in developing 
the cash flow forecast for the Company;

• Compared management's estimate of the Company's cash collection 
trend from customers and the Government against historical collection 
trends for monthly electricity sales and ICPT surcharges;

• Assessed the reasonableness of coal and gas price assumed in 
management's cash flow for the next 12 months against third party 
industry reports;

• Reviewed past trends of consumer deposits refunds to assess the 
likelihood of repayment;

We performed the following audit procedures: (continued)

• Checked the borrowing repayment profile of the Company against the

• Checked the extent of undrawn facilities available to the Company.

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material 
exceptions to the Directors’ assessment that the Company will be able to

Information other than the financial statements and auditors’ report thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ Report, Statement on Risk 

Management and Internal Control and the Board Risk Committee Report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 

and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 

so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge 

obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair 

view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies 

Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 

financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability 

to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 

Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from 

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 

assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 

Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 

or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional 

judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, 

design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 

our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 

not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and of the Company’s internal control.

(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the 

Directors.

(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 

whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or on the Company’s ability 

to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the 

related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 

Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, 

and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 

fair presentation.

(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an 

opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain 

solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 

any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 

with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to 

eliminate threats or safeguards applied. 

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements 

of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report 

unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 

be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 

of such communication.

 The BNRC and Board hereby recommend for the re-election of each Director who is retiring at the 33rd AGM.

(c) Ordinary Resolutions 7 to 16 – Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration

 Section 230(1) of the Act stipulates among others that the fees and any benefits payable to the Directors of a listed company and its subsidiaries shall be approved at 
a general meeting. As agreed by the Board, the shareholders’ approval shall be sought at the 33rd AGM on the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration of the Company 
and TNB Subsidiaries Category II and III through separate resolutions as follows:

(i) Ordinary Resolutions 7 to 15 on the payment of Non-Executive Directors’ fees for the Non-Executive Chairman and each Non-Executive Director separately 
from the 33rd AGM until the next AGM of the Company.

(ii) Ordinary Resolution 16 on the payment of benefits payable (excluding Non-Executive Directors’ fees) to the Non-Executive Directors from the 33rd AGM until 
the next AGM of the Company.

 The last increment of the Non-Executive Directors remuneration/benefits payable was made in 2013. The Board in 2021 engaged Willis Towers Watson to 
undertake Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration Benchmarking exercise. Based on the findings, the structure of Non-Executive Directors' remuneration  
(including benefits) was generally aligned with the market practice and the existing remuneration is recommended to be retained and reviewed in three (3) years' time.

 The proposed Ordinary Resolutions 7 to 16 for the payment of Directors' fees and benefits payable to the Non-Executive Directors of the Company from the 33rd AGM 
until the conclusion of the next AGM are tabled herewith in line with the provision of the Act and Guidance 7.2 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021 
to ensure full disclosure.

 No separate resolution for Khazanah Nasional Berhad (Khazanah) Nominee Director, Datuk Amran Hafiz bin Affifudin including his Alternate Director, in lieu of 
Khazanah’s waiver of Director’s fees and meeting allowances to its Nominee Directors who are Khazanah employees. The said waiver is applicable to all Khazanah’s 
investee companies.

 The Non-Executive Directors remuneration policy of TNB and its subsidiaries is as follows:

 In determining the estimated total amount of benefits payable, the Board had considered various factors including the number of scheduled and special meetings for 
the Board, Board Committees and boards of subsidiaries along with the number of Non-Executive Directors involved.

 Payment of Non-Executive Directors’ benefits will be made by the Company and its subsidiaries on a monthly basis and/or as and when incurred, provided that the 
proposed Ordinary Resolution 16 be passed at the 33rd AGM. The Board is of the view that it is fair and justifiable for the payment of benefits to the Non-Executive 
Directors be made as and when incurred, after the Non-Executive Directors have discharged their responsibilities and rendered their services to the Company.

 Details of the Directors’ Remuneration for the Financial Year ended 31 December 2022 are enumerated on page 180 of the Corporate Governance Overview 
Statement of this Integrated Annual Report.

(d) Ordinary Resolution 17 – Re-appointment of Auditors

 Based on the External Auditors Assessment Result for the Financial Year under review, the Board Audit Committee and Board are satisfied with the quality of service, 
adequacy of resources provided, communication, independence, objectivity and professionalism demonstrated by the External Auditors in carrying out their duties. 
Being satisfied with the External Auditors’ performance, the Board recommends their re-appointment for shareholders’ approval at the 33rd AGM.
