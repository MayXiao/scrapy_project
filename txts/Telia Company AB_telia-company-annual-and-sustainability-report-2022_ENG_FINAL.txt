Comments from our CEO

Stepping up the pace 
towards a Better Telia 
2022 was not the year we had 
hoped for. Just as the world was 
emerging from the pandemic, 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
triggered a level of uncertainty 
and volatility not seen in a 
generation. 

The pandemic accelerated changes in how we 
live and work, adding momentum to the rapid 
digitalization that was already underway. The war 
in Ukraine and global instability have heightened 
the threat level from cyberattacks and underlined 
the importance of digital security. Combined, 
these factors once again demonstrate the fact 
that a well-functioning digital infrastructure is 
essentially the backbone of society, now and in 
any future we can imagine. 

As the leading provider of critical digital 
infrastructure and services to the societies of 
the Nordics and the Baltics, Telia’s purpose is 
to reinvent better connected living. And our 

transformation into a more agile, responsive and 
resilient business could not be more relevant and 
important. 

In 2022, and for the first time since the current 
business portfolio was established, Telia grew 
service revenue in every country we operate in, 
sustaining the turnaround that started towards 
the end of 2021. And we continued to successfully 
execute on the strategic roadmap we launched 
two years ago, with solid momentum in many 
aspects of our transformation. At the same time, 
it was a challenging year with significant macro 
headwinds, especially from higher energy costs. 
While we have taken steps to mitigate these 
headwinds, we have not yet been able to offset 
them fully, and so EBITDA development and cash 
generation was behind our original expectations 
for the year. 

As we move into 2023, we are stepping up the 
pace of transformation while staying focused on 
our strategy to create a Better Telia for all our 
stakeholders – customers, employees, owners 
and the societies of the Nordics & Baltics. 
Everything we do to create a Better Telia is guided 
by our belief that the demand for safe, reliable,

our 5G rollout, reaching more than 80% of the 
Norwegian, Finnish and Lithuanian populations 
and more than 50% of people in Sweden. Our 
network modernization has therefore now passed 
its investment peak, and monetization of that 
investment is a key priority going forward. Private, 
or Enterprise Mobile Networks, are an example of 
how we can monetize our mobile networks and 
we are already the clear market leader in this area, 
with more than fifty commercial sites signed, up 
from ten just two years ago. 

As an example, one of those commercial contracts 
is with the Norwegian Defense Material Agency. 
This collaboration ensures that the Norwegian 
Armed Forces can count on the most secure 
communication services ever built on 5G 
technology in times of both peace and crisis. The 
architecture of the 5G network ensures that, when 
necessary, Armed Forces data can be separated 
and given priority over other traffic in the public 
mobile network, with an additional layer of highly 
secure encryption. In another of these contracts, 
we worked with Nokia to become the first operator 
in the world to implement a 4G/5G virtual private 
network based on network slicing for Sandvik’s 
test mine in Tampere, western Finland, a model 
solution for companies that need dedicated 
connectivity.

We remain the largest owner and operator of 
digital infrastructure in the Nordics and Baltics 
and continue to deliver on our strategy to both 
develop and realize its full value. During 2022 we 
completed a sale of 49% of our Swedish tower 
business to Brookfield and Alecta, building on the 
sale of similar sized stakes in our Norwegian and 
Finnish tower businesses, to the same partners, 

in 2021. As a result, we have now created the 
leading, pan-Nordic tower platform with an 
enterprise value of EUR 2.6 billion. 

Building our network leadership credentials 
is a key metric of success for Connecting 
everyone, and for the sixth year in a row Telia 
Sweden’s mobile network came out on top in the 
annual assessment by umlaut, the third-party 
independent assessor of the world’s mobile 
networks. Meanwhile, dedicated work to improve 
our network in Finland led to Telia winning awards 
in all five categories in Tutela’s independent 
report. Third-party tests also revealed that, among 
the top mobile operators in Estonia and Lithuania, 
Telia delivered the fastest median download 
speeds – a key factor in customer experience and 
satisfaction. 

Our third strategic priority is Transforming to 
digital in order to become simpler, faster, data 
driven and able to operate with lower costs. Our 
ambition is to become a less complex, more agile 
company by radically reducing the number of 
products, processes, and platforms we operate 
with. To date, we have reduced legacy products by 
more than 40% and are well on our way towards 
our target of a 100% reduction. New products 

copper broadband customers remaining in 
Sweden, and only 25% of our copper-based 
networks still to decommission, we are now in 
the final years of such rapid decline. Meanwhile, 
convergence is progressing, not least in our home 
market, with more than one million TV customers 
and a 20% increase in households subscribed to 
triple-play services (internet, TV and telephony). 
Triple-play customers are less likely to churn and 
are disproportionately more valuable to us, now 
and in the long term, which is why convergence 
remains a key priority.

Revenue growth is a key index of success, but 
we also measure progress against our Inspiring 
customers strategic priority via customer 
satisfaction. Customer satisfaction improved 
during the year, with a number of awards 
recognizing the quality and consistency of our 
services, especially with our enterprise customers. 
SKI, the Swedish quality index, concluded that, 
among the large operators, Telia had the most 
satisfied enterprise mobile customers. In Norway, 
Phonero, our enterprise brand, came out on top 
in EPSI Rating’s mobile customer satisfaction 
survey, where we were recognized for providing 
high-quality services and being easy to deal with. 
In Lithuania, for the second year in a row, Telia 
came out on top in a secret shopper evaluation 
of mobile communication service providers’ 
customers care centers and for providing the best 
customer experience when ordering home internet 
connections over the phone.

Our second strategic priority is Connecting 
everyone to the most trusted, reliable and 
modern networks in the Nordics and Baltics. 
During 2022 we made considerable progress on 

»A well-functioning digital 
infrastructure is essentially the 
backbone of society, now and 
in any future we can imagine.«

high-speed networks will remain high, and that, 
going forward, Telia will play a fundamental role 
in the continuing digitalization of society. Our 
roadmap for a Better Telia is enabled by four 
strategic priorities:

First, and to reverse multiple years of declining 
revenue, we have put our customers at the heart 
of everything we do, with a commitment to 
Inspiring customers. We do this by leveraging 
next-generation network capabilities that take 
customer experience, and secure, digital services 
to the next level. During 2022 we returned 
to service revenue growth in all our markets. 
Unlike many of our peers across Europe, we also 
managed to grow our enterprise revenue. Our 
Swedish enterprise business grew for the first 
time in two decades on the back of Telia’s ability 
to help Swedish businesses, large and small, 
digitalize safely and securely. Mobile growth 
has also improved boosted by the successful 
monetization of our modernized networks, content 
aggregation and the return of roaming. And we are 
especially pleased with the rebound of our mobile 
business and brand consideration in Finland, 
having posted six consecutive quarters of growth 
by the end of the year. 

New services also contributed to our growth, 
including IoT products and services, with 
connections more than doubling and revenue 
increasing by a third in two years. Our fixed 
business has made even more progress, our fiber 
revenue base is now 25% higher than it was 24 
months ago, enabling 6.4 million homes access 
to high-speed connections. This has been partly 
offset by the ongoing decline in copper-based 
broadband, but as we now have only 100,000 

5Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



can be deployed on common platforms that can 
be scaled across our markets, driving substantial 
efficiencies and service improvements. More than 
50% of our new target products have now been 
deployed on common platforms, with more than 
two-thirds already being reused in more than one 
market. Our transformation has directly contributed 
to a much-improved customer experience for our 
Swedish B2B customers, which enabled us to 
reduce the order processing time from weeks to 
minutes.

We are also improving and automating our 
processes to enable efficient, high-quality, zero-
touch customer experiences. Our operational 
excellence program systematically drives 
continuous improvement, which has so far 
reduced the number of service incidents by 
almost 20%, increased the number of hours saved 
through automation by 65%, and been a key 
driver of a 30% reduction in call volumes into our 
Swedish customer operations.

As part of our transformation, we are investing 
in the upskilling and reskilling of our workforce 
to ensure we retain and attract the best digital 
talent. We have invested in new tools and training 
to increase our workforce’s access to analytics 
for data-driven decisioning by 55%. We have 
expanded our shared service center in Lithuania 
by almost 50% in order to build in-house 
capability, especially in critical software skills 
including front-end development and analytics 
that had previously been outsourced. And we now 
operate with a third of the systems integrators we 
once worked with, enabling a significant reduction 
in third-party IT costs.

Our final strategic priority is Delivering 
sustainably, meaning we aim to create value for 
all our stakeholders, consistently, reliably and in 
a responsible manner. In 2022 we have returned 
to revenue growth, we are delivering on our 
transformation program, we have reshaped our 
business portfolio to improve capital allocation 
and crystallize value from both non-core assets 
and infrastructure, and we have returned almost 
SEK 14 billion to shareholders in the form of 
dividends and share buybacks. However, we 
have faced significant challenges in our C More 
Pay TV business, and from macro factors such as 
rising inflation and interest costs and supply chain 
disruption, resulting in weaker than originally 
planned cash generation and total shareholder 
return during 2022. With mitigations now in place 
to offset these challenges, a restructuring of our 
TV and Media unit underway, and a continued 
execution of our strategy, we are aiming to return 
to growth, consistently and reliably, across all the 
main financial metrics in 2023.

Delivering sustainably is also about being a 
responsible business that creates value for 
all stakeholders. As further detailed in the 
Sustainability section of this report, we are 
positively progressing towards our ambitions 
in Climate and circularity, Digital inclusion, and 
Privacy and security. External validation of our 
performance included a platinum medal from 
EcoVadis, placing Telia among the top 1% of 
companies surveyed; the highest possible ESG 
rating, AAA, from MSCI; a score of A- in CDP’s 
Climate Change rating, up from the D score we 
received in 2018; a B- ESG rating from ISS; and 
a continued place in the FTSE4Good Index of 
responsible companies.

35% of our supply chain emissions are covered by 
science-based targets, and we remain committed 
to our goal of 72% by 2025. We underlined our 
commitment to renewable energy by signing 
Power Purchasing Agreements in Denmark and 
Estonia to secure our supply and help fund the 
production of renewable wind and solar energy. 
The shift to renewable electricity has contributed 
to a 78% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
in Telia’s own operations, compared to 2018. The 
remaining emissions from our own operations 
are generated by backup power sources and our 
own car fleet. In Norway and Estonia, we piloted 
hydrogen as backup power, replacing diesel in 
selected sites. And the shift to electric vehicles 
(EVs) continued in 2022, with 17% of the vehicles 
in our fleet electric and 31% hybrid at the end of 
the year. 

We are the leading digitalization partner for 
the energy sector, the defense sector and many 
civil contingency agencies, proving that Telia 

is increasingly the most trusted and secure 
digital infrastructure provider in the Nordics 
and Baltics. And in the past two years we have 
reached more than one million people (of which 
more than 400,000 in 2022) with initiatives 
designed to build digital skills, targeting seniors, 
children, immigrants and small and medium-sized 
enterprises. Finally, in our consumer surveys, we 
achieved top-tier positions on privacy in four out 
of six markets. 

While 2022 was a year of much progress, we 
are transforming a large, complex business in 
a challenging environment and there are no 
shortcuts to success. We have known from 
the start that achieving our ambitious goals 
demands focus, discipline and perseverance, and 
the challenges we faced this past year were a 
reminder of that. However, having returned Telia 
to growth, taken 5G network leadership in the 
region, passed our investment peak, and built the 
foundations for better operational momentum and 
cash conversion going forward, I remain confident 
that we are on the right track. 

I want to thank every Telia colleague and partner 
for their continued hard work and commitment, 
and I want to thank our close to 500,000 
shareholders for their confidence and support.

I could not be prouder to lead, or more determined 
to transform Telia at this time.

Read more about the global trends that affect Telia and our customers

10Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



01. Geopolitics dictate 
macroeconomics 
The global economic and geopolitical situation 
changed dramatically during 2022 as a result 
of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, soaring inflation, 
energy shortages and mounting geopolitical 
polarization. This altered geopolitical landscape 
has increased the need for trusted and resilient 
infrastructure, including communication, as the 
number of cyberattacks has surged. Severe 
disruptions in energy supply and higher food prices 
have resulted in record inflation, prompting central 
banks to raise interest rates. This has weighed 
on the overall economy and is likely to produce a 
spending squeeze for consumers as real incomes 
fall. Telecom service are, given their essentialness, 
less likely to be affected than other sectors.

02. Simplified experiences
Tremendous innovation in digital experiences is 
simplifying all aspects of our lives. This ranges 
from food deliveries to insurance, asset sharing, 
shopping, and home digitalization. These 
innovations highlight the need for simplicity and 
great user experiences that every company needs 
to embrace to remain competitive. Around the 
corner, the emergence of the metaverse adds 
another dimension to digital experiences.

03. Ecosystems and platforms  
in the cloud
Value chains are evolving into ecosystems 
and interfaces are increasingly automated as 
application programming interfaces (APIs) are 
used to exchange data as well as control and 
interact with various components of a solution. 
Digital ecosystems can scale very efficiently and 
flexibly, even on a global level. Hyperscalers such 
as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google 
are key parts of these ecosystems, which continue 
to grow rapidly as businesses move more of their 
workloads and critical services to the public cloud. 
These dynamics create a growing need for trusted 
and reliable connectivity.

04. Intelligent automation
Digitalization is rapidly moving towards cloud-
native architectures. For organizations this can lead 
to the provision of substantially improved customer 
experiences, greater efficiency, and agility. But 
to capitalize on this shift, organizations need to 
rethink and redesign their ways of working. Key 
enablers include access to many types of digital 
data, agile working methods and Machine Learning 
and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Together they 
provide the foundation for intelligently automated 
processes. 

11Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



05. Integrated sustainability
Stakeholders such as policymakers, customers, 
consumers and investors are continuing to raise 
their expectations for sustainable practices 
and offerings. What was previously optional 
is today becoming mandatory through stricter 
legislation related to environment, human rights 
and governance. The ambition is to steer capital 
towards sustainable investments, avoid deceptive 
or misleading reporting and claims, and make it 
possible to compare corporate practices. In many 
respects energy has taken center stage and there 
is a clear need to reduce consumption to handle 
supply disruptions, and combat climate change. 
Cost levels also need to be managed from a 
societal viewpoint to mitigate a growing energy 
poverty risk and possible financial distress for 
businesses. In parallel, the urgent need to phase 
out fossil energy and transition into a net-zero 
and circular economy remains crucial. Further 
information on this trend on page 80.

06. Changing talent market
In the talent market, the focus on appealing, 
purposeful human leadership is becoming 
ever more pronounced. Company values and 
opportunities to learn, develop new skills and grow 
are increasingly important criteria for job seekers. 
Following the pandemic, many job seekers expect 
to have the option to work remotely, for at least 
part of the week. The gig economy is still growing 
rapidly, despite Gen Z’s perceived
preference for stability.

Telia has been a strategic digitalization partner 
to Region Skåne, the municipality responsible for 
Sweden’s southernmost county, since 2012. Over 
the years, Telia has provided the municipality with 
communication services, local private networks, 
medical alarms, contact centers and security 
services, among others, in addition to operating 
and managing its communication network 
infrastructure. 

One of Region Skåne’s primary areas of 
responsibility is healthcare. Hospitals are often 
under pressure to provide the best possible care 
with limited resources. As a result, they can’t 
afford to lose track of their equipment. The Telia 
Tracking real-time location system (RTLS) is helping 
hospitals in Skåne to overcome this challenge.

Telia’s RTLS uses radio-frequency identification 
(RFID) readers, Wi-Fi infrastructure and a 
combination of active and passive tags to keep track 
of equipment. The active tags are battery-powered 
and can be read at a greater range than the passive 
tags, which are powered by energy from the RFID 
readers. Currently, active tags are used in emergency 
rooms. By using existing Wi-Fi infrastructure for the 
tracking of active tags, Telia Tracking builds on the 

Creating better 
connected healthcare 
in Region Skåne

investments already made by the region’s hospitals.
RFID readers will be placed around all the hospitals 
to enable the RTLS to receive information from 
passive tags, which are currently used to track staff 
uniforms. Eventually, passive tags could be used to 
track personal protective equipment, bed sheets 
and small medical devices. Staff can use their 
computers or smartphones to locate whatever has 
been tagged.

Tracking of potentially lifesaving equipment 
ensures that it is in the right place at the right time, 
increasing efficiency and helping to reduce loss and 
theft. In addition to basic location data, there are 
plans to enable users to be able to see if equipment 
is readily available, currently in use or needs to be 
repaired, as well as when it was last sanitized.

Ultimately, the use of Telia Tracking should enable 
hospital staff to concentrate on providing the best 
possible care for patients, rather than on trying 
to keep track of medical equipment. Equipment 
tracking also increases patient satisfaction and 
decreases the likelihood of potentially harmful 
delays to treatment.

Case: Inspiring 
customers

As a vital partner to the public 
sector, we are reinventing 
better healthcare by bringing 
new digital services to one of 
Sweden’s largest regions.

Telia launched its 5G network in Norway in the 
municipality of Lillestrøm in May 2020. Since then, 
the high-speed network has expanded to connect 
cities and municipalities across the country, 
including Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger. 
During 2022, Telia’s 5G population coverage in 
Norway increased from 50% to over 84% and we 
expect to complete the country’s first nationwide 
5G network in 2023.

In its Mobile Network Experience Report for 
Norway, published in June 2022*, Opensignal, an 
independent analytics company, presented seven 
5G awards. Telia received six joint awards and 
was the only operator to win a 5G category — 5G 
Video Experience — outright. 5G Video Experience 
quantifies the quality of mobile video experienced 
by Opensignal users on real-world video streams 
when connected to a 5G network. A score of 
75/100 or above is considered excellent, signifying 
a very consistent experience across all users, video 
streaming providers and resolutions tested, with 
fast loading times and almost non-existent stalling. 
Telia’s winning score was 82.7/100.

Telia’s 5G network enables faster data speeds, 
more capacity and lower latency. This provides 
customers with a superior user experience – both 
on mobile and broadband via fixed wireless 
access (FWA). Demand for FWA from Telia, which 

Providing Norway with a 
better 5G experience

is a great alternative to fiber, remained high in 
Norway throughout 2022. FWA also enables high-
speed broadband in remote areas where fiber is 
not an option, closing the digital access divide in 
Norway. In parallel with the nationwide 5G rollout, 
Telia is modernizing its entire mobile network, 
providing better speeds and coverage in the 4G 
network, while doubling capacity. These significant 
investments are contributing to increased 
digitalization and productivity across the country.

EPSI Rating’s 2022 mobile survey revealed that 
Telia’s 5G mobile customers are far more satisfied 
than non-5G customers. 5G has also significantly 
strengthened the perception of Telia’s network 
quality, leading to increased brand consideration. 
Finally, Telia is growing in the mobile B2C market in 
Norway, driven in part by 5G. Revenue market share 
(RMS) increased from 33.2% in H1 2021 to 33.7% 
in H1 2022, according to NKOM’s latest report in 
September 2022.

A nationwide 5G network will soon be a reality 
in Norway, creating even more opportunities for 
customers and society.

With the support of advanced analytics and artificial 
intelligence (AI), we have enhanced the customer 
experience in our core business, got to know our 
customers better and can now meet their needs in a 
better way. The result is a personalized experience 
across channels, including online, in customer care 
conversations and when we contact our customers 
with new offerings.

To get to where we are today, we started to 
implement new technology, including a customer 
data platform, predictive AI and tools for customer 
care support optimization in Sweden and Finland, 
which was then scaled to Norway, Estonia and 
Lithuania. This state-of-the-art technology helps us 
achieve a much better, action-oriented understanding 
of customer preferences and household needs. Of 
course, this only applies to customers who have given 
their explicit consent. Applying AI models, we can 
predict individual customer preferences by observing 
and learning from other customers with similar 
behaviors and needs.

As an example, the content displayed on the new 
Telia.se website differs based on individual visitor 

Enhancing customer 
experience with AI

preferences. AI models are also used to determine 
which customers are targeted by specific campaigns 
and to provide recommendations to customer 
care agents when they talk to our customers. This 
approach helps us solve our customers’ needs 
more efficiently, resulting in shorter customer 
support calls. As a result of every customer call 
better addressing each customer’s specific needs, 
sales conversion rates in those calls have doubled. 
We see the same positive trend when we apply 
targeted offerings in our outbound direct marketing 
activities, with those conversion rates quadrupling. 
Personalization has also reduced the number of 
customers who opt out of direct marketing by 60%, 
suggesting that our messages are well crafted.

We are using analytics and AI models on a broad 
scale and have reached almost one million customers 
in Finland and more than 1.2 million customers in 
Sweden with AI insights-driven communication in 
2022. Personalization enables Telia to create a better 
multichannel experience, with total consistency 
between the ads customers see on social media, the 
content of emails from Telia and the conversations 
they have with our customer support.

Energy was at the center of many discussions in 
2022. As a telco, Telia has both a responsibility 
to limit its own energy use and an opportunity to 
support its customers’ efforts to do the same via 
digitalization. During the year, we made progress in 
both areas.

Since 2020, we only use renewable electricity to 
power our networks and data centers. In 2022, we 
took the next steps by signing Power Purchasing 
Agreements in Denmark and Estonia to secure supply 
and contribute to the production of wind and solar 
energy in our Nordic and Baltic footprint. Ultimately, 
the best kilowatt hour is the one never consumed. In 
this context, network modernization is essential to 
increase efficiency while carrying increased volumes 
of data as societies digitalize. Our 5G network is 
up to four times more energy-efficient than a 4G 
network in terms of energy per data bit transported.

Telia’s total power consumption increased by 4% in 
2022 due to the rollout of 5G, but the dismantling 
of older infrastructure helped to offset this. Copper-
based access was, for example, replaced with mobile 
and fiber connectivity, which saves substantial 
amounts of energy. Fiber-based broadband is 
approximately 15 times more energy-efficient per 

Rethinking 
energy to deliver 
sustainably

unit of data transported than the copper-based 
equivalent. In Sweden, our largest market, this 
transition has contributed to decreased electricity 
consumption compared to 2012, despite data 
volumes increasing by 1,800%. During the year, we 
also explored our role in the wider energy system 
by piloting smart battery solutions in Sweden. Peak 
shaving/load shift pilots in collaboration with battery 
provider Polarium demonstrated cost reductions 
of up to 10-15% achieved by charging lithium-ion 
batteries when prices are low and using stored 
capacity when demand and prices are high. The 
batteries also enable us to offer excess energy 
capacity to the grid at times when availability does 
not match supply, which makes the grid more 
resilient. 

Our ambition is to limit energy use while enabling 
customers to digitalize and use resources more 
efficiently. Opportunities include replacing travel, 
optimizing logistics and energy use in buildings in 
a precise way. Our IoT deliveries to energy and real 
estate companies grew in 2022. In total,  we enabled 
an estimated reduction of 810 GWh during the year, 
the equivalent of annual electricity consumption of 
90,000 households in Sweden.

Financial position
Goodwill and other intangible assets decreased 
to SEK 74,547 million (89,943) mainly due to 
impairments, partly offset by foreign exchange rate 
effects. 

Investments in associated companies and joint 
ventures, pension obligation assets and other non-
current assets increased to SEK 8,171 million (4,749) 
mainly due to positive remeasurements of defined 
benefit pension plans. 

Long-term interest-bearing receivables decreased 
to SEK 7,629 million (9,244), mainly due to 
reclassification to Short-term interest-bearing 
receivables partly offset by market value changes in 
derivates and net investments in investment bonds. 

Short-term interest-bearing receivables increased 
to SEK 9,676 million (8,841), driven by collaterals 
for derivatives due to market value changes and 
reclassification from Long-term interest-bearing 
receivables partly offset by net divestments of 
bonds. 

Long-term borrowings increased to SEK 94,555 
million (91,637) impacted by an increase in 
derivates partly offset by a decrease in bonds, 
including reclassification to Short-term borrowings.

Condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 

Cash flow from investing activities amounted to 
SEK -9,936 million (-10,908). 2022 was mainly 
impacted by net inflow from short term investments 
while 2021 was mainly impacted by net outflow 
from short term investments, partly offset by the 
disposal of Telia Carrier. 

Cash flow from financing activities decreased to 
SEK -21,779 million (-10,600). 2022 was impacted 
by the partial disposal of the tower business in 
Sweden which was more than offset by settlement 
of derivatives and repurchased treasury shares. 
2021 was mainly impacted by the partial disposal 
of the tower businesses in Finland and Norway.

The Board of Directors does not currently have 
any authorization by the general meeting of 
shareholders to issue new shares but has the 
authorization to repurchase a maximum of 10% of 
the company’s total number of outstanding shares 
before the AGM 2023. In order to continue to 
provide the Board of Directors with an instrument 
to adapt and improve Telia Company’s capital 
structure, the Board of Directors proposes that the 
AGM on April 5, 2023, resolves to authorize the 
Board of Directors to acquire the company’s own 
shares. The authorization may be exercised on 
one or more occasions before the AGM 2024. The 
maximum number of treasury shares held by the 
company may not exceed 10% of all shares in the 
company.

In case of a change of control in Telia Company, the 
company might have to repay certain loans at short 
notice, since some of Telia Company’s financing 
agreements contain customary change-of-control 
clauses. These clauses generally also contain other 
conditions including, for example, that the change 
of control has to cause a negative change in Telia 
Company’s credit rating in order to be effective.

For 2022, the Board of Directors proposes to the 
AGM an ordinary dividend of SEK 2.00 per share 
(2.05), totaling SEK 7.9 billion (8.3). The dividend 
should be split and distributed in four tranches of 
SEK 0.50 per share.

The proposed dividend is based on the total 
number of outstanding shares as of December 31, 
2022, which amounted to 3,932,109,286. See also

People
Our people ambition
The re-invention of Telia starts with our people. We 
have an ambition to relentlessly continue to build 
a Telia designed for generations to come. We have 
solid ground to stand on – building on almost 200 
years of successful re-inventions and of focusing 
on people, business, and society. We will continue 
to move forward with our passion to create 
something more and something better for our 
employees and our customers. Our people strategy 
is essential to our journey ahead and to accelerate 
the transformation. Our ambition is to create a 
Telia where our people can grow and develop and 
a culture that is inclusive, rights-respecting and 
empowering – with the opportunity for all Telia 
people to operate at their full potential.

Culture and Leadership
Culture and Leadership is key to the success of 
Telia’s transformation, and significant focus and 
investment have been made into culture and 
leadership this year. 

Having launched a new purpose, strategy and 
leadership framework in the past couple of years, 
focus for 2022 has been to work with our values 
to drive the evolution of our culture. Our values of 
Dare, Care, Simplify are loved by teams and leaders 
alike but not always demonstrated in our daily 
behaviors. We believe that living our values more 
consistently will support our transformation and our 
ultimate ambitions.

Our culture evolution starts from the top and 
evolves around co-creation with our people. Since 
August we have performed cultural alignment 

sessions with Group Executive Management team 
and several culture focus groups have been held 
with our employees in all markets. 
 
In November Telia Company’s top 200 leaders 
across the Telia footprint participated in a 2-day 
cultural workshop followed by additional feedback 
sessions from focus groups and workshop with 
Group Executive Management. 

Bridging over to 2023, the cultural journey will 
continue with updated Leadership programs for 
our leaders, continuing to integrate and activate 
the leadership framework. During first half of 
2023 several workshop will take place across Telia 
markets focusing on behavioral change and how to 
ensure the changes are incorporated in all people 
processes. 

YouFirst
YouFirst is our group-wide approach to employee 
performance evaluation and development; ensuring 
that we set clear expectations and priorities, 
coach our people to success, focus on growth 
and recognize and reward high performance. It 
is integrated in daily work through continuous 
dialogue between the employee and his/her 
leader, enabling regular performance coaching and 
feedback for all employees.

Performance excellence is key for us to successfully 
transform. During 2022 we have implemented 
a new framework for all employees and leaders 
to optimize their impact on company results 
– focusing performance with greater strategic 
alignment and personalized growth. 

In the Learning area have we accelerated 
and delivered a broad portfolio for both 

self-development, team development, up and 
reskilling. We have launched Change-management 
trainings and updated our common leadership 
program linked to our Leadership Expectations. 
We have increased the engagement in our 
digital platforms with the aim to drive a culture of 
growth, innovation, and continuous improvement 
by collaborating close with the business and 
influencing effectiveness, efficiency and 
productivity.

Building a sustainable workforce
With a highly competitive talent market we continue 
to focus on attracting and retaining the right people 
today and going forward. We are actively and 
continuously working to future proof our workforce 
using strategic workforce planning and analytics 
in combination with targeted upskilling efforts to 
accelerate our shift towards skilled profiles who 
are strong in automation, digital, and agile (among 
others).

To be able to retain and increase the diversity of our 
tech workforce, we have set a public commitment that 
reskilling and upskilling initiatives should be based on 
equal opportunity, open and inclusive for all. During 
the year we have also continued to launch new digital 
interfaces for learning as well as new collaborations 
with several acclaimed content providers.

During the year, we established a baseline for one 
of our top people priorities; to define our future 
workforce and organizational design. Based on 
an analysis of our markets and units, we have 
set an ambition for Telia’s workforce size, shape 
and composition over the coming years. Several 
initiatives to reach the ambitions have been 
identified and are in execution, both with indirect 
and direct impact on our workforce (e.g process 

excellence, product portfolio simplification, etc.). 
Workforce changes will be a part of the broader 
shift towards digitalization and automation and will 
follow the migration away from legacy networks 
and products.

Respecting labor rights
We are committed to respect the rights of our 
employees, confirmed by our People policy. As we 
are operating in a context characterized by strict 
labor laws and a high degree of unionization, many 
aspects are secured through legal compliance 
measures embedded in Telia’s processes and 
through collective bargaining agreements. 

Freedom of association and the right to collective 
bargaining
All employees, regardless of location or 
employment type, have the right to choose to be 
represented by a trade union for the purposes 
of collective bargaining. No employee shall be 
discriminated for exercising this right. These 
principles are also included in the Supplier Code 
of Conduct, which means that we also expect all 
suppliers to recognize these rights. At year-end, 
92% of employees were covered by collective 
bargaining agreements. Telia Company cooperates 
with employee representatives and national trade 
unions in accordance with both national legislation 
and applicable collective bargaining agreements. 
Together with employees in the Nordic and Baltic 
operations Telia Company has established a 
European Works Council (EWC) that serves as an 
employee representative forum for information 
and consultation with the Group Executive 
Management on transnational matters. In addition, 
local companies regularly engage with local trade 
unions. During the year, there has been one strike 
during collective bargaining in the ICT sector in 

34Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



Finland and a settlement was found during June. 
Besides that, there has been no labor disputes 
resulting in strikes or notices of strike. During 
the year, Telia Company carried out a number of 
reorganizations that impacted employees across 
the group. In all cases, local companies complied 
with applicable legal obligations relating to union 
information and consultation.

Diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity
We are committed to building a diverse and 
inclusive culture. As of 2021, Telia has a D&I 
ambition as well as public employee diversity 

Parental leave
Benefits such as parental leave is applicable in each 
of our markets, in accordance with local laws. In 
all cases employees are subject to apply parental 
leave when a childbirth or an adoption takes place.

Remuneration 
to executive 
management

Remuneration principles for Group Executive 
Management 2023
The AGM on April 2, 2020, decided on guidelines for 
remuneration to Group Executive Management which 
have remained applicable during 2022. The Board of 
Directors will propose changes to the guidelines to 
the AGM on April 5, 2023, see proposal below. 

Group Executive Management is defined as the 
president and the other members of the management 
team who report directly to the CEO. These guidelines 
are applicable to remuneration agreed, and 
amendments to remuneration already agreed, after 
adoption of the guidelines by the 2023 AGM. These 
guidelines do not apply to remuneration resolved by 
the General Meeting.

The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure that 
Telia Company can recruit and retain qualified 
employees, which is a prerequisite for the 
successful implementation of the Company’s 
business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term 
interests, including its sustainability objectives. The 
proposed guidelines will be effective at the time of 
the AGM decision.

and inclusion targets. Our work to integrate equal 
opportunity into all People Processes such as 
rewards, recruitment, performance management 
and leadership is continuous. A big focus has 
been to continue to raise awareness, both through 
live and online trainings for managers as well as 
virtual common employee engagement activities 
on D&I topics. Read more about our progress of 
the public targets, our diversity data, inclusion 
engagement scores and our local initiatives in 
the Sustainability chapter, Diversity, inclusion and 
well-being.

Engagement, well-being and future way of 
working
According to our employee engagement survey 
we have during the year continued to keep high 
physical well-being while preserving engagement 
and motivation. Read more in the Sustainability 
chapter, Diversity, inclusion and well-being.

During the year we have continued to work 
according to our “Office first” model. The model 
is built on an office first approach that enhances 
flexibility in the workplace, enabling employees 
to thrive together physically whilst leveraging the 
opportunities of working from home.

Total remuneration
The remuneration to the Group Executive 
Management shall be based on the principle that it 
is the total remuneration that shall be considered. 
The total remuneration shall be competitive, but not 
market leading and shall be evaluated against a set 
of peer group companies within the similar industry 
and of comparable size and complexity. It shall also 
create prerequisites for international recruitment and 
diversity within the Group Executive Management. 
The total remuneration may consist of fixed base 
salary, pension, other remuneration and other 
benefits. Telia Company shall not offer any variable 
remuneration to the Group Executive Management.

For employments governed by rules other 
than Swedish, pension and other benefits may 
be adjusted for compliance with local rules or 
established local practice. Such adjustments shall 
to the extent possible serve the overall objectives 
of these guidelines.

Fixed base salary
The fixed base salary shall be based on 
competence, responsibility and performance. 
Market benchmarks should be made regularly. The 
individual performance shall be evaluated and be 
used as a basis for the annual review of fixed base 
salaries. The performance shall be evaluated in 
relation to the fulfilment of annual pre-determined 
targets which shall include financial, employee and 
sustainability targets.

Pension, other remuneration and other benefits
Pensions and pension benefits shall be based on 
a defined contribution model, which means that 
a pension premium is paid amounting to a fixed 
percentage of all or part of the individual’s annual 

fixed base salary, unless legal requirements or 
collective agreements state otherwise. The pension 
premium may not exceed 30% of the annual fixed 
base salary. In addition, a cash allowance may be 
paid which together with the pension premium may 
not exceed 35% of the total remuneration. 

The Company may provide other benefits in 
accordance with prevailing market practice from 
time to time. A member of the Group Executive 
Management may be entitled to, inter alia, car 
benefits as well as medical and healthcare benefits. 
The cost of such other benefits shall not exceed 
10% of the annual fixed base salary.

Members of the Group Executive Management 
may for a limited period of time be offered certain 
benefits related to an international assignment or 
as a result of recruitment from another country. 
Such benefits may not in total exceed 25% of the 
annual fixed base salary.

Conditions for termination and severance pay
The termination period for a member of the Group 
Executive Management may not be less than six 
months (twelve months for the Chief Executive 
Officer) upon termination by the employee and not 
more than twelve months upon termination by the 
Company. Upon termination by the Company, the 
individual may be entitled to a severance payment. 
Fixed base salary during the notice period and 
severance pay may together not exceed an amount 
equivalent to the fixed base salary for two years.

Severance pays shall not constitute basis for 
vacation pay or pension. Remuneration during the 
termination period and severance pay shall be 
reduced if the individual is entitled to remuneration 

from a new employment or if the individual will be 
conducting own business during the termination 
period or the period under which severance pay 
is paid. In addition, remuneration may be paid for 
non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration 
shall compensate for potential loss of income and 
shall only be paid to the extent the previously 
employed executive is not entitled to severance 
pay. The remuneration shall be based on the 
fixed base salary at the time of termination of 
employment, amount to not more than 60% of 
the fixed base salary at the time of termination 
of employment and be paid during the time the 
non-compete undertaking applies, however not for 
more than twelve months following termination of 
employment.

Salary and employment conditions for 
employees outside of the Group Executive 
Management
In preparation of the Board of Directors’ proposal 
for these remuneration guidelines, salary and 
employment conditions for the Company’s 
employees have been taken into account by including 
information on the employees’ total remuneration, the 
components of the remuneration and increase and 
growth rate over time, as basis for the Remuneration 
Committee’s and the Board of Directors’ decision 
when evaluating whether the guidelines and the 
limitations set out herein are reasonable.

Shareholding targets for the Group Executive 
Management
The Board of Directors is of the opinion that a 
considerable long-term shareholding in Telia 
Company is an important part in aligning the 
interests of the Group Executive Management with 
the interests of the shareholders, and therefore 

recommends the Chief Executive Officer and other 
members of the Group Executive Management 
to build up a personal holding of Telia Company 
shares equivalent to 100% of the Chief Executive 
Officer’s and 50% of other members of the Group 
Executive Management’s annual fixed base salary 
(net after tax) within timeframes set by the Board of 
Directors.

The decision-making process to determine, 
review and implement the guidelines
The Board of Directors has established a 
Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration 
Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board 
of Directors’ resolutions in remuneration-related 
matters, and preparing the Board’s proposal for 
guidelines for remuneration to the Group Executive 
Management. The Board of Directors shall prepare 
a proposal for new guidelines when there is a need 
for material amendments to the guidelines, but at 
least every fourth year, and submit it to the General 
Meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new 
guidelines are adopted by the General Meeting. 
The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor the 
application of these guidelines as well as the current 
remuneration structures and compensation levels 
within the Company. The Board of Directors shall 
annually prepare a remuneration report which shall 
be submitted to the General Meeting for approval.

Decisions regarding remuneration shall be 
managed through a well-defined process that 
ensures that no individual is involved in the 
decision-making process related to their own 
remuneration. The Chief Executive Officer’s total 
remuneration is decided by the Board of Directors 
based on the recommendation of its Remuneration 
Committee within the confine of these guidelines. 

36Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



The total remuneration to the other members of 
the Group Executive Management is approved by 
the Remuneration Committee, based on the Chief 
Executive Officer’s recommendations.

Deviation from the guidelines
The Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to 
derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, 
if in a specific case there is special cause for the 
derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve 
Telia Company’s long-term interests, including its 
sustainability, or to ensure the group’s financial 
viability. As set out above, the Remuneration 
Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board of 
Directors’ resolutions in the remuneration related 
matters. This includes any resolution to deviate 
from the guidelines.

Description of material changes to the guidelines 
and how comments from shareholders have 
been taken into consideration
In relation to the remuneration guidelines adopted 
by the 2020 AGM, the guidelines have, other than 
editorial amendments, been adjusted so that 
pension premiums may not exceed 30% of the 
annual fixed base salary (previously 40%). In order 
to compensate for reduced pension premiums, 
the possibility of paying a cash allowance which, 
together with the pension premium, may not exceed 
35% of the total remuneration has been introduced. 
The remuneration guidelines have further been 
supplemented with shareholding targets for 
members of Group Executive Management with the 
aim that they should have a significant long-term 
shareholding in Telia Company. Currently applicable 
Remuneration guidelines are available in Note C32 
to the consolidated financial statements.

Long-term incentive program 2022/2025
The AGM held on April 6, 2022, resolved to launch 
a long-term incentive program (LTI) comprising of 
approximately 250 key employees. This program is 
not available for the members of Group Executive 
Management due to this being a requirement of our 
largest owner (the Swedish state). The purpose of 
the program is to strengthen the company’s ability 
to recruit and retain talented key employees, create 
a long-term confidence in and commitment to the 
group’s long-term development, align key employees’ 
interests with those of the shareholders, increase 
the part of the remuneration that is linked to the 
company’s performance and encourage shareholding. 
The program rewards performance measured over a 
three-year period, is capped to a maximum value of 
60% of the annual base salary and is equity based 
(delivered in Telia Company AB shares). A prerequisite 
for pay-out from the LTI program is the continuous 
employment during the length of the program.

The targets are Cashflow, Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE), Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). 
The final allotment of Telia Company AB shares will 
be based 25% on Cashflow, 20% on a third-year 
final target for ROCE, 40% on TSR compared to a 
corresponding TSR development of a pre-defined 
peer group of companies and 15% on the ESG 
part. ESG is defined by three separate performance 
conditions based on Climate, Digital Inclusion and 
Privacy which have been set in line with targets in 
the Company’s annual and sustainability reporting. 
The three ESG performance conditions entail 5% 
weight respectively.

The maximum number of Performance Shares a 
participant can receive is based on 30% of the 
participant’s annual salary and related to the share 
price.

Cashflow represents 25% of the Performance 
Shares (or 7.5% of the participant’s annual salary):
• If 100% (or above) of the Cashflow target is met, 

100% of Performance Shares under the Cashflow 
part will vest.

• If less than 90% of the Cashflow target is met, no 
Performance Shares under the Cashflow part will 
vest. 

• If 90% of the Cashflow target is met, 25% of 
Performance Shares under the Cashflow part will 
vest. 

• If between 90 to 100% of the Cashflow target 
is met, a proportionate amount of Performance 
Shares under the Cashflow part will vest. 

ROCE represents 20% of the Performance Shares 
(or 6% of the participant’s annual salary):
• If 100% (or above) of the Company’s ROCE target 

is met, 100% of Performance Shares under the 
ROCE part will vest.

• If less than 90% of the Company’s ROCE target is 
met, no Performance Shares under the ROCE part 
will vest. 

• If 90% of the ROCE target is met, 25% of the 
Performance Shares under the ROCE part will 
vest. 

• If between 90 to 100% of the ROCE target is met, 
a proportionate amount of Performance Shares 
under the ROCE part will vest. 

The TSR part represents 40% of the Performance 
Shares (or 12% of the participant’s annual salary): 
• If the Company’s TSR is ranked first or second 

compared to the defined peer group of 
companies, 100% of the Performance Shares 
under the TSR part will vest.

• If the Company’s TSR is ranked third of fourth, 
75% of the Performance Shares under the TSR 
part will vest.

• If the Company’s TSR is ranked fifth or sixth, 50% 
of the Performance Shares under the TSR part 
will vest.

• If the Company’s TSR is ranked seventh, 25% of 
the Performance Shares under the TSR part will 
vest.

• If the Company’s TSR is ranked eight or lower, no 
Performance Shares under the TSR part will vest.

The ESG part represents 15% of the Performance 
Shares (or 4.5% of the participant’s annual salary): 
• If 100% (or above) of the ESG target is met, 100% 

of Performance Shares under the ESG part will 
vest.

• If the minimum level is not reached, no 
Performance Shares under the ESG part will vest. 

• If the minimum level is reached, 25% of 
Performance Shares under the ESG part will vest

• If between the minimum level and 100% of the 
ESG target is met, a proportionate amount of 
Performance Shares under the ESG part will vest. 

The program may be repeated annually. Similar 
programs were launched in 2010-2021. The 
prevalence of an LTI program is subject to the 
approval of the AGM. For more information on 
Telia Company’s LTI programs, see Note C32 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

Country development in 2022
Sweden
Telia continued to lead the 5G build-out and 
achieved 53% population coverage by the end of 
the year, remaining on track to reach the target of 
more than 90% population coverage by the end of 
2023. The modernization of the existing 4G network 
also continued, helping to provide an even better 
customer experience, as evidenced by Telia’s mobile 
network again being ranked as the best in Sweden 
by the independent benchmarking company umlaut. 
During the year, Telia also divested 49% of its 
Swedish tower business to Alecta and Brookfield 
(see Note C20), with the net proceeds of SEK 5.4 
billion transferred to Telia Company’s shareholders 
via a share buyback program. 

During the year, Telia took several important 
steps to improve the customer experience for 
consumers. These included, among others, adding 
coverage of Sweden’s top football league to its 
sports aggregation proposition and the launch of 
new unlimited mobile connectivity and content 
offerings, as well as streaming services. On the 
enterprise side, Telia continued to enjoy a high 
level of trust, which together with the broadest 
portfolio of services resulted in multiyear contracts 
with high-profile customers. Examples include an 
agreement to provide Ellevio, one of Sweden’s 
largest electricity network companies, with digital 
infrastructure for its smart grid, and another deal 
to provide a full-service ICT solution for NCC, a 
leading construction company in the Nordics. Telia 
also reached an agreement with the Swedish Civil 

Contingencies Agency to provide radio access 
network services. Telia also launched a solution that 
could help to reduce the energy consumed to heat 
buildings by up to 10%.
 
Consumer segment service revenue increased by 
1.1% as strong mobile-, TV- and fixed broadband 
revenue development more than compensated for 
a continued decline in fixed telephony revenue. 
In the Enterprise segment, competition remained 
tough, and despite a continued decline in fixed 
telephony revenue, service revenue increased by 
0.4%. This represents a substantial improvement 
compared to previous years.

Net sales increased by 1.9% to SEK 35,112 million 
(34,451) and like-for-like net sales increased by 
1.9%, driven by increases in equipment sales and 
service revenue.

Like-for-like service revenue increased by 0.8% 
as growth in mobile-, TV- and fixed broadband 
revenue more than compensated for continued 
pressure on fixed telephony revenue, in particular, 
as well as lower revenue from business solutions.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.1% to SEK 13,508 
million (13,359) and the adjusted EBITDA margin 
decreased to 38.5% (38.8). Like-for-like adjusted

million related to copper network assets.

CAPEX excluding licenses, spectrum and right-of-

Finland
Telia continued to make good progress on the 
network modernization and 5G rollout agenda 
and, by year-end, had achieved 5G population 
coverage of 79%. Dedicated work to improve 
the network led to Telia winning awards in all five 
categories in the independent benchmarking 
company Tutela’s report, based on assessments 
of the mobile network user experience in Finland 
using extensive crowdsourced measurements. Telia 
scored particularly well in overall Core Consistent 
Quality and average Coverage Score, and shared 
the number one position for 5G Consistent Quality 
and Video Experience. Furthermore, Telia became 
the first operator in the world to implement a virtual 
private network based on network slicing and edge 
computing.
 
Net sales increased by 4.7% to SEK 15,190 million 
(14,504) and like for like net sales increased by 
0.1%, as lower equipment sales were more than 
offset by increased service revenue. Exchange rate 
fluctuations had a positive impact of 4.7%.

Like-for-like service revenue increased by 0.6% as 
2.6% growth in mobile service revenue, driven by 
increased ARPU, was partly offset by decreased 
fixed service revenue, predominantly related to 
business solutions and fixed broadband. 

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 2.8% to SEK 
4,443 million (4,322) and the adjusted EBITDA 
margin declined to 29.3% (29.8). Like-for-like 
adjusted EBITDA decreased by 1.6%, mainly due 
to operational expenses increasing as realized 
efficiencies, and especially those related to 
resource costs, were more than offset by increased 
energy costs.

Operating income amounted to SEK -8,716 million 
(1,354), impacted by an impairment of SEK -9,500

Norway
In parallel with the modernization of Telia’s mobile 
network, the 5G rollout made good progress, 
resulting in 5G population coverage of 84% by the 
end of the year. Furthermore, Telia and Fjordkraft 
entered into a long-term agreement under which 
Fjordkraft’s mobile customers will be transferred to 
Telia’s award-winning mobile network in 2023. 

On the consumer side, Telia added Netflix and TV2 
to the more than 100 TV channels and streaming 
services already available in its TV offering. On the 
enterprise side, Telia secured several important 
contracts, including an agreement with the 
Armed Forces for the delivery of fixed and mobile 
connectivity services, as well as an agreement with 
34 municipalities and roughly an equal number of 
municipal businesses in Rogaland and Vestland 
for connectivity services. In addition, Telia signed 
a strategic multiyear agreement for connectivity 
solutions with Usbl, one of Norway’s largest 
developers of housing associations.

Net sales increased by 8.9% to SEK 15,022 million 
(13,788) and like-for-like net sales increased by 
3.5% due to increased service revenue, which more 
than compensated for lower equipment sales. 
Exchange rate fluctuations had a positive impact 
of 5.5%.

Like-for-like service revenue increased by 5.6%, 
driven predominantly by mobile service revenue 
increasing by 6.9%, but partly also by increased 
fixed service revenue. The latter increased due to 
a positive development for revenue associated 
mainly with fixed broadband and TV.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 8.2% to SEK 
6,750 million (6,240) and the adjusted EBITDA 
margin decreased to 44.9% (45.3). Like-for-like

Lithuania
Telia secured spectrum in the 700MHz and 3.6Ghz 
bands and, thanks to several years of preparation 
for the launch of commercial 5G services, was able 
to instantly achieve 5G population coverage of 
80% in the third quarter when the spectrum was 
switched on. 5G population coverage increased 
further to 86% by the end of the year, putting Telia 
in a good position to continue to provide customers 
in Lithuania with the best possible connectivity 
and customer experience. Telia also received 
recognition for its sustainability work in the form 
of a NAVA award for significant contributions to 
environmental protection. For example, Telia was 
the first operator to introduce refurbished mobile 
phones in Lithuania and, together with other 
operators, launched the Eco Rating initiative, which 
evaluates the environmental impact of mobile 
phones.

Net sales increased by 10.7% to SEK 4,784 million

5.7%, driven mainly by increased service revenue. 
Exchange rate fluctuations had a positive impact 
of 5.0%.

Like-for-like service revenue increased by 6.5%, 
supported by growth of mobile and fixed service 
revenue. Mobile service revenue growth of 10.2% 
was the result of customer base expansion coupled 
with growing ARPU, whereas fixed service revenue 
increased by 3.9% due to strong growth in fixed 
broadband and business solutions revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 11.7% to SEK

of 4.9%.

Like-for-like service revenue increased by 5.7%, 
driven by mobile- and fixed service revenue 
increasing by 6.6% and 5.5%, respectively. Mobile 
service revenue growth was attributable to an 
expanding ARPU and subscriber base, whereas the 
fixed service revenue increase was predominantly 
driven by growth in fixed broadband and business 
solutions revenue, which together more than offset 
a continued decline in fixed telephony revenue.

Commercial and 
business model 
disruption

High inflation and increased interest rates risk 
driving the economy further into recession. At the 
same time, our industry is undergoing a historical 
transformation and there is an increasing need 
for innovation to ensure growth and maintain 
competitiveness. In addition, there is continued 
price pressure on services, driven by increasing 
competition in our B2B and B2C businesses.

Potential impact
Failure to anticipate and respond to the current 
economic headwinds and industry dynamics, and 
to drive a change agenda that meets mature and 
developing demands in the market, may affect 
Telia’s results and position in the value chain. 
Competition from a variety of sources, including 
current market participants, new entrants and 
new products and services, continues to intensify 
and may also adversely affect Telia’s results.

• Sustaining a premium 
position is fundamental in 
supporting pricing activities 
to offset inflationary pressure.

• Lead, monitor, and react to 
changes in customer and 
market behavior.

• Focused execution of 
business transformation 
programs to ensure growth 
and cost savings.

• Focus on partner 
collaboration to drive value 
creation.

Execution and 
Transformation 

To effectively execute our strategy, we invest 
in business transformation to improve agility 
and flexibility, reduce cost and complexity, and 
increase competitiveness, thereby boosting 
the attraction of our customer offering 
and, ultimately, our financial performance. 
Continuously managing risks, prioritizing the 
most important initiatives, and removing barriers 
to execution are key requirements for success.

Potential impact
Our transformation initiatives set out a series 
of financial and non-financial benefits to 
be achieved across Telia. Failure to execute 
could have a negative impact on business 
transformation and growth initiatives, potentially 
deferring revenue upside and delaying cost 
reductions and efficiency gains from transformed 
operations.

• Strengthening our strategy-
to-execution process by 
continuously simplifying, 
digitalizing, and improving 
the Telia Way of Working.

• An extensive execution and 
transformation portfolio has 
been established across Telia 
and comprehensive work is 
underway to refactor and 
rebalance plans to further 
mitigate current geopolitical 
and inflationary headwinds.

• A strategy-to-execution 
framework and process 
have been deployed to track 
business objectives and 
the progress made towards 
realizing them.

Risks and uncertainties that could specifically impact Telia Company’s 
operations include, but may not be limited to the following:

Cybersecurity, 
network quality,  
and resilience

Telia’s ability to deliver high-quality, secure 
services and networks is fundamental to our 
customers and critical for our commercial 
success. Cyberattacks aimed directly at Telia 
Company and our customers are becoming more 
sophisticated, and threats include loss of data

Potential impact
Failure to meet our customers’ security and 
quality requirements and expectations may have 
an adverse impact on our business, leading to 
indirect sanction costs, fines, contract penalties, 
damage to our reputation, and/or churn.

New security and national security regulatory 
requirements may impact how we build 
our infrastructure and our ways of working, 
potentially leading to cost increases.

• A cybersecurity program 
based on international

Capabilities, skills, 
competence and 
leadership

People are at the core of everything we do at 
Telia, and their talents enable us to execute 
on our strategy. Following the pandemic, the 
competition for talent has increased. To secure 
access to the right talent and execute on its 
strategy, Telia needs to attract and retain highly 
skilled employees and continuously develop its 
capabilities and competencies. Creating a strong 
culture focusing on accountability, ownership and 
clarity has raised expectations related to speed 
of execution, people engagement and customer 
experience.

Potential impact
A shortage of critical capabilities and 
competencies could lead to a shift in workforce 
composition and limit the progress on 
transformation.

The high pace of change, cost pressures and 
ambiguity within the company could have 
a negative impact on employee health and 
wellbeing. 

• Key initiatives are in place 
to drive strategic workforce 
planning, talent and skills 
mapping, and upskilling/
reskilling of existing 
workforce.

• Partnering and targeted 
recruitment efforts within 
specific competence areas.

• Intensive training programs 
have been established with 
a strong focus on internal 
growth and technical 
skills (e.g., our Telia Cloud 
Academy).

• Thorough follow-up on 
recurring employee surveys.

• A holistic and insight-driven 
Health and Welfare program 
aligned with employee 
experience drivers.

Third-party 
management

Telia relies on a vast number of suppliers, partners, 
and customers, some of which are in countries 
or industries that face challenges in upholding 
ethical and sustainable business practices. 
Despite efforts to conduct due diligence and 
audits, suppliers and business partners may be in 
violation of Telia’s requirements and/or national 
and international laws and regulations.

National and international sanction programs may 
also be imposed on our third parties, which may 
have a negative impact on our business.

Potential impact
Failure of Telia’s suppliers and partners to 
adhere to relevant laws, regulations and supplier 
requirements may risk or violate human and labor 
rights. Such failure or perceived failure may also 
damage the perception of Telia among customers 
or other stakeholders. Violations of laws, 
regulations or supplier requirements put suppliers 
and subcontractors at risk of needing to limit or 
terminate their operations, which may lead to Telia 
needing to seek new suppliers. This may have a 
negative impact on costs and/or delivery times. 
Violation of national and international sanction 
programs may result in penalties and damage to 
our brand and reputation.

• The supplier code of conduct, 
which stipulates Telia’s 
expectations on sustainable 
business practices, is included 
in all supplier contracts. 
In addition, the supplier 
security directive is included 
in contracts for suppliers that 
handle sensitive information.

• A risk-based supplier due 
diligence process is followed 
prior to signing or renewing 
contracts.

• Continuous monitoring 
through recurring screening 
and due diligence of high-
risk suppliers, partners and 
customers.

• On-site and off-site audits are 
conducted by Telia or through 
the industry’s Joint Audit 
Cooperation (JAC) initiative.

section chapter on

Customer privacy Ensuring the privacy and security of our 
customers’ data is vital for our business. Vast 
amounts of data are generated in and through 
Telia’s services and networks and we have a 
responsibility to protect this data from misuse, 
loss, unauthorized disclosure, or damage. New 
ways of connecting and data-driven business 
models increase the complexity of understanding 
and retaining control over how data is collected 
and used.

Potential impact
Actual or perceived issues related to network 
integrity, data security and customer privacy 
may violate users’ privacy rights and lead to an 
unfavorable perception of how Telia handles 
these matters, which in turn may impact the 
business. Failing to comply with national and 
EU legislation may result in significant financial 
penalties.

• Continuous compliance 
reviews of GDPR 
implementation.

• Ongoing implementation of 
common tools and processes 
to further improve the quality 
and control of compliance 
with customer privacy 
requirements.

• Strengthening of the 
organization and mandate 
for Data Protection Officers 
(DPO) and other privacy 
experts.

• Mandatory training on 
data security and privacy 
awareness for all employees.

Corruption and 
unethical business 
practices

The telecommunications industry is susceptible 
to a range of corrupt practices as it requires 
government approvals and necessitates large 
investments. In general, key areas with elevated 
corruption risks include the licensing process, 
market regulation and price setting, the supply 
chain, third-party management, and customer 
relations. Mergers and acquisitions may pose 
risks of corruption, fraud and unethical business 
practices and require extensive buyer/seller due 
diligence. 

Potential impact
Actual or perceived corruption or unethical 
business practices may damage the reputation 
of Telia. Actual corrupt activity may result in loss 
of trust and customers, financial penalties and 
debarment from procurement and institutional 
investment processes. As corruption is often a 
barrier for human rights and equal opportunities, 
actual corruption or fraud may lead to Telia being 
associated with human rights violations.

• Anti-bribery and corruption 
(ABC) program implemented 
in all parts of the organization.

• Continuous development 
and testing of ABC-related 
controls, including implemen-
tation of measures to improve 
automatic controls.

• As part of the merger and 
acquisition process, due 
diligence and handover 
plans are in place covering, 
for example, third party due 
diligence.

• Education and communi-
cation on ABC to targeted 
employees, specifically those 
in high-risk roles and newly 
acquired businesses.

Environment To forcefully address the climate crisis and the 
unsustainable use of natural resources, Telia has 
ambitious environmental goals in place. We see 
increasing requirements and expectations from 
customers, policy makers, investors, and others 
to manage negative impacts on environment 
and climate. Due to climate change, increasing 
numbers of extreme weather events (such as 
heat waves, flooding, and thunderstorms) pose 
risks to our infrastructures and services, which, in 
turn, are vital for societies to function.

Potential impact
Failure to deliver on our commitments and 
goals and thereby not meeting stakeholders’ 
requirements and/or expectations may lead to 
negative reputation, loss of revenue, inability 
to attract talent or limited access to “green 
capital”. Increasing electricity prices, scarcity of 
renewable energy certificates or the introduction 
of carbon taxation could increase operational 
costs. Extreme weather may lead to operational 
disruptions and drive the need for additional 
investments.

• Ambitious short-, mid-, and 
long-term goals for GHG 
emissions and waste, such as 
Science Based Targets, and 
related programs.

on environmental risks and 
mitigations, please see the

Regulation and 
licenses

Telia operates in a highly regulated industry. 
New legislation and precedents are constantly 
being developed in the EU and by the European 
Court of Justice, for example on net neutrality. 
This regulatory landscape imposes limits on the 
flexibility Telia has to manage its business. In 
several countries, Telia entities are designated as 
parties with significant market power in one or 
several telecom submarkets. As a result, Telia is 
required to provide certain services on regulated 
terms and prices, which may differ from the terms 
on which it would otherwise have provided those 
services. Effects from regulatory intervention may 
be both retroactive and prospective.
 
Potential impact
Regulatory changes and fragmented local 
implementation and interpretation affecting 
Telia’s business activities, as well as decisions 
by regulatory authorities or courts, including 
the granting or amending of telecom licenses 
and spectrum permits and increasing national 
security requirements, may affect Telia’s strategy, 
ability to conduct business, and financial results.

• Proactive outreach to 
legislators and regulators 
when laws are adopted 
and implemented, as well 
as when laws are applied 
in submarkets, including 
intervention and remedies.

• Continuous legal and 
regulatory monitoring to 
provide timely advice and 
assistance throughout the 
organization.

• Working closely with the 
line organization to build 
competence and ensure the 
integration of analysis and 
advice early on in all relevant 
processes.

Impairment losses 
and restructuring 
charges

Factors generally affecting the markets Telia is 
operating in as well as changes in the economic, 
regulatory, business, or political and societal 
environment may negatively affect management’s 
expectation of future cash flows attributable 
to certain assets. Telia may then be required to 
recognize asset impairment losses, including but 
not limited to goodwill and fair value adjustments 
recorded in connection with historical or future 
acquisitions.

Potential impact
Significant adverse changes in the economic, 
regulatory, business, or political and societal 
environment, as well as in Telia’s business plans, 
may affect Telia’s financial position, the results of 
operations, impairment losses and restructuring 
charges, which may adversely affect Telia’s ability 
to pay dividends.

For details on impairment testing, see section 
‘impairment testing’ in Note C12.

• Management constantly 
reviews and refines business 
plans, and may make exit 
decisions or take other 
actions to effectively execute 
on business strategy.

Human Rights Human rights are universal, indivisible, and 
interdependent, making them challenging to rank 
and compare. At Telia, we continuously work to 
identify the most salient human rights risks in our 
markets and value chain. We apply continuous 
human rights due diligence and conduct human 
rights impact assessments when there is a need 
for greater insight into the risk in question. 
We see growing stakeholder expectations 
from investors, business/public customers and 
regulators, including in relation to upcoming 
legislation on human rights due diligence and a 
social taxonomy.

Macroeconomic and 
geopolitical 

The overall macroeconomic environment is 
becoming increasingly uncertain. High inflation 
and rising interest rates may have a negative 
impact on customers’ buying behavior and our 
business. The length, impact and outcome of the 
ongoing war in Ukraine is highly unpredictable 
and raises numerous risks, including further 
destabilization and deterioration of the 
macroeconomic environment and increased 
likelihood of cyberattacks that may affect our 
networks. The energy crisis, brought about 
by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other 
environmental factors, has resulted in higher 
prices and increased volatility in the energy 
market and an overall weaker macroeconomic 
environment. Tensions between China and Taiwan 
contribute to increasing supply-chain uncertainties 
that may develop into a global semiconductor 
shortage.

Potential impact
Volatility in energy costs have had, and will 
continue to have, a significant impact on Telia’s 
energy expenses. In addition, high energy prices 
and high interest rates may have a negative 
impact on customer buying behavior, which 
could have an adverse impact on Telia’s earnings. 
Supply disruptions and delays, in particular 
in connection with semiconductors, will likely 
lead to further price increases. Telia may also 
be subject to direct cyberattacks affecting our 
operations and our customers, or be impacted 
indirectly by cyberattacks against critical 
infrastructure.

• Increased focus on structural 
cost takeouts and a more 
systematic approach to 
pricing.

• Price hedging to limit the 
volatility and financial impact 
of energy expenses.

• Increased follow-up of key 
business KPIs to mitigate any 
negative impact on financials.

• Active monitoring of the 
geopolitical risk landscape 
(e.g., Ukraine and Taiwan) and 
assessing any impact on Telia 
Company’s business.

• Risk assessments and 
preparation of contingency 
plans.

• Increased crisis coordination 
throughout the group to 
mitigate negative impacts.

• Closely monitoring the 
demand-planning process 
to mitigate supply-chain 
shortages and long lead 
times.

Group-wide Governance Framework
Telia Company’s group-wide governance 
framework is approved by the Board. Its purpose is 
to ensure that:
• the company has the understanding and 

prerequisites to fulfil promises and commitments 
to our customers, shareholders, and employees

• operational results correspond to decisions made, 
and are structured to encourage all employees to 
strive, within set boundaries, towards the same 
goals

• there is a common, clear understanding of the 
group’s purpose, values, roles, responsibilities, 
and authority to act 

Customer promises and key stakeholder 
obligations 
The customers are our champions in everything we 
do. The promises and obligations we make to our 
customers, shareholders and other stakeholders are 
the foundation for deciding what we shall achieve 
and the values we want to create.

Deciding what we shall achieve
We are building a Better Telia – our goal is to make 
Telia better for customers, better for our employees, 
better for our owners and better for the Nordic and 
the Baltic societies.

Purpose
To provide overall guidance to employees, 
the Board has approved a purpose statement: 
“Reinvent better connected living”. The purpose is 
a clear direction for the strategy to create a Better 
Telia, grow business and deliver sustainable value 
creation.

Strategic Priorities
Guided by our purpose to “Reinvent better 
connected living” we aim to grow our business 
and deliver sustainable value creation to our 
shareholders through four strategic priorities.

• Inspiring customers

experiences that go beyond connectivity is about 
making sure we deliver the best possible digital 
communications experience to our 24 million 
customers across the Telia footprint.

• Connecting everyone
Connecting everyone through the most trusted, 
reliable, and efficient modern networks is about 
strengthening and maintaining our network 
leadership in the region. Having secure and 
reliable infrastructure is at the core of our ability 
to offer connectivity.

• Transforming to digital
To better serve our customers we need to transition 
Telia into a more agile, digital, and leaner company 
and we do so with the help of our third priority, 
“Transforming to digital” which is one of the most 
ambitious transformation agendas in our industry.

• Delivering sustainably
Delivering sustainably through an accountable 
and empowered organization focuses on creating 
long-lasting and sustainable value for all our 
stakeholders by being a financially, socially, and 
environmentally strong and resilient company.

For more information on the strategy, see Our 
Strategy.

Operational, financial and sustainability targets
The Board is setting the direction for the coming 
years for operational, financial and sustainability 
matters. The targets are set for the group as a 
whole and for each country and business unit.

targets and governance, see the Sustainability 
section and the Director’s Report. 

Setting the boundaries for how we act

the boundaries for how employees shall act. Key 
elements are Telia’s values, policy framework and 
the corresponding steering documents, Delegation 
of Obligations and Authority and the Code of 
Responsible Business Conduct.

compass for how to act and behave in daily work.

approved by the Board, at least on an annual basis, 
after being reviewed at a Group Governance, Risk, 
Ethics and Compliance committee (GREC) or Group 
Executive Management meeting. The Board has

Group functions are responsible for driving 
developments within their respective areas to ensure 
efficiency and cross-border synergies.

All countries and group functions work in close 
cooperation with each other, providing advice and 
guidance to maintain high technical and commercial 
skills, ensure good management and regulatory 
compliance, use of economies of scale, as well as 
achieve a business that is sustainable in the long 
term. Resources, in terms of financial and human

the Group Policy on Media Owner Commitments, all 
editorial decisions are solely taken by personnel within 
the editorial operations and at the absolute discretion 
of the Editor-in-Chief. Editorial operations are separate 
from other parts of Telia Company, and we respect 
the editorial integrity of the mass media, including the 
confidentiality of sources and source material and the

organized social interests.
 
Strategy to Execution
The strategy to execution framework and process is 
deployed to redefine and allocate, measure
and track development of business objectives to 
realization/benefit.

Follow-up of our performance 
Performance follow-up is essential to be able to 
take corrective measures and plan for the future. 
Performance follow-up is applied to organizational 
units as well as individuals.

Business reviews
The CEO sets goals for the operations based on the 
direction of the Board.

To ensure performance, managers have annual 
targets for their respective operations. The plan 
for each unit is followed up in business review 
meetings held monthly and includes financial and 
operational reviews for the reporting period. The 
review meeting also includes a review of scorecards 
including operational, commercial, financial and 
people performance metrics as well as tracking of 
business initiatives. The business reviews allow for 
frequent follow-up of operational key performance 
indicators (KPIs) on the country and business unit 
levels. The operational KPIs are a key part of the 
follow-up and consist of several measurements that 
give management a good overview of the current 
state and progress over time. The Net Promoter 
Score (NPS®) framework is used to monitor and 
improve the customer experience that Telia 
provides. At the business review meetings, the 
CEO, CFO, COO, Head of Business Finance, Head 
of Investor Relations, and selected members of 
Group Executive Management attend, in addition 
to the respective country management. The Board 
receives reports on operational performance 
monthly, and at each ordinary board meeting, the 
group’s operational and financial performance 
is presented in detail by the CEO and the CFO, 
respectively. See also section Board of Directors. 

Risk and compliance reviews
The Governance, Risk, Ethics and Compliance 
(GREC) committee is the primary governing body 
for risk and compliance follow-up. For further 
information, see the section on Governance, Risk 
and Compliance, GRC.

Individual performance management 
YouFirst is the group-wide approach to employee 
performance and development. It guarantees that 
expectations and priorities are connected to the 
strategy, setting challenging goals and creating 
personal accountability for results. YouFirst is 
integrated in daily work through continuous leader- 
employee conversations that include coaching and 
feedback with all employees.

Individual performance management is also 
described in the Directors’ Report section on 
People.

Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) 
A group Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) 
function has been established to ensure that Telia 
Company has an integrated and strategic approach 
towards aligning governance and policies with 
company objectives, while effectively managing 
risks and promoting ethical and responsible 
decision making through compliance with all 
relevant policies, laws and regulations.

The Head of the GRC function acts as the owner of 
the group common GRC process, is also the Chief 
Risk Officer and, since October 1, 2022, reports to 
the Chief Financial Officer.

Function responsibilities include:
• Oversee the Group-wide governance framework 

(see Group-wide governance framework) and 
own the group policy framework and the group 
framework for ERM, policies and instructions 
within his/her areas of responsibility and to 
monitor compliance and support group-wide 
implementation

• Oversee the operational effectiveness of the ERM 
processes across the group and propose actions 
for improvement

• Monitor the risk level as well as the nature of 
specific risk matters across the group. As part of 
that responsibility, the Head of the GRC collects 
and aggregates the respective reports from 
countries and group functions in order to give the 
CEO and the Board a consolidated and holistic 
view on the group’s risk level and individual, 
material risks

• Facilitate and organize the governance, risk, and 

compliance (GREC) committee on group level
• Promote a culture that encourages ethical 

conduct and commitment to compliance as well 
as to assist, advise and provide objective and 
reasonable assurance that the company manages 
Compliance risks in an appropriate way.

Risks and uncertainties
Operating in a broad range of products, services 
and markets in the highly competitive and 
regulated telecommunications industry, Telia is 
subject to a wide variety of risks and uncertainties. 
Telia has defined risk as anything that could have a 
material adverse effect on the achievement of Telia 
Company’s strategic and operational goals. Risks 
can be threats, uncertainties or lost opportunities 
relating to current or future operations or activities.

Risks and uncertainties related to business and 
sustainability as well as to shareholder issues are 
described in the Directors’ Report section Risks and 
uncertainties and financial risks in Note C27 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

Risk management – the three lines model 
Telia recognizes that successful risk management 
is fundamental to achieving business and growth 
opportunities, by striving for the highest possible 
returns within acceptable risk and cost levels. 
Risk management is initiated on an Enterprise 
level, with a collaboration between the Strategy 
and Enterprise Risk Management functions to 
identify key risks, threats and consequences to 
specific value drivers and strategic objectives. 
The identified risks are analyzed and prioritized 
together with the Executive management team, 

who agree on a portfolio of Principal Risks. An 
Executive risk owner is assigned to each Principal 
Risk and tasked with defining the Principal Risk 
appetite, which is typically aligned with a Group 
Policy. The Principal Risks constitute the foundation 
of Telia Company’s Risk Management Framework.

The management of risk within each Principal 
Risk area is an integral part of Telia’s strategic and 
operational activities, business planning process 
and monitoring of business performance. Risks 
are continuously identified and assessed, and 
measures are implemented to mitigate and monitor 
these risks.

Risk management roles and responsibilities are 
aligned to the three lines model: 
• First line: The Head of Countries and Group 

Functions are accountable for Risk Management 
in their respective units and they assign Risk 
Management Coordinators who ensure the 
implementation of the Risk Management 
Framework throughout the line organization.  
The line organization is responsible and 
accountable for assessing, responding and 
controlling, through internal control activities and 
reporting risks to local risk committees.

• Second line: Comprises the group-level 
Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) function 
incorporating Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) function and Group Compliance function, 
the Principal Risk area and assurance functions, 
the internal controls function within Group 
Finance, and the GREC (Governance, Risk, Ethics 
and Compliance) meetings. Principal Risk area 
coordinators are appointed by the Chief Risk 

Officer and are responsible for maintaining a 
holistic view of the risk area by ensuring that 
the risk appetite is cascaded throughout the 
organization, monitoring, and evaluating the risk 
and control capabilities, overseeing the operational 
effectiveness of the area’s risk processes across the 
Group and reporting risk posture to Governance, 
Risk, Ethics and Compliance (GREC). 

• Third line: The Group Internal Audit function 
provides independent and objective assurance 
and advisory services of governance, risk, and 
internal control.

In addition, external parties, such as the external 
auditors and regulatory bodies, provide assurance 
related to specific statutory requirements, e.g., 
information presented in the consolidated financial 
statements or reported to the Swedish Financial 
Supervisory Authority.

The aim of the continuous risk management 
process is to ensure all risks that may help or 
hinder the achievement of Telia’s objectives are 
regularly assessed, managed, and monitored. The 
risk management process promotes transparency, 
feasibility, and traceability and Telia strives to 
fully integrate risk management into all business 
processes. Management ensures that a personal 
sense of responsibility and common view on, and 
awareness of, risk is established among employees, 
as well as facilitating the accountability for risks in 
daily decision making. Risk reporting is integrated 
into the business planning process and risks 
are reviewed at business reviews and escalated 
through the line organization.

63Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



Management proactively conducts risk and 
compliance evaluations and assessments, on a 
regular basis and in a timely manner, to ensure 
that all employees are aware of and take steps to 
comply with the relevant requirements. Compliance 
indicates the conformance to external as well as 
internal requirements, such as applicable legislation 
and regulation, international standards and norms, 
and Group policies and instructions. 

Aligned assurance
Telia has adopted an aligned assurance way of 
working where the Enterprise Risk Management, 
Ethics & Compliance and Group Internal Audit 
communities align planning, executing and 
reporting assurance activities. Fundamental 
objectives of Aligned Assurance are to ensure that 
risks are being managed within the company’s risk 
appetite, as well as provide holistic visibility and 
assurance to the Board, management, regulators 
and customers. 

Information gathered through the assurance 
activities are aligned and provided to GREC and 
the Audit Committee. The aligned approach from 
assurance functions supports management’s 
decision making with comprehensive views of the 
company’s overall risks, current levels of control and 
effectiveness of mitigating activities.

Assurance framework
A risk and compliance assurance framework 
has been developed to support an aligned and 
systematic approach to assurance. The assurance 
framework consists of six elements that are 
founded on a sound and clear tone from the top. 
It is designed to adhere to international standards 
and is based on the principles of prevent, detect 

and investigate. The framework is used to establish 
assurance of the appropriate management of key 
risks in our risk universe.

Governance, Risk, Ethics & Compliance  
(GREC) committee
The purpose of the Group GREC committee is 
to act as the primary governing body for risk 
management and compliance throughout Telia 
Company.

GREC committees are also established on a 
country level and in selected group functions and 
subsidiaries (Common Products and Service).

GREC meetings, on all levels, are held at least 
quarterly and provide a forum for management 
updates, discussion, decisions and follow-up on 
risk and control mitigation activities and initiatives 
within the different risk areas and sustainability 
focus areas.

On group level, the GREC meeting is chaired 
by the CEO and consists of Group Executive 
Management, the Head of GRC as well as the Head 
of Group Internal Audit. The purpose, agenda, and 
participants of local GREC meetings mirror the 
group-level meetings.

Whistle-blowing and Speak-up line
2022 was the eighth year of operation for Telia’s 
speak-up line, the whistle-blowing tool available in 
11 languages. It enables employees and others to 
anonymously and confidentially report violations of 
proper accounting, reporting or internal controls, as 
well as non-compliance with local laws or breaches 
of Telia Company’s Code of Responsible Business 
Conduct, group policies and group instructions.

Internal controls over 
financial reporting

In accordance with the Swedish Companies Act 
and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code, 
the Board is responsible for internal controls over 
financial reporting. The Board continuously reviews 
the performance of internal controls and initiates 
activities to foster continuous improvement of 
internal controls. Telia Company’s risk management 
framework includes internal controls over financial 
reporting and is in line with the COSO framework 
for internal controls.
It consists of inter-related areas, which are control 
environment, risk assessment, control activities, 
information and communication, and monitoring.

To establish a consistent approach to, and a group- 
common view of, risks related to incorrect financial 
reporting, group-wide risk catalogues have been 
implemented in all major entities in which Telia has 
management responsibility. The internal control 
function within Group Finance is responsible for 
developing and maintaining the IT-based tool for 
managing the risk catalogues.

Internal control is an integral part of Telia’s 
corporate governance and enterprise risk 
management, which involves the Board, Group 
Executive Management and employees on all 
organizational levels. It is a process that includes 
methods and processes to:
• Safeguard the group’s assets
• Ensure the reliability and correctness of financial 

reporting
• Secure compliance with applicable legislation 

and guidelines

• Ensure that objectives are met and that 
operational efficiency is continuously improved

The objective of Telia’s financial reporting is to align 
with high professional standards and to be full, fair, 
accurate, punctual and understandable.

Control environment
The most essential elements of Telia’s control 
environment are the group policies with related 
group instructions as well as detailed group 
directives. Management at all levels is responsible 
for ensuring that the organization complies with 
the Delegation of Obligations and Authority issued 
by the CEO, the financial governing documents, 
the reporting framework, and other group 
requirements.

Group Finance is responsible for monthly 
monitoring and, if significant, communication of 
changes in legislation, listing requirements and 
financial reporting standards affecting financial 
group policies, instructions, or directives.

Management in each entity or group function is 
responsible for ensuring that:
• Monthly and quarterly financial statements 

comply with Telia’s accounting policies 
• Financial reports are delivered on time
• Activities to mitigate the risks, as specified in the 

group risk catalogues, have been implemented 
and are performed

• Material business and financial risks are 
identified and reported 

The financial shared services unit of Telia Company 
supports harmonized and standardized financial 
accounting processes and controls across large 
wholly-owned business units.

Risk assessment
Telia has a risk-based approach towards internal 
controls over financial reporting. Risk management 
related to financial reporting is incorporated in the 
group-common risk management framework as 
described in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework.

As such, assessment and management of risks 
that may result in inaccurate financial reporting 
is a natural part of the daily work, where the 
group risk catalogues are used as a baseline. Risk 
assessments are performed from both a top-down 
and a bottom-up perspective. The results of the 
risk assessments are documented in the group risk 
catalogues.

Control activities
All business processes across Telia include controls 
regarding the initiation, approval, recording 
and accounting of financial transactions. Major 
processes, including related risks and key controls, 
are described and documented in a common and 
structured way, based on the requirements set 
in the group risk catalogues. Controls are either 
automated or manual and designed to ensure that 
necessary actions are taken to either prevent or 
detect material misstatements and to safeguard the 
assets of the company. Controls for the recognition, 
measurement and disclosure of financial 
information are included in the financial closing 
and reporting process, including controls for IT 
applications used for accounting and reporting.

Information and communication
Group policies, instructions and directives, 
the reporting framework guidelines and other 
requirements regarding accounting and reporting 
as well as performing internal controls are made 

Telia has a group-wide standard for performing 
internal investigations. The guiding principle 
is to ensure that investigations are conducted 
objectively and impartially; are carried out in a 
way to swiftly establish the facts with minimum 
disruption to the business or the personal lives of 
employees; and to make sure that confidentiality 
and non-retaliation are respected at all times. 
Consolidated case reports have been presented 
to the Audit Committee throughout the year. The 
reports included allegations of certain significance, 
the progress of investigations and the final results 
of the investigations.

For more information about whistle-blowing 
reports, internal investigations and disciplinary 
decisions during 2022, see Note S16 in the 
Sustainability notes.

To the reader of this Statement: If you believe 
there are deficiencies in Telia Company’s financial 
reporting or if you suspect any misconduct within 
the Telia Company group, you may report your 
concerns at: www.speakupline.ethicspoint.com

The Head of Group Internal Audit reports 
functionally to the Audit Committee and 
administratively to the Telia Company Chief 
Financial Officer. The results from each specific 
audit assignment are reported to the line 
manager responsible for the audited area or 
unit, to relevant members of Group Executive 
Management, and to the external auditors. A 
summary of audit findings is reported to the 
Committee on a quarterly basis.

Auditors

Number of auditors and duties
According to its Articles of Association, Telia 
Company AB shall have no less than two and no 
more than three auditors and no more than the 
same number of deputy auditors. The AGM can also 
appoint only one auditor if the auditor in question is 
a public accounting firm. The auditor(s) report to the 
shareholders at General Meetings.

The task of the external auditor is to examine Telia 
Company’s annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, as well as to review the Board and the 
CEO’s administration of the company. The duties of 
the auditors include among others:

• Presenting the audit plan, scope and content of 
the annual audit to the Audit Committee

• Review the interim report for the third quarter
• Audit of the financial statements in accordance 

with international standards on auditing and 
generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden

• Conducting a statutory examination of the 
Corporate Governance Statement

• Conducting an examination of the statutory 
Sustainability Report. The auditors also perform 
an annual limited assurance of the Telia Company 
Sustainability Report.

The auditors present the results of their audit in 
the Auditors Report, as well as provide an opinion 
on whether the guidelines for remuneration to 
senior executives have been complied with, which 
is presented at the AGM. Furthermore, the auditors, 
on a quarterly basis, report to the Audit Committee 
and Group Executive Management regarding the 
audits performed and observations made.

For further information on the contacts between 
the Board and the auditors, see the sections on 
the Board of Directors and Internal controls over 
financial reporting, respectively.

Current auditors and fees
At the AGM 2022, Deloitte AB was elected as 
auditor until the end of the AGM 2023. Deloitte 
AB has appointed Peter Ekberg (born 1971), 
Authorized Public Accountant, to serve as auditor 
in charge. Deloitte AB is often engaged by Telia 
Company’s largest shareholder, the Swedish State, 
for both audit and advisory services. Peter Ekberg 
does not hold any shares in Telia Company.

For information on fees paid for audit-related and 
other services, see Note C33 to the consolidated 
financial statements.

At least once a year, the entire Board meets with the 
external auditors, in part without the presence of 
management.

Group internal audit

The Group Internal Audit function provides 
independent, and objective assurance and 
advisory services designed to add value and 
improve Telia Company’s operations. Internal 
Audit assists Telia Company in accomplishing its 
objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined, 
and agile approach to evaluating and improving the 
effectiveness of the organization’s governance, risk 
management and internal control.

The direction of the work of the internal audit 
function is stated in the audit plan. In order to 
reflect the overall business objectives and risks, the 
audit plan is aligned with the group strategy and 
business plans. The audit plan determines priorities 
and resource allocation. It is approved by the Audit 
Committee and presented to the external auditors 
on a regular basis. Quarterly, the audit assignments 
are discussed with the external auditors in order to 
share risk assessments and audit findings.

In 2022, audits were performed in group functions, as 
well as in the countries. Important audit areas were:

• Transformation
• Information and IT security 
• Finance
• Service assurance
• Compliance

accessible to all employees concerned, using Telia’s 
regular internal communication channels. Employees 
at group level continuously engage in internal training 
activities to ensure harmonization within important 
areas such as revenue recognition, distinction 
between capital and operating expenditure, etc.

Telia promotes an open, honest, and transparent 
flow of information, especially regarding the 
performance of internal controls. Control 
performers are encouraged to disclose any issues 
concerning their controls in the reporting, so that 
a problem can be taken care of before it, possibly, 
causes misstatements.

Monitoring
Telia has implemented a structured process for 
performance monitoring of internal controls 
over financial reporting. This process includes 
countries and group functions and consists of self-
assessments of the risk-mitigating activities. The 
internal controls function within Group Finance 
monitors the process monthly.

On behalf of Group Executive Management, the 
internal control function carries out an annual risk-
based compliance review of key risks to evaluate 
the quality of self-assessments, risk mitigation and 
the overall internal control environment.

The results of the self-assessments and the 
compliance review are communicated to the 
management of all relevant entities and to the 
Audit Committee. The Committee also receives 
reports directly from both external and internal 
auditors. The reports are discussed, and follow-up 
observations are made by the Committee. Both the 
external and internal auditors are present at the 
Committee meetings.

Sustainability 

Telia Company’s sustainability agenda and 
ambitions are thoroughly integrated in the 
company’s business strategy, as described in 
the beginning of this report (see Our Strategy). 
Our corporate purpose reflects a commitment 
and willingness to contribute to more resilient 
and equitable societies. Simply put, by 
reinventing sustainably, we reinvent better 
connected societies and improve the lives of 
our customers. In this section we present our 
most material impact areas, what we have 
achieved so far and challenges we face along 
the way.

How we 
prioritize Our material impact areas

• Human rights
• Children’s rights
• Freedom of expression 

and surveillance privacy

• Diversity, inclusion and

• Responsible sourcing
• Anti-bribery and

Other material impact areas

Privacy and  
security

Priority impact areas

In 2022 we took the next steps on this “double materiality” journey 
through which we confirmed nine material impact areas. As illustrated 
to the right, we have selected three of them as our main focus – 
Climate and circularity, Digital inclusion and Privacy and security. 
These are the areas that are connected to our core business and 
therefore offer particular leverage. The remaining six constitute 
essential building blocks of an ethical and rights-respecting culture. 
All impact areas are embedded in our Business strategy.

More information about stakeholder engagement and materiality 
determination is presented in Sustainability note S3, including specific 
context and trends for 2022 that affected our material impact areas.

We continuously analyze which sustainability 
topics (impact areas) we need to act and 
report on, either because Telia’s actions 
within the area in question may influence the 
world around us or because it may influence 
Telia’s financial value (based on the double 
materiality definition).

Sustainability governance

The ultimate responsibility for sustainability 
oversight lies with the Board, which also decides 
on the overall sustainability direction and policy 
commitments. The Board receives updates on 
sustainability performance twice a year and more 
often if needed as part of the CEO’s monthly 
updates to the Board. The Audit Committee of 
the Board receives risk reports from management 
twice a year, covering 12 principal risk areas that 
incorporate our sustainability impact areas, and 
decides on acceptable risk levels (see the section 
about Telia Company’s risk universe). 

Group Executive Management (GEM) and 
Governance, Risk, Ethics and Compliance (GREC) 
meetings are the primary decision-making 
forums at management level for sustainability-
related topics. GEM adopts and follows up on 
Telia’s sustainability goals, while GREC monitors 
sustainability-related risks via Telia’s Enterprise Risk 
Management Model.

Within GEM and GREC, the Chief External Affairs 
and Trust Officer has the overall responsibility for 
sustainability-related topics. 

The Group Head of Sustainability reports to the 
Chief External Affairs and Trust Officer and has the 

overall responsibility for proposing strategic content, 
goals, required actions and follow up of work that 
has been integrated across the organization.

The Head of Governance, Risk and Compliance 
is in charge of the company’s Enterprise Risk 
Management model, has operational responsibility 
and oversight over the anti-bribery and corruption 
program, and reports to the CFO. 

The Special Investigations Office manages the 
company’s whistle-blowing system (the Speak 
Up Line) with a direct reporting line to the Audit 
Committee of the Board. 

At the local level, local management teams and 
local GRECs have similar responsibilities as the 
GEM and Group GREC. 

There are also specific coordination and 
decision-making forums related to the respective 
sustainability impact areas, as reported separately 
in each impact area chapter. 

Read more in the Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) and Compliance Framework including 
information on Whistle-blowing and Speak-up 
line.

Code of Conduct 

The Code of Conduct, issued by the Board, provides high-level guidance on the 
essence of the company’s policies and instructions regarding various sustainability 
topics. It is therefore the company’s ethical compass and applies to everyone at Telia – 
employees, members of the board, contractors, consultants, and freelancers. Training 
in the Code’s content is mandatory and by year end 2022, 86% of all employees had 
completed the code training.  

The Board approves all policies that form the Code. Policies are publicly available on 
our website and can be further elaborated through instructions approved by the CEO 
or responsible GEM member. 

Sustainability is integrated into our daily business and our 
processes including strategy development, risk management 
and oversight mechanisms.

Our approach

To forcefully address the climate crisis and the 
unsustainable use of natural resources, Telia 
adopted two ambitious environmental goals in 
2019: to achieve zero CO2 emissions and zero 
waste by 2030.  

• The zero CO2 ambition focuses on creating a cli-
mate-neutral value chain by 2030. We are committed 
to at least halving absolute GHG emissions by 2030 
and offsetting the rest while continuing to move 
towards net zero, which requires further emission 
reductions and permanent removal and storage of 
carbon. In 2022, we submitted for external validation 
of a 2040 long-term net-zero target aligned with 
the new SBTi Net-Zero Standard (SBTi validation 
pending). 

• The work toward zero waste focuses on our opera-
tions, including network construction and mainte-
nance done by contractors. The aim is to prevent, 
reduce, reuse or recycle waste instead of sending it 
to incineration or landfills. 

• In addition, we are committed to enabling a net-
zero and circular economy through our offerings. 

Telia’s long-term decarbonization journey is broken 
down into more detailed goals to be reached by 
2022 and 2023, as well as 2025 science-based 
targets, aligned with the 1.5° C pathway for the ICT 
industry (see table to the left). 

Our approach is proactive and structured. Five 
out of six markets are covered by ISO 14001 

certification and three markets are covered 
by additional energy management systems 
(Sustainability note S18). Environmental screening 
of energy consumption, waste and GHG emissions 
precede investment decisions, which in turn affects, 
for example, product and service development. 
We acknowledge that we cannot achieve our 
goals alone. Therefore, we extensively collaborate 
and co-create with others to accelerate progress. 
Selected examples are presented in the section on 
Collaborations that shape our work.

Work during the year

01. CLIMATE

Creating a climate-neutral value chain
We have reduced absolute CO2e emissions from 
our own operations by 82% since 2018 (scope 1, 
2 and business travel). Part of the achievement 
relates to our decision to only use renewable 
electricity when powering our operations, including 
networks and data centers. In the coming years, we 
will continue our efforts to reduce the remaining 
emissions from our own operations generated by 
diesel-powered backup generators, district heating 
and business travel, among other examples. 
Meanwhile, we are offsetting these remaining 
emissions through carbon credits, which resulted 
in us being climate neutral in our own operations 
since 2020.

Climate highlights

85% 
of absolute emission reductions 
in own operations since 2018

As illustrated on the next page, most of our 
total value chain emissions, an estimated 91%, 
are generated in the supply chain, compared 
to only 1% generated in our own operations. 
Working closely with suppliers to ensure emission 
reductions is therefore key to achieve our goals. 
In the procurement process we assess suppliers’ 
climate management maturity to reward the best 
ones and influence the others. During 2022, we 
continued to engage with suppliers, urging them 
to set science-based targets, and by year end, 
suppliers corresponding to 35% of our total supply 
chain emissions were covered by such targets. An 
additional 16% have committed to set such goals 
within two years. Reaching our goal – 72% by 2025 
will require accelerated collaboration within the 
industry as well as policy measures such as efficient 
carbon pricing mechanisms. For more information on 
what we request from suppliers, visit our website. 

Our latest update of the most material emission 
areas in the value chain (category 1, 2, 11 and 13) 
shows a 7% decrease compared to base year 
(2018). The decrease is mostly due to changes in 
global carbon intensity factors (Environmentally-
Extended Input-Output factors, EEIOs) during the 
pandemic. To date, when we calculate the supply 
chain emissions, we largely depend on calculations 
based on EEIOs, which makes it difficult to track 
emission reductions based on supplier selection 
and supplier action. We therefore aim for a higher 
share of supplier- and product-specific data the 
coming years, as suppliers increase their ability to 
report data. We have also joined forces with peers 
and other global companies, such as Ericsson, Ikea 
and Unilever, in the 1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders 
initiative to provide support in both target setting 
and reporting via the Supplier Engagement Guide 
and the SME Climate Hub. 

In 2022, Telia together with Accenture created a 
modeling tool to monitor the expected emission 
curve up until 2040, based on current goals, planned 
actions, and expected effects from external drivers 
such as policy developments, the pace of energy 
transition, electrification, and digitalization, etc. The 
tool enables Telia to model effects due to changes in 
various parameters and see how it would impact an 
expected emission curve. The first analysis illustrated 
the need for an increased reduction pace in our 
supply chain and the need for a circular shift within 
Telia, our industry and society as a whole.

In 2022, an internal cross-functional group 
reviewed climate-related risks and opportunities 
from a 2025 perspective, to deduce how our 
business is likely to be affected by ongoing climate 
change. Areas covered included potential changes 
related to customer demand, changes in policy, 
access to capital and changes related to our supply 
chain. More information is available in the TCFD 
section of Sustainability note S4.  

Managing energy while digitalizing societies
Energy has been in focus for all players of society 
this past year and electricity consumption is one of 
Telia’s most significant environmental aspects. 

Our strategy to manage energy impacts and costs 
consists of several parts, including:
• Increasing energy efficiency through new network 

hardware and power saving features
• Managing power consumption through 

decommissioning legacy networks and 
modernizing sites, for example, by placing relevant 
units outdoors to reduce the need for cooling

• Only using renewable electricity when powering 
our operations and looking for alternatives to the 
remaining fossil-based energy sources

• Providing customers with solutions that enable 
energy reductions (see next section).

During the year we consumed approximately 1,136 
GWh (2021: 1,091 GWh) electricity in our own 
operations. Electricity use represented 94% of the 
total purchased energy while the remaining share 
consisted of district heating and district cooling, 
vehicle fuels, and natural gas. Since 2020, we only 
use electricity from renewable sources, covered by 
Guarantees of Origins or secured through long-term 
Power Purchasing Agreements for solar and wind. 
Energy efficiency measure have intensified during the 
past few years and compared to 2018, energy use per 
subscription equivalent has decreased by 7%. 

Additional energy data is provided in
Sustainability note S4.

Enabling other sectors to reduce emissions  
and energy
Several reports, such as the Exponential Roadmap 
report, show the potential of connectivity and 

digital solutions to improve resource efficiency and 
reduce GHG emissions across sectors. 
Since 2020, we track “enablement effects” for some 
of our products and services: remote meetings and 
IoT for buildings, transport, and utilities. Based on 
products and services delivered during and before 
2022, we estimate that these categories enabled 
emission reductions totaling approximately 
330,000 tons of CO2e in 2022, the equivalent of 
emissions arising from over 2.4 million return trips 
by air between Stockholm and Helsinki.

Apart from the carbon enablement effect, Telia 
also measures energy reductions enabled by IoT. 
Electricity savings from such services are important 
to enable reductions of other types of environmental 
impacts and contribute to the overall energy saving 
needs of Europe in 2022, which faced energy 
scarcity. We estimate that in 2022 we enabled 
electricity savings of approximately 810 GWh 
through IoT solutions for smart buildings and utilities, 
equivalent to the annual energy consumption of 
90,000 average Swedish households. 

Moreover, the underlying connectivity we provide 
enables further indirect reductions that are more 
difficult to capture. For example, as a connectivity 
provider we enable various digital solutions by other 
digital players, such as circular economy business 
models that significantly reduce resource use. 

Read more about our enablement methodology 
and the results in Sustainability note S4.

Green bonds

In 2020, Telia was the first telco in the Nordics to 
issue a green bond. In 2022 a new green hybrid 
bond of EUR 600 million was issued, making the 
current total outstanding volume of green bonds 
EUR 1,100 million. The proceeds have mainly been 
used to finance more energy efficient networks 
when we migrate from copper to fiber and 5G in 
Sweden, but also for green digital solutions that 
enable customers to reduce emissions and save 
energy. Read more in the green bond report.

will be critical if we are to tackle climate change and 
start existing within planetary boundaries that are 
safe for humanity and ecosystems. On the back 
of this reality, we have committed to reach zero 
waste in our own operations, including network 
construction and maintenance, by 2030. This 
means applying the principle of “Prevent, Reduce, 
Reuse and Recycle” (in that order) across all 
material streams. We are equally committed to 
enabling circularity through our offerings. 

Embedding circularity in our own operations
Our strategic focus lies on moving up in the waste 
hierarchy to prevent/ reduce waste and increase 
reuse and recycling rates. The current status towards 
our zero waste goal is shown on the next page with 
66% of waste being either reused or recycled during 
the year, 33% incinerated (with or without energy 
recovery) and 1% directed to landfill. Recycling and 
reuse opportunities vary across our markets and 
across diverse waste types. Incineration with energy 
recovery is a very common practice in Telia’s markets. 
The decommissioning of telephone poles generates 
a big share of what is being incinerated today. 
There is no alternative since the poles are classified 
as hazardous waste due to the fact that they are 
impregnated. Additional waste data is presented in 
Sustainability note S4.

Offering circular products and services
Environmental screening, focusing on emissions, 
energy, waste and hazardous materials, is included 
in our product development and sourcing process 
to impact products entering our flows. 

We also aim to scale circular business models 
and during the year we increased sales of mobile 
phones offered as a service to extend the lifetime

of electronics and increase recycling rates. Such 
circular business models require consumer mind 
shifts but are becoming increasingly interesting for 
our customers when we add value by, for example, 
providing hardware support and insurance instead 
by just delivering a product. 

In 2021, we launched Eco Rating of mobile phones 
in partnership with other operators to drive circular 
principles within the mobile phone manufacturing 
industry. The rating, which is based on lifecycle 
assessments, makes it easy for customers to 
understand the circularity aspects of a phone, it 
incentivizes mobile phone manufacturers to apply 
circular principles from the design to the end-of-life 
phase, and it helps Telia to prepare for upcoming 
new ecodesign requirements. By year end, 10 out 
of our top 12 mobile phone suppliers by spend 
were part of Eco Rating, and it was offered in all 
our markets – either to consumers or business 
customers, or to both. 

Enabling circularity in other sectors
Digitalization can accelerate the circular shift by 
enabling various sectors to use energy, fuel, water, 
and other resources in more efficient ways. As a 
connectivity provider, we enable various circular 
business models, such as sharing platforms, 
blockchain technologies for traceability, etc. In many 
cases, digital solutions also enable dematerialization. 
These effects are sometimes indirect but reflect the 
importance of our core business – connectivity. 

Circularity highlights and additional information are 
presented to the left and in Sustainability note S4.

The 2022 energy crisis deeply affected Europe 
economically, environmentally and socially. At 
Telia, this triggered additional efforts to reinvent 
energy, by limiting consumption and exploring new 
roles in the broader energy system. 

Our previous achievement, a full shift to renewable 
electricity through Guarantees of Origin, was 
complemented in 2022 by the signing of Power 
Purchasing Agreements in Denmark and Estonia 
to secure supply and contribute to the production 
of renewable wind and solar energy. The shift to 
renewable electricity has contributed to a 85% 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in Telia’s 
own operations, compared to 2018. 

Remaining emissions in our own operations relate 
to areas such as backup power and our car fleet. In 
Norway and Estonia, we piloted hydrogen as backup 
power, replacing diesel in some selected sites. The 
shift to electric vehicles (EVs) continued, with 17% 
being electric and 31% hybrid at the end of the 
year. The decision to switch to electric field service 
vehicles in Lithuania during the year will further 
increase the share of EVs in 2023. 

Reinventing energy

During the year, we also explored new roles in the 
wider energy system:
• We connected our Helsinki Data Center (HDC) to 

the Finnish electricity market to allow for HDC’s 
backup batteries to contribute to balancing 
production and consumption fluctuations in the 
Finnish electricity market, thereby contributing 
to the stabilization of the Finnish electricity grid. 
If a power outage or other exceptional situation 
occurs, the batteries will still be used to cover 
the data center’s electricity demand before the 
backup power generators start to operate. A 
similar setup is being explored in Sweden. 

• Telia Sweden initiated a collaboration with real 
estate company SBB to recycle excess heat from 
the Haninge Data Center to be used in school 
buildings, elderly housing and offices. The setup 
operates on geothermal principles, with SBB 
having built a bedrock-based borehole energy 
storage on one of its properties to store the 
excess heat produced by Telia’s adjacent data 
center. At the same time as the data center will 
be cooled down by the same borehole layer. 
100,000 square meters of SBB property receives 
self-sufficient heating, which corresponds to a 
saving of approximately 5,600 MWh per year.

Digital inclusion
Year Goals 2022 progress

2025 • Reach 1 million individuals by digital inclusion 
initiatives from 2021 to 2025

• 1,015,914 individuals reached since 2021 
(408,394 in 2022)

Our approach

Telia Company is committed to connecting 
everyone to the most trusted, reliable, and efficient 
modern networks. Ensuring that everyone has 
access to reliable connectivity and the right digital 
skills is the key to making sure that no one is 
left behind in the digital world. Our work within 
this area focuses on contributing to equality 
and inclusion, to make sure that individuals and 
societies in the Nordics and Baltics capture the full 
potential of digitalization.

Digitalization is currently transforming societies – 
bringing both new opportunities and risks. Those 
who are digitally included can make the most of 
new opportunities. Those who are not risk being 
left behind when services such as healthcare, 
banking and education are digitalized, and many 
social arenas continue moving online.

Work during the year

Providing reliable access
We are committed to providing high-quality 
services to our customers and in 2022 we 
continued making considerable investments to 

improve connectivity quality for everyone. At the 
end of 2022, Telia provided the following: 
• Almost 100% of the population with 4G data 

coverage  
• 70% of the population with 5G data coverage 

and the aim to reach over 90% of the population 
in all Nordic markets by 2023 

• 6.3 million homes across all markets covered by 
fiber access

• In areas where fiber access is not viable, we are 
providing Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) using the 
4G and 5G networks

Stakeholder concerns relate to two main areas, 
the differences in quality between urban and rural 
areas, and the effects due to the shutdown of the 
copper network. Differences in quality between 
urban and rural areas exist but we have committed 
to improving network coverage across our markets. 
The shutdown of copper networks represents risks 
but these are carefully managed in coordination with 
municipalities and relevant authorities to prevent 
negative effects on individuals or communities.

Due to increased inflation and the economic 
downturn in 2022, risks related to the affordability 
aspect of digital inclusion increased. We are 

Access + 
Digital skills =  
Digital inclusion

mitigating these by recommending lower cost 
subscription options to consumer who are facing 
challenges, or the possibility to switch to Telia’s low-
cost brands during challenging times.

Securing access for all is also about making it 
possible for individuals with disabilities to use our 
services. Telia’s global design system is compliant with
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
standard for color contrast, legibility, screen readers, 
etc. In addition, our internal Accessibility Center 
of Excellence continues to act as a knowledge 
hub to share accessibility expertise and increase 
collaboration. 

Building digital skills
As societies digitize, risks and opportunities linked 
to digital skills are increasing. Therefore, in 2021 
we launched a group-wide digital skills program, 
based on analyses of local needs. We aimed to 
reach one million individuals through these digital 
skills initiatives by 2025, targeting primarily seniors, 
children, immigrants, women, and SMEs. By the 
end of 2022, we had reached our goal (1,015,914 
individuals reached in total since 2021), three years 
ahead of the set target date. In order to stretch 
ourselves further, we made the decision in early 
2023 to add another million by 2025. 

During the year, in collaboration with experts from 
Malmö University and Jönköping University, we 
initiated a project to develop a methodology to 
measure the impact of a selection of Telia’s digital 
inclusion initiatives. The methodology and guide 
were tested on two digital inclusion initiatives in 
Sweden, to be finalized in 2023. 

More information on how we calculate “reach” 
and conduct impact assessments is available in 
Sustainability note S5. Examples of ongoing 
initiatives are presented on the next page.

Accessibility in our shops  
and offices 
In 2022, Telia Estonia in collaboration with 

accessibility experts carried out an accessibility 
audit in its physical and online stores and trained 
250 customer service employees on accessibility. 
In addition, Telia Estonia carried out a workshop 
called “Challenge Your Senses” at Telia’s office 
buildings to give employees the opportunity to 
learn about visual, hearing and motor disabilities, 
with more than 200 participants. 

Digital Inclusion Benchmark
The World Benchmarking Alliance 

encourages greater action towards achieving the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals. Through 
its Digital Inclusion Benchmark, it assesses 150 
global digital technology companies on actions to 
strengthen digital inclusion. In its second benchmark 
report released in December 2021, Telia was ranked 
11th out of 150 global companies, and fourth 
among companies in Europe. The Digital Inclusion 
Benchmark tracks how companies are supporting 
and promoting a more inclusive digital economy and 
society by assessing companies’ efforts in improving 
access, enhancing skills, building trust to foster 
beneficial use, and innovating openly, sustainably, 
and ethically. The main findings from 2021 are 
available on our website.

Making digital lives safer  
for children 
The online world gives children fantastic 
opportunities, but it also risks placing them in 
vulnerable situations. Spoofy is an online safety 
game, available both as an app and in a desktop 
version, which is connected to a website with 
additional digital skills materials for teachers and 
parents. It was launched in collaboration with 
consultancy CGI in Estonia during 2021 and in 
Lithuania in 2022 to teach younger children in a fun 
and gamified way about smart, safe, and friendly 
online behavior. In Estonia and Lithuania more than 
55,000 children, parents and teachers have so far 
used the game and/or the digital skills materials 
available on the website.

Helping new arrivals to increase 
their digital confidence 
Immigrants in our markets face barriers that could 
prevent them from finding employment. Telia 
Finland, in partnership with the Startup Refugees 
network, created a mentoring program to enable 
refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants to get 
employment in the IT industry. The mentoring 
program consists of various activities such as 
mentoring by Telia employees, a tech recruitment 
workshop, a career day, and a webinar introducing 
reskilling opportunities for immigrants interested in 
working in the tech sector. Since its launch in 2020 
more than 100 immigrants have participated in the 
initiative. 

Helping small businesses  
and startups to digitalize 
Research shows that SMEs are falling behind in 
digital competencies, which could impact local 
economies and livelihoods if they are subject to the 
growing cyberthreats. Technology Thursdays is a 
webinar series, organized by Telia Finland, initiated 
to increase small and medium-sized businesses’ 
knowledge about information security topics. Twice 
a month, the Technology Thursday webinars cover 
information security from different perspectives. 
In the webinars, cybersecurity experts discuss 
topics of information security from the perspective 
of both the end user and the company, giving 
the participants practical skills and knowledge to 
prepare for possible information security threats. 
During 2022, Technology Thursday webinars were 
joined by more than 3,000 participants. 

Improving the digital skills  
of seniors
Technology enables seniors to be socially active 
and access vital online services, such as those 
related to banking and health. However, technical 
aspects can be challenging. Launched in 2018, 
the “Digital Senior” initiative has so far helped 
approximately 12,000 senior citizens in over 33 
municipalities in Sweden and Norway to improve 
their digital skills and confidence. The sessions, in 
which young people trained by experts teach the 
seniors new skills, also enable meetings across 
generations. In 2022, the Digital Senior program 
continued with 22 events in 3 municipalities and 
more than 1,000 participants.

Privacy and security
Year Goals 2022 progress

2023 • Top-tier positions on customer privacy in  
all markets

• Ranked first or second by consumers in four out 
of six markets

• Preferred supplier, responsive to and proactively 
addressing customers’ security needs 

• Several contract wins with elevated security 
requirements during the year

Annual • Continuous implementation of “privacy and 
security by design” approach

• Achieved for the year

Our approach

We are committed to respecting the privacy rights 
of our customers and keeping their information safe. 
This requires a proactive approach to providing 
transparent information to users and ensuring that 
we are handling personal data on customers’ terms. 

Today, societies and individuals depend on 
our network infrastructure to function. We put 
significant efforts into securing service continuity 
and protecting our systems from cyberattacks. We 
also provide customers with knowledge and tools 
to protect themselves and their businesses against 
various forms of cyberthreats. 

Our 2023 goal is to have top-tier positions with 
regards to privacy in all markets and be a preferred 
supplier due to the measures we take regarding 
security. This requires robust processes, the right 
competencies and interaction with our customers 
to understand their expectations and needs. 

Our work is governed by Group policy – Security 
and Group policy – Privacy and data protection

01. SECURITY

Our processes
The development of geopolitical events is 
accelerating risks associated with cyberattacks for 
our customers, our industry and society at large. 
These risks need to be managed with a broad 
spectrum of proactive measures that allow us 
to effectively adapt to rapidly changing security 
environments. On the human side, we invest heavily 
in both broad security awareness throughout 
all parts of our organization as well as in deep 
expertise in the different security disciplines. 
We habitually challenge and adjust our security 
processes to make sure that they are fit for purpose 
not only from an internal perspective but also 
through the lens of independent, external security 
auditors. As for security tools, we recognize that it 
is key not only to increase investments in a modern 

and adequate suite but also to master its utilization 
to the fullest extent possible.

Our security governance framework is developed 
and refined in alignment with ISO 27001 and 
other relevant and well renowned best practice 
guidelines such as NIST CSF and CIS controls. It 
specifies requirements on information security and 
related risk management across all Telia functions 
and local organizations. We maintain an ISO 27001 
certificate in relation to which external audits are 
carried out annually to ensure proper security 
measures and continuous improvement.
 
Our Global Security Operations Centre (GSOC) 
takes responsibility for our reactive capabilities by 
monitoring and handling cybersecurity incidents 
around the clock. The GSOC is a member of the 
Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams 
(FIRST) and is a Trusted Introducer (TF-CSIRT).

Work during the year

Winning contracts with elevated security 
requirements
Our ambition is to stay close to customers’ security 
needs and be a preferred supplier. National security 
legislation is placing increasingly stringent demands 
on several of our most important customers and 
Telia is in an advantageous position to continue 
delivering the type and level of security that the 
most demanding customers need. During the 
year, we won contracts with elevated security 
requirements from public agencies and businesses 
that play a critical role in society. Examples include 

the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and the 
Norwegian Defense Materiel Agency. 

In 2022, we also stepped up communication efforts 
targeting small and medium-sized companies and 
consumers with the aim of making them aware of 
increasing online risks and advising them how to 
take precautions. These efforts included articles, 
training sessions and new product launches such 
as Trygghetspaketet in Sweden and Trygg Surf in 
Norway. Additional information on how we approach 
small and medium-sized companies is available in 
the Digital inclusion chapter. 

ISO 27001 certification 
Our ISO 27001 certification is an important part 
of the continuous strengthening of our practices 
and in meeting our customers’ demands. During 
the year, the certificate was maintained with an 
unchanged scope, comprising areas such as 
Global Security Operations Information Security 
Governance, Enterprise Information Security Risk 
Management, Incident Management and Change 
Management, SOC services, contact center 
services, and cloud-based communication services. 
More information regarding local certifications is 
available in Sustainability note S18.

Work to secure Telia’s business continuity
As digitalization gains pace, our customers and 
society as a whole are increasingly dependent on 
the services we provide. The invasion of Ukraine 
and subsequent events have put the spotlight on 
this fact. Therefore, we focus on the robustness 
and performance of the design and lifecycle of our 

88Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other

https://www.teliacompany.com/en/about-the-company/public-policy


services. We make sure that continuity and recovery 
plans are in place to build resilience and counteract 
unexpected disruptions.

Our Business Continuity Management (BCM) 
framework is applied to critical services, functions, 
processes, and resources. It identifies important 
dependencies and risks and secures an effective 
response to disruptive events. It also drives 
implementation of continuity measures and solutions. 
The framework is aligned with the ISO 22301 
standard and is our platform to meet regulatory 
requirements in the markets where we operate.

02. PRIVACY

Our processes
Telia has adopted a “privacy by design” approach 
to ensure GDPR compliance and transparent 
management of personal data in all new products 
and services. The key components of our approach 
are:
• Embedding data protection into our business, 

including products, processes, and IT systems 
from the initial design stage and then throughout 
their lifecycle

• Analyzing data protection parameters jointly with 
privacy experts, from the initial planning stages of 
a data processing operation

• Conducting a Privacy Assessment and when 
needed a Data Protection Impact Assessment 
(DPIA) before carrying out data processing where 
the initiative is likely to result in a high risk to the 
rights and freedoms of individuals

Continuous testing of processes, routines  
and controls
We continuously review and update privacy 
processes based on evolving best practices, 
applicable legislation, case law and government 
recommendations. Information on how we process 
customer data is provided through transparency 
notices available in all relevant languages.

Responsibility for customer privacy is divided 
between a Privacy Legal Team and the Data 
Protection Officer’s (DPO) Office. The Privacy 
Legal Team provides legal advice and proactively 
supports the business in the “privacy by design” 
work. The DPO Office has a special role due to 
GDPR requirements and is independent to avoid 
conflict of interest. The DPO Office carries out 
reviews and tests compliance with the GDPR and 
e-Privacy Directives, responds to requests from 
individuals in data-protection cases and interacts 
with data-protection authorities in matters related 
to customer privacy. The Group DPO reports 
regularly to the GREC management forum and the 
Board of Directors.

Work during the year

Strong privacy position
Consumer studies conducted by SB Insight show 
that privacy is among the top three sustainability 
topics that consumers want us to focus on. We 
regularly track how consumers perceive our privacy 
work compared to competitors through an external 
survey conducted by Telia. By the end of the year, 
four out of six markets were ranked first or second. 

Going forward, we will focus on continued work to 
strengthen our processes, build competencies, and 
enhance transparency in customer facing channels. 
The latter is important to increase customers’ 
awareness of how we use their data and which 
rights they have (examples provided below).

Securing the rights of users 
Individuals can exercise their GDPR rights by 
providing or withdrawing consent, objecting to 
certain processing purposes, or requesting to be 
forgotten. This can be achieved by contacting 
customer service, visiting Telia stores or accessing 
online customer self-service portals that enable 
individuals to easily access their accounts and make 
requests. 

During 2022, we received around 2,700 Right of 
Access requests from customers who wanted to 
obtain a copy of their personal data. This helps 
customers understand how and why we are using 
their data, as well as to check that we are handling 
it in accordance with the law.

To secure safe handling of personal data, privacy 
training is conducted via an e-learning course that 
is mandatory for all employees (by year end 2022, 
85% of all employees had completed the training). 
There are also specific courses for employees 
who handle personal data directly and have direct 
customer contact, such as customer care and retail 
staff, and for IT system owners. 

Work to identify and prevent data breaches
Telia entities follow a common investigation and 
reporting process in all suspected personal data 
breach cases. We report all personal data breaches 
to supervisory authorities and notify individuals in 
a timely manner, when applicable. To minimize risk 
of breaches, when a mitigating action is applied in 
one unit, it is also shared for implementation across 
the group subsidiaries.

In 2022, we confirmed 674 personal data breaches 
across our markets. Most cases were related to 
human errors or technical errors that caused 
personal data to be disclosed or accessed in an 
unauthorized way, for example if customer data 
was accidentally sent to the incorrect customer. 

Privacy risks related to state surveillance is reported 
under the Freedom of expression and surveillance 
privacy chapter. Definitions of terms used in this 
chapter are found under Sustainability note S6.

AI/data ethics  

In 2019, Telia developed its Guiding Principles 
on AI Ethics, a document which has played an 
instrumental role in the process of developing 
data-driven services (Telia Crowd Insights). An 
internal assessment of Telia use cases in 2022, 
based on the upcoming EU AI Act showed that 
our overall AI risk exposure is low but that certain 
use cases are associated with higher risks such as 
credit scoring, voice authentication and workplace 
analytics. We will monitor new risk areas as they 
emerge through screening questions within areas 
such as sourcing. Risks often relate to privacy but 
also other human rights.

Human rights
Year Goals 2022 progress

2022 • Update the analysis of salient human rights risks • Completed

Annual • Continuous application of Human Rights 
Assessments in relevant business decisions

• Assessment areas included: Children’s rights, 
5G deployment, Russian aggression towards 
Ukraine, AI, labor rights risks in local supply 
chains in infrastructure deployment, and human 
rights risk mapping for the full value chain

Our approach

In line with the UN Guiding Principles for Business 
and Human Rights, Telia is committed to respecting 
human rights throughout its value chain by 
applying human rights due diligence. Our products 
and services also enable the realization of certain 
human rights such as facilitating access to health 
care, education, and jobs. Research results from 
the GSMA’s Mobile Economy 2021 report shows 
that connectivity and digitalization can accelerate 
progress in relation to all 17 UN Sustainable 
Development Goals.

Policy: Our work is governed by the Group 
policy – Human rights

The most important human rights areas  
to address 
Human rights are universal, indivisible, and 
interdependent. Therefore, the different human 
rights risks are difficult to rank and compare 
between each other. Still, it is important to identify 
the specific human rights that are most salient 
in our markets and value chain. In 2022, due to 
changes in socio economic factors in our markets 
and globally, we updated our salience analysis 
together with non-profit organization BSR – the 
outcome is presented on the next page.

determine salience, see Sustainability note S7.

and security chapter). We also do risk analyses 
of varying depth ahead of mergers, acquisitions, 
and divestments (more information is available in 
Sustainability note S17).

The Group Executive Management and the Board 
are regularly informed of the due diligence outcome 
through the Enterprise Risk Management process 
and related bi-annual risk reports (see Risk and 
uncertainties section).  

Grievance mechanism
Telia’s Speak-Up Line, which serves as a grievance 
and whistle-blowing mechanism, is open for both 
employees and external stakeholders to raise 
concerns without fear of retaliation or reprisal and 
to provide fair investigation. For more information 
about cases reported through the Speak-up line, 
see Sustainability note S16.

other areas with human rights implications such 
as corruption, AI and trade sanctions. Also, when 
furthering digital inclusion, we can contribute to 
the realization of a broad set of human rights. On 

Work during the year

Human rights due diligence
In 2021 we consolidated our human rights practices 
into a human rights due diligence strategy by 
strengthening our governance and clarifying division 
of roles. Today, the newly established Human 
Rights Core Team, consisting of internal experts 
in salient human rights topics, has a dedicated 
role in performing due diligence. During the year, 
we strengthened the due diligence capabilities of 
additional staff groups through face-to-face training 
with a particular focus on members of the local risk 
forums (the GRECs). We also piloted human rights 
screenings in the product development process, in 
addition to what is already in place for privacy and 
security risks. 

We conduct human rights impact assessments 
(HRIAs) on topics and areas identified in our 
continuous due diligence process. Assessments 
vary in scope and depth, depending on the topic 
and risk level. In 2022 we concluded a children’s 
rights impact assessment aligned with a model 
provided by UNICEF (see further in the Children’s 
rights chapter) and human rights assessments 
related to:
• Our deployment of 5G, using a report by Ericsson 

and human rights experts at Shift as starting point 
for further analysis from a telco perspective 

• The Russian invasion of Ukraine
• Our local supply chain in infrastructure 

deployment 
• Our deployment of AI (see further on page 89)

In addition, impact assessments are included in our 
day-to-day work on privacy and security-related 
risks (more information is available in the Privacy 

Support to restore mobile 
communication in Ukraine 

In the modern world, societies require connectivity 
to function properly. Severe connectivity 
disruptions have a negative impact on various 
human rights, for example by impairing access 
to health care, banking services or business 
transactions, all of which play a vital role in daily 
life. The Russian invasion of Ukraine destroyed 
critical network infrastructure in many parts of 
the country. To support the restoration of the 
Ukrainian network, Telia Lithuania donated network 
equipment that was replaced as a result of the 
rollout of 5G in Lithuania.

Year Goals 2022 progress

2022 • Carry out a Children’s Rights Impact Assessment • Completed, using a dedicated framework by 
UNICEF

Annual • Continuous blocking of child sexual abuse 
material in our networks

• Achieved for the year across all networks

• Continuous detection of child sexual abuse 
material in own IT systems

• Achieved for the year

• Provide child safeguarding services to our 
customers

• Available in four out of six markets

Our approach

Children and young people are active users of 
our services. We believe that Internet access 
enriches children’s lives and provides them with 
opportunities to socialize, play and learn. However, 
children are particularly vulnerable to online 
risks such as cyberbullying, online abuse and 
inappropriate content. 

Keeping children healthy and safe online requires 
collaboration within and beyond our industry. Close 
collaboration with children’s rights organizations 
enables us to better understand how we impact 
children – directly or indirectly. Our long-standing 
collaboration with World Childhood Foundation 
is one example, which has helped us develop our 
work against the spread of Child Sexual Abuse 
Materials (CSAM) online. 

We are a signatory to several industry initiatives 
such as the GSMA Mobile Alliance against 
Child Sexual Abuse Content, the ICT Coalition 
for Children Online and the Alliance to better 
protect minors online, where knowledge and best 
practices are exchanged. We have also adopted 
the UN’s Children’s Rights and Business Principles 
as guidance to integrate children’s rights and 
perspectives into our operations and offerings. Our 
focus is to protect children but also empower and 
listen to them as we shape our work.

Our work is governed by the Group policy – 
Human rights. Requirements related to child 
labor in the supply chain are governed by the 
Supplier Code of Conduct.

Children’s rights

Telia was recognized as a 
leader by a Global Child Forum 
benchmark as a result of its 
efforts and commitment to 
children’s rights, earning 
the 6th position among 104 
telecommunications companies.

Work during the year

Integrating and promoting children’s rights  
in business
In 2022 we carried out a holistic children’s 
rights impact assessment of our business, to 
support future work in identifying, preventing, 
and mitigating risks to child rights, and capture 
opportunities to support children. Based on a 
self-assessment framework developed by UNICEF 
(Mo-CRIA), we did an extensive document review 
and desktop research, and conducted interviews 
with more than 20 Telia employees and two 
children’s rights organizations. The assessment 
reflected a high level of child rights integration into 
our business and operations. A summary of findings 
and subsequent action plan to improve our future 
work is available on our website.

In addition to the broader assessment mentioned 
above, we apply a tool to assess actual and 
potential impacts on children’s rights during our 
product development process. The tool was 
developed in partnership with BSR, based on the 
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights and the UN’s Children’s Rights and Business 
Principles. In 2022, we used the tool to assess 
various smart watches for children. 

As part of our family offering, in four out of six 
markets, we provide software that enables parents 
and guardians to set limits on children’s screen 
time and block harmful content. Our TV service 
is equipped with a PIN code functionality that 
enables parents to restrict access to, for example, 
programs featuring adult content material or movie 
rental services. In the majority of our markets we 

provide materials or tools for parents to support 
children in their everyday life online (see further in 
the Digital inclusion chapter). 

To educate and activate our employees we offer 
trainings, both specifically on children’s rights 
(created in collaboration with World Childhood 
Foundation) and on human rights more broadly.

Fighting child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
Watching CSAM is a severe violation of children’s 
rights and illegal in our markets. Research 
concludes that watching such materials increases 
the likelihood of abuse offline. We therefore 
actively participate in the fight against CSAM 
online through blocking measures and cooperation 
with industry peers, law enforcement agencies 
and NGOs such as ECPAT and World Childhood 
Foundation. We block websites identified by law 
enforcement as illegal for hosting CSAM. While we 
stand for and promote an open Internet, this is the 
only area where we have taken an active stand for 
voluntary blocking. 

Within Telia’s own IT systems, we apply a technical
solution that provides alerts if CSAM is detected
in hardware used by employees, trainees, or 
contractual workers. If such material is detected, a 
police report is filed and HR related remedies are 
initiated in accordance with national legislation.
During the year, two detections and subsequent 
police reports were filed, resulting in criminal 
investigation.

Please note that our work to build young people’s 
digital skills is covered under Making digital lives 
safer in the Digital inclusion chapter.

Supporting children in need

Several studies across the countries where we 
operate, reveal an increase in the number of 
children that struggle with mental health issues 
and live in vulnerable situations, most probably 
exacerbated by the pandemic, the ongoing war 
and the global economic downturn. Below are 
some examples of how Telia is supporting children 
in need:
• Telia Estonia is collaborating with Triumf 

Hero, a gamified app that aims to ease the 
mental burden of children and youth by 
providing psychological support including 
psychoeducation and coping techniques. 
Through Telia’s support the app is now also 
available in Ukrainian.

• For the third consecutive year Telia supported 
Bris, a Swedish children’s rights organization 
that provides a helpline for children and young 
people. Our support has enabled more children 
to contact and get help from the child helpline 
thanks to extended opening hours. Telia’s 
provision of services amounts to SEK 3 million to 
date (1 million annually since 2020).

Shaping our work by  
listening to children 

For many years Telia has conducted Children’s 
Advisory Panels (CAPs) to give children a voice 
about their experiences in the online world. Topics 
covered include children’s experiences with privacy, 
online gaming, healthy online life, digital learning, 
and misinformation online. We use the findings 
to inform business decisions and how we shape 
family offerings and support materials. For more 
information on our CAP results, visit our website.

Year Goals 2022 progress

Annual • Continuous implementation of Telia’s policy and 
the Global Network Initiative’s (GNI’s) principles 
and implementation guidelines

• GNI’s independent review and assessment 
completed for the year with successful outcome 

• Continuous transparency related to government 
requests 

• Law Enforcement Disclosure Report published

Our approach

As a telco and TV and Media provider, Telia’s 
networks and services provide access to 
information and contribute to the exchange of 
ideas in a way that supports freedom of expression, 
openness, transparency, and democracy. At the 
same time, policymakers increasingly introduce 
new surveillance measures to fight crime, terrorism, 
hate speech and more. These measures can 
potentially limit the freedom of expression and 
privacy of users and the trust in the services we 
provide.

Telia is committed to respecting the freedom of 
expression and right to privacy of users while 
meeting legal requirements in the countries where 
we operate. We have clear policy commitments in 
place and have shaped implementation processes 
based on input from the Global Network Initiative 

(GNI), a multi-stakeholder organization that brings 
together ICT companies, human rights and freedom 
of press groups, academics, and investors to 
protect and advance global free expression and 
privacy in the broadening ICT industry sector.

States define the scope of surveillance and 
limitations to the free flow of information based on 
legislation and requests from authorities. We abide 
by legislation but challenge requests that have no 
or unclear legal grounds. When there is a conflict 
between internationally recognized human rights 
and local legislation, we seek ways to raise the 
issue with relevant authorities or inform consumers 
and other stakeholders about the issue through 
public communications. 

Our work is governed by the Group policy – 
Freedom of expression and surveillance 
privacy

 

Our processes 
In our work we differentiate between two types of 
requests from governments/authorities:

• Conventional requests are day-to-day requests 
that are typically of lower risk, such as daily secret 
real-time wiretapping and monitoring by the 
police based on court orders. Such requests are 
received and handled by dedicated local teams.

• Unconventional requests are requests that 
may have serious impacts on users’ freedom 
of expression and privacy. Examples include 
demands to shut down Internet access, blocking 
of websites or requirements to retain data for 
surveillance when legislation is unclear.

Our Group policy and related instruction sets 
out practical steps regarding assessments and 
escalation to be performed for unconventional 
requests. Such requests are to be assessed by 
the local company and escalated to group level 
for final joint decisions on how to mitigate human 
rights risks. While our process aims to identify and 
mitigate potential violations of individuals’ rights, 
the actual outcome significantly depends on local 
legislation.

Work during the year

Unconventional requests during the year 
During 2022, we closed some 15 unconventional 
requests and demands across our markets. To 

ensure consistency, group-level experts facilitated 
local assessments and escalations. Requests 
included mainly blocking of specific content on 
the Internet and removal of TV-stations from Telia 
TV services, but also new legislation on take-down 
of terrorist content online, use of anonymized and 
aggregated data to fight corona, and blocking 
of mobile calls around prisons. In almost all the 
cases, Telia took measures to promote freedom 
of expression and surveillance privacy or mitigate 
risks in some way, for example by transparency, 
asking authorities to clarify their requests and/
or by being transparent to the public about the 
request, and always to apply the rule of law. Such 
actions were defined jointly by local companies 
and representatives of Telia’s Group Executive 
Management. For information on requests to block 
Russian originated content, ongoing at the end of 
the year, please visit our website.

Promoting transparency 
When we provide transparency regarding 
governments’ surveillance and actions to limit 
freedom of expression, we contribute to the 
protection of users’ rights. Making such information 
more easily accessible has the potential to inform 
groups whose rights are at risk, including civil 
society groups working to protect these rights. 
We therefore publish Law Enforcement Disclosure 
Reports (LEDR) that include detailed statistics on 
conventional requests, as well as the approximate 
number of unconventional requests. The reports

also refer to some of the most relevant legislation. 
A main element in our reporting on countries’ local 
laws is carried out through contributions to the 
GNI database on Country Legal Frameworks 
Resource. Further information about the 2022 
LEDR report and the latest statistics are available in  
Sustainability note S8. 

Participation in the Global Network Initiative 
To understand our impacts and successfully 
mitigate risks, we depend on input from 
stakeholders and experts within this field. 
Therefore, Telia is an active member of the Global 
Network Initiative (GNI), which aims to share 
learnings and leverage when governments act 
in ways that risk violating freedom of expression 
and privacy. Telia is a member of the board and 
participates in various committees and task forces. 
More information about the work in 2022 is 
available on the GNI website.

GNI independent assessment of our work 
As part of our membership, we have committed 
to implementing the GNI principles by putting 
concrete measures in place to promote and 
advance freedom of expression and the right to 
privacy. All GNI companies undergo independent 
assessments of their implementation every two 
to three years. Results of these assessments are 
shared with the GNI’s multi-stakeholder board, 
which makes a final determination of the member 
companies’ progress in implementing the GNI 
principles over time. 

Telia’s second assessment was conducted in 
2021/2022. Based on the recommendations in 
these assessments, Telia has taken the following 
actions, amongst others: 

• Included freedom of expression and surveillance 
privacy in the company Enterprise Risk 
Management setup

• Set up a training on human rights for all 
employees and provided targeted training 
sessions for the most relevant teams

• Initiated work to review how Telia’s due diligence 
efforts can cover third parties other than suppliers

Based on the assessor’s report in May 2022, the 
GNI Board determined that Telia is making good-
faith efforts to implement the GNI Principles with 
improvement over time. More information about the 
assessment can be found on GNI’s website. The 
GNI will issue a public report in 2023.

Diversity, inclusion  
and well-being 

Sustainability-related aspects of our people and 
culture strategy relate to securing the human and 
labor rights of our greatest asset – our people. 
As we are operating in a context characterized by 
strict labor laws and a high degree of unionization, 
many aspects are secured through legal compliance 
measures embedded in Telia’s processes and 
through collective bargaining agreements. Read 
more in the People section. 
 
In our materiality analysis, two human rights areas 
have been identified as important to develop: 
 
• Diversity and inclusion - to secure the right to equal 

opportunity and non-discrimination
• Health and well-being – to secure the right to health

01. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Our approach

Telia is committed to building a diverse and inclusive 
culture. We strive to provide equal opportunities and 
to ensure that our employees reflect the diversity 
of the customers and societies we serve. Beyond 
diversity, we strive for inclusivity, where no employee 
shall be discriminated against or treated differently 
because of their gender, gender identity or expression, 
ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, 
social background and/or other characteristics 
protected by applicable law. 

Our approach is built on three main elements:

• Employee and leadership engagement: 
Increasing awareness and engagement through 
trainings and events for managers and employees, 
as well as engagement with internal diversity 
ambassadors.

• Improved awareness and processes: Eliminating 
bias and discrimination by integrating diverse, 
inclusive, and equal opportunity perspectives into 
company culture, including processes such as 
recruitment and succession planning.

• Initiatives and partnerships: Actively engaging 
and contributing to diversity and inclusion 
communities across our markets

The Group Diversity and Inclusion Lead coordinates a 
network that is responsible for local implementation 
and progress is reported back to the GEM to ensure 
continuous realignment and well-monitored progress.

Our work is governed by the Group Policy – 
People

96Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other

https://www.teliacompany.com/en/about-the-company/public-policy


We engaged in several specific activities to 
address inclusion in the tech sector. Examples 
from the year include:

• Participation in Women in Tech themed events 
in most countries where we operate, to engage 
women of all ages and backgrounds to join 
the tech industry. Efforts and initiatives include 
external sponsorships, as well as internal 
development or mentorship programs for female 
leaders and employees, reaching over 700 
women.

• Telia Sweden, Finland and Norway enabled 41 
unemployed immigrants with higher education to 
enter the tech job market by offering internships 
at Telia and mentorships by Telia employees. 

• TV och Media conducted several workshops 
on the subjects of norms, inclusion, minority 
stress and encounters with racist expressions. 
Approximately 16% of employees were reached 
with these efforts. 

Please note that our digital inclusion work targeting 
customers and other external stakeholders is 
covered under the Digital inclusion chapter. 

Efforts to reduce the gender pay gap 
As part of refining our equal pay framework, that 
aims to have zero pay inequality, a pay gap and 
gender parity analysis is carried out once a year 
in all markets. The 2022 results showed an overall 
raw gender gap decrease of one percentage point 
in comparison to 2021. Much of the remaining 
differences can be attributed to gender segregation 
of professions (for example more men in 
technology and more women in support functions) 
and an imbalance in vertical career development 
between male and female employees. To further 
reduce the pay gap, we have strengthened our 
initiatives to recruit, promote and retain female 
managers and decrease gender segregation 
within Tech, IT, and commercial roles by actively 
recruiting and upskilling more women to such roles. 
Individual, unexplainable pay inequalities for equal 
roles are handled through a process with clear 
actions for corrections. 

Activities to raise awareness 
Through various internal and external initiatives, 
we discuss challenges and let a multitude of 
voices share their experiences and propose ways 
forward to reach our end goal to increase diversity 
at Telia and in the tech sector. During the year we 
reached more than 20,000 people (internal and 
external) through events we hosted, sponsored or 
collaborated in, on topics such as Gender equality, 
Women in tech, Race and ethnicity, Disability and 
accessibility, LGBTQI+ rights and the importance 
of allyship. As an example, we hosted the Diversity 
Talk “Close the gap” and the Global Virtual Pride 
with various Telco industry peers. 

Work during the year

The diversity of Telia
For many years Telia has measured various 
parameters to understand the barriers that need 
to be addressed to provide equal opportunity 
for all employees. We regularly track gender and 
age data to better understand the diversity of 
our employees (see next page). In addition, we 
conducted a second voluntary equality data sample 
survey (the first was in 2021), to see how inclusion 
is perceived in our workforce. We plan to further 
capture the voice of our employees through a 
large-scale voluntary equality data survey for the 
whole company, in 2023.  

Continuous improvements of HR processes
In 2022, we continued to refine key Human 
Resources processes, including recruitment, 
performance evaluations, on- and off-boarding, and 
compensation, to better support diversity, gender 
equality and equal opportunity. As an example, 
managers are provided with data dashboards 
ahead of the team performance evaluations at 
all levels of the company, to show the eventual 
imbalances in their teams including differences in 
performance scores by gender and age. During 
this process, trained facilitators ask questions to 
identify possible unconscious bias. In addition, 
all new managers undergo mandatory leadership 
training that includes diversity and inclusion 
modules. Inclusive leadership is an explicit pillar of 
Telia’s Leadership Framework which forms the basis 
of Telia’s leadership culture. More information is 
available in the People section.

Training

• By the end of 2022, 66% of managers had been 
trained in unconscious bias and 63% had been 
trained in inclusive recruitment practices. 

• All Telia recruitment specialists are trained in 
inclusive recruitment practices to secure a diverse 
pipeline of talent for our company. 

External recognition in 2022  

• Telia Estonia obtained the “Diverse Workplace” 
label by the Human Rights Center of Estonia.

• The Diversity Charter Lithuania recognized Telia 
Lithuania as one of the top two companies that 
maintain diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 

Discrimination and harassment 

We work to counter discrimination and have 
processes in place to handle breaches. During 
the year, around 12 discrimination and/or 
harassment-related reports were filed. Subsequent 
investigations resulted in 2 minor disciplinary 
actions and no terminations.

02. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

Our approach

Health and well-being form the basis for a 
great employee experience. We strive to ensure 
employees’ right to health and that employees can 
perform at their best in their everyday work. A healthy 
workplace, good work-life balance and flexible ways 
of working are key aspects to achieve this.

Our work is governed by the Group policy – 
People. Health and safety requirements for 
suppliers are outlined in the Supplier Code of 
Conduct.

Our most significant health risks
Our employees generally work in offices and retail 
environments where health risks relate mainly to 
mental well-being and ergonomics. Our biggest 
challenges relate to ensuring employees have a 
good work-life balance and sufficient recovery 
between intense work periods.

Significant health and safety risks close to our 
core operations include working at heights or 
performing electrical work related to network 
maintenance and construction, which is generally 
carried out by contractors. To mitigate these risks, 
suppliers are required to comply with the Supplier 
Code of Conduct, which includes health and 
safety requirements, and to report any relevant 
incidents to Telia’s whistle-blowing tool. We also 
carry out onsite audits to check health and safety 
compliance. More information is available in the 
Responsible sourcing chapter.

and well-being are increased stress and workload, 
as well as respiratory infections as a post-pandemic 
effect. We continuously monitor these aspects 
through the sickness absence rate (SAR). Additional 
SAR information and statistics are available in 
Sustainability note S10.

ISO 45001 certification
Telia views the ISO 45001 health and well-being 
management system standard as a valuable tool to 
ensure systematic assessments and follow-up on 
risks. During the year, local companies in Finland, 
Norway, Estonia, and Lithuania maintained their 
ISO 45001 certifications. At year end, 42% of 
all employees were covered by the ISO 45001 
certification. Local companies in Sweden and 
Denmark are not ISO 45001 certified but have 
implemented management systems based on 
the same principles. Additional information about 
management systems is available in Sustainability 
note S18.

Incidents
During the year, no major injuries or fatalities were 
registered for our staff or contractors. Contractors 
reported 38 cases regarding minor injuries.

For more data about health and well-being, see  
Sustainability note S10. 

Telia’s health and well-being model
Our internal health and well-being model is based 
on the following key elements: 

• A continuous improvement approach to 
occupational health and safety through the use of 
the ISO 45001 management system standard

• Preventive actions such as risk assessments and 
employee surveys

• Health and well-being included in regular 
performance check-ins between managers and 
employees

• Health and well-being training for all managers

Work during the year

Better connected working
In 2022 we continued our “better connected 
working” model, based on learnings from the 
pandemic. This model takes a flexible approach 
and enables employees to both thrive in our offices 
and use opportunities to work from home. Results 
from the annual employee engagement survey 
showed that 54% of employees primarily worked 
from the office, 39% primarily from home and 7% 
from other locations.  

Measuring health and well-being
Overall health and well-being are measured as 
part of the employee engagement survey. Results 
indicate an increase of 5 percentage points in 
experienced overall personal work-life balance, in 
comparison to 2021. 78% of respondents were able 
to successfully achieve a good personal work-life 
balance and 73% identified as having good overall 
well-being. Our main challenges regarding health

Year Goals 2022 progress

2022 • All new and renewed supplier contracts screened 
according to the due diligence process 

• More than 90% of total spend were covered

Annual • All supplier non-conformities identified during 
the year closed within due date

• 125 non-conformities identified in the year, 58% 
closed within due date (42% remain open but 
are not critical)

Please refer to Sustainability note S19 for information about the scope of Telia’s goals within this area.

Our approach

We rely on a global supply chain to deliver 
products and services to our customers. In our 
sourcing processes we consider various aspects, 
such as price, quality, the supplier’s sustainability 
standards and ability to innovate, to assess the full 
value of their deliveries before we decide which 
supplier to select.

A dedicated due diligence process is in place to 
evaluate suppliers’ sustainability performance. The 
responsible sourcing function is responsible for the 
supplier sustainability risk assessment, including 
due diligence and audits. Local or group level 
subject matter experts also lend support in auditing 
and dialogue meetings.

Our supplier requirements are set out in the 
Supplier Code of Conduct

Responsible sourcing
Due diligence coverage 
• Anti-bribery and corruption
• Conflict minerals
• Environment
• Human rights
• Labor rights
• Management and ownership structure
• Occupational health and safety
• Privacy
• Security
• Trade sanctions

Key elements in our work 
 
Supplier requirements
Our suppliers shall align and comply with the 
requirements stated in our Supplier Code of 
Conduct. In addition, suppliers handling personal 
or sensitive data must comply with the security 
and privacy requirements stated in Telia’s Supplier 
Security Directive. Suppliers are expected to apply 
these requirements throughout their own supply 
chains. 

Supplier due diligence
The objective of the due diligence process is to 
ensure that Telia only engages with suppliers who 
meet our standards and require the same from 
their own suppliers. The process has a risk-based 
approach that allows us to focus on those suppliers 
that could potentially expose individuals, the 
environment, and Telia to elevated risks. The due 
diligence process consists of the following steps:

with identified non-conformities and mutually 
agreed Corrective Action Plans (CAP). 

In addition to our own audit engagements, and 
to be able to expand our reach of supplier audit 
impact and leverage, Telia collaborates with other 
telecom operators through the Joint Alliance for 
CSR (JAC), to assess sustainability practices in 
lower tiers in the supply chain. Members of the JAC 
share resources and best practices to coordinate 
supplier audits using common requirements in five 
areas: Labor, Health and Safety, Environment, Ethics 
and Management Systems.

Supplier development and engagement
As part of supplier management, we maintain a 
continuous dialogue with suppliers to increase 
their awareness and understanding of our 
expectations. Audit non-conformities, as well as 
risks and challenges that require a joint approach, 

1. An up-front risk assessment is carried out to 
identify high-risk triggers such as high-risk 
countries from an anti-bribery and corruption 
perspective, and access to Telia’s network or 
privacy data.  

2. If risks are deemed high in the up-front risk 
assessment, the supplier undergoes an in-depth 
due diligence assessment consisting of a 
self-assessment against the Supplier Code of 
Conduct and other relevant requirements as 
well as screening covering, for example, ultimate 
beneficial ownership (UBO) and sanctions. The 
in-depth due diligence assessment results in risks 
being graded as high, medium or low. Potential 
high risks and serious violations identified in the 
in-depth due diligence assessment could lead 
to disqualification of the supplier or trigger a 
supplier audit.  

3. High-risk suppliers identified during the in-depth 
due diligence assessment and suppliers with 
critical non-conformities identified through audits 
are reported to the Group sourcing management 
team for decision-making regarding supplier 
selection and monitoring. 

Supplier audits
Supplier audits are key to assess if suppliers 
comply with our requirements. Decisions about 
which suppliers to audit are made together with 
Group sourcing management and other business 
stakeholders, based on a dynamic approach in 
order to react to incidents and high-risk issues. 
Audits are concluded in the form of audit reports 

100Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other

https://www.teliacompany.com/en/contact-us/for-suppliers/documents


are raised at supplier executive meetings where 
top management from both sides engage to 
address topical issues and agree on action plans. 
If the companies do not reach an agreement and a 
supplier fails to meet an agreed CAP, termination of 
the supplier is considered. Information on selected 
engagement areas is presented on the next page. 

Work during the year

Review of process
During the year we have reviewed our way of 
working with the aim to recalibrate and ensure a risk-
based approach. In this work we have put emphasis 
on human rights risks in our value chain which 
will help in the prioritization of appropriate risk 
mitigating activities such as audits going forward.  

Due diligence and audit data
• More than 1600 suppliers went through the 

up-front risk assessment, covering more than 
90% of the total supplier spend. This resulted in 
578 (36%) in-depth due diligence assessments. 

• 1% of suppliers that underwent the in-depth 
due diligence assessment were associated with 
high risks and therefore subject to additional 
procedures (as described on the previous page).

• 27 supplier audits were conducted by Telia, out of 
these 12 were Supplier Code of Conduct audits, 
9 Security audits and 6 Quality audits. Through 
the audits, 125 non-conformities were identified 
during the year, 42% remain open, and none of 
these are critical.

• An additional 98 audits were conducted by JAC 
impacting approximately 133,000 workers in total. 
8 audits were initiated by Telia, of which 4 were 
closed and 4 were ongoing at the end of the year.

Audit results from the past couple of years show 
that first tier suppliers generally score relatively high 
in the areas of labor rights, human rights, security 
aspects related to asset management and personal 
data processing. The largest gaps identified for 
the suppliers were risk management and enforcing 
Telia’s Supplier Code of Conduct requirements 
in their own supply chains. Results from audits 
conducted by JAC in lower tiers highlighted health 
and safety as the main challenges.

Work to counter supply disruptions 

Global supply chains make companies vulnerable 
to supply chain disruptions. Since 2020 this has 
become more evident than before as our industry 
has been, and still is, experiencing shortages of 
semiconductors. This jeopardizes our 5G roll-out 
and the supply of various devices needed by our 
customers. At the end of 2022 we could conclude 
that we mitigated these risks very well, thanks 
to proactive and intensive interactions with our 
suppliers. This experience, however, demonstrates 
the need to promote resilience in the supply chain. 
Disruptions will most likely continue to be caused 
by various factors in the coming years, ranging 
from climate change effects to pandemics or 
geopolitics, among others.  

Currently we are increasing our supply chain 
resilience through sustainability requirements for 
our suppliers, work to diversify our supplier base, 
and assessments of suppliers’ business continuity 
capabilities already in our supplier selection 
phase.  We run regular cross-company supply risk 
management processes and put focus on improving 
internal planning processes. In the years ahead 
we will continue developing this work further to 
increase resilience and avoid disruptions of supply.

Driving circularity within mobile 
phone manufacturing
Efforts to influence the environmental performance 
of mobile phones continued via the Eco Rating 
initiative launched in 2021. The rating guides 
consumers in their purchasing decisions but 
also works as a useful tool for engagement with 
manufacturers to drive circular principles in the 
production of mobile phones. More information 
about Eco Rating is available in the Climate and 
circularity chapter.

Engagement for climate action
Climate is an integrated part of our supplier 
evaluations and a key selection criterion when 
awarding new business. By the end of the year, 
35% of supply chain emissions were covered by 
science-based targets, with an additional 16% in 
the pipeline awaiting external approval of targets. 
We engaged with suppliers in various ways, 
ranging from top management interactions at 
strategic meetings to a call to action during the 
global climate summit (COP27). We also provide 
support through the Supplier Engagement Guide 
to facilitate action (more information is available in 
the Climate and circularity chapter).

Violations of labor rights in field 
service work
Due to a number of labor rights incidents related 
to field service suppliers in our core markets, Telia 
initiated a project in 2022 to influence this sector. 
We sent out a survey to all key suppliers in this 
category to assess the maturity level related to 
labor and broader human rights. Major findings 
include lack of processes for human rights due 
diligence and supply chain audits. The plan for 
2023 is to secure corrective actions and proactive 
collaboration across the supply chain, in addition 
to increased awareness of the Speak-up line for 
stakeholders, as outlined in the Supplier Code of 
Conduct. For more information about the Speak-up 
line, see Sustainability note S16.

Forced labor in China
Telia has engaged with 28 suppliers that have been 
mentioned in public reports over the past couple of 
years. The reports link ICT companies to violations 
of the rights of the Uighur minority in China. We 
take these reports seriously and, at the end of the 
year, we had received satisfactory responses from 
23 suppliers and further engaged with the other 5 
suppliers through a dialogue via JAC.

2022 supplier engagement focus

During 2022, as a result of input from due diligence and audit reports, media reports, and stakeholders’ or 
suppliers’ own observations, Telia has engaged on a deeper level with suppliers in key areas.

Year Goals 2022 progress

Annual • Annual Anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) risk 
assessments performed in all markets 

• Achieved for the year

• Maturity assessments of the ABC program 
performed in all markets along with plans to close 
maturity gaps

• Achieved for the year

Our approach

We conduct business with zero tolerance for 
corruption. Corruption risk is treated as one of Telia’s 12 
principal risk areas and an Anti-bribery and corruption 
(ABC) program is in place to mitigate this risk. The 
program provides a systematic way to effectively 
detect and prevent corruption and violations of anti-
corruption laws. It is implemented and continuously 
developed using a risk-based approach through:
• Regular ABC risk assessments to identify and 

manage key risks 
• Annual maturity assessments to follow up on 

progress and identify areas for improvement
• Training to ensure awareness of ABC risks
• Supply chain risk management by screening, 

monitoring and auditing suppliers
• Annual mandatory Conflicts of Interest disclosure 

for the extended leadership team and for key 
employees during the onboarding process

Our exposure to corruption risks significantly 
decreased in the past few years due to the 
divestments of our global operations through Telia 

Carrier and all subsidiaries in Eurasia. Today, most 
of our markets are in the lower risk spectrum, 
according to the Transparency International 
Corruption Perceptions Index (see illustration). 
Our supply chain, however, is global with suppliers 
operating within a wide risk spectrum which we 
manage through requirements in our Supplier Code 
of Conduct, our due diligence process and auditing 
of high-risk suppliers. More information is available 
in the Responsible sourcing chapter.

The ABC program is managed by the Group 
Governance, Risk and Compliance unit, which 
is responsible for the program design and 
coordination of activities. Local Ethics and 
Compliance Officers are responsible for local 
implementation.

The Special Investigations Office (SIO), which 
is part of the Security Office, handles special 
investigations related to potential corruption, 
fraud, and other significant related risks such as 
retaliation. Read more about cases during the year 
in Sustainability note S16.

Our work is governed by the Group policy – 
Anti-brib ery and corruption

Work during the year

ABC program maturity
In 2019, Telia introduced a maturity assessment 
methodology to enable holistic and credible 
evaluation and follow-up of key risks. Since then, the 
methodology has been used to assess the maturity 
of the ABC program throughout the Group and in all 
markets. 2022 results indicate good maturity, with 
improvements noticed in internal control and third-
party management.

ABC risk assessments
ABC risk assessments were performed in all markets 
during the year. 2022 risk assessment results 
indicate a well-functioning program but due to 
the geopolitical situation the likelihood of overall 
ABC risk is low to medium with potential high 
financial and reputational impact. Furthermore, 
there is high awareness of and attention to ABC on 
both the country and Group level. Some areas of 
improvement have been identified as part of the 
risk assessments and plans are being developed to 
address those areas during 2023.

During 2022, a high-level internal audit was 
conducted on sponsorships and donations. The 
scope of the audit was the Nordic countries and 
all Group-level functions. No severe findings were 
revealed.

Training
During onboarding, all employees are required to 
complete an e-learning on the Code of Conduct, 
which includes a specific section on anti-corruption. 
In addition, targeted face-to-face training is 
performed yearly on selected groups. In 2022, 
above 90% of the extended leadership team and 
Telia employees who are board members of Telia 
minority-owned companies received ABC-specific 
awareness training.

S1 General 
information

The Sustainability section and the Sustainability 
notes within the Board of Directors’ Report, 
constitute Telia Company’s statutory sustainability 
report according to the requirements in the 
Swedish Annual Accounts Act. It also serves as 
the Global Compact Communication on Progress 
(CoP) for Telia Company and all its subsidiaries. In 
addition, sustainability content is integrated into 
other sections of this report, e.g., in the description 
of Telia’s business strategy, analysis of underlying 
trends, and in the Corporate Governance section. 

The report has been prepared according to Telia’s 
Sustainability Reporting Framework, which, to 
facilitate comparability, is based on frameworks 
such as the Global Reporting Initiative, the 
Integrated Reporting Framework, the Global 
Compact Communication on Progress, the EU 
Non-Financial Reporting Directive, the UN Guiding 
Principles Reporting Framework and the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. 
Telia’s Sustainability Reporting Framework contains 
reporting principles, content guidance, detailed 
information on the basis for the preparation of 
information, and definitions. It is available at www.
teliacompany.com/sustainability/reporting. To 
facilitate reading and comparability, please refer to 
the Sustainability Index on pages 126 and 127. 

Please note:
• This sustainability report shall not be considered 

prepared strictly in accordance with any of the 
above listed regional or international frameworks.  

• The scope of information provided covers 
our operations in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, 
Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden. In addition, our 
associated company LMT in Latvia is included 
in our environmental reporting to align with the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol accounting standard.  

• Material omissions or limited scope of information 
are explained in the respective note. 

Deloitte has been engaged to provide limited 
assurance of this sustainability report, see Auditors’ 
Limited Assurance Report in the Sustainability 
section for more information. All disclosures that 
constitute the sustainability report are covered by 
the limited assurance engagement.  

Comments and feedback help us develop our work 
and reporting; you are welcome to contact us at 
sustainability-group@teliacompany.com.  

S2 Sustainability 
governance

For more information see Sustainability 
Governance in the Sustainability section. Additional 
information, including the governance of the 
company’s overall risk management process, is 
available in the Corporate governance and Risk 
and uncertainties section.  

The Code of Conduct and other governing 
documents can be found at Telia’s website. Telia 
adheres to the international frameworks listed 
in the Statement of Materiality and Significant 
Audiences.

S3 Materiality determination  
and stakeholder engagement 

At regular intervals, we do materiality deep dives, 
for example during business strategy reviews 
(such as the previous one in 2020) or if there are 
other major business or societal changes around 
us. In between such deep dives, we act on our 
“materiality maintenance plan”, which includes 
continuous monitoring of various research, 
industry, and media reports, as well as surveys 
or conversations with particular stakeholder 
groups on specific topics to make sure we focus 
our work in the most material areas. We take a 
double materiality approach, assessing both 
how the company is impacting people and the 
environment, and how people and the environment 
are impacting the company. We strive to measure 
impacts but acknowledge that impact assessment 
models (e.g., social and financial) are still evolving.   

Stakeholders are generally selected for 
engagement either because they represent the 
opinions of a stakeholder group (e.g., unions) or 
because we consider them knowledgeable due to 
their expertise (e.g., human rights organizations) 
and/or experience (e.g., children).  

Information on the final outcome is presented in 
sections about How we prioritize and Trends 
affecting our work in 2022, with additional 
detailed information in each impact area chapter 
and an overview of 2022 materiality findings on 
pages 106 and 107.

Climate and 
circularity

Our operations and offerings impact the environment both negatively 
(generation of emissions, waste etc.), and positively (low carbon, circular and 
energy efficient products and services that enable customers to transition 
into a low carbon economy). 

We are affected by current and expected future climate impacts on our 
business, such as extreme weather events, as well as changes in legal 
requirements, customer demands, employee expectations and access to 
capital.

• Upcoming EU regulations on eco-design, environmental claims, energy efficiency, and circularity of certain products. 

• A general increase in expectations from consumers and business customers, including demand for data to 
prove performance and benefits. 

• Increasing demands for products and services that enable customers to reduce emissions and energy use. 

• Increasing expectations from investors on net-zero targets and information about how companies plan to 
transition into a low-carbon economy.

• The disconnect between the pace needed for climate action and actual emission reductions (globally and in 
Telia’s markets) increases the likelihood of extreme weather events.

• Increased tensions between social, economic, and climate-related issues slow down pace of action globally 
and in some of Telia’s markets.

Privacy and 
security

We embed data protection into our products and services and secure 
business continuity by protecting our systems through security processes. 

Significant data breaches and cyberattacks could impact business continuity, 
costs and trust/reputation.

• Increased risk of cyberattacks due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

• Increased requirements on security from B2B customers and through upcoming EU regulation as well as the 
expected admission of Finland and Sweden to NATO.

• Upcoming EU AI Act shapes expectations on corporate work related to AI ethics.

Digital 
inclusion

We provide access to connectivity for millions of customers and support 
groups that risk being left behind.

The digital divide limits our customer base and creates negative perception 
of digitalization.

• Continued digitalization of society, including vital services, makes high-quality connectivity and relevant digital 
skills increasingly important. 

• High inflation and the economic downturn raised affordability concerns which may impact access to services for 
economically vulnerable groups. 

Consumers 
Investors
Policymakers

Human rights Our services and ways of working are impacting the rights and well-being of 
approx. 20,000 employees, millions of customers, and thousands of workers 
in our supply chain. Our services also enable the realization of human rights. 

Violations of human rights in our value chain impact the trust in Telia and our 
ability to retain and attract employees, customers, and capital. 

• Increased attention to human rights through upcoming legislation (EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence 
Directive and local versions).

• Additional proof points of how digitalization can increase access to societal services, such as health care, and 
provide safer workplaces when dangerous tasks are automized. In parallel, digitalization is restructuring the labor 
market with increasing need for up- and re-skilling of individuals. 

• Climate change increasingly impacts human rights negatively.

Children’s 
rights

Our services and ways of working impact the rights and well-being of 
children as users of our services, children of our employees and children in 
our supply chain.

Negative impacts on children’s rights and welfare affects the trust in Telia and 
our ability to retain and attract customers, employees and access to capital. 

• Continuous reports on the vulnerability of children in the online world, including spread of child sexual abuse 
material, cyberbullying, misinformation and hate speech.

Some additional topics that affect our industry, such 
as labor rights, conflict minerals and AI ethics, are 
embedded in our overarching sustainability impact 
areas listed above. Certain topics that are on the rise 
but not seen as highly material, such as biodiversity 
and water, are addressed in other sustainability notes 
of this report.

Main sources for determining materiality and our 
reporting scope in 2022 included: 
• Our own 2020 materiality deep dive based on 

desktop research validated through internal and 
external stakeholder dialogues.  

• A 2022 materiality validation exercise conducted 
by Telia’s internal subject matter experts who 
monitor developments, including through 
external reports and input from stakeholders, 
to continuously determine sustainability risks, 
opportunities and (where possible) impacts. 

• An AI-based global materiality check to identify key 
conversations in our sector and related to Telia. 

• Learnings from industry association GSMA’s 
project on metrics for the mobile industry in 
partnership with Yale University, based on 
stakeholder engagement.

• 2022 expert analysis on ongoing climate-related 
trends among key stakeholders, and the business 
impact those trends could pose to Telia in the 
short-, mid-, and long term. And a deep dive into 
material transition risks and opportunities to Telia 
in a 2025-2027 perspective.

• Updated human rights risk mapping and salience 
analysis with BSR.

• SB Insight’s 2022 consumer trend studies which 
identify how consumers in our markets think a 
telco should prioritize. 

• Topics covered by ESG ratings, including how 
topics are weighted. 

• Engagement with collaborative partners (some 
of them listed on page 77) to get deeper 
understanding of theme-specific impacts and 
topic boundaries. 

• Concerns raised by stakeholders in the media and 
Telia’s Speak Up Line. 

• Continuous monitoring of policy development.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
Telia has been climate neutral in its own operations 
since 2020. This is achieved through absolute 
emission reductions (only using renewable 
electricity since 2020) and carbon offsetting of 
remaining emissions (scope 1, scope 2 market-
based and scope 3 business travel). More 
information about selected offsets/carbon credits is 
available on our website.

To be able to track absolute emissions from year 
to year, scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions are 
reported in the following tables, excluding carbon 
offsetting. Our emission reporting is aligned with 
the GHG protocol.

1) Revision of data, due to update of 2021 emission factors, 
compared to 2021 Annual and Sustainability Report

Other indirect GHG emissions – Scope 3 
During 2020, we carried out a full value chain 
assessment using 2018 data to further understand 
our total carbon footprint and to set science-based 
targets covering all scopes. The Corporate Value 
Chain (Scope 3) Standard was applied to calculate 
all 15 categories of scope 3 emissions. A full update 
of all categories is provided every second year. Most 
material categories (see below) are updated annually: 
• Purchased goods and services (category 1) – 

OPEX, e.g., purchased mobile devices
• Capital goods (category 2) – CAPEX, e.g., network 

equipment
• Business travel (Scope 6)
• Use of sold products and downstream leased 

assets (categories 11 and 13) – GHG emissions 
related to the use of sold or leased products, e.g., 
from phones and routers 

“Other material categories” includes the remaining 
seven categories considered material such as 
upstream transportation, fuel and energy-related 
activities, employee commuting, waste handling and 
end-of-life treatment of sold products, franchises, and 
investments. 

Scope 3 data is presented in the table above. 

Lower CO2e-emissions upstream (categories 1 
and 2) in 2021, compared to base year 2018, are 
mostly due to decreasing carbon intensity emission 
factors (Environmental Economic Input Output 
factors, EEIOs) due to the pandemic. Other factors 
impacting reductions are potential reductions in 
spend by Telia, supplier-specific reductions and 
changes in calculation methodology (minor in 
2021). We aim to reduce the application of generic 
calculations (EEIOs) and increase the share of 
supplier-specific data and product-specific LCA 
data. Overview of this development is shown in the 
table to the right.

Additional information about the methodology 
including underlying assumptions is available in the 
methodology paper available on Telia’s website. 
Regarding the results, please note:
• Reporting of enablement effects is still new and 

methods are under development as research on 
the impacts of digitalization continue advancing. 
Hence reported data are estimates based on 
available research and data. 

• Carbon enablement factor calculations are 
generally based on assumptions from market 
reports or other studies, not Telia customer-
specific data.

• Currently, no standards exist for enablement 
calculations. We therefore participate in the 
work of the European Green Digital Coalition, 
launched by the European Commission in 2021 
to advance enablement calculation and reporting 
methodologies for ICT technologies, aiming 
for standardization. Carbon Trust, which Telia 
engages for its reporting methodology, has 
been selected as an expert organization by the 
Commission for this task.  

• Due to the limited scope of our model and the 
conditions in our markets (e.g., national electricity 
grid emission factors), the results should not be 
considered directly comparable to the results 
based on other telcos’ similar models.

• Data presented in previous Annual and 
Sustainability Reports is not fully comparable 
to the 2022 numbers since data capture was 
improved and certain calculation methods 
changed during the year.

Water and biodiversity 
Water is not regarded as a key environmental 
aspect for our own operations. Some data center 
facilities have water-based cooling, but water is 
re-circulated in closed systems. Water consumed 
in the offices and in other locations is used for 
sanitary purposes and kitchen/canteen activities 

only. All Telia facilities, including data centers, are 
located in built areas with connection to municipal 
water infrastructure.

Biodiversity is not regarded as a key environmental 
aspect for our own operations since our land 
holdings are limited. All infrastructural interventions, 
such as towers and fiber rollout, are constructed 
according to local construction and environmental 
legislations.

Water and biodiversity aspects are important 
in parts of our supply chain, e.g., in certain 
manufacturing processes of electronics and 
mineral extraction. Suppliers are required to 
identify and manage all significant environmental 
aspects associated with their operations, apply 
the precautionary principle, and apply the same 
requirements on their sub-contractors. These 
requirements also apply for water and biodiversity, 
when relevant. Moreover, Telia’s circularity agenda 
is another way of limiting negative impacts on 
ecosystems in the supply chain. 

Carbon and energy enablement
The methodology for Telia’s carbon enablement 
calculations has been developed together with 
the consultancy firm Carbon Trust. The starting 
point for developing our model was the GSMA 
Enablement Effect Report. Today we focus on 
calculating the enablement effect of our remote 
meetings and IoT offerings. We are not capturing 
the broader sets of enablement effects, such as 
home working, online shopping, accommodation 
sharing, etc., for which our underlying connectivity 
services provide opportunities. Moreover, no 
eventual rebound effects are captured in our 
calculations.

Taxonomy reporting

The aim of the EU Taxonomy, as part of the European 
Green Deal, is to direct financial flows towards 
sustainable economic activities by providing a 
common classification system of what is considered 
sustainable. In 2021, companies were required to 
report only what is ‘eligible’ (covered) under the 
Taxonomy. This year, for the first time, we report 
whether the eligible activities are also ‘aligned’ 
(comply) with the Taxonomy’s technical screening 
criteria, and if they meet the requirements on ‘do no 
significant harm’ and ‘minimum social safeguards’.

The EU Taxonomy is still under development: so 
far only criteria for two of the six environmental 
objectives have been adopted. As illustrated 
below, Telia Company reports a limited percentage 
of Taxonomy eligible and aligned activities since 
telecommunications networks are not included 
(see Financial key performance indicators on 
pages 112-114). Our industry has highlighted 
this deficiency to the European Commission, 
advocating for networks to be covered in future 
Taxonomy delegated acts with dedicated, fit-for-
purpose alignment criteria. 

Please note that complete environmental data for 
Telia is provided in the Climate and circularity 
chapter and previous parts of this note, including the 
total carbon and energy footprint of our business, 
energy sources used, and circularity initiatives. 

Assessment of eligibility
Telia has assessed all economic activities within 
the Group to determine which activities should 

be reported under the Taxonomy definitions. 
The following activities under the climate change 
mitigation environmental objective have been 
deemed eligible for Telia in 2022: 

8.1 Data processing, hosting and related activities: 
Telia reports data centers – facilities used for 
centralized storage, management or processing 
of data together with all the infrastructure and 
equipment necessary to do so. The data centers we 
report are used by external customers and for Telia’s 
internal purposes. In the absence of a standardized 
EU definition for data center, we have scoped our 
reporting to focus on data centers that meet a 
specified energy consumption threshold and are 
critical for the core network operation in a specific 
market or across company’s operations.

8.2 Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions 
reductions: Under this activity, we report 
products and services with significant enabling 
effects but exclude the data transmission phase 
or technologies needed for data transmission 
processes. This interpretation is informed by 
discussions within the industry, where this is a 
prevailing approach, as well as by contacts with 
EU policymakers. Telia is currently providing the 
following solutions with significant enablement 
effects for customers:
• Remote meeting services
• Internet of Things solutions for smart buildings 

and transportation

TV and Media-related activities (8.3 and 13.3 under 
the climate change adaptation environmental 
objective) have been deemed insignificant, given 
that only CAPEX and OPEX related to implemented 
adaptation solutions can be reported. There is 

uncertainty about reporting under the climate 
change adaptation environmental objective, 
despite guidance from the European Commission. 

We have also assessed several additional economic 
activities that constitute purchase of taxonomy-
aligned outputs, namely: 

4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic 
technology
4.3 Electricity generation from wind power 
4.11Storage of thermal energy
6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and 
light commercial vehicles

No turnover can be reported for these activities 
and the related financial KPIs would constitute 
OPEX under taxonomy definitions, which is not 
material for Telia’s business model. Therefore, these 
economic activities have been excluded from the 
reporting scope. 

Telia will continue to monitor future guidance 
and adjust its reporting in light of emerging best 
practices.

Assessment of alignment
8.1 Data processing, hosting, and related activities
There are three technical screening criteria for 
substantial contribution that need to be fulfilled  
under 8.1:
• Implementation of the EU Code of Conduct for 

Data Centre Energy Efficiency, verified by an 
independent third party and audited at least 
every three years 

• Where a specific Code of Conduct practice is not 
relevant, explanation is provided, including the 
use of alternative best practices

• Global warming potential of the refrigerant used 
in the cooling system does not exceed 675

At the moment, there is no agreed methodology and 
process for verifying compliance with the EU Code 
of Conduct for Data Center Energy Efficiency. Hence, 
it is not possible for any data center under 8.1 to be 
aligned. The European Commission initiated work on 
a temporary methodology in 2022, but results were 
not available in time for the reporting cycle. 

To date, one of Telia’s reported data centers 
has implemented the EU Code of Conduct. This 
same data center also meets the requirement 
on refrigerants by applying water cooling in the 
operational cooling system. 

8.2 Data-driven solutions for GHG emission 
reductions
There are two alignment criteria that need to be 
fulfilled for an activity to be Taxonomy-aligned 
under 8.2:
• ICT solution to be predominantly used for 

enabling GHG emission reductions
• Substantial lifecycle GHG emission savings 

compared to the best-performing alternative 
solution/technology

All services reported under 8.2 are aligned with 
the technical screening criteria. As no alternative 
solutions/technologies exist for the services 
reported under this activity, we consider, based 
on the criterion text, that a lifecycle assessment 
is not necessary. Nonetheless, in our analysis, we 
calculated the net benefits of the digital component 
of the reported solutions, demonstrating substantial 
greenhouse gas emissions and electricity savings 
from these services.

Do no significant harm
A “do no significant harm” assessment was carried 
out to assess compliance for each of the two 
reported activities (8.1 and 8.2). Under “climate 
change adaptation”, the assessment consisted of 
Telia’s physical climate risk analysis at a company 
level, which is detailed under Telia’s transition plan 
and TCFD reporting. We consider this analysis to be 
insufficient in granularity to ensure compliance with 
activity 8.1. We will complement the existing high-
level analysis with deepened site-specific analyses 
to adjust ongoing mitigation activities. However, 
the company-level analysis meets the requirement 
in case of the data-driven solutions reported under 
activity 8.2, as digital services are not site-specific.

For activity 8.2, an additional assessment was 
carried out to ensure the requirements are met 
under “transition to circular economy”:
• Telia does not manufacture any servers or 

data storage equipment but purchases it from 
suppliers which operate within the EU. These 
suppliers mark their products with the CE label, 
as required under the Directive 2009/125/EC. 
Compliance is also ensured through supplier 
requirements based on the Supplier Code of 
Conduct.  

• Telia Company has specific requirements in 
place for its suppliers in regard to restricted and 
banned substances covered by the EU Directives 
on restriction of the use of certain hazardous 
substances (RoHS) and waste from electrical and 
electronic equipment (WEEE).

• Telia Company is compliant with local waste 
management regulations and requirements, as 
well as the EU WEEE legislation. In addition, 
we purchase waste management services from 

suppliers with relevant licenses in the specific 
markets. All electronic waste is separated and 
reused or recycled (for more information, see the 
Climate and circularity chapter).

Minimum social safeguards
Minimum social safeguards are in place through 
the implementation of company-level policies 
and instructions related to, for example, human 
rights, anti-bribery and corruption, taxation and fair 
competition. These policies and instructions adhere 
to relevant international standards and guidelines 
(see the Group-wide Governance Framework 
section for a brief description). Furthermore, these 
areas are fully reflected in Telia Company’s risk 
management process, which is an integrated part 
of the business planning process and monitoring of 
business performance. More information about the 
risk management practices and principal risk areas 
can be found in the Enterprise Risk Management 
and Compliance Framework section. Our 
approach to assessing non-compliance to any of 
our policies and instructions involves continuous 
due diligence and various follow-up procedures, 
including grievance mechanisms, audits, and 
controversy screenings of suppliers.

Accounting principles
The Taxonomy KPI definitions of Turnover, Operating 
expenditure (OPEX) and Capital expenditure 
(CAPEX) are not fully aligned with similar measures 
used in Telia Company’s consolidated financial 
statements. For Taxonomy reporting purposes, 
some adjustments have therefore been made to 
Telia’s financial measures. Telia’s interpretations 
of the Taxonomy KPI definitions are based on 
guidance in the Taxonomy publications, guidance 

from FAR (Institute for the Accountancy Profession 
in Sweden – FAQ on the EU Taxonomy), and 
consultations with external sustainability experts. 
The interpretations of the KPI definitions might 
change in the future as the Taxonomy reporting 
guidance is clarified, and/or the Taxonomy reporting 
practices are developed. To fully align with the 
Taxonomy reporting requirements, further efforts will 
be needed to improve our internal reporting systems 
and processes.

The three Taxonomy KPI denominators have been 
defined as follows by Telia in 2022:
• Turnover is defined as the external revenue under 

the International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS), which corresponds to external net sales in 
Telia’s consolidated statements of comprehensive 
income. 

• CAPEX is defined as the additions to property, 
plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-
of-use assets during the financial year before 
depreciation, amortization and impairments. 
Additions to goodwill and film and program rights 
are not included in CAPEX. Additions are defined 
as investments during the financial year (net of 
any government grants received) and include 
additions resulting from business combinations 
as well as gross increases of asset retirement 
obligations (costs of dismantling and restoration). 
Telia’s CAPEX measure used in the consolidated 
financial statements excludes additions 
resulting from business combinations and asset 
retirement obligations but includes advances and 
pre-payments.

• OPEX is defined as direct non-capitalized 
costs that relate to research and development, 
building renovation measures, short-term leases, 

maintenance and repair, and any other direct 
expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing 
of assets of property, plant, and equipment by 
the undertaking or third party to whom activities 
are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the 
continued and effective functioning of such assets. 

• Direct non-capitalized costs related to research 
and development corresponds to the amount for 
research and development expenses in Telia’s 
consolidated statements of comprehensive 
income, excluding amortization, depreciation, 
and impairment expenses in that function. Telia 
has adopted a strict interpretation of day-to-day 
servicing expenditures and has, for example, only 
included costs if required for maintenance of 
servicing property plant and equipment.

Since Telia’s reporting structures and systems 
have not yet been fully adjusted to mirror the 
economic activity definitions of the Taxonomy, 
some assumptions have been made to establish 
the numerator for certain parts of the KPIs. For 
some of the Data Center activities, estimates have 
been made to calculate the share of OPEX and 
CAPEX related to external customers, these are the 
figures covered in the reporting. As a general note, 
Telia has applied a conservative approach both in 
identifying eligible activities and when estimating 
CAPEX and OPEX associated with such activities.

Strategy

Since Telia’s first TCFD report in 2019, we have 
continuously developed our reporting and 
underlying assessments of risks and opportunities. 
In the table on the next page, we present key risks 
and opportunities with additional information on the 
following pages, including impacts on strategy and 
financial planning. 

During 2022 we have identified expected climate-
related risks and opportunities in the short- mid- 
and long-term time horizon. Short term is defined 
as from now to 2025, mid term from 2025 to 
2027 and long term from 2027 to 2030. Due 
to uncertainties, we use a longer timeframe for 
physical climate risks – currently up until 2040. In 
our view, each risk described under transition risks 
below can be turned into an opportunity, through 
successful mitigation activities.

Transition risks
Identification of risks and opportunities
Transition risks and opportunities are continuously 
assessed as part of our monitoring of, for example, 
policy and technological development (legal, 
policy and technological risks), the development 
of the energy market and customer trends (market 
risks), and stakeholder and media discussions 
(reputational risks). In 2022 we updated our analysis 
and deepened our understanding by letting a cross-
functional group of internal subject matter experts 
screen information from various sources and analyze 
potential shifts (policy/legal, technological, market 
and reputation) and what risks and opportunities 
those could pose for Telia for short- mid- and 

and climate-related risks. The latter is part of the 
company’s Enterprise Risk Management process, 
where Environment, which embeds Climate and 
circularity, is one of 12 principal risk areas that the 
Board is overseeing. Each year the Board approves 
the externally assured Annual and Sustainability 
Report through which Telia’s climate performance is 
reported to external stakeholders.  

The role of management
The Group Executive Management (GEM) jointly 
owns the environmental agenda, and its members 
are responsible for assessment and management of 
climate-related matters including strategic business 
decisions, goal setting, and target execution. 
In addition, there is an environmental steering 
committee to facilitate continuous strategic work, 
find solutions and ways forward related to barriers, 
risks, and opportunities, and make proposals to 
the full GEM as needed. The steering committee 
consists of four members of the GEM, the 
Group Head of Strategy, and the Group Head of 
Sustainability.

In 2022, a decision was made to more clearly 
distribute responsibilities for KPIs related to 
climate and circularity within local and functional 
management teams and integrate the same KPIs 
into the performance evaluation of key individuals. 
Implementation was ongoing at the end of the 
year. Moreover, ESG parameters, including Telia’s 
2025 supply chain climate target, were included 
in the Long-Term Incentive program (variable pay) 
applicable to the extended leadership team1.

Telia’s transition plan 
and TCFD reporting

Telia sees climate change management as a 
decisive factor for future business success and 
acknowledges the importance of providing 
investors and other stakeholders with information 
about how we plan to transition into a low-carbon 
economy and keep Telia resilient. We take the 
TCFD recommendations not only as reporting 
recommendations, but as useful guidance to 
continuously structure and improve our work.

Governance

Board oversight and the role of management 
related to the full sustainability agenda, including 
climate, is described in the Sustainability 
governance chapter. Additional climate-specific 
information is provided here. 

Board oversight
In 2019, the Board adopted Telia’s 2030 climate 
targets. In 2021, the Board approved the new 
Telia purpose and updated business strategy, in 
which climate and circularity were embedded and 
selected as one out of the three most prioritized 
impact areas with dedicated short-, mid- and long-
term goals. To continuously exercise oversight, the 
Board receives half-year and full-year updates from 
management on both progress towards the goals 

long-term perspective, with a particular focus on 
the mid-term one, 2025-2027.  The analysis outlined 
four key shifts, related to: (1) expectations on our 
products & services, (2) opportunities for products 
with enablement effect (3) expectations on our data 
centers & networks and (4) expectations related 
to Telia’s overall resilience. The work was overseen 
by Group-level representatives from Sustainability, 
Finance, Strategy and Risk management so that 
adjustments could be made in their respective areas 
of work. 

In short, we found: 
• Policy/legal: New policy and legal requirements 

are currently very much driven by the EU 
Green Deal, the EU Circular Action Plan and 
related national legislation. Several new and 
upcoming laws are making previous voluntary 
work mandatory, loopholes are being closed 
and transparency requirements aim to make 
the environmental performance of companies/
products/services comparable. We expect 
these changes to increase the return on 
investments in sustainability-related work and 
make greenwashing and “lighter” sustainability 
work more difficult and subject to penalization. 
In addition to legislation targeting all large 
companies (such as CSRD and CSDDD), ICT/telcos 
are targeted specifically in relation to, for example, 
the energy efficiency of data centers, eco-design 
and the energy efficiency of mobile phones, the 
“right to repair” electronics, transparency, and 
other requirements regarding the environmental 
impacts of networks. High reputational risks, rather 
than fines, are expected for laggards and cases of 
non-compliance.

1) The Extended Leadership Team consists of the company’s ~130 top leaders (members of Group Executive Management, their direct 
reports and certain additional local/functional management team members when those have roles of particular strategic importance). In 
this context, please note that members of the GEM are excluded from any variable pay schemes, as a requirement from our largest owner.

Market
• We see and expect increasing investor 

expectations and interest in our climate work, 
both related to reductions of our negative carbon 
footprint and our ability to enable customers 
to reduce emissions through digitalization. 
The Sustainable Finance Reporting Directive 
(in force from 2024) aims to redirect capital to 
sustainable economic activities and will gradually 
start impacting access to capital. This is already 
materializing in growing interest in Green Bonds 
and Sustainability Linked Loans, as well as more 
granular requests from ESG rating agencies, 
analysts and lenders. 

• Results from the 2022 SB Insights B2C study 
highlights climate and circularity among the top 
three prioritized topics for consumers across our

reputational impacts. 

markets. There are certain differences between 
the Nordic and Baltic markets, with Nordic 
customers having the highest expectations on 
climate performance to date. 

• Business customers are raising the bar as they 
move from ambitions to action and increasingly 
seek advice on how they can lower their footprint 
through low-carbon, energy-efficient and circular 
products, as well as digital services that drive 
efficiencies. Such opportunities are increasing as 
5G expands and Industry 4.0 emerges. 

• Reputation: Telia’s customer surveys show high 
trust in Telia and our sector is connected to 
relatively low negative associations. The ability to 
become low-carbon, energy-efficient and circular 
is expected to determine the future reputations of 
both individual companies and the industry.  

• Technology: High-quality connectivity and digital 
solutions are crucial to enable a transition into a 
net-zero economy. Final impacts will also depend 
on how technology is deployed, if suppliers 
manage to transform to low-carbon and circular 
economies, as well as the sectors’ ability to 
handle conflicting goals. As an example, regional 
autonomy ambitions for security reasons may drive 
increasing infrastructure needs locally.  

We expect these transitional trends to intensify up until 
2025/2027, which leads us to prioritize the risks and 
opportunities listed in the table above. Uncertainties 
relate to the pace of change, which may be affected by 
the current economic downturn, the energy crisis, the 
level of ambition of next years’ government policy, and 
the frequency and severity of extreme weather events.

Impact on strategy
The ongoing trends described above confirm the 
importance of Telia’s climate and circularity goals 
being embedded in the business strategy, which in 
turn impact various aspects of our business, as well 
as underlying area-specific strategies and ways of 
working. Here are a few examples:  
• Own operations: Our environmental goals have 

led to 85% in emissions reductions since 2018 
related to energy and fuel (scope 1 and 2). We are 
continuing our efforts to reduce emissions further 
and have mapped which steps to take to achieve 
a 90% reduction by 2030 at the latest (base year: 
2018). 

• Supply chain management: Emission reductions 
in our supply chain are key to achieve our goals. 
Hence, climate performance is embedded in Telia’s 

117Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



supplier selection and engagement processes, 
whereby we request companies to set science-
based targets. In several areas we work with 
peers to generate an industry shift (see example 
of Eco Rating of smart phones and GSMA 
collaboration related to circular approaches to 
networks on pages 102 and 77). We believe our 
“all company” approach is the best way to secure 
top management commitments and substantial 
reductions, while also increasing the resilience 
in our supply chain, rather than zooming in on 
specific product/service deliveries to Telia. 

• Investments and product development: 
Investment decisions related to product 
development and other areas are preceded by 
environmental screening covering impact on 
emissions, energy, and waste. In addition, we are 
scaling circular business models and sales of 
enablement products/services. 

We have not conducted any transitional scenario 
analysis related to various levels of temperature 
rise. However, in 2022, we created a modelling 
tool together with Accenture to assess how Telia’s 
current targets and various external factors, such 
as expected legal developments and the pace of 
the shift to renewable energy, electrification and 
digitalization, etc., may impact our ability to achieve 
our goals. The tool is used to assess impacts of 
various future scenarios related to such drivers. 
The 2022 exercise demonstrated that, based 
on our current assumptions, external drivers will 
significantly contribute to emission reductions, 
which adds to the expected effects from Telia’s 
current climate goals. However, to achieve our 
goals we need a higher pace of reductions in 
our supply chain, as well as a larger net-zero and 
circular shift in the broader society.

Impact on financial planning 
Financial planning is affected by our various 
initiatives, e.g., purchasing of renewable electricity, 
carbon offsets and long-term Power Purchasing 
Agreements, as well as investments in energy-
efficiency measures, the development of new 
products and offerings (continuous development 
of Telia’s IoT platform, cloud and crowd insights 
offerings, circular business models such as Device 
as Service and internal loop for refurbished mobile 
phones). Some initiatives generate extra costs 
(offsets and purchasing of Guarantees of Origin), 
while others reduce costs (e.g., refurbishment 
initiatives) or generate increased or new revenue 
as we generate extra value to our customers. Two 
examples are Device as a Service (DaaS), whereby 
we simplify the lives of customers while limiting 
the environmental impact, and our IoT offerings, 
which strengthen our ambition to be the customer’s 
digital partner of choice. 

Physical risks
Identification of risks and opportunities
During 2021, we carried out our first physical 
climate risk assessments in all our markets, 
based on analysis provided by the Swedish 
Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). 
The analysis involved climate modelling of three 
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 
by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) through three reference periods 
(2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100). The 
selected scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) 
cover a wide range of variations regarding 
future concentrations of greenhouse gases in 
the atmosphere and its effect on indicators such 
as annual average temperature and heatwaves, 
annual maximum wind speed, annual average 

precipitation, and daily maximum precipitation. 
The analysis shows differences among the various 
reference periods and scenarios for the indicators 
analyzed. A few conclusions:
• Heatwaves: The yearly average temperature 

is rising globally and will increase all over the 
Nordic/Baltic region, especially in northern 
Sweden. Warmer yearly average temperatures 
will also increase the frequency, duration, and 
intensity of heatwaves in the summer. Generally, 
the northern regions are projected to warm more 
than the southern regions, and inland regions are 
projected to heat more than coastal regions. The 
results consistently show a higher temperature 
increase for the later time periods.  

• Wind speed: Annual maximum wind speed is 
affected by a complex set of variables that control 
storm paths, strength, and frequency, resulting in 
greater uncertainty in comparison to other climate 
indicators.  

• Precipitation: Changes in precipitation are 
expected to be small in the earlier timeframes, 
with increasing risks in the later period. 

Going forward, we will complement the high-level 
analyses with deepened region- or site-specific 
analyses to adjust ongoing mitigation activities.

Impact on strategy and financial planning:
Potential implications of the changes outlined 
above are, in most cases, related to disruptions 
(power outages and connection losses), which 
we work with systematically within Telia’s Service 
Continuity Management, regardless of the cause 
– see the Privacy and security and Responsible 
sourcing chapters for further information (the latter 
for information about work to prevent disruption of 
supply). To date, the organization’s experiences of 

extreme weather have shaped preventive actions 
in our local markets. In 2023, we will look further 
into eventual risks related to network equipment we 
purchase. 

To date, the above-mentioned processes and 
activities are part of continuous work and financed 
as such, without any specific climate-related 
financing or inclusion in financial planning.  

Risk management

Processes for identifying and assessing  
climate-related risks
Over the past few years, we have taken several 
steps to integrate climate into Telia’s risk 
management processes:
• In 2018/19, we conducted a materiality 

assessment that preceded the adoption of Telia’s 
2030 climate goals for the value chain. 

• In 2020, we further mapped and calculated 
our climate and waste impacts, as well as our 
enablement effect, to better understand the size 
of risks and opportunities which informed more 
detailed target setting for 2023 and 2025. 

• In 2021, we conducted our first physical risk 
assessment. 

• In 2022, we set up a cross-functional transition 
plan working group to regularly assess climate-
related risks and opportunities, with the first 
report delivered to Group Executive Management 
(GEM) at the end of the year. 

Since 2021, Environment (Climate and circularity) 
is selected as one of 12 principal risk areas that are 
covered in Telia’s Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) Framework, used to regularly identify, 
analyze, assess, and report risks and uncertainties. 

118Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



As part of the ERM process, the overall maturity 
level of the environmental work is regularly assessed 
in a structured way using the same model that is 
applied for all principal risk areas at Telia. We also 
use Telia’s ERM heat map to assess the impact level 
of transitional risks, based on assumptions regarding 
financial, strategic, regulatory, customer experience 
and reputational impacts. The impact levels are 
described in the table on page 116. 

Processes for managing climate-related risks
Risks and opportunities that we identify are prioritized 
and managed through Telia’s environmental program 
or directly integrated into key processes for suitable 
work areas (e.g., service continuity management, 
product development, etc.). Risk prioritization is based 
on the impact levels described in the table on page 
116. 

Metrics and targets

Telia adopted its 2030 targets in 2019 and its 2025 
science-based targets in 2020 aligned with the ICT 
sector’s 1.5C pathway. These long- and mid-term goals 
were broken down into short-term targets for 2022 and 
2023. In 2022, we submitted a 2040 net-zero target 
to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to get 
external approval for a goal aligned with the new SBTi  
Net-Zero Standard (approval pending). 

Metrics used to track progress are:
• Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions according to the GHG 

protocol (see page 108)
• Enablement reporting developed with consultancy 

Carbon Trust (see page 109)
• Taxonomy eligibility and alignment for data centers 

(8:1) and enablement services (8:2) (see page 110)

• Impact level in Telia’s ERM Risk Scoring (very high, 
high, medium, low) (see table on page 116).

A full overview of metrices, targets and progress 
to date is available in the Climate and circularity 
chapter and in the earlier parts of this Note. 

S5 Digital inclusion

See the Digital inclusion chapter for more 
information.

The key pillars of Telia’s Digital inclusion strategy 
are 1) Providing reliable access to connectivity and 
2) Building digital skills with the following KPIs.  

Providing reliable access
Progress to ensure access is measured through KPIs 
for population coverage. We also work to increase 
access to our services for individuals with disabilities 
(no quantifiable KPI available). 

Building digital skills
Reach refers to the number of individuals that we 
have reached via our digital inclusion initiatives. 
Individuals covered are those who risk being 
disadvantaged, digitally excluded, or placed in a 
vulnerable situation. To put our goal of one million 
into context, Telia had 14.4 million consumers and 
enterprise mobile subscribers in 2022. 

The initiative in question raises awareness about 
risks and opportunities in the online world with the 
aim of building digital skills. The former is essential 
to build the latter. 

Key target groups today are:
• Seniors (to for example access necessary 

services such as health care and banking)
• Children (to be well equipped in the online 

world). In the case of children, we also include 
reach related to parents and teachers who are 
key for skills building and empowerment related 
to children.

• Immigrants (to remove barriers as they enter 
highly digital societies)

• Women (to be re-skilled in order to increase equal 
opportunities in the IT and technology sector)

• SMEs (to not lag behind due to limited digital 
maturity including related to cybersecurity). 

Both physical and digital channels are used. Format 
and channels are shaped by target group needs 
and potential to reach beyond smaller groups of 
individuals in e.g face-to-face trainings.

The vast majority of our initiatives are conducted 
in collaboration with important stakeholders or 
partners such as municipalities (for seniors) or 
organizations specialized in a topic (child rights 
organization). Initiatives are accounted for if there 
is an important/ substantial contribution from Telia 
either as an initiator of the initiative, or through a 
financial or in-kind contribution. 

Reach by digital inclusion initiatives includes direct 
reach (number of participants in face-to-face 
training programs, seminars, workshops, or other 
digital skills building events) and indirect reach 
(number of unique viewers of specific websites 
with digital skills building guide materials, number 
of downloads of educational apps, number of 
receivers of printed digital skills guide materials, 
number of participants in webinars etc).

In 2022, we initiated a project in collaboration 
with Malmö University and Jönköping University 
to develop a model for measuring the impact of a 
selection of our digital inclusion initiatives. To better 
understand the impact and evaluate the initiatives 
in question, we have previously conducted impact 
assessments for three initiatives: Digital Senior in 
Sweden (2018, with a university partner); Greatest 
Courage in Estonia (2021, with a consultancy 
specializing in social impact measurement); and 
Women Go Tech in Lithuania (2021, by WGT itself). 
For additional information about our initiatives, visit 
our website.

S6 Privacy and 
security

See the Privacy and security chapter for more 
information. 

Personal data and Personal data breach are 
defined as per Article 4. GDPR, data breach 
notification obligations are outlined in Article 33. 

Right of access request refers to Article 15 GDPR.

As the processes of some business units (TV4, C 
More and MTV Oy) differ from Group processes 
(regarding, for example, right of access requests 
and personal data breaches), such reported 
statistics do not include cases from these units.

S7 Human rights
See the Human rights chapter for more information. 

Salient human rights issues 
Salient human rights issues – listed in the Human 
rights chapter of this report – are defined as per 
the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework: 
“the issue at risk of the most severe negative 
impact through the company’s activities and 
business relationships.” Identification of the most 
salient issues focuses on risk to people based on 
likelihood and severity. The latter is defined by:
• Scale (gravity of human rights impact)
• Scope (number of people who have or could be 

impacted)
• Remediability (can the impact be put to right or not)

Salience is reviewed as part of our broader process 
to determine materiality (see Sustainability note 
S3) and further analysis conducted by Telia’s 
Human Rights Core Team, which includes internal 
experts on various human rights areas. These 
experts regularly consult and receive input from 
external partners and networks we participate in. 
Examples include: 
• Children’s rights organizations such as World 

Childhood Foundation (for topics related to 
children’s rights including the spread of child 
sexual abuse materials)

• The Global Network Initiative (on freedom of 
expression and privacy)

• Compensation as to privacy incidents, either 
under agreements or GDPR.

• Guarantees of measures and non-repetition 
as to privacy and security incidents by e.g. 
improvement of internal guidelines and 
processes and as to employee issues e.g. in the 
form of disciplinary actions against responsible 
employees.

Media freedoms
For information about Telia’s commitment to 
media freedoms, please refer to our Group Policy 
Media Owner Commitments which defines Telia 
Company’s commitments in relation to a free flow 
of information, freedom of expression, freedom 
and independence of mass media and an open and 
democratic society.

• Union representatives (on labor rights, including 
risks of discrimination)

• Internal and external diversity networks (for topics 
related to diversity and inclusion)

• Audit results through Joint Audit Cooperation (on 
labor rights in supply chains, including forced and 
child labor)

• Continuous interactions with other experts as 
needed, including authorities such as local data 
protection boards on privacy matters

• The global non-profit organization BSR for 
sustainability expertise

Access to remedy
Telia learns about a human rights risk or harm 
through our Speak-Up Line and also via customer 
care, sourcing, employee complaints processes, etc.

Telia’s Speak-Up Line serves as our operational level 
grievance mechanism and is available, in several 
languages, to both internal and external stakeholders.

Telia provides remedy such as by:
• Restitution as to privacy incidents by deleting 

or requiring others to delete e.g., unlawfully 
disclosed personal data or to correct erroneous 
personal data.

• Satisfaction as to privacy incidents and customer 
complaints more broadly by investigating and 
acknowledging the harm and providing an 
apology directly to the customer and/or via 
media. All customer complaints are assessed with 
the purpose to prevent any harm from happening 
again. 

S8 Freedom of 
expression and 
surveillance privacy

See the Freedom of expression and surveillance 
privacy chapter for more information. Definitions 
of the authority request categories are available in 
Telia’s Sustainability Reporting Framework. 

In our Law Enforcement Disclosure Reports (LEDR), 
we publish detailed statistics on conventional 
requests as well as the approximate number of 
unconventional requests. The March 2023 LEDR 
report includes statistics regarding conventional 
requests from 2020 to 2022. A summary Telia’s 
LEDR report is presented on the next page as part 
of the external assurance. 

Figures both on the following page and in the 
LEDR show the number of day-to-day conventional 
requests from authorities, not the number of 
individuals to whom they relate. Comparisons 
between markets should be avoided due to 
differences in market shares as well as working 
methods of both authorities and Telia locally. For 
more information about definitions, data sources and 
main challenges, see Appendix 2 in the LEDR. For 
statistics before 2020, please see our resource page 
for Law Enforcement Disclosure Reports.

S10 Health and well-being
See the Diversity, inclusion and well-being chapter for more information. 

As a result of different HR systems, sickness absence figures are not available for Lithuania. For more 
information about calculation methods and definitions, see Telia’s Sustainability Reporting Framework. 

Sickness absence
The sickness absence rate (SAR) represents 
the percentage ratio of absence days related to 
sickness per days of total contractual work time.

Sickness absence rate (%) 2022 2021

Denmark 3.2 2.8

Estonia 2.0 1.8

Finland 2.8 2.4

Norway 5.4 4.7

Sweden 2.7 2.4

Weighted average, all countries 3.0 2.6

Our target is to constantly have lower sickness 
absence rates than the national industry average. 
Monitoring of the sickness absence rate is crucial, 
and actions are taken locally when there is an 
increase.

Lost-time injuries 
The lost-time injury frequency (LTIF) figure 
represents the number of injuries resulting in 
absence from work per million theoretical work 
hours.

Lost-time injury frequency 2022 2021

Denmark 2.72 0.50

Estonia 0.30 1.25

Finland 0.12 0.11

Lithuania 0.00 0.50

Norway 0.00 0.00

Sweden 0.00 0.00

All countries 0.17 0.21

In our industry the overall accident rate is low. To 
illustrate what the data above represents, Finland’s 
score of 0.12 means there was one accident in that 
market in 2022. Our target is to have a LTIF lower 
than 0.52. However, there main focus is to monitor 
activities and take immediate action if the LTIF 
changes significantly.

S11 Legal compliance
For information about legal cases and proceedings, 
see Note C30 in the Consolidated financial 
statements. This includes significant legal cases 
and proceedings relating to, for example, business 
ethics, environmental and socio-economic 
compliance if such cases exist.

S9 Diversity and 
inclusion
See the Diversity, inclusion and well-being 
chapter for more information. Complementary 
information is available in the People section of the 
Board of Directors’ Report.

In many of our markets, we are not allowed to track 
the region of birth of our employees. However, in 
Sweden we can get aggregated data on the region 
of birth by providing personal identity numbers to 
the Central Bureau of Statistics (SCB). The outcome 
is presented on page 98.

Region of birth, as defined by Sweden’s Central 
Bureau of Statistics (SCB), is determined by the 
individuals’ place of birth and the parents’ place 
of birth. This defines Swedish background as an 
individual born in Sweden with one or two parents 
born in Sweden, and Non-Swedish background 
as an individual born outside of Sweden or born 
in Sweden with two foreign-born parents. Data 
for Telia in Sweden is presented according to the 
definition provided by SCB. Please note that data 
for GEM and the Board only considers where the 
individual was born.

to local norms issued by authorities based on 
the World Health Organization (WHO) and 
the International Commission on Non-Ionizing 
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines when 
constructing radio networks and for the mobile 
devices we sell. 

In the current 5G deployment across the Nordics 
and Baltics, we follow the ICNIRP guidelines, which 
were updated in 2020 to include 5G frequencies, 
also called 5G spectrum. 5G technology is, to a 
large extent, built on the same infrastructure as 
previous generations of mobile networks, such as 
3G and 4G, and the equipment used adheres to 
the same strict EMF requirements and exposure 
limits. During network planning, we ensure that 
equipment is placed in such a way that we meet 
applicable regulations on exposure limits. If 
needed, we carry out on-site measurements to 
verify that regulations are met.

We continuously engage with key stakeholders 
such as local and national authorities, on our own 
and through industry organizations, to clarify 
concerns or questions from the public and make 
sure authorities have relevant information about 
how we build our networks according to EMF 
guidelines. More information on EMF is provided 
on local websites and Telia Company’s website.

Transparent, fair, and ethical tax practices form part 
of Telia’s basis for business operations. Telia works 
according to internal control procedures, such as 
our Group tax instruction, and complies with local 
legislation and internationally accepted principles to 
pay the amount of taxes legally due in any territory.

In addition to corporate income tax payments, Telia 
generates billions of SEK in other tax payments 
and non-tax-based fees such as telecom licenses 
throughout its footprint. The total tax contribution 
in 2022, including both taxes borne and taxes 
collected, amounted to SEK 19.1 billion (19.3).

S12 Child, forced and 
compulsory labor
Supplier requirements regarding child, forced and 
compulsory labor are included in the Supplier 
Code of Conduct and in the in-depth due diligence 
assessment. Suppliers are expected to enforce and 
verify compliance with Telia’s requirements within 
their own operations and through their supply 
chains.

Independent human rights impact assessments 
carried out in 2017 for one of our operations in the 
Nordics (Telia Sweden) and one in the Baltics (Telia 
Lithuania) indicated a high unlikelihood of child, 
forced and compulsory labor related to our own 
geographical contexts. Our conclusion is that this 
still applies. 

Continuous audits carried out by Telia and the Joint 
Alliance for CSR (JAC) indicate that child labor issues 
are rare. During the year, no findings related to child 
labor were found through Telia’s audits. JAC had 
9 child labor-related findings (the respective JAC 
members sponsoring the audits are responsible for 
following up and closing such non-conformities).

In the past couple of years, reports linked our industry 
and some of Telia’s suppliers to forced labor. During 
2022, follow up work was still carried out to address 
these (see the Responsible sourcing chapter).

A general statement regarding the UK Modern 
Slavery Act is available on Telia’s website. The 
statement provided on the website is not part of the 
sustainability report and has not been subject to 
limited assurance.

* Investigations are considered closed when a final report has

investigations office, to appropriate management (determined on 
a case-by-case basis).

For more information about the whistle-blowing 
process and channel, see the Whistle-blowing 
and Speak-up line chapter in the Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) and Compliance Framework 
section.

During the year, 103 (103) reports were recorded 
in the whistle-blowing channel Speak-up line, of 
which 50 (40)% were filed anonymously. The most 
common reported issues related to allegations of 
poor leadership, harassment and fraud. Reports 
were received through the Speak-up line portal 
or e-mail address (which are available to both 
employees and third parties), through direct 
contact with group or local ethics and compliance 
officers and via line managers. In 2023 we plan to 
simplify the Speak-up line and increase awareness 
of the tool, as part of the roll out a new Code of 
Conduct and reinforcement of the Supplier Code of 
Conduct.

Consolidated case reports were presented to 
the Audit Committee throughout the year. The 
reports included allegations of certain significance, 
progress, and the final results of the investigations.

A summary of cases is provided to the right. The TV 
and Media business unit uses a different provider 
for whistle-blowing reports in order to protect the 
dividing line between editorial work and Telia as a 
media owner. Reporting and investigations within 
the TV and Media unit are carried out in line with 
Telia’s defined whistle-blowing process, but Telia 
does not have any insight into the investigations 
conducted. All whistle-blowing reports from the TV 
and Media business unit are, however, included in 
the following statistics. 

Telia and local companies are constantly prepared 
to participate in disaster relief or crisis support, 
primarily through the use of our networks, products 
and services. Common measures are zero-rating 
traffic or supporting with additional network 
capacity. For a period during 2022, Telia provided 
support to Ukraine through free or reduced rate 
calls to/from Ukraine, distribution of free pre-
paid SIM cards for refugees and free access to 
news channels for Telia customers. Through a live 
fundraising event, TV4 collected close to 40MSEK 
that was donated to four NGOs. More information 
about support activities for Ukraine is available on 
our website.

Sponsorships
To ensure that sponsorships and donations are 
conducted in an ethical and compliant manner, 
these are governed by our Group Instruction – 
Sponsorships and donations. As sponsorships 
and donations can be used to facilitate corrupt 
practices, the Instruction includes strict 
requirements; all sponsorships and donations 
must be documented to reflect their purpose and 
recipients undergo documented due diligence. 
Political donations are strictly forbidden. 

The general principle is to sponsor or partner with 
organizations to support long-term activities, linked 
to digitalization and our geographical presence. 

Donations and disaster relief
Telia provides short-term philanthropic donations 
such as financial or in-kind support for disaster 
relief or other extraordinary circumstances. 
Substantial financial donations during the year 
included donations to a Swedish children’s rights 
organization, Bris. Read more in the Children’s 
rights chapter.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are guided by 
the M&A Instruction and by the M&A handbook, 
which describes the M&A process in majority 
transactions, both acquisitions and divestments. 
The handbook was updated and further developed 
in 2022. It includes general guidance on ethics and 
compliance as well as sustainability related topics. 

Significant divestments during the year 
Telia Towers – Sweden – Signed, announced, and 
closed in 2022.  

Telia divested 49% of its ownership of Telia 
Towers Sweden to Brookfield and Alecta, after a 
similar divestment of Telia Towers Norway and 
Finland in 2021. Standard KYC due diligence was 
carried out, as counterparties were reputable firms 
regulated by financial supervisory authorities in 
low-risk jurisdictions, although complemented with 
interviews of potential investors to ensure that they 
share Telia’s view on how to run the business. Telia 
Towers Sweden will remain a subsidiary to Telia and 
Telia’s group policies will remain fully applicable. 
Since Telia will continue using Telia Towers as a 
supplier, it will be subject to the same supplier 
due diligence as other suppliers, according to an 
agreement between Telia and Telia Towers.

No significant acquisitions were made during 2022.

The goals and process described in the

editorial operations are, however, managed by 
the TV and Media unit, in a separate process, to

The Telia Management System is developed in 
accordance with several international standards,

C1. Basis of preparation

General
The annual report and consolidated financial state-
ments have been approved for issue by the Board of 
Directors on March 8, 2023. The income statement 
and the balance sheet of the parent company and 
the statement of comprehensive income and the 
statement of financial position of the group are sub-
ject to adoption by the AGM on April 5, 2023.

Telia Company’s consolidated financial state-
ments have been prepared in accordance with  
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union (EU). In addi-
tion, concerning purely Swedish circumstances, 
the Swedish Financial Reporting Board has issued 
standard RFR 1 “Supplementary Accounting Rules 

for Groups” and other statements. The standard is 
applicable to Swedish legal entities whose securities 
are listed on a Swedish stock exchange or author-
ized equity marketplace at the end of the reporting 
period and specifies supplementary rules and dis-
closures in addition to IFRS requirements, caused by 
provisions in the Swedish Annual Accounts Act.

Measurement bases and accounting 
policies
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared mainly under the historical cost conven-
tion. Other measurement bases used, and applied 
accounting policies are described in Note C3.

Amounts and dates
Unless otherwise specified, all amounts are in 
millions of Swedish kronor (SEK) or other currency 
specified and are based on the twelve-month  
period January 1 to December 31 for items related 
to comprehensive income and cash flows, and as of 
December 31 for items related to financial position. 
Rounding differences may occur. Any restatements 
of financial or operational data are disclosed if 
material.

Restatement of financial and operational 
data
As a result of a reorganization as of December 2022, 
Capex excluding fees for licenses and spectrum and 

right-of-use assets, segment assets as well as num-
ber of employees have been restated for compara-
bility between TV and Media and Other operations. 
The restatement effect for Capex excluding fees 
for licenses and spectrum and right-of use assets is 
presented in the table below. The restatement effect 
for segment assets as of December 31, 2021, was 
SEK -376 million for TV and Media and SEK +376 
million for Other operations. The restatement effect 
for number of employees was -126 for TV and Media
and +126 for Other operations.

Recently issued accounting standards
New and amended standards and interpretations 
effective in 2022
As of January 1, 2022, the following amended 
standards and interpretations became applicable:
• Amendments to IFRS 3, “Reference to the Concep-

tual framwork”
• Amendments to IAS 16, “Proceeds before intended 

use”
• Amendments to IAS 37, “Onerous contracts - costs 

of fulfilling a contract”
• Annual improvements 2018-2020, amendments to 

IFRS 1, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 41 

The amended standards and interpretations rele-
vant to Telia Company are in certain cases in line 
with already applied interpretations and otherwise 
have had no or very limited impact on the financial 
statements.

New or amended standards and interpretations 
effective on or after January 1, 2023
Telia Company has not pre-adopted any of the new 
or amended standards effective on or after Janu-
ary 1, 2023.

The new standard IFRS 17 “Insurance contracts” is 
effective January 1, 2023. IFRS 17 covers principles 
for recognition, measurement, presentation, and 
disclosure of insurance contracts and replaces IFRS 
4 “Insurance contracts”. The standard applies to all 
types of insurance contracts regardless of the type 
of entities that issue them and provides a general 
model for valuation of insurance contracts, supple-
mented by a simplified approach and some specific 
adaptions. 

IFRS 17 will be applicable for Telia Company’s 
insurance contracts issued to customers via its 
insurance company Telia Försäkring AB. The insur-
ance contracts refer to property insurance related 
to equipment sold to customers. The coverage 
period for these insurance contracts is less than one 
year and Telia Company will account for these con-
tracts applying the simplified Premium Allocation 
Approach (PAA) under which the insurance premi-
ums received are recognized as a liability for remain-
ing coverage and insurance revenue is recognized 
over the period when the insurance coverage is pro-
vided. Telia Company will also apply the exceptions 
for insurance contracts with a short coverage period 
under which the liabilities for remaining coverage 
and incurred claims are not discounted. The imple-
mentation of IFRS 17 will have no material impact 
on Telia Company’s financial statements when the 
standard is applied for the first time.

The following amendments, which will be appli-
cable for Telia Company, are expected to have no 
or very limited impact on Telia Company’s financial 
statements when they are applied for the first time:
• Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 

2, “Disclosure of accounting policies”, effective 
January 1, 2023

• Amendments to IAS 8, “Definition of accounting 
estimates”, effective January 1, 2023

• Amendments to IAS 12 “Deferred tax related to 
assets and liabilities arising from a single transac-
tion”, effective January 1, 2023

• Amendments to IFRS 17 “Initial Application of IFRS 
17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information”, effec-
tive January 1, 2023

• Amendments to IAS 1 “Classification of liabilities as 
current or non current”, effective January 1, 2024

• Amendments to IAS 1 “Non-current liabilities with 
covenants”, effective January 1, 2024

• Amendments to IFRS 16 “Lease liability in a sale 
and leaseback”, effective January 1, 2024

Other issued amendments are deemed not applica-
ble for Telia Company.

EU endorsement status
As of the beginning of March 2023, amendments to 
standards and interpretations mentioned above had 
been adopted by the EU, except for amendments 
to IAS 1 “Classification of liabilities as current or 
non-current” and “Non-current liabilities with cove-
nants” and amendments to IFRS 16 “Lease liability in 
a sale and leaseback”.

C2. Judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements requires 
management and the Board of Directors to make 
estimates and judgments that affect reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, 
and related disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities. These estimates are based on historical 
experience and various other assumptions that 
management and the Board believe are reasonable 
under the circumstances, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgments about the carrying 
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates under different assump-
tions or conditions, significantly impacting Telia 
Company’s earnings and financial position.

Management believes that the following areas 
comprise the most difficult, subjective or complex 
judgments it has to make in the preparation of the 
financial statements.

For information on accounting policies applied, 
see the respective sections of Note C3.

Revenue recognition
For a telecom operator, if and when revenue should 
be recognized requires management judgment in a 
number of cases.

Principal or agent – gross versus net presentation 
When the group acts as a principal, income and 
payments to suppliers are reported on a gross basis 
in revenue and operating costs. If the group sells 
goods or services as an agent (for example insur-
ance in some countries) revenue and payments to 
suppliers are recorded in revenue on a net basis, 

representing the margin/commission earned.
Whether the group is considered to be principal 

or agent in a transaction depends on analysis by 
management of both the legal form and substance 
of the agreement between the group and its busi-
ness partners; such judgments impact the amount 
of reported revenue and operating expenses but do 
not impact net income or cash flows.

Features indicating that the group is acting as a 
principal include: it has the primarily responsibility 
for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or 
services, it bears the inventory risk, and the group 
has latitude in establishing prices or provides addi-
tional goods and services. If the group does not 
have control of the goods or services before they 
are transferred to the customer, it acts as an agent. 
For insurance services, the key judgement is based 
on whether Telia Company bears the insurance risk 
or not. Telia Company is deemed to be acting as an 
agent if it does not bear the insurance risk. For other 
types of digital value added services the key judge-
ment is related to assessment of whether Telia Com-
pany has the primarily responsibility for fulfilling the 
promise to provide the service. In this assessment 
the terms of the contract, the way the service is sold, 
the level of interaction with the customer before, 
during and after delivering the service and the tech-
nical delivery of the service are considered among 
other things.

Bundling of products and services
In bundling of products and services, identifying 
performance obligations and determining the stand-
alone selling prices requires management judgment. 

Revenue are allocated between the goods and ser-
vices identified as a separate performance obliga-
tion based on their relative stand-alone selling price. 
The stand-alone selling price determined for goods 
or services may impact the timing of the recognition 
of revenue. Determining the stand-alone selling 
price of each performance obligation can require 
complex estimates if those are not directly observ-
able. The group’s estimation of stand-alone selling 
prices that are not directly observable are mainly 
based on expected cost plus a margin.

Leases
Definition a of a lease
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period of time in exchange for consider-
ation. Significant management judgment is required 
in determining whether the contract is a lease or 
a service agreement. To determine if a contract is 
a lease an assessment of whether, throughout the 
period of use, the customer has both the right to 
obtain substantially all of the economic benefits 
from use of the identified asset and the right to 
direct the use of the identified asset. Especially 
for contracts for network related assets (technical 
space and technical equipment) where the contract 
is related to the use of a portion of a larger asset 
this assessment requires significant judgment and 
analysis of the contract terms and the facts and cir-
cumstances such as for example the technological 
aspects of the asset.

Lease term
Determining the lease term requires management 
judgment as the estimated lease term includes 
the non-cancellable period of the lease together 
with both periods covered by extension options, 
if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that 
option, and periods covered by termination options 
if the lessee is reasonable certain not to exercise 
that option. The threshold for reasonably certain is 
deemed to be higher than “more likely than not”, 
but lower than “virtually certain” in IAS 37 “Provi-
sions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets”. 
Extension and termination options are included in a 
number of Telia Company’s lease contracts through-
out all asset classes across the group. When deter-
mining the lease term, Telia Company considers all 
facts and circumstances that creates an economic 
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to 
exercise a termination option. Example of factors 
that are considered are; strategic plans, assessment 
of future technology changes, the importance of the 
underlying asset to Telia Company’s operations and/
or costs associated with not extending or not ter-
minating the lease. Around 45% of Telia Company’s 
lease liability relates to extension periods.

Discount rate
The future lease payments are discounted using 
either the interest rate implicit in the contract, if that 
rate can be readily determined, or the lesee’s incre-
mental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing 
rate is defined as the rate of interest that a lessee 
would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, 
and with a similar security, the funds necessary to

service arrangements 33%, or agreement term if longer

Film and program rights 20-100%

Cost to obtain a contract Straight line, based on historic and projected churn

Right-of-use assets Expected lease term, 3-50%

Valuation of intangible and other  
non-current assets
Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, 
right of use assets, film and program rights and cost 
to obtain a contract represent a significant part of 
Telia Company’s total assets.

Useful lives
Determination of the useful lives of asset classes  
involves taking into account historical trends 
and making assumptions related to future socio- 
economic and technological development and  
expected changes in market behavior.

In 2022 and 2021, amortization, depreciation 
and impairment losses for intangible assets, prop-
erty, plant and equipment and right of use assets 
totaled SEK 38,936 million and SEK 20,023 million, 
respectively. Amortization and impairment losses 
for film and program rights and cost to obtain a 
contract were SEK 5,557 million (4,977) and SEK 
1,362 million (1,215), respectively. For additional 
information on intangible and tangible assets, right 
of use assets, film and program rights and costs to 
obtain a contract subject to amortization and depre-
ciation and their carrying values as of the end of the 
reporting period, see Notes C6, C7, C12, C13, C14 
and C28, respectively.

obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use 
asset in a similar economic environment. For most 
contracts, Telia Company has discounted the future 
lease payments using the incremental borrowing 
rate. Determining the incremental borrowing rate 
requires management judgement. The incremental 
borrowing rate is based on Telia Company’s external 
funding rate by currency and by duration of  
the estimated lease term. The rate is also adjusted 
for geographical risks and credit risks for the sub-
sidiaries. For additional information on leases and 
carrying values, see Note C28.

Income taxes
Significant management judgment is required in 
determining provisions for deferred tax liabilities 
and assets, in particular as regards valuation of 
deferred tax assets. As part of this process, income 
taxes have to be estimated in each of the jurisdic-
tions in which Telia Company operates. The process 
involves estimating the actual current tax exposure 
together with assessing temporary differences 
resulting from the different valuation of certain 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
in the tax returns. Management must also assess 
the probability that the deferred tax assets will be 
recovered from future taxable income.

Actual results may differ from these estimates due 
to, among other factors, future changes in business 
environment, currently unknown changes in income 
tax legislation, or results from the final review of tax 
returns by tax authorities or by courts of law. For 
additional information on deferred tax assets and 
liabilities and their carrying values as of the end of 
the reporting period, see Note C10.

137Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



Impairment testing
A number of significant assumptions and estimates 
are involved when measuring value in use and fair 
value less costs of disposal based on the expected 
future discounted cash flows attributable to an asset, 
for example with respect to factors such as market 
growth rates, revenue volumes, market prices for 
telecommunication services, costs to maintain and 
develop communication networks and working cap-
ital requirements. Forecasts of future cash flows are 
based on the best estimates of future revenue and 
operating expenses using historical trends, general 
market conditions, industry trends and forecasts 
and other available information. These assumptions 
are prepared by management and subject to review 
by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
Potential significant climate related risks (as well 
as other types of risks in Telia Company’s Risk Uni-
verse) and the group’s ongoing and future mitigating 
activities are reflected in the forecasts. Climate 
related risks are considered through, for example, 
the sales growth forecasts which include offerings 
based on circular business models (e.g. pre-owned 
phones, Device as a Service and buy back initiatives 
to enable reuse and recycling) and products and 
services that enable our customers to reduce GHG 
emissions and energy use (e.g. remote meetings, IoT 
and other data-driven services). Further the EBIT-
DA-margin and CAPEX-to-sales forecasts include 
impacts of higher energy prices and Telia Company’s 
activities to manage the energy impacts and costs. 
The CAPEX-to-sales forecasts are considering that 
investment decisions are preceded by environmen-
tal screening of energy consumption, waste and 
GHG emissions, which in turn affects for example 
product and service development and network con-
struction. The group-wide re-use and recycling pro-
gram for network equipment is part of the forecasts. 

For more information on climate risks, goals and 
activities, see Directors’ Report section Risks and 
uncertainties/Environment and Sustainability report 
section Climate and circularity including the TCFD 
report in Note S4.
The cash flow forecasts are discounted at the 
weighted average cost of capital for the relevant 
cash-generating unit. For TV and Media the sales 
growth and the Adjusted EBITDA-margin develop-
ment in the forecast deviate from historical trends. 
For the forecast period the development is based 
on the effects from the ongoing simplification of the 
organization and consolidation of linear and stream-
ing content under TV4 and MTV. The CAPEX-to-
sales ratio development in the forecasts for all CGUs 
except TV and Media deviate from historical trends 
due to lower future investment levels as the peak 
of the 5G network modernization has been passed. 
For Denmark the sales growth development in the 
forecast deviates from historical trends due to the 
planned pricing activities within the mobile connec-
tivity area. For additional information on goodwill 
and it’s carrying value as of the end of the reporting 
period, see Note C12.

Provisions for pensions and  
employment contracts 
The most significant assumptions that management 
has to make in connection with the actuarial calcu-
lation of pension obligations and pension expenses 
affects the discount rate, the inflation, and the 
longevity. Changes in any of these key assumptions 
may have a significant impact on the projected ben-
efit obligations, funding requirements and periodic 
pension cost.

For additional information on assumptions made, 
sensitivity analysis related to change in assumptions 

and pension obligations and their present values as 
of the end of the reporting period, see Note C22.

Provisions for restructuring activities,  
contingent liabilities and litigation
Telia Company has engaged, and may in the future 
need to engage, in restructuring activities, which 
require management to make significant esti-
mates related to expenses for severance and other 
employee termination costs, lease cancellation, site 
dismantling and other exit costs and to realizable 
values of assets made redundant or obsolete (see 
section “Valuation of intangible and other non-cur-
rent as sets” above). Should the actual amounts 
differ from these estimates, future results could be 
materially impacted.

Determination of the treatment of contingent 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements is 
based on management’s view of the expected out-
come of the applicable contingency. Management 
consults with legal counsel on matters related to 
litigation and other experts both within and outside 
the company with respect to matters in the ordinary 
course of business.

For additional information on restructuring provi-
sions, including their carrying values as of the end 
of the reporting period, and on contingencies and 
litigation, see Notes C23 and C30, respectively.

Accounts payables under vendor  
financing arrangements
Telia Company has arrangements with several banks 
under which the banks offer Telia Company’s ven-
dors the option to receive earlier payment of Telia 
Company’s accounts payables. Vendors utilizing 
the financing arrangement pay a credit fee to the 
bank. Telia Company does not pay any credit fees 
and does not provide any additional collateral or 

guarantee to the bank. Based on Telia Company’s 
assessment the liabilities under the vendor financing 
arrangement are closely related to operating pur-
chase activities and the financing arrangement does 
not lead to any significant change in the nature or 
function of the liabilities. These liabilities are there-
fore classified as accounts payables with separate 
disclosures in the notes. The credit period does not 
exceed 12 months and the accounts payables are 
therefore not discounted. Account payables under 
vendor financing arrangements were SEK 11,413 mil-
lion per December 31, 2022 (11,001). See Note C25.

The war in Ukraine
On February 24, 2022, Russian military forces 
launched a military action against Ukraine. Telia 
Company’s operational exposure to the war in 
Ukraine including the imposed sanctions is deemed 
limited. However, the war has resulted in higher 
prices and increased volatility in the energy market 
and an overall deteriorated macroeconomic envi-
ronment, which is likely to continue, and the energy 
prices are expected to remain at a high level. The 
group’s energy costs are almost SEK 0.8 billion 
higher for 2022 on a like for like basis.

The war in Ukraine has not had any significant 
impact on Telia Company’s expected credit losses. 
Telia Company’s financial risk management is in all 
material aspects unchanged, but with additional 
focus to maintain a continued strong liquidity posi-
tion. Debt capital markets remains open to Telia 
Company, and the main funding need 12 months 
is limited. The increase in interest rates, which is 
partly related to the Ukraine war, has had a nega-
tive impact on the market value of Telia Company’s 
investment bonds, resulting in a limited negative 
effect on the finance net in 2022. See also section 
“Risks and uncertainties”

C3. Significant accounting policies

Consolidated financial statements

General – Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the 
parent company Telia Company AB and all entities 
over which Telia Company has control. The group 
controls an entity when the group is exposed to, 
or has rights to, variable returns from its involve-
ment with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. The 
existence and effect of potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible, including 
potential voting rights held by another entity, are 
considered when assessing whether an entity is 
controlled or not. Telia Company is assumed to have 
control if the group owns the majority of shares and 
the shares have equal voting rights attached, and a 
proportionate entitlement to a share of the returns 
of the entity and decisions about relevant activities 
are determined by majority votes. Telia Company 
is also assumed to have control if Telia Company 
selects the majority of the board contractually even 
if not holding the majority of the shares, see Notes 
C4 and C20, respectively.

Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisi-
tion method which measures goodwill at the  
acquisition date as: the fair value of the considera-
tion transferred; plus the amount of any non-con-
trolling interest in the acquiree recognized in the 
transaction; plus if the business combination is 

Non-controlling interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests are 
treated as equity transactions, including any trans-
action-related costs. Gains or losses on disposals as 
well as any excess or deficit of consideration paid 
over the carrying amount of non-controlling inter-
ests when acquiring additional shares in a subsidiary 
are recognized in retained earnings. Consideration 
paid for a call option or other similar contract giving 
Telia Company the right to acquire a fixed non- 
controlling interest in exchange for a fixed amount 
of cash or another financial asset is deducted from 
retained earnings.

Commitments to purchase non-controlling inter-
ests are considered financial liabilities with sub-
sequent changes in the value recognized as other 
operating income/expense. For each business com-
bination the group elects to measure any non-con-
trolling interest in a subsidiary either at fair value 
(goodwill recognized on non- controlling interest) or 
only at the proportionate share of the identifiable 
net assets (goodwill recognized only on acquired 
interest).

Joint arrangements
Joint arrangements are entities over which the 
group has joint control by virtue of contractual  
arrangements. Joint arrangements are classified as 
either joint operations or joint ventures. Joint oper-
ations are arrangements whereby Telia Company 

achieved in stages, the fair value of the previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree; less the net rec-
ognized amount of the identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. When the difference is neg-
ative, a bargain purchase gain would be recognized 
in net income. Costs related to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred.

Any contingent consideration payable would be 
recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. If the 
contingent consideration would be classified as  
equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is 
accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consid-
eration are recognized in net income. Acquisition 
of additional shares in a subsidiary after obtaining 
control as well as a partial disposal of shares in a 
subsidiary while retaining control are accounted 
for as equity transactions with owners. See section 
“Non-controlling interests” below.

Assets (including any goodwill and fair value 
adjustments) and liabilities for entities acquired or 
divested during the year are included in the consol-
idated financial statements from the date on which 
control is obtained and excluded from the date on 
which control is lost.

Intra-group sales and other transactions have 
been eliminated in the consolidated financial state-
ments. Profits and losses resulting from intra-group 
transactions are eliminated unless a loss indicates 
impairment.

bilities and accounts for its share of the assets, lia-
bilities, revenue and expenses of the joint operation

The joint operations are primarily designed for pro-
viding output to the shareholders.

Joint ventures on the other hand are arrange-
ments where Telia Company has right to the net 
assets of the arrangement and the investment is 
accounted for under the equity method (similar to 
associated companies - see section below). Joint  
arrangements acquired or divested during the year 
are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date on which joint control is obtained and 
excluded from the date on which joint control is lost.

Associated companies
Associated companies are entities over which the 
group has significant influence but not control. If  
the group holds, directly or indirectly (e.g. through 
subsidiaries), 20% or more of the voting  
power of the investee, it is presumed that the group 
has significant influence, unless it can be clearly 
demonstrated that this is not the case. Holdings in 
associated companies are accounted for using the 
equity method and are initially recognized at cost, 
including any transaction costs. The group’s share of 
net income in associated companies is included in 
operating income because the operations of these 
companies are related to telecommunications and 

139Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



it is the group’s strategy to capitalize on industry 
know- how by means of investing in partly owned 
operations. The share of net income is based on 
the entity’s most recent accounts, adjusted for any 
discrepancies in accounting policies, and with esti-
mated adjustments for significant events and trans-
actions up to Telia Company’s close of books.

The line item Income from associated companies 
and joint ventures also includes amortization of fair 
value adjustments and other consolidation adjust-
ments made upon the acquisition of associated 
companies as well as any subsequent impairment 
losses on goodwill and other intangible assets, and 
capital gains and losses on disposals of stakes in 
such companies. Telia Company’s share of any gains 
or losses resulting from transactions with associated 
companies is eliminated. When selling a subsidiary 
to an associated company transaction gain or loss is 
recognized in full without any eliminiation.

Dividend received reduces the carrying amount 
of an investment. Negative equity participations in 
associated companies are recognized only to the 
extent contractual obligations to contribute addi-
tional capital exist and are then recorded as Other 
provisions.

The group’s share of associated entities equity 
transactions such as the acquisition or sale of treas-
ury shares from third parties are recognized directly 
in equity.

Cash flow reporting
Cash flows from operating activities are reported 
using the indirect method and include dividends 
received from associated companies and other 
equity instruments, interest paid or received (except 
for paid interest capitalized as part of the acquisition 
or construction of non-current assets and therefore 
included in cash flows from investing activities), pro-
visions, compensation from or contributions to the 

Swedish pension fund and taxes paid or refunded. 
Changes in non-interest bearing receivables and 
liabilities are reported in working capital. Terminal 
financing receivables are also included in working 
capital. Cash flow from operating activities also 
includes cash flows from film and program rights.

Cash flows from investing activities include 
CAPEX, payments to acquire or receipts from 
the sale of joint ventures, associates, subsidiaries 
(obtaining or losing control) net of cash and cash 
equivalents acquired or disposed of and other 
equity instruments. Further, cash flows from invest-
ing activities include payments related to lease 
receivables, as well as other investments with matur-
ities over 3 months.

Cash flows from financing activities include divi-
dends paid to owners of the parent and to holders 
of non-controlling interests, payments and receipts 
from changes in ownership of non-controlling 
interest and cash flows from settlement of foreign 
exchange derivative contracts used for economic 
hedges of cash-pool balances including any pay-
ments or receipts from CSA (Credit Support Annex).

Proceeds from and repayment of borrowings 
include cash flows from derivatives hedging such 
borrowings. Further, cash flow from financing activi-
ties also includes repayments of lease liabilities.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand, 
bank deposits and highly-liquid short-term invest-
ments with maturities up to and including 3 months.

Cash flows of a foreign entity are translated at 
the average exchange rate for the reporting period, 
except for certain transactions like dividends from 
associates, dividends paid to holders of non-con-
trolling interests, acquisitions or disposals of subsid-
iaries and associated companies, and other major 
non-recurring transactions which are translated at 
the rate prevailing on the transaction day.

Segment reporting
The group’s businesses are managed and reported 
by the seven operating segments: Sweden, Finland, 
Norway, Denmark, Lithuania, Estonia and TV and 
Media. Operating segments that are not individually 
reportable: Latvia and Group functions are com-
bined into Other operations. For additional informa-
tion, see Note C5. Segments are consolidated based 
on the same accounting principles as for the group 
as a whole except for inter-segment leases which 
are treated as operating leases. When significant 
operations are transferred between  segments, com-
parative period figures are restated.

Foreign currency translation and  
inflation adjustments
Currency translation is based on market rates with 
information from major market providers and are 
fixed daily.

Separate financial statements of a group entity  
are presented in the entity’s functional currency, 
being the currency of the primary economic envi-
ronment in which the entity operates, normally the 
local currency. In preparing the financial statements, 
foreign currency transactions are translated at the 
exchange rates prevailing at the date of each trans-
action. At the end of each reporting period, monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign curren-
cies are translated at the closing rates existing at that 
date. Exchange rate differences arising from operat-
ing receivables or liabilities are recognized in operat-
ing income, while differences attributable to financial 
assets or liabilities are recognized in finance items.

Exchange rate differences on equity instruments 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income and on cash flow hedges are recognized in 
other comprehensive income.

The consolidated financial statements are pre-
sented in Swedish krona (SEK), which is the functional 
currency of the parent company. For consolidation 
purposes, income and expenses of foreign oper-
ations (subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated 
companies, and branch offices) are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period.

However, for items related to dividends, gains 
or losses on disposal of operations or other major 
transactions or if exchange rates fluctuated sig-
nificantly during the period, the exchange rates at 
the date of the transactions are used. Assets and 
liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjust-
ments arising on acquisition of foreign operations, 
are translated at closing rates at the end of the 
reporting period except for equity components, 
which are translated at historical rates. Translation 
differences are recognized in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity attributable to 
owners of the parent or to non-controlling interests, 
as appropriate.

When a foreign operation is disposed, any related 
cumulative exchange rate difference is recycled to 
net income as part of the gain or loss on the dis-
posal, except for accumulated exchange rate differ-
ences related to non-controlling interests which are 
derecognized but not recycled to net income. How-
ever, if Telia Company would dispose a non-con-
trolling interest in a foreign operation while retaining 
control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative 
amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests.

Revenue recognition
Revenue principally consist of mobile service 
revenue including subscription, interconnect and 
roaming and fixed service revenue including teleph-
ony, broadband, TV, installation fees, and business 

140Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



solutions, as well as advertising revenue, revenue 
from equipment sales and leases. There is both 
revenue from products and services sold separately 
and from products and services sold as a bundle.

Revenue is recognized based on a single prin-
ciple based five-step model which is applied to all 
contracts with customers. Revenue is allocated to 
performance obligations (equipment and services) 
in proportion to stand-alone selling prices of the 
individual items. Revenue is recognized when (at a 
point in time) or as (over a period of time) the per-
formance obligations are satisfied, which is deter-
mined by the manner in which control passes to the 
customer.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration 
specified in a contract with a customer and excludes 
amount collected on behalf of third parties. The 
consideration promised in a contract with a cus-
tomer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts 
or both. For variable consideration accumulated 
experience is used to estimate and provide for the 
variable consideration, and revenue are only recog-
nized to the extent that it is highly probable that a 
significant reversal will not occur.
 
Service revenue
Service revenue is recognized over time, in the 
period in which the service is performed, based on 
actual traffic or over the contract term, as applicable. 
Revenue from voice and data services is recognized 
when the services are used by the customer. Sub-
scription fees are recognized as revenue over the 
subscription period. Sales relating to prepaid phone 
cards, primarily mobile, are deferred as a contract 
liability and recognized as revenue based on the 
actual usage of the cards.

Revenue from interconnect traffic with other  
telecom operators is recognized at the time of tran-
sit across Telia Company’s network.

Installation services are in many cases considered 
separate performance obligations and revenue is 
recognized when or as the obligation is satisfied, 
depending on the type of installation service and 
how and when the control is transferred to the 
customer.

For open access fiber installed at customer’s 
premises, non-refundable customer fees and related 
installation costs, including planning, trenching, 
cabling, splicing, mounting, connection, cross-con-
nect equipment and media converter, are recognized 
when the installation is finalized. Connection fees are 
recognized separately at completion of connection, 
if the fees do not include any amount for subse-
quent servicing but only cover the connection costs. 
Amounts for subsequent servicing are deferred.

To corporate customers, Telia Company offers 
complex, long-term functional service agreements 
which could include telecom and datacom sub-
scription services, installation services related to 
telecom or datacom and other customized services. 
Typically, telecom and datacom services are con-
sidered separate performance obligations. Revenue 
for each separate performance obligation is recog-
nized over the period of time that the subscription 
service is provided, and the performance obligation 
is satisfied. Since the subscription services in a 
functional agreement are performed on a monthly 
basis over the same period, these services are in 
practice accounted for in the same way as if they 
had been one performance obligation. Installation 
services in functional agreements are in most cases 
considered separate performance obligations and 

revenue is recognized when or as the obligation 
is satisfied, depending on the type of installation 
service and how and when control is transferred to 
the customer. For many of the installation services 
the control is transferred, and revenue is recognized 
upon completion of the installation. Functional 
agreements often also include equipment, see 
below. In functional agreements there are often also 
variable usage-based services and add on services. 
Each one of these services are considered separate 
performance obligations. Revenue for usage-based 
services is recognized over the period the service 
is used as the obligation is satisfied and control is 
transferred over time. Revenue for add on services 
is recognized when or as the obligation is satisfied, 
depending on the type of add on service and how 
and when control is transferred to the customer.

Invoices for mobile subscriptions, broadband, 
fixed  telephony and other services are normally paid 
monthly, over the contract period.

Equipment revenue
Revenue from equipment sales is recognized at 
the point in time when control is transferred to the 
customer, which normally is on delivery and when 
accepted by the customer. If the customer has the 
right to return the equipment, the amount of rev-
enue recognized is adjusted for expected returns, 
estimated based on historical data. Equipment is 
paid for upfront or over time, when Telia Company 
provides the customer with financing.

Functional agreements with corporate customers 
often include equipment such as sales or financial 
leases of for example terminals (phones/tablets/
LAN equipment etc.). The equipment is considered 
separate performance obligations and revenue 

from sale of equipment is recognized at the point in 
time when the performance obligation is satisfied, 
and control has been transferred (when the equip-
ment have been delivered). When the equipment is 
leased to the customer, the lease is usually classified 
as a finance lease and the finance lease revenue is 
recognized in accordance with IFRS 16. 

Advertising revenue
The performance obligation for advertising is satis-
fied when the advertisement is actually shown, pub-
lished or displayed and the revenue is recognized at 
that time. The revenue is reduced for rebates.

Bundled services and products
Telia Company may bundle services and products 
into one customer offering. Offerings may involve 
the delivery or performance of multiple products, 
services, or rights to use assets (multiple delivera-
bles). Telia Company accounts for each individual 
product and service separately if they are distinct 
– i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable 
from other items in the bundled package and if a 
customer can benefit from it. When the transac-
tion price is determined for bundles that includes 
services (e.g. a mobile subscription), the minimum 
non-cancellable contract term is considered. When 
applicable, the transaction price is adjusted for 
financing components and expected returns. There 
are usually no or few other variable components 
in the transaction price. The transaction price is 
allocated to each equipment and service accounted 
for as a separate performance obligation, based on 
their relative stand-alone selling price. For most per-
formance obligations, the stand- alone selling prices 
are directly observable. If stand-alone selling prices 

141Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



are not directly observable, they are estimated 
based on expected cost plus margin. In some cases, 
the offerings include non-refundable upfront fees 
such as activation fees. Payments for such fees are 
included in the transaction price, and, if not related 
to the satisfaction of a performance obligation, allo-
cated to other performance obligations identified in 
the contract.

Some bundled offerings include lease compo-
nents, e.g. TV boxes, as well as non-lease compo-
nents, e.g. subscription. In those arrangements, the 
transaction price is allocated to both the lease com-
ponents and non-lease components identified as 
separate performance obligations. The lease com-
ponents are then accounted for as either an operat-
ing lease or a finance lease depending on the lease 
classification (see also section “lease agreements, 
Telia Company as a lessor” below). Revenue for the 
non- lease components are recognized when or as 
the performance obligations are satisfied.

Equipment that can be used only in connection 
with services provided by Telia Company and that 
have no other significant function for the customer 
than delivering the service, e.g. routers, is not 
accounted for as a separate performance obliga-
tion. In such arrangements, the transaction price is 
allocated to the performance obligations identified, 
i.e. no part of the transaction price is allocated to 
the equipment. Any consideration received upfront, 
when the equipment is delivered, is recognized as 
a contract liability and recognized as revenue when 
or as the identified performance obligations are 
satisfied.

If a contract with a customer includes a license 
that is distinct, the promise to grant a license is 
classified as either a “right to access” or a “right to 
use” Telia Company’s intellectual property. A license 
is classified as a “right to access” if Telia Company 

will undertake activities that significantly affects the 
intellectual property, that do not result in the trans-
fer of a separate performance obligation to the cus-
tomer, and, the customer is directly exposed to any 
positive or negative effects of those activities. When 
the promise to grant a license is classified as a ”right 
to access”, revenue are recognized over time. When 
the promise to grant a license is classified as a “right 
to use”, revenue are recognized at the point in time 
when control is transferred to the customer.

Principal or agent
Sometimes a third party is engaged in delivering 
goods or services to Telia Company’s customers, e.g. 
Telia Company offers several value-added services 
(VAS) to the customers in bundled offers.

In arrangements where Telia Company acts as a 
principal, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. 
When Telia Company acts as an agent and arranges 
goods or services to be provided by another party, 
revenue is recognized as the net amount of consid-
eration that Telia Company retains after paying that 
other party. When invoicing end-customers for third-
party content services, amounts collected on behalf 
of the principal are excluded from revenue. For more 
information see to Note C2.

Other revenue related transactions
Under customer loyalty programs, customers are 
entitled to certain discounts (award credits) relating 
to services and goods provided by Telia Company. 
The loyalty program provides the customers with a 
material right which is accounted for as a separate 
performance obligation. The transaction prices are 
allocated between the services and goods provided, 
and the award credits based on relative stand-alone 
selling prices. The stand-alone selling price for the 
award credits is estimated based on the discount 

grant- ed when the award credit is redeemed and 
the likelihood of redemption, which is based on past 
practice. A contract liability is recognized until the 
award credits are redeemed or expire.

Some contracts contain a financing component 
because the timing of payments provides the cus-
tomer or Telia Company with a benefit of financing. 
When determining the transaction price for such 
agreements, Telia Company adjusts the promised 
amount of consideration for the effects of the time 
value of money. Telia Company uses the practical 
expedient to not calculate and account for signif-
icant financing component if the period between 
the transfer of a good or service to a customer and 
payment is 12 months or less.

Telia Company distinguishes between contract 
assets and receivables based on whether receipt of 
the consideration is conditional on something other 
than passage of time. Contract assets primarily 
relate to transactions where Telia Company satisfies 
a performance obligation to transfer equipment that 
is part of a bundles to the customer, but the right to 
payment for the equipment is dependent on Telia 
Company satisfying another performance obligation 
in the contract, for example a mobile subscription. 
The contract assets are transferred to receivables 
when the right becomes unconditional, i.e. when 
only the passage of time is required before payment 
of consideration is due. Contract liabilities primarily 
relate to prepayments received from customers such 
as prepaid cards, prepaid subscriptions, loyalty pro-
grams and variable considerations.

If expected to be recovered, sales commissions 
and equipment subsidies granted to dealers for 
obtaining a specific contract are capitalized and 
deferred over the period which Telia Company 
expects to provide services to the customer. The 
asset (included in balance sheet line item Other 

non-current assets) is amortized on a straight-line 
basis. The amortization is classified as an operating 
expense (within EBITDA) in the income statement. 
Telia Company applies the practical expedient to 
recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a con-
tract as an expense when incurred, if the amortiza-
tion period of the asset is one year or less.

Operating expenses
Telia Company presents its analysis of expenses 
using a classification based on function. Cost of 
sales comprises all costs for services and products 
sold as well as for installation, maintenance, service, 
and support. Selling and marketing expenses com-
prise all costs for selling and marketing services and 
products and includes expenses for advertising, PR, 
pricelists, commission fees, credit information, debt 
collection, etc. Credit losses as well as allowances 
for credit losses are also included. Recovery of 
receivables written-off in prior years is included in 
Other operating income. Research and development 
expenses (R&D) include expenses for developing 
new or substantially improving already existing ser-
vices, products, processes or systems. Maintenance 
and minor adjustments to already existing services, 
products, processes or systems are not included in 
R&D. Expenses that are related to specific customer 
orders (customization) are included in Cost of sales. 
Amortization, depreciation and impairment losses 
are included in each function to the extent referring 
to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment 
or right- of-use assets used for that function. Amor-
tization of film and program rights is included in the 
function Cost of sales. Amortization of cost to obtain 
a contract is included in the function Selling and 
marketing expenses.

Advertising and other marketing costs are  
expensed as incurred. All pension benefit costs 

142Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



except for the interest component are recognized 
as personnel expenses. For equity-settled share-
based payments to employees, such as Telia Com-
pany’s Performance Share Programs, cost, being 
the fair value at the allotment date of the equity 
instruments allotted, is recognized as personnel 
expenses allocated over the vesting period and with 
a corresponding increase in equity. Cost is based on 
the best available estimate of the number of equity 
instruments to vest. If necessary, the estimate is 
revised during the vesting period and finally revised 
at the end of the vesting period.

Other operating income and expenses
Other operating income and other operating 
expenses include gains and losses, respectively, 
on disposal of shares or operations in subsidiaries 
(see section “Associated companies” above) and on 
disposal of intangible assets or property, plant and 
equipment.

Also included in other operating income and 
expenses are impairment losses of goodwill, govern-
ment grants, exchange rate differences on operating 
transactions, results from court-settled disputes with 
other operators regarding historical interconnect 
and roaming fees, restructuring costs and other sim-
ilar items. Government grants are initially measured 
at fair value and recognized as income over the peri-
ods necessary to match them with the related costs.

Exchange rate differences from operating trans-
actions also include effects from economic hedges 
and value changes in derivatives hedging opera-
tional transaction exposure (see section “Derivatives 
and hedge accounting” below).

Finance income and finance costs
Interest income and expenses are recognized as 
incurred, using the effective interest rate method, 
with the exception of borrowing costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of an asset, which are capitalized as part 
of the cost of that asset (see also section “Intangible 
assets, and property, plant and equipment” below). 
Increases in provisions due to passage of time and 
interest on lease liabilities are recognized as interest 
expenses.

Interest income and expenses also include 
changes in fair value of the interest component 
of cross-currency interest rate swaps as well as 
changes in fair value of interest rate swaps. The 
initial difference between nominal value and net 
present value of borrowings with an interest rate dif-
ferent to market rate (“day 1 gain”) is amortized until 
due date and recognized as Other interest income. 
The interest component of changes in the fair value 
of borrowings identified as hedged items in fair 
value hedges and of derivatives hedging loans and 
borrowings (see section “Derivatives and hedge 
accounting” below) are included in Other interest 
income (gains) or in Interest expenses (losses). 
Exchange rate differences on financial transactions 
also comprise changes in fair value of the currency 
component of cross-currency interest rate swaps 
and of forward contracts hedging currency risks in 
external borrowings.

Dividend income from equity investments is rec-
ognized when Telia Company’s rights to receive pay-
ment have been established. Income and expenses 
relating to guarantee commissions are included in 
Other interest income and Interest expenses, respec-
tively. Interest expenses include funding- related 
bank fees and fees to rating institutions and market 

makers. Further the net interest on the net defined 
benefit liability (asset) is recognized as part of 
finance costs.

Income taxes
Income taxes comprise current and deferred tax. 
Current and deferred income taxes are recognized 
in net income or in other comprehensive income, 
to the extent relating to items recognized in other 
comprehensive income. Deferred income taxes are 
provided in full, using the balance sheet liability 
method, on temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their car-
rying values in the consolidated financial statements 
and on unutilized tax deductions or losses. Where a 
subsidiary has a history of tax losses, Telia Company 
recognizes a deferred tax asset only to the extent 
that the subsidiary has sufficient taxable temporary 
differences or there is convincing other evidence 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available.

On initial recognition of assets and liabilities, 
deferred taxes are not recognized on temporary 
differences in transactions that are not business 
combinations. Deferred tax liabilities for undistrib-
uted earnings or temporary differences related to 
investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and asso-
ciated companies are not recognized because such 
retained earnings can be withdrawn as non-taxable 
dividends and the companies can be sold without 
tax consequences. In certain countries such as Lat-
via and Estonia, income tax is levied on dividends 
paid or declared. For these countries deferred tax is 
recognized on undistributed earnings and current 
tax is recognized in the period when distributions 
are made. Current and deferred income tax is deter-
mined using tax rates and tax legislation that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the end 

of the reporting period and in the case of deferred 
tax that are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset or liability is settled. 
Effects of changes in tax rates are recognized in the 
period when the change is substantively enacted. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent 
that the ability of utilizing the tax asset is probable. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when a 
legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current income tax liabilities and the 
deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and 
the same taxation authority.

Interest on current tax payable or refundable 
calculated by tax authorities is classified as Interest 
expenses and Other interest income, respectively.

Intangible assets, and property,  
plant and equipment

Measurement bases
Goodwill is measured, after initial recognition, at 
cost, less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impair-
ment at least annually. Impairment losses are not 
reversed. Based on management analysis, goodwill 
arising from a business combination is for impair-
ment testing purposes allocated to the groups of 
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Each group 
represents the lowest level at which goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes and it 
is never larger than an operating segment.

Other intangible assets are measured at cost, 
including directly attributable borrowing costs, less 
accumulated amortization and any impairment losses. 
Direct external and internal development expenses 
for new or substantially improved products and 

143Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



processes are capitalized, provided that future eco-
nomic benefits are probable, costs can be measured 
reliably and the product and process is technically 
and commercially feasible. Activities in projects at the 
feasibility study stage as well as maintenance and 
training activities are expensed as incurred.

Intangible assets acquired in a business com-
bination are identified and recognized separately 
from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an 
intangible asset and their fair values can be meas-
ured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets is 
their fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in 
a business combination are measured on the same 
basis as intangible assets acquired separately. 
Property, plant and equipment are measured at 
cost, including directly attributable borrowing costs, 
less accumulated depreciation and any impairment 
losses. Software used in the production process 
is considered to be an integral part of the related 
hardware and is capitalized as plant and machinery.

Property and plant under construction are valued 
at the expense already incurred, including interest 
during the installation period. To the extent a legal 
or constructive obligation to a third party exists, the 
acquisition cost includes estimated costs of disman-
tling and removing the asset and restoring the site. 
The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying 
value of the item if it is probable that the future eco-
nomic benefits embodied within the item will flow 
to Telia Company and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. All other replacement costs are 
expensed as incurred. A change in estimated  
expenditures for dismantling, removal and restora-
tion is added to and/or deducted from the carrying 
value of the related asset. To the extent that the 

change would result in a negative carrying value, 
this effect is recognized in net income. The change 
in depreciation charge is recognized prospectively.

Capitalized interest is calculated, based on 
the group’s estimated average cost of borrowing. 
However, actual borrowing costs are capitalized if 
individually identifiable, such as interest paid on 
construction loans for buildings.

Government grants received as compensation 
for the cost of an asset are initially measured at fair 
value, normally being the consideration received. A 
government grant reduces the carrying value of the 
related asset and the depreciation charge recog-
nized over the asset’s useful life.

Amortization and depreciation
Amortization of intangible assets (other than good-
will and trade names with indefinite useful lives) and 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment are 
based on cost, less residual values, and taking into 
account the estimated useful lives of various asset 
classes or individual assets. Land is not depreciated. 
For assets acquired during a year, amortization and 
depreciation are calculated from the date of acqui-
sition. Amortization and depreciation are mainly 
recognized on a straight-line basis.

Mobile and fixed telecommunication licenses 
to operate a specific network are regarded as 
integral to the network and amortization does not 
commence until the related network is ready for 
use. Amortization of network-independent licenses 
to use specific radio frequencies (spectrum) com-
mences when the related frequency block is avail-
able for use. License fees based on future services, 
i.e. relating to the ongoing performance of the entity 
are not capitalized but expensed as incurred.

Impairment testing
Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite 
useful lives and intangible assets not yet available 
for use are tested for impairment annually, and 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may 
be impaired. Intangible assets with a finite life and 
tangible assets are tested for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recovera-
ble amount of an individual asset, the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs is tested for impairment. If an analysis 
indicates that the carrying value is higher than its 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use, an impair-
ment loss is recognized for the amount by which the 
carrying amounts exceed the recoverable amount.

Value in use is measured based on the expected 
future discounted cash flows (DCF model) attributa-
ble to the  asset.

Film and program rights
Film and program right assets and related liabilities 
are recognized in the statement of financial position 
when the license period begins, the cost can be 
measured reliably, the content has been accepted 
by the group in accordance with the license agree-
ment and the film or program is available for its first 
showing/broadcasting. The assets are presented in 
separate line items for non-current and current film 
and program rights in the consolidated statement of 
financial position. Film and program rights are rec-
ognized at cost less accumulated amortization and 
any impairments. Future payment commitments for 
contractual film and program rights not recognized 
in the statement of financial position are disclosed 

as contractual commitments. Film and program 
rights are amortized over the useful life which is 
based on the license period or number of showings. 
Amortization of film and program rights is included 
in the function Cost of sales and is classified as 
operating expenses within EBITDA. Cash flows relat-
ing to program rights are classified within operating 
activities.
 
Financial instruments

Classification of financial assets
A financial asset is for measurement purposes ini-
tially classified into one of three measurement cate-
gories. The classification depends on how the asset 
is managed (business model) and the characteristics 
of the asset’s contractual cash flows. The measure-
ment categories for financial assets are as follows:
• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 

(FVTPL)
• Financial assets at fair value through other 

comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
• Financial assets at amortized cost

A financial asset is measured at amortized cost (AC) 
if both of the following conditions are met:
• The financial asset is held within a business model 

whose objective is to realize the cash flows from 
the financial assets by holding the financial assets 
and collecting its contractual cash flows over the 
life of the assets and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding

144Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



A financial asset is measured at Fair Value through 
Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) if both of 
the following conditions are met:
• The financial asset is held within a business 

model whose objective is to realize the cash flows 
from the financial assets both by collecting the 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets 
and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding

A financial asset is measured at Fair Value through 
Profit or Loss (FVTPL) unless it is measured at amor-
tized cost or at fair value through other comprehen-
sive income.

Equity instruments and derivative instruments 
do not give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding and are there-
fore measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
However, for equity instruments that are not held-
for-trading, there is an irrevocable option that can 
be made on initial recognition to present changes 
in the fair value in other comprehensive income. 
This is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Amounts presented in other comprehensive income 
are not subsequently transferred to profit or loss.

Telia Company makes an assessment of the 
objective of the business model in which a financial 
asset is held at a portfolio level, because this best 
reflects the way the business is managed and infor-
mation is provided to management. The information 
considered includes:
• The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio 

and the operation of those policies in practice
• How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated 

and reported to management of Telia Company

income and for contract assets. The loss allowance 
is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected 
credit losses, except for the following, for which the 
loss allowance is measured at an amount of twelve 
months expected credit losses:
• Financial assets that are determined to have low 

credit risk at the reporting date
• Financial assets for which the credit risk has not in- 

creased significantly since initial recognition

The loss allowance for trade receivables and con-
tract assets is always measured at an amount equal 
to lifetime expected losses applying the simplified 
approach in IFRS 9. The general model is applied for 
all other financial assets.

When determining whether the credit risk of a 
financial asset has increased significantly since 
initial recognition and when estimating expected 
credit losses, the group considers reasonable and 
supportable information that is relevant and availa-
ble without undue cost or effort.

Expected credit losses are probability-weighted 
estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured 
as the present value of all cash shortfalls, i.e. the 
difference between the cash flows due to the entity 
in accordance with the contract and the cash flows 
that the group expects to receive.

• The risks that affect the performance of the 
business model and how those risks are managed

• How managers of the business are compensated
• The frequency, volume and timing of sales of 

financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for 
such sales and expectations about future sales 
activity

Transaction costs
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially 
recognized at fair value plus transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of the financial asset or financial liability. However, 
transaction costs related to assets or liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss are expensed as 
incurred.

Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is derecognized when Telia Company has 
transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset and has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or has transferred control 
of the asset. A financial liability is derecognized 
when the obligation under the liability is discharged 
or canceled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender 
on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated as a derecogni-
tion of the original liability and the recognition of a 
new liability, and the difference between the carry-
ing amounts is recognized in net income.

Impairment
A loss allowance is recognized for financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and, financial assets 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive 

145Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



Fair value hierarchy levels
The carrying values of classes of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are determined based 
on a three-level fair value hierarchy, as follows.

Fair value estimation
The fair values of financial instruments traded in 
active markets are based on quoted market prices at 
the end of the reporting period. For financial assets, 
the current bid price is used. The fair values of finan-
cial instruments that are not traded in active markets 
are determined by using valuation techniques. 
Management uses a variety of methods and makes 
assumptions that are based on market conditions 
existing at the end of the reporting period.

Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar 
instruments are used for long-term debt. Other tech-
niques, such as estimated discounted cash flows 
(DCF analyses), are used to determine fair value for 
the remaining financial instruments. DCF analyses 
are performed using the applicable yield curve for 
the duration of the instruments for non-optional 

derivatives, and option pricing models for optional 
derivatives. Forward exchange contracts are meas-
ured using quoted forward exchange rates and 
yield- curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate 
swaps are measured at the present value of future 
cash flows, estimated and discounted based on the 
applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates.

The carrying value less impairment provision 
of trade receivables and the carrying values of 
payables are assumed for disclosure purposes to 
approximate their fair values. The fair value of finan-
cial liabilities is for disclosure purposes estimated 
by discounting the future contractual cash flows 
at the current market interest rate that is available 
for similar financial instruments with adjustment

for credit purposes based on known credit spreads 
from exchange traded Telia Company bonds. The 
fair value of loans and receivables is for disclosure 
purposes estimated by discounting the future con-
tractual cash flows at the current market interest 
rate that is available for similar financial instruments 
with adjustment for credit purposes based on known 
credit spreads, where available and if not available, 
individual estimates.

Current/non-current distinction, offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities maturing more than 
one year from the end of the reporting period are 
considered to be non-current. Other financial assets 
and liabilities are recognized as current.

Financial assets are recognized and derecognized 
applying settlement date accounting. Financial lia-
bilities are recognized when Telia Company receives 
payment from the counterparty and are derecog-
nized when the obligation specified in the contract 
is discharged or cancelled or expires.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset only if 
there is an enforceable legal right to offset the rec-
ognized amounts and there is an intention to settle 
on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.

Financial assets – measurement
Equity instruments are measured at fair value. Unre-
alized gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value up to the date of sale are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair 
value reserve. Quoted equity instruments are valued 
at quoted market price. Telia Company’s primary val-
uation technique for unquoted equity instruments is 
based on the most recent transaction for the specific 
company if such transaction has been recently done. 
Adjustments to the carrying value is made to reflect 

significant changes in circumstances since the trans-
action date if Telia Company assess that the change 
will have a material impact on the fair value. The 
estimated fair value for material unquoted equity 
instruments is verified by applying other valuation 
models in the form of valuation multiples from peers 
on relevant financial and operational metrics.

Holdings in venture capital entities are measured 
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized 
in net income. Bonds are measured at fair value 
(quoted market prices) with changes in fair value 
recognized through profit and loss or other com-
prehensive income. Receivables arising from own 
lending, except for short-term receivables where the 
interest effect is immaterial, are measured at amor-
tized cost, using the effective interest rate method, 
less impairment. An impairment loss on receivables 
from own lending is calculated as the difference 
between the carrying amount and the present value 
of the estimated future cash flow discounted at the 
original effective interest rate.

Short-term investments with maturities over 3 
months comprise bank deposits, commercial papers 
issued by banks, bonds and investments. Cash and 
cash equivalents include cash at hand and bank 
deposits as well as highly-liquid short-term invest-
ments with maturities up to and including 3 months, 
such as commercial papers issued by banks. All 
instruments are initially measured at fair value and 
subsequently at either fair value through other com-
prehensive income or at amortized cost.

Financial liabilities – measurement
Financial liabilities (interest-bearing loans and bor-
rowings), except for short-term liabilities where the 
interest effect is immaterial, are initially recognized 
at fair value and subsequently measured at amor-
tized cost, using the effective interest rate method. 

146Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



Liabilities that are hedged against changes in fair 
value are, however, measured at hedged fair value. 
Any difference between the proceeds (net of trans-
action costs) and the settlement or redemption of 
borrowings is recognized over the term of the loan 
or borrowings. Borrowings with an interest rate 
different to market rate are initially measured at fair 
value, being the net present value applying the mar-
ket interest rate. The difference between the nominal 
value and the net present value is amortized until 
due date.

Financial guarantee liabilities are contracts that 
require a payment to be made to reimburse the 
 holder for a loss it incurs because the specified 
debtor fails to make a payment when due in accord-
ance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial 
guarantee  contracts are recognized initially as a 
liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the issue of the 
guarantee.

The financial guarantee is subsequently  measured 
at the higher of the allowance calculated at the 
end of the reporting period and the amount initially 
recognized.

Trade receivables and trade payables 
– measurement 
Trade receivables are initially recognized at fair 
value, normally being the invoiced amount, and sub-
sequently carried at invoiced amount less allowance 
for expected credit losses, which equals amortized 
cost since the terms are generally 30 days and 
the impact of discount would be immaterial. An 
estimate of the amount of allowance for expected 
credit losses is recognized and reduces the carrying 
amount of the trade receivables. An impairment loss 
on trade receivables is calculated as the difference 
between the carrying amount and the present value 

of the estimated future cash flow. Bad debts are 
written-off when identified and charged to Selling 
and marketing expenses. Accrued trade receiva-
bles are recognized at the amounts expected to be 
billable.

Trade payables are initially recognized at fair 
value, normally being the invoiced amounts, and 
subsequently measured at invoiced amounts, which 
equals amortized cost, using the effective interest 
rate method, since generally the payments terms 
are such that the impact of discounting would be 
immaterial.

Accounts payable under vendor financing 
arrangements are closely related to operating pur-
chase activities and the financing arrangement does 
not lead to any significant change in the nature or 
function of the liabilities. These liabilities are there-
fore classified as accounts payables, but are spec-
ified in the disclosures. The credit period does not 
exceed 12 months and the accounts payables are 
therefore not discounted.

Derivatives and hedge accounting – 
measurement and classification
Telia Company uses derivative instruments, such 
as interest and cross-currency interest rate swaps, 
forward contracts and options, primarily to control 
exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and 
interest rates. For hedging of net investments in for-
eign operations, Telia Company also uses financial 
liabilities.

Derivatives and embedded derivatives, when 
their economic characteristics and risks are not 
clearly and closely related to other characteristics of 
the host contract, are recognized at fair value. Deriv-
atives with a positive fair value are recognized as 
non-current or current receivables and derivatives 
with a negative fair value as non-current or current 

liabilities. Swaps, forward exchange contracts and 
options are classified as non-interest-bearing and 
interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate 
swaps as interest-bearing items. For classification in 
the statement of comprehensive income, see sec-
tions “Other operating income and expenses” and 
“Finance costs and other financial items” above.

Hedging instruments are designated as hedges 
in economic hedges, see below or in either fair 
value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations. Hedges of foreign 
exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted 
for as cash flow hedges. Documentation on hedges 
includes: the economic relationship between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item; risk man-
agement objectives and strategy for undertaking 
various hedge transactions; and an effectiveness 
assessment. For fair value hedges, the effective and 
ineffective portions of the change in fair value of the 
derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged 
item attributable to the risk being hedged, are rec-
ognized in net income.

Hedge accounting is not applied to derivative 
instruments that economically hedge monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign curren-
cies (economic hedges) or that are initiated in order 
to manage e.g. the overall interest rate duration 
of the debt portfolio. Changes in the fair value of 
economic hedges are recognized in net income as 
exchange rate differences, offsetting the exchange 
rate differences on monetary assets and liabilities. 
Changes in the fair value of portfolio management 
derivatives are recognized in net income as Finance 
costs.

For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the 
change in fair value of the derivative is recognized 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the hedge reserve in equity until the underlying 

transaction is reflected in net income, at which time 
any deferred hedging gains or losses are recycled to 
net income. The ineffective portion of the change in 
fair value of a derivative used as a cash flow hedge 
is recognized in net income. However, when the 
hedged forecast transaction results in the recogni-
tion of a non-financial asset or liability, the gains and 
losses are included in the initial measurement of the 
cost of the asset or liability.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to 
the effective portion of the hedge is recognized in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognized in net income. Gains and losses deferred 
in the foreign currency translation reserve are 
recycled to net income on disposal of the foreign 
operation. Changes in the fair value of derivative 
instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting are recognized in net income.

When the forward element of a forward contract 
or the foreign currency basis spread is excluded from 
the hedging relationship, the change in fair value of 
the excluded portion is accounted for as a cost of 
hedging. The change in fair value of the excluded 
portion is recognized in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in a separate component of equity.

Repurchase agreements
Repurchase agreements, means that the parties 
have agreed on sale and repurchase of a certain 
security, at a predetermined price and point in time. 
Since the group remains exposed to the risk and 
rewards of the asset during the transaction period, 
securities remain accounted for in the balance sheet 
as financial assets. Received cash is accounted for 

147Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



as financial liabilities. Sold securities are also dis-
closed as pledged assets.

Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net 
realizable value. Costs, including an appropriate 
portion of fixed and variable overhead expenses, 
are assigned to inventories held by the method most 
appropriate to the particular class of inventory, with 
the majority being valued on a first-in-first-out basis. 
Net realizable value represents the estimated selling 
price for inventories less all estimated costs of com-
pletion and costs necessary to make the sale. 

Obsolescence is assessed with reference to the 
age and rate of turnover of the items. The entire dif-
ference between the opening and closing balance 
of the obsolescence allowance is charged to cost 
of sales. The fair value of inventories acquired in a 
business combination is determined based on the 
estimated selling price less the estimated cost of 
sale and a reasonable profit margin.

Assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are clas-
sified as held for sale if their carrying value will be 
recovered principally through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. An asset held for 
sale is measured at the lower of its previous carrying 
value and fair value less costs to sell.

One of the conditions that must be satisfied for 
an asset to be classified as held for sale is that the 
sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal 
group) is available for immediate sale in its pres-
ent condition. One criterion for the sale to qualify 
as highly probable is that the appropriate level of 
management must be committed to a plan to sell 
the assets or disposal group in its present condition. 
In the telecom industry acquisitions often require 

regulatory approval. If the buyer is a telecom oper-
ator in the same market parties often have to agree 
to a number of remedies to get the approval. If the 
buyer is expected to be a telecom operator in the 
same market and significant remedies are expected, 
a sale is usually not regarded as highly probable 
and consequently the assets are not classified as 
held for sale by Telia Company, until the remedies 
are agreed upon and accepted by management. 
The determination if and when non-current assets 
and disposal groups should be classified as held for 
sale requires management judgment considering all 
facts and circumstances relating to the transaction, 
the parties and the market and entities can come to 
different conclusions under IFRS.

Equity attributable to owners of the 
parent
Equity attributable to owners of the parent is 
divided into share capital, other contributed capital, 
hedging reserve, cost of hedging reserve, fair value 
reserve, foreign currency translation reserve, equity 
transaction in associates and retained earnings. 
Share capital is the legally issued share capital. 
Other contributed capital comprises contribu-
tions made by shareholders in the form of share 
premiums in connection with new share issues, 
specific share holder contributions, etc. This item is 
reduced by reimbursements to shareholders made 
in accordance with separately decided and commu-
nicated capital repayment programs (e.g. through 
purchasing own shares or extraordinary dividends). 
The hedging reserve as well as the cost of hedging 
reserve and the foreign currency translation reserve 
are reclassified to net income. The fair value reserve 
includes both debt instruments at fair value through 
OCI which are reclassified to net income, and equity 
instruments at fair value through OCI which are not 

classified to net income. Cash flow hedges may also 
adjust the initial cost of a non-financial asset or lia-
bility. Equity transactions in associates are the effect 
on the group from equity transactions such as buy-
back of shares from third parties by an associated 
entity. All other equity is retained earnings.

Dividend payments are proposed by the Board of 
Directors in accordance with the regulations of the 
Swedish Companies Act and decided by the gen-
eral meeting of shareholders. The proposed cash 
dividend will be recorded as a liability immediately 
following the final decision by the shareholders.

Provisions for pensions and  
employment contracts 
Telia Company provides defined contribution or  
defined benefit pension plans to its employees. 
Contributions to defined contribution plans are nor-
mally set at a certain percentage of the employee’s 
salary and are expensed as incurred. Telia Company 
pays fixed contributions to separate legal entities 
and will have no legal or constructive obligation to 
pay further amounts if the fund does not hold suf-
ficient assets to pay all employee benefits. Contri-
butions to defined contribution plans are expensed 
when employees provide services entitling them to 
the contribution.

Defined benefit pension plans, provided to part 
of Telia Company employees in Sweden, Finland 
and Norway, means that the individual is guaranteed 
a pension equal to a certain percentage of his or her 
salary. The pension plans mainly include retirement 
pension, disability pension and family pension. The 
present value of pension obligations and pension 
costs are calculated annually, using the projected 
unit credit method, which distributes the cost over 
the employee’s service period. The pension cost is 
recognized in three components, service cost, net 

interest and remeasurements. Service cost is recog-
nized in operating income and net interest, based 
on discount rate, on defined benefit obligation and 
plan assets is reported as interest income or interest 
expenses in financial items.

Changes in actuarial assumptions and experience 
adjustments of obligations and changes in fair value 
of plan assets, deviations from discount rate, results 
in remeasurements and are recognized in Other 
comprehensive income at the end of the reporting 
period.

Actuarial assumptions are determined at the end 
of the reporting period. The assets of Telia Compa-
ny’s pension funds constitute pension plan assets 
and are valued at fair value at the end of the report-
ing period.

Net provisions or assets for post-employment 
benefits in the statement of financial position rep-
resent the present value of obligations at the end 
of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets.

Other provisions and contingencies
A provision is recognized when Telia Company has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation, and a reliable esti-
mate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
If the likelihood of an outflow of resources is less 
than probable but more than remote, or a reliable 
estimate is not determinable, the matter is disclosed 
as a contingency provided that the obligation or the 
legal claim is material.

Provisions are measured at management’s best 
estimate, at the end of the reporting period, of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation, and 
are discounted to present value where the effect 

148Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



is material. From time to time, parts of provisions 
may also be reversed due to better than expected 
outcome in the related activities in terms of cash 
outflow.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, 
e.g. product warranty commitments, the probability 
that an outflow will be required in settlement is 
determined by considering the class of obligations 
as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the 
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one 
item included in the same class may be small but it 
is probable that some outflow of resources will be 
needed to settle the class of obligations as a whole.

Other provisions comprise restructuring provi-
sions which include termination benefits, onerous 
contracts and other expenses related to cost 
reduction programs, post-acquisition integration 
programs, closing-down of operations, etc. Restruc-
turing provisions are mainly recognized as Other 
operating expenses, since they are not expenses for 
post-decision ordinary activities.

Termination benefits are recognized at the earlier 
of when Telia Company no longer can withdraw the 
offering of those benefits or when Telia Company 
has made an appropriate public announcement, 
specifying the terms of redundancy and the number 
of employees affected, or after individual employees 
have been advised of the specific terms.

Onerous contracts are recognized when the 
expected benefits to be derived by from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting 
the obligations under the contract. The provision is 
measured at the present value of the lower of the 
expected cost of terminating the contract and the 
expected net cost of continuing with the contract. 
Before a provision is established, any impairment 
loss on the assets associated with that contract is 
provided for.

Other provisions also include warranty commit-
ments, environmental restoration, litigation, onerous 
contracts not related to restructuring activities, etc. 
These provisions are recognized as Cost of sales, 
Selling and marketing expenses, Administrative 
expenses or Research and development expenses 
as applicable.

Lease agreements

Telia Company as lessee
Telia Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a 
lease liability on the statement of financial position 
when the underlying asset is made available for 
Telia Company, i.e. at the commencement date. Telia 
Company applies the practical expedients to rec-
ognize payments associated with short-term leases 
and leases of low value as an expense in the income 
statement. Telia Company does not apply IFRS 16 to 
intangible assets.

The lease liability is initially measured at the 
present value of the lease payments during the 
estimated lease term that are not paid at the com-
mencement date. Lease payments included in the 
measurement of the lease liability comprise of fixed 
lease payments including in-substance fixed pay-
ments, variable lease payments that depend on an 
index or a rate, amounts expected to be payable 
under a residual value guarantee and payments 
related to options that Telia Company is reasonably 
certain to exercise. In all asset classes, payments 
related to non-lease components are separated 
from the lease payments and expensed as incurred.

The estimated lease term includes the non-can-
cellable period of the lease together with both 
periods covered by extension options (if Telia 
Company is reasonable certain to exercise that 
option) and periods covered by termination options 

(if Telia Company is reasonable certain not to exer-
cise that option). Determining the estimated lease 
term, including extension and termination options, 
requires significant judgement, see Note C2.

The lease liability is remeasured if there are modi-
fications to the lease contract or if there are changes 
in the cash flow based on the initial contract terms. 
Changes in cash flows based on the initial term 
occurs when; Telia Company changes its initial 
estimation of whether extension and/or termination 
options will be exercised, there are changes in ear-
lier estimates of whether a purchase option will be 
exercised, lease payments changes due to changes 
in index or rate, or if there is a change in estimates 
regarding amounts expected to be paid under a 
residual value guarantee.

The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate can-
not be readily determined, Telia Company’s incre-
mental borrowing rate. For the majority of all lease 
contracts Telia Company uses its incremental bor-
rowing rate, as the interest rate implicit in the lease 
usually is not readily determinable.

Some lease agreements, e.g. for stores could 
contain variable payments that are linked to the 
sales generated from the store. Variable lease 
payments are recognized in the income statement 
in the period in which the event that trigger those 
payments occurs.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability plus any lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date and any initial direct costs 
incurred, less any lease incentives received. Also, any 
restoration costs estimated in  accordance with the 
guidance in IAS 37 are included in the measurement 
of the right-of-use asset. The related provision is rec-
ognized separately from the lease liability.

The right-of use asset is subsequently depreci-
ated on a straight-line basis from the commence-
ment date to the earlier of the end of the useful life 
of the underlying asset or the end of the estimated 
lease term. Any remeasurement of the lease liability 
results in most cases in a corresponding adjustment 
of the right-of-use asset. If the carrying amount of 
the right-of-use asset has already been reduced to 
zero, the remaining remeasurement is recognized in 
the income statement. The right-of-use assets are 
tested for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of 
an asset may not be recoverable.

Right-of-use assets are presented as a separate 
line in the statement of financial position and lease 
liabilities as long- and short-term borrowings in the 
statement of financial position.

In the income statement, depreciation charges of 
the right-of-use asset are presented in the different 
functions depending on type of leased asset. The 
interest expense on the lease liability is presented 
as finance costs. Lease payments associated with 
leases of low value and short-term leases are pre-
sented in the different functions depending on type 
of leased asset.

Repayments on the lease liability are presented 
as a cash flow from financing activities. Payments 
of interest as well as payments for short-term leases 
and leases of low value are presented as cash flow 
from operating activities.

Telia Company as a lessor
In arrangements where Telia Company is a lessor, 
determination of whether each lease is a finance 
lease or an operating lease is made at lease incep-
tion. To classify each lease, an overall assessment is 
made of whether the lease transfers substantially all

through the merger of the Communications, Brand 
and Sustainability functions, appointing Ola Rembe 
as Senior Vice President, Head of Communications,

LED (Lithuania, Estonia and Denmark) and 
CEO of Telia Lithuania, plans to retire from Telia

of EUR 500 million under its existing EMTN (Euro 
Medium Term Note) program.

of the underlying asset. If substantially all of the 
risk and rewards are transferred, then the lease is 
a finance lease. If not, it is an operating lease. If a 
contract includes both lease and non-lease compo-
nents, Telia Company allocates the consideration to 
the components identified on the basis of relative 
stand-alone selling prices (see section “revenue  
recognition” above).

In arrangements where Telia Company is an inter-
mediate lessor the classification of the sublease is 
assessed with reference to the right-of-use asset 
arising from the head lease.

Telia Company as finance lessor
Telia Company owns assets that are leased to cus-
tomers under finance lease agreements. Amounts 
due from lessees are recognized as receivables 
at the amount of the net investment in the leases, 
which equals the net present value. Initial direct 
costs are included in the initial measurement of the 
financial lease receivable and reduce the amount 
of income recognized over the lease term. Interest 
income is recognized over the lease term on an 
annuity basis.

Telia Company as operating lessor
Rental revenue from operating leases are recog-
nized on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negoti-
ating and arranging an operating lease are added to 
the carrying value of the leased asset and are recog-
nized on the same basis as the lease revenue.

Assets and liabilities related to contracts  
with customers

Costs to obtain a contract
Costs to obtain a contract are incremental costs 
incurred resulting in obtaining a contract with a 
customer, which Telia Company would not have 
incurred if the contract had not been obtained. 
These costs are typically external commissions 
paid, internal commission or bonus paid related to 
obtaining a new contract. Closing balance for Cost 
to obtain a contract amounted to SEK 1,522 million 
(1,490). Amortization in 2022 amounted to SEK 
1,362 million (1,215). Other changes during the year 
were mainly due to new contracts of SEK 1,371 mil-
lion (1,339). Costs to obtain a contract are included 
in Other non-current assets. The amortization is 
classified as an operating expense (within EBITDA) 
in the income statement, see Note C7.

Contract assets
Contract assets mainly refer to transactions where 
Telia Company satisfies a performance obligation 
to transfer equipment that is part of a bundle to 
the customer, but the payment for the equip-
ment is dependent on Telia Company satisfying 
another performance obligation in the contract, for 

example a mobile subscription. Total contract assets 
amounted to SEK 493 million (517) of which SEK 
115 million (137) are included in Other non-current 
assets and SEK 378 million (379) are included in 
Trade and other current receivables and assets.

Contract liabilities
Contract liabilities primarily relate to deferred rev-
enue such as prepaid cards, prepaid subscriptions, 
loyalty programs and variable considerations. Total 
contract liabilities amounted to SEK 3,337 million 
(3,230), of which SEK 10 million (9) are included in 
Other long-term liabilities and SEK 3,327 million 
(3,221) are included in Trade payables and other 
current liabilities. The opening balance for contract 
liabilities has, in all material aspects, been recog-
nized as revenue during the year.

For information on revenue from leases, see Note 
C28.

ment testing.

An impairment of the total carrying value of the 
C More brand relating to segment TV and Media of 
SEK 316 million has been recognized within Cost of 
sales in 2022. The brand was part of Trade names in 
the intangible assets table below. See also section 
Impairment testing. Impairment of other intangible 
assets in 2021 was mainly related to a reassessment 
of certain intangible assets in Denmark following a 
balance sheet review.

The carrying value for intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives is SEK 1,815 million (2,125) and 

is related to brands in TV and Media. These brands 
serve as umbrella brands under which the various 
TV and Media businesses are operated. The TV and 
Media brands (except for the C More brand) are 
deemed to be lasting in the sense that the brands are 
expected to remain as long as there is a commercial 
interest from advertisers, viewers and Telia Company. 
Additionally, the brands have a long history, are well 
known and are established in Sweden and Finland. 
Therefore, the remining useful lives for these brands 
have been deemed indefinite. 

For amortization rates applied, see section “Useful 
lives” in Note C2. In the statement of comprehensive 
income, amortization and impairment losses are 
included in all expense line items by function as well 
as in line items Other operating expenses.

assumptions that it believes are reasonable based 
on the best information available. Management 
believes that value in use based on own business 
plan better reflects the value for Telia Company and 
of the long-term valuation, compared to the current 
market values that in some cases can be below the 
recoverable amount derived from Telia Company’s 
own long-term business plans.

The key assumptions in the value in use calcula-
tions were sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin 
development, the weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC), CAPEX-to-sales ratio (CAPEX excluding 
Right-of-use assets), and the terminal growth rate 
of free cash flow. CAPEX for Right-of-use assets has 
been considered in the impairment test model. 

The value in use calculations were based on fore-
casts approved by management, which management 
believes reflect past experience, forecasts in industry 
reports, and other externally available information.

For TV and Media the sales growth and the 
Adjusted EBITDA-margin development in the forecast 
deviate from historical trends. For the forecast period 
the development is based on the effects from the 
ongoing simplification of the organization and consol-
idation of linear and streaming content under TV4 and 
MTV. The CAPEX-to-sales ratio development in the 
forecasts for all CGUs except TV and Media deviate 
from historical trends due to lower future investment 
levels as the peak of the 5G network modernization 
has been passed. For Denmark the sales growth 
development in the forecast deviates from historical 
trends due to the planned pricing activities within the 
mobile connectivity area.

Approved forecasts consider potential significant 
climate related risks (as well as other types of risks in 
Telia Company’s Risk Universe) and the group’s ongo-
ing and future mitigating activities. Climate related 
risks are considered through, for example, the sales 
growth forecasts which include offerings based on 

circular business models (e.g. pre-owned phones, 
Device as a Service and buy back initiatives to enable 
reuse and recycling) and products and services that 
enable our customers to reduce GHG emissions and 
energy use (e.g remote meetings, IoT and other data-
driven services). 

Further the EBITDA-margin and CAPEX-to-sales 
forecasts include impacts of higher energy prices 
and Telia Company’s activities to manage the energy 
impacts and costs, including: 

• increasing energy efficiency through new network 
hardware and power saving features.

• managing power consumption through decom-
missioning legacy networks and modernizing sites, for 
example copper-based access is replaced with mobile 
and fiber connectivity and relevant units are placed 
outdoors to reduce the need of cooling and

• using renewable electricity when powering our 
operations covered by Guarantees of Origins or 
secured through long-term Power Purchasing Agree-
ments for solar and wind and looking for alternatives 
to remaining fossil-based energy sources.

The CAPEX-to-sales forecasts are considering that 
investment decisions are preceded by environmental 
screening of energy consumption, waste and GHG 
emissions, which in turn affects for example product 
and service development and network construction. 
The group-wide re-use and recycling program for net-
work equipment is part of the forecasts.

For more information on climate risks, goals and 
activities, see Directors’ Report section Risks and 
uncertainties/Environment and Sustainability report 
section Climate and circularity including the TCFD 
report in Note S4. 

The forecasted cash flows were discounted at the 
weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the rele-
vant cash-generating unit. The WACC is derived from 
the risk-free interest rate in local currency, the country 
risk premium, the business risk represented by the

Impairment testing
Goodwill
Goodwill is, for impairment testing purposes, 
allocated to cash generating units in accordance 
with Telia Company’s business organization. Each 
country, and TV and Media constitutes a separate 
cash-generating unit (CGU). Carrying values of all 
cash-generating units are tested annually for impair-
ment, or more frequently if there are indications that 
goodwill might be impaired.

Based on the impairment tests performed in the 
fourth quarter 2022 a total goodwill impairment of SEK 
19,100 million has been recognized in 2022. The impair-
ment tests reflect the changed macro-economic land-
scape and higher Weighted Average Cost of Capital 
(WACC) for the group, due to increased market interest 
rates in 2022, which resulted in the need for impairment 
of goodwill relating to Finland, Norway, Denmark and 
Latvia. The recoverable amounts for these CGUs as of 
December 31, 2022, amounted to SEK 35,553 million 
for Finland, SEK 44,631 million for Norway, SEK 5,783 

million for Denmark and SEK 4,369 million for Latvia. 
The impairment test for the CGU TV and Media has 
not identified any impairment need as of December 31, 
2022, however the estimated recoverable amount was 
in the proximity of the carrying value as of December 
31, 2022, and the CGU is sensitive to changes in WACC 
or the assumptions in the long term plan.

For impairment testing purposes the carrying 
value is defined as segment operating capital and 
allocated common assets from Common Products 
and Services, less deferred tax on fair value adjust-
ments and notionally adjusted for non-controlling 
interests in goodwill. The segment operating capital 
includes Right of use assets, but excludes lease lia-
bilities. For definition of segment operating capital, 
see Note C5 and “Definitions.” 

The recoverable amounts (that is, the higher of 
value in use and fair value less cost to sell) are nor-
mally determined on the basis of value in use, apply-
ing discounted cash flow calculations. In all of the 
recoverable amount calculations, management used

1) CAPEX excluding right-of-use assets

The upper part of the following table sets out how many percentage points each key assumption must 

estimated beta, the local equity market risk premium 
and an estimated reasonable cost of borrowing above 
the risk-free rate. The pre-tax discount rate typically 
cannot be directly observed or measured. It is calcu-
lated by iteration – by first running DCF calculation 
using post-tax cash flows and a post-tax discount rate, 
and then determining what the pre-tax discount rate 
would need to be to cause value in use determined 
using pre-tax cash flows to equal the value in use 

determined by the post-tax DCF calculation. 
The forecast periods, WACC rates and the termi-

nal growth rates of free cash flow used to extrapo-
late cash flows beyond the forecast period varied by 
cash  generating unit as presented below. In all cases 
management believes the terminal growth rates do 
not exceed the average growth rates for markets in 
which Telia Company operates. 

Sensitivity analysis - goodwill
The estimated recoverable amounts for Finland, 
Norway, Denmark, Latvia and TV and Media were 
in proximity of the carrying values as of December 
31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the estimated 
recoverable amounts for Finland and Norway were 
in proximity of the carrying values. 

The impairment tests assumed, in addition to the 
post-tax WACC rates and the terminal growth rates 
stated above, the following sales growth, Adjusted 
EBITDA margin and CAPEX-to-sales ranges (CAPEX 
excluding Right-of-use assets) during the next 5 
years for the cash generating units (CGUs) that are 
sensitive to reasonable changes in assumptions.

Brands with indefinite useful lives
Following the decision to consolidate the C More 
business under TV4 in Sweden and MTV in Finland, 
the impairment test of the C More brand (based on 
value in use) resulted in an impairment of the total 
carrying value of SEK 316 million in 2022.

The recoverable amounts for the other brands 
in TV and Media, which have indefinite useful lives, 
have been determined based on fair value less costs 
to sell. The brands are tested annually for impair-
ment, or more frequently if there are indications that 
brands might be impaired. The fair value less costs 
to sell has been estimated based on the Relief of 
royalty method under the Income approach. Under 
this method the fair value of the brands is estimated 
to the present value of the after-tax royalty savings 
attributable to owning the brands. 

The key assumptions in the fair value less costs 
to sell calculations for the brands were revenue 
growth, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital

(WACC), the terminal growth rate of revenue and 
royalty rates. The revenue growth rates over the 
ten-year projected cash flow period are based on 
past performance and management’s expectations 
of market development. The projected revenue cash 
flows were discounted at the weighted average cost 
of capital (WACC). The WACC was determined on 
the same basis as described for goodwill above, but 
with additional specific risk factors associated with 
intangible assets as compared to the TV and Media 
business as a whole. The royalty rates were deter-
mined based on license agreements for other strong 
brands within the media industry and the brand 
awareness of TV and Media’s brands. The brand val-
uation is categorized in level three in the fair value 
hierarchy. (See Note C3 for description of fair value 
hierarchies.) The key assumptions used when deter-
mining the fair value less costs to sell for the brands 
are presented in the table below.

Impairments in 2022 mainly relate to the copper
network in segment Sweden which is expected to
be dismantled by the end of 2026. An impairment
test has been performed based on the latest copper
network dismantling plan, which resulted in an
impairment of SEK 422 million of the Swedish cop-
per network assets within Plant and machinery. The 
impairment is recognized within Cost of sales and 
refers to segment Sweden. After the impairment, the 
carrying value of the Swedish copper network assets 
amounts to SEK 1,247 million. 

Impairments in 2021 mainly related to a reas-
sessment of certain assets in Denmark following a 
balance sheet review.

Treasury shares 
On April 6, 2022, the AGM authorized the Board of 
Directors to decide on a share buy-back program. 
Repurchases of shares may be made on one or more 
occasions before the AGM 2023. On June 1, 2022, 
the Board of Directors decided to initiate a share 
buy-back program with the intention to buy back 
shares for SEK 5.4 billion starting no earlier than 
June 15, 2022 and ending no later than February 
28, 2023. The total price for the repurchased shares 
under the share buy-back program during 2022 was 
SEK 5,400 million. Transaction costs, net of tax, was 
SEK 86 million.

During May 2022 Telia Company acquired addi-
tional 339,912 treasury shares, at an average price 
of SEK 40.01 to cover commitments under the Long 
term Incentive Program (LTI) 2019/2022 (595,632 
shares at an average price of SEK 35.32 under the 
LTI program 2018/2021). The total price for the 
repurchased shares during 2022 was SEK 14 million 
(21) and transaction costs, net of tax, amounted to 
SEK 0 million (0). During 2022 Telia Company trans-
ferred 332,875 shares (595,632) to the incentive 
program participants. The remaining 7,037 shares 
were sold through the stock exchange for SEK 0.2 
million.

In total the acquisitions of treasury shares under 
the share buy-back program and the LTI program 
reduced other contributed capital within parent 
shareholder’s equity by SEK 5,499 million during 
2022 (21). As of December 31, 2022, Telia Com-
pany held 157,522,416 treasury shares (0) and the 
total number of issued and outstanding shares was 
4,089,631,702 (4,089,631,702) and 3,932,109,286 
(4,089,631,702) respectively.

Subsidiaries with material non-controlling 
interests
Summarized financial information on subsidiaries  
with material non-controlling interests (NCI) is  
presented below. The amounts disclosed for each 
subsidiary are based on those included in the  
consolidated financial statements before inter- 
company eliminations and only the net asset in 
which the NCI has a share. Other comprehensive 
income (OCI) only comprises exchange rate  
differences arising on translation to SEK.

The NCI in Telia Lietuva, AB, is 11.8%. The group 
holds 49% of the shares in Latvijas Mobilais Tele-
fons SIA (LMT). However, according to shareholders’ 
agreements Telia Company has the board majority 
in LMT and the company is therefore regarded as 
a subsidiary. In addition, LMT is held partly by the 
associated company SIA Tet which  
decreases NCI to 39.7%. The NCI in Telia Towers AB, 
which includes the tower businesses in Finland, Nor-
way and Sweden, is 49%. 

 On January 27, 2022, Telia Company signed an 
agreement to divest a 49% stake in its Swedish 
tower business to Brookfield and Alecta at a price 
corresponding to an enterprise value for 100% of 
SEK 11,224 million on a cash and debt free basis. 
The transaction was subject to customary regu-
latory approvals and was closed on June 1, 2022. 
The transaction resulted in an increase of Retained 
earnings in equity attributable to owners of the par-
ent of SEK 5,255 million (net including transaction 
costs of SEK 29 million) and an increase of equity 
attributable to non-controlling interests of SEK 190 
million. The disposal had a positive cash flow effect 
for the group in the second quarter 2022 of SEK 

5,475 million which was recognized in line-item 
Capital contributions non-controlling interests within 
financing activities. If, and when there is a transfer of 
the tower assets from their respective business unit,

C22.  Provisions for pensions and  
employment contracts

Post-employment benefits
Telia Company provides defined benefit pension 
plans to its employees in Sweden, Finland and Nor-
way. The pension plans mainly include  
retirement pension, disability pension and family 
pension. 

Employees in Telia Company AB and most of its 
Swedish subsidiaries are eligible for retirement ben-
efits under the ITP-Tele (ITP 2 plan) defined benefit 
plan. However, all employees born in 1979 and later 
are covered by a defined contribution pension plan 
(the ITP 1 plan). The part of the Swedish ITP 2 multi-
employer pension plan that is secured by paying 
pension premiums to Alecta is accounted for as a 
defined contribution plan as the plan administrator 
does not provide sufficient information necessary to 
account for the plan as a defined benefit plan. Telia 
Company’s portion of total premiums in the Alecta  
ITP 2 plan is 0.05% (0.07) and the share of total 
number of active insured in ITP 2 is 0.63% (0.67). 
Expected contribution to the ITP 2 plan for 2023 is 
SEK 15 million. At the end of 2022, Alecta’s surplus, 
in the collective funding ratio, is preliminary esti-
mated to 172% (172).

Telia Company’s employees in Finland are entitled 
to statutory pension benefits pursuant to the Finnish

Pension obligations and pension expenses
Total amounts recognized in the statements of financial position for pension obligations were as follows.

Employees Pensions Act, a defined benefit pension 
arrangement with retirement, disability, unemploy-
ment and death benefits (TyEL pension). In addi-
tion, certain employees have additional pension 
coverage through a supplemental pension plan. In 
Finland, a part of the pension is funded in advance 
and the remaining part financed as a pay-as-you-go 
pension i.e. contributions are set at a level that is 
expected to be sufficient to pay the required bene-
fits falling due in the same period.

Telia Norway operates a defined benefit pension 
plan, which was closed for new entrants in 2011. 

The pension obligations are secured mostly by 
pension funds, but also by provisions in the state-
ments of financial position combined with pension 
credit insurance. 

Telia Company’s defined benefit plans are 
approximately divided between the following 
groups; 20% active members, 32% deferred mem-
bers and 48% retirees.

Telia Company’s employees in many other 
countries are usually covered by defined contri-
bution pension plans. Contributions to the latter 
are  normally set at a certain percentage of the 
 employee’s salary and are expensed as incurred.

Principal actuarial assumptions
The actuarial calculation of pension obligations 
and pension expenses is based on the following 
principal assumptions. These assumptions are 
the most significant ones in terms of the risk for 
changes in Telia Company’s pension obligations. 
The discount rate reflects the interest rate level at 
which the pension liabilities could be effectively 
settled and affects the value of the defined benefit 
obligations. 

As in previous years the discount rate for Sweden 
is determined by the covered bond market. Since 
the commitment has a longer duration than most 
covered bonds, an extrapolation of the yield curve is 
performed and used with the corresponding dura-
tion of Telia Company’s pension obligations. The 

discount rate for Finland is based on high-quality 
corporate bonds with long duration. Norway sets 
the discount rate on the same basis as Sweden. 

Inflation and increased longevity have an impact 
on future pension payments and therefore the 
pension obligation. For Sweden management set 
the long-term annual inflation rate based on a com-
bination of the target set by the national central 
bank, implied market inflation and forecasts. For 
Finland, the inflation assumption is derived from 
long-term inflation swaps. For Norway, the inflation 
is mainly based on estimations from the Norwe-
gian Accounting Standards Board. See below for a 
sensitivity analysis related to a change in the signif-
icant assumptions used in calculating the pension 
provision.

Future contributions 
For companies in Sweden, pension liabilities are 
secured also by pension credit insurance. This 
means that, should the net provision for pension 
obligation increase, each company can choose if 

and when to contribute to the pension fund or oth-
erwise to recognize a provision. To pension funds 
outside Sweden, Telia Company expects to contrib-
ute SEK 153 million in 2023.

The sensitivity analyses are based on a change 
in an assumption while holding all other assump-
tions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, 
and changes in some of the assumptions may by 
correlated.

Investment strategy
The assets of Telia Company’s pension funds consti-
tute pension plan assets and are valued at fair value. 
These assets are used as prime funding source 
for the pension obligations and exist primarily in 
Sweden and Finland. The pension funds invest the 
assets in such a manner that the liquidity of the 
funds is ensured. The investment horizons are long-
term and aimed to cover Telia Company’s pension 
obligations. The weighted average duration for the 
pension obligation plans is approximately 17 years. 
Investment plans are approved by the boards of 
the pension funds. The investment activities comply 
with the rules and regulations issued by the authori-
ties governing pension foundations.

Sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations to changes in the assumptions was as follows.

For the Swedish pension fund, which represents 
approximately 75% of the total group plan assets, 
Telia Company applies a minimum funding require-
ment. Asset management has been successful, 
and the portfolio has generated an annual return 
of 6% since inception. As of December 31, 2022, 
the strategic asset allocation decided by the Board 
of the Swedish Fund, was 49% fixed income, 34% 
equities and 17% alternative investments. The alter-
native investments include real estate and hedge 
funds. The actual allocation may deviate from the 
strategic allocation in a range within specified limits. 
To achieve long term financial targets, it is always 
important to find an appropriate balance between 
risk and return. 

Financial performance has been weak during 
2022 and market conditions are expected to be 
challenging going forward as well. Diversification of 
the assets, and disciplined use of risk are methods 
used to limit negative impact.

C23. Other provisions
Restructuring provisions
The restructuring provisions represent the pres-
ent value of management’s best estimate of the 
amounts required to settle the liabilities. The esti-
mates may vary as a result of changes in the length 
of notice period before leaving and in the actual 
outcome of negotiations with, sub-contractors and 
other external counterparts as well as the timing 
of such changes. The restructuring provisions are 
mainly related to workforce reduction as a result of 
ongoing optimization of the business in the Nordics 
and Group functions.

Asset retirement obligations
Asset retirement obligations mainly refer to han-
dling  hazardous waste such as worn-out telephone 
poles impregnated with creosote or arsenic and 
to dismantling and restoration of mobile and fixed 
network sites. Remaining provisions as of December 
31, 2022, are expected to be fully utilized in the 
period 2023–2100, depending on factors such as 
any contractual renewal options for site leases and 
dismantling plans decided by management.

Other provisions
Other provisions include provisions for damages 
and court cases, future onerous and other loss- 
making contracts, insurance provisions, payroll taxes 
on future pension payments, estimated expenses 
related to fulfilling representations made and war-
ranties, i.e. transaction warranties, and for potential 
litigation etc. in connection with disposals and 
winding- up of group entities, associated compa-
nies and other equity holdings as well as provision 
for buy-back commitments for sold equipment in 
certain markets. Full utilization of these provisions 
is expected in the period 2023–2055. The provi-
sions represent the present value of management’s 
best estimate of the amounts required to settle the 
liabilities.

Fair value measurement of Level 3 financial 
instruments
Investments classified within Level 3 make use of 
significant unobservable inputs in deriving fair  
value, as they trade infrequently. As observable  
prices are not available for these equity instruments, 
Telia Company has a market approach to derive the 
fair value.

Telia Company’s primary valuation technique 
used for estimating the fair value of unlisted equity 
instruments in Level 3 is based on the most recent 
transaction for the specific company if such trans-
action has been recently done. If there have been 
significant changes in circumstances between the 
transaction date and the balance sheet date that,  
in the assessment of Telia Company, would have a 
material impact on the fair value, the carrying value 
is adjusted to reflect the changes.

Fair value hierarchy levels
The carrying values of classes of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value were distributed by fair value hierarchy level as follows.

C27. Financial risk management

Principles of financing and financial risk  
management
Telia Company’s financing and financial risks are 
managed under the control and supervision of  
the Board of Directors of Telia Company. Financial 
management is centralized within the Group  
Treasury unit of Telia Company, which operates as 
Telia Company’s internal bank and is responsible for 
the management of financing, management of cap-
ital and cash. Group Treasury is also responsible for 
Telia Company’s financial risk management, financial 
infrastructure, implementation of group policies 
and instructions, identification and monitoring of 
financial risks as well as implementation of hedging 
strategies thereof. The most noticeable risks under 
Group Treasury’s responsibility are credit risk,  
liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and (re-)
financing risk. Group Treasury also seeks to manage 
the cost of financial risk management.

Telia Company finances its operations mainly 
by borrowing under its uncommitted open-market 
financing programs directly in Swedish and interna-
tional money markets and debt capital markets. The 
communicated funding strategy is focused on the 
refinancing risk, other themes have been to have a 
smooth maturity profile, maintain duration, to diver-
sify funding sources and to keep a prudent liquidity 
position. Capital markets is the primary source of 
funding while bank funding is mainly considered 
as backup support. This increases flexibility and 
ensures access to markets with attractive pricing. 
The open-market financing programs typically pro-
vide a cost-effective and flexible alternative to bank 
financing. During the first quarter of 2022 a green 
hybrid bond of EUR 500 million was issued (SEK 5.4 

billion) to a coupon of 2.75% and a yield of 2.88% 
with a first reset date after 6.25 years. During the 
fourth quarter of 2022, Telia Company issued addi-
tional volume of EUR 100 million (SEK 1.1 billion) 
to the same coupon of 2.75% and a yield of 5.63% 
with the first reset date after 5.75 years so the total 
volume outstanding under this green hybrid bond is 
EUR 600 million. The proceeds will primarily finance 
more energy efficient networks. Further, in the third 
quarter of 2022, Telia Company issued another 
hybrid bond of EUR 600 million (SEK 6.5 billion) to 
a coupon of 4.62% and a yield of 4.88% with the 
first reset date after 5.25 years and in the fourth 
quarter a 2-year senior bond of SEK 600 million to a 
coupon of 3.99% and a yield of 3.99% and another 
2-year senior bond of SEK 2,400 million to a floating 
interest rate. Outstanding bonds with a nominal 
amount corresponding to SEK 21.3 billion, of which 
hybrid bonds with a nominal amount corresponding 
to SEK 15.2 billion with call dates in October 2022 
and April 2023, were repaid during 2022. The nom-
inal value of Telia Company’s hybrid notes has been 
reduced by SEK 2.3 billion during 2022. The total 
outstanding volume of hybrid per year end is EUR 
1,800 million. 

Capital management
Telia Company’s capital structure and dividend  
policy is decided by the Board of Directors with a 
floor of SEK 2.00 per share and an ambition for low 
to mid-single digit percentage growth.

For 2022, the Board of Directors proposes to the 
AGM an ordinary dividend of SEK 2.00 per share 
(2.05), totaling SEK 7.9 billion (8.3). The dividend

should be split and distributed into four tranches of 
SEK 0.50 per share.

Telia Company targets a leverage corresponding 
to Net debt/adjusted EBITDA in the range of 2.0-2.5x 
and a solid investment grade of A- to BBB+. The 
credit rating of Telia Company remained unchanged 
during 2022. Moody’s rating for long-term borrow-
ings is Baa1 with a stable outlook. The Standard & 
Poor long-term rating is BBB+ and the short-term 
rating is A-2, both with a stable outlook. These ratings 
represent a solid investment grade level and are 
highly important allowing Telia Company continued 
good access to the financial markets.

Telia Company is not subject to any externally 
imposed capital requirements.

In respect of capital management, Telia Company 
defines capital as equity and 50% of hybrid bonds, 
which is consistent with the market practice for 
this type of instrument. As per December 31, 2022, 
Telia Company’s capital amounted to SEK 77,635 
million (93,972), whereof equity SEK 67,673 million 
(83,544 ) and 50% of hybrid bonds SEK 9,962 mil-
lion (10,428).

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk of delay or loss of value or 
income as well as incurred costs due to counter-
party default or failure to meet its financial obli-
gations. The carrying amount of Telia Company’s 
instruments with credit risk exposure is as follows.

The net aggregated exposure in derivatives as 
of December 31 is distributed by the counterparty 
long-term rating as in the table below. Received col-
lateral, regulated by the Credit Support  Annex of the 
ISDA agreements, is deducted from the exposure. 

Telia Company can invest surplus cash in bank 
deposits and securities issued by banks with a rating 
of at least A- (Standard & Poor’s) or A3 (Moody’s). 
In addition investments can be made in corporate 
securities with rating of at least BBB+ or Baa1. 
Cash can also be invested in government bonds 
and treasury bills issued by the Swedish, German, 
Finnish, Norwegian or Danish government, Swed-
ish municipals, investment funds and securitized 
assets with AAA/Aaa rating. Expected credit losses 
for cash in bank and deposits as well as for invest-
ments in securities measured at amortized cost or at 
fair value through OCI are reassessed on a regular 
basis and is primarily based on external ratings of 
the counterparties or issuers. The expected credit 
losses on the balance sheet date are considered 
insignificant and reflects the high credit quality of 
the counterparties reflected in the external ratings. 
The exposure related to cash in bank deposits and 
investments in securities is distributed as in the 
tables below.

The credit risk with respect to Telia Company’s 
trade receivables is diversified geographically and 
among a large number of customers, private indi-
viduals as well as companies in various industries. 
Solvency information is required for credit sales to 
minimize the risk of credit losses and is based on 
group-internal information on payment behaviour, 
if necessary supplemented by credit and busi-
ness information from external sources. Incurred 
expenses for credit losses in relation to consolidated 
net sales was approximately 0.5% in 2022 and 0.7% 
in 2021. 

Telia Company applies a simplified approach for 
calculating expected credit losses for trade receiva-
bles, meaning that the loss allowance reflect lifetime 
expected credit losses for those assets even if the 
credit risk has not increased significantly since the 
assets were initially recognized. The loss allowance 
for expected credit losses for trade receivables is 
calculated using a provision matrix based on the 
age of the receivables and experience of actual 
historical losses. The historical information used in 
the provision matrix is regularly assessed in order to 
determine that it reflects information about current 
conditions and reasonable and supportable future 
conditions. For quantitative information about the 
loss allowance for expected credit losses for trade 
receivables, see Note C18.

The loss allowance for expected credit losses for 
consumer financing receivables is calculated based 
on default statistics per country. The default statis-
tics are based on how much of each month’s lending 
that is transferred to debt collection over the lifetime 
of the contracts. The historical information used to 
calculate the loss allowance is evaluated regularly in 
order to determine that it reflects information about 
current conditions and reasonable and supportable 
future conditions.

An allowance for expected credit losses is calcu-
lated and recognized also for lease receivables. The 
loss allowance for lease receivables is calculated 
based on risk classification from a credit reference 
agency representing the probability that a counter-
party will encounter financial problems. To cover a 
credit loss within the leasing area there is always 
an option to sell the underlying asset to an external 
part.

For quantitative information about the loss allow-
ance for expected credit losses for lease receivables, 
see Note C28. 

When entering into financial transactions such as 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and other 
derivative transactions, Telia Company accepts only 
creditworthy counterparties with a solid invest-
ment grade rating. Telia Company requires each 

counterparty to have an International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreement. The 
permitted exposure of each counterparty when 
entering into a financial transaction depends on the 
rating of that counterparty.

Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that Telia Company will 
encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associ-
ated with financial liabilities that are settled by deliv-
ering cash or another financial asset.

Telia Company has internal control processes 
and contingency plans for managing liquidity risk. 
The short-term and mid-term liquidity management 
takes into account the maturities of financial assets 
and financial liabilities and estimates of cash flows 
from operations.

A centralized daily cash pooling process enables 
Telia Company to manage liquidity surpluses and 
deficits according to the actual needs on group and 
subsidiary level.

Telia Company’s policy is to have a prudent 
liquidity position in terms of available cash and/or 
unutilized committed credit facilities. Telia Compa-
ny’s short-term liquidity risk (payment obligations 
due within a year, see table “Expected maturity”) is 
managed with the liquidity reserve described below.

In the table Hybrid bonds are represented at their reset date.

Amounts in foreign currency have been converted 
into SEK using the exchange rate prevailing as of 
the end of the reporting period. Future interest 
payments, related to instruments with floating 
interest rates, have been estimated using forward 

rates. Where gross settlements are performed 
(cross- currency interest rate swaps, currency swaps 
and forward exchange contracts), all amounts are 
reported on a gross basis. 

Currency risk management
Currency risk is the risk that fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates will adversely affect the group’s 
results, financial position and/or cash flows. Cur-
rency risk can be divided into operational transac-
tion exposure and translation exposure.

Transaction exposure relates to net inflows or 
outflows of foreign currencies required by opera-
tions and financing. Telia Company’s general policy 
is to hedge the majority of known operational trans-
action exposure up to 12 months into the future.  
Financial flows are usually hedged until maturity, 
even if that is longer than 12 months.

Regarding foreign currency transaction exposure, 
CFO has a clearly defined deviation mandate which 
is capped at the equivalent of SEK 10 million calcu-
lated as one day Value at Risk (VaR), expressed as 
the long/short SEK counter-value amount that may 
be exposed to currency fluctuations. Since SEK is 
the functional currency of Telia Company, borrow-
ings are either denominated in, or swapped into SEK 
unless linked to international operations or allocated 
as hedging of net investments in foreign currency.

The cash flow pertains to foreign exchange rate hedging of receivables, payables and cash balances in foreign 
 currencies. Foreign exchange rate risks are also mitigated through the group’s net investments in EUR, see sec-
tion “Translation  exposure.”

Financial transaction exposure risk
At year end, contractual undiscounted financial cash 
flows split by currency, for the group’s interest-bear-
ing borrowings, assets and derivatives represented 
the following expected maturities, including instal-
ments and estimated interest payments. Amounts in 
foreign currency have been converted to SEK using 
the exchange rate prevailing as of the end of the 
reporting period. Future interest payments, related 
to instruments with floating interest rates, have been 
estimated using forward rates.

Operational transaction exposure sensitivity
In most cases, Telia Company customers are billed 
in their respective local currency. Receivables from 
and payables to other operators for international 
fixed-line traffic and roaming are normally settled 
net through clearing-houses. Hence, the operational  
 
need to net purchase foreign currency is primarily 
due to a deficit from such settlements and the  
limited import of equipment and supplies. Main 
sources of transaction exposures are derived from 
the Nordic operations involving EUR, NOK and DKK.

Translation exposure sensitivity
The positive impact on group equity would be 
approximately SEK 3.3 billion (5.8) if the Swedish 
krona weakened by 10 percentage points against all 
translation exposure currencies and vice versa. The 
calculation is based on the exposure as of year end, 
including hedges but excluding any potential equity 
impact due to Telia Company’s operational need to 
net purchase foreign currency, or to currency trans-
lation of other net income related items. Changes in 
exposure during 2022 is mainly due to impairments 
related to goodwill in Finland, Norway, Denmark, 
and Latvia.

Telia Company’s financial policy provides the frame-
work for management of interest rates and the 
average maturity of borrowings and investments. 
The group aims at balancing the estimated running 
cost of borrowing and the risk of negative impact 
on finance net if market interest rates increase. The 
group’s policy is that the duration of the debt portfo-
lio should be between 1 to 5 years. If the loan port-
folio structure deviates from the desired one, various 
forms of derivative instruments are used to adapt 

the structure in terms of duration and/or currency, 
including interest rate swaps and cross- currency 
interest rate swaps. For exposures in different cur-
rencies see “Financial transaction exposure risk”.
At year end, Telia Company’s rate reset periods 
of interest-bearing assets, liabilities and deriva-
tives  represented the following interest types and 
expected maturities. Amounts indicated represent 
nominal values.

Interest rate risk management
Telia Company’s sources of funds are primarily 
equity attributable to owners of the parent, cash 
flows from operating activities, and borrowings. The 
interest-bearing borrowings and financial invest-
ments expose the group to interest rate risk. Interest 
rate risk is the risk that a change in interest rates will 
negatively affect the group’s net interest expense 
and/or cash flows. Leasing is not under active 
interest rate risk management and is therefore not 
included in the section below.

the volume of loans may vary over time, thereby 
affecting the estimate.

However, assuming that those loans were reset 
by start of next year, at a one percentage point 
higher interest rate than the prevailing rate as per 
year end, and remained at that new level during 
12 months, the post-tax interest expense would 
increase by approximately SEK 334 million (476). 
At the same time the effect on equity would be a 
decrease of SEK 31 million (33) due to cash flow 
hedges.

Carrying value of the loan portfolio would 
change by approximately SEK 1.8 billion (2.4), 
should the level in market interest rates make a 
parallel shift of one percentage point, and assuming 
the same volume of loans and a similar duration on 
those loans as per year end.

Refinancing risk management
In order to reduce refinancing risk, the group aims to 
distribute loan maturity dates over a longer period. 
The group’s policy is that the average maturity of 
borrowings should exceed 4 years and that a max-
imum of 30% of the funding is allowed to mature 
within 2 years. As of year end the average maturity 
of Telia Company’s borrowings was 6.8 years and 
16% of the borrowings due within 2 years.

Pension obligation risk and sensitivity
See Note C22 for details on the pension obligation 
risks and a sensitivity analysis.

Management of insurable risks
The insurance cover is governed by corporate 
guidelines and includes a common package of dif-
ferent property and liability insurance programs. The 
business units and other units being responsible for 
assessing the risks decide the extent of actual cover. 
Corporate Insurance at Telia Company manages 
the common group insurance programs and uses 
a captive, Telia Försäkring AB, as a strategic tool in 
managing the insurance programs. Some of the risks 
that are placed in the captive are reinsured in the 
international reinsurance market.

Master netting arrangements and  
similar agreements
Telia Company has entered into ISDA Master Agree-
ments for its OTC derivative business, i.e. interest 
rate and currency derivatives, with all of its core 
banks. These ISDA Master Agreements allow the 
parties to do close-out nettings. For derivatives 
in the financial operations, CSAs (credit support 
annex) may be entered into as an annex to the 
respective master agreement, and are recognized 
as current receivables/liabilities. Under the CSA, the 
parties agree to provide each other with collateral, 
which is calculated based on a weekly or daily expo-
sure under the specific agreement. Funds trans-
ferred and interest accrued under a CSA agreement 
is not considered collateral.

Telia Company has designated certain interest 
rate swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge against 
changes in the amount of future cash flows related 
to interest payments on existing liabilities also 
including certain long-term borrowings hedging 
net investments, see Note C21. Hedge ineffec-
tiveness related to outstanding cash flow hedges 
was immaterial and recognized in net income. Net 
changes in fair value recognized in other compre-
hensive income are offset in a hedging reserve as a 
component of equity, see Note C11. During the year 
no cash flow hedges were discontinued due to the 
original forecasted transactions not having occurred 
in the originally specified time period.

Interest rate risk sensitivity
At year end Telia Company had interest-bearing 
debt of SEK 84.3 billion, carrying value, with dura-
tion of interest of 3.2 years, including derivatives. 
The volume of debt exposed to changes in interest 
rates over the next 12-month period was at the 
same date approximately SEK 42.1 billion, carrying 
value, assuming that existing debt maturing during 
the year are refinanced and after accounting for 
derivatives.

The exact effect of a change in interest rates on 
the financial net stemming from this debt portfolio 
depends on the timing of maturity of the debt as 
well as reset dates for floating rate debt, and that

To assess that the hedge can be assumed to be 
effective going forward the future cash flows calcu-

between the hedged item and the hedging instru-
ment. If the cash flows offset the hedge it can 
be deemed to be highly effective going forward 
(prospectively).

Telia Company as lessee
The group leases various types of assets, such as 
technical space (e.g. technical sites, roof-tops, co- 
locations, space on towers and data centers), tech-
nical equipment (e.g. copper, dark fiber, IRU, ducts, 
towers, base stations and servers), non-technical 
space (e.g. office space, stores and parking space) 
and land. Other leases mainly relate to cars, office 
equipment and IT equipment. Lease agreements 
are negotiated on individual basis and contain a 
wide range of different lease terms and conditions. 
The lease contracts often include renewal options 
for various periods of time. The lease liabilities (and 
the right-of-use assets) include the non-cancellable 
period of the lease together with both extension 
periods (if Telia Company is reasonable certain 

to exercise the extension option) and termination 
periods (if Telia Company is reasonable certain not 
to exercise the termination option). Determination 
of the lease term therefore requires management 
judgment, see Note C2. Apart from short-term 
leases, estimated lease terms including estimated 
extension and termination periods range between 
2 and 39 years. The average useful life of the right-
of-use assets 2022 range between 5 and 14 years. 
Approximately 44% of the total lease liabilities (and 
right of use assets) relate to extension periods were 
Telia Company has made an assessment that it is 
reasonable certain that the extension options will be 
exercised. This portion of the lease liabilities (and 
right of use assets) mainly relates to technical space 
and technical equipment.

Operating leases
Telia Company as lessor, is leasing out various types 
of assets to customers such as technical equipment 
and space (i.e. copper, dark fibre, IRU. ducts and 
space on towers). Telia Company has operating 
lease agreements related product offerings to 
end-customers in Sweden and Finland. Contract 
periods range between 2 and 5 years, with an 

The Swedish State
At year-end, the Swedish State held 39.5% of total 
shares in Telia Company. The remaining 60.5% of 
the total shares are widely held. 

The Telia Company group’s services and products 
are offered to the Swedish state, their agencies, and 
state-owned companies in competition with other 
operators and on conventional commercial terms. 
Certain state-owned companies run businesses that 
compete with Telia Company. Likewise, Telia Com-
pany buys services from state-owned companies at 
market prices and on otherwise conventional com-
mercial terms. Neither the Swedish State and their 
agencies, nor state-owned companies represent 
a significant share of Telia Company’s net sales or 
earnings.

The Swedish telecommunications market is  
governed mainly by the Electronic Communications 

Act and ordinances, regulations and decisions in 
accordance with the Act. Notified operators are 
required to pay a fee to finance measures to pre-
vent serious threats and disruptions to electronic 
communications during peacetime. The required fee 
from Telia Company was SEK 38 million in 2022 and 
SEK 35 million in 2021. In addition, Telia Company, 
like other operators, pays annual fees to the Swedish 
National Post and Telecom Agency (PTS) to fund the 
Agency’s activities under the Electronic Communi-
cations Act and the Radio and Telecommunications 
Terminal Equipment Act. Telia Company paid fees of 
SEK 39 million in both 2022 and 2021.

Associated companies and joint ventures
Telia Company sells and buys services and products 
to and from associated companies. These transac-
tions are based on commercial terms.

C29. Related party transactionsaverage term of approximately 3 years. In addition, 
Telia Company has operating lease contracts of 
handsets in Norway, which include a right for the

the current handset and entering into a new lease 
contract. Contract periods range between 1 and 2 
years. For information on assets subject to operating

Key management
See section “Remuneration to corporate officers” in

Some loan covenants agreed limit the scope for  
divesting or pledging certain assets. Some of Telia 
Company’s more recent bond issuances include 
change-of-control provisions which under certain 
conditions allow the lenders to call back the bond 
before scheduled maturity. Conditions stipulated 
include a new owner taking control of Telia Com-
pany, as such also resulting in a lowering of Telia 
Company’s official credit rating to a “non-investment 
grade” level.

For all financial guarantees issued, stated 
amounts equal the maximum potential future pay-
ments that Telia Company could be required to 
make under the respective guarantee.

Collateral pledged
As of the end of the reporting period, collateral 
pledged for blocked funds in bank accounts was

Legal and administrative proceedings 
In its normal course of business, Telia Company is 
involved in a number of legal proceedings. These 
proceedings primarily involve claims arising out of 
commercial contract and commercial law issues and 
matters relating to telecommunications regulations 
and copyright laws.

Except for the proceedings described here, Telia 
Company or it’s subsidiaries are not involved in any 
legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings which 
management believes could have a material adverse 

effect on Telia Company’s business, financial condi-
tion or results of operations.

The Norwegian Tax Administration (NTA) is per-
forming a VAT audit investigating the treatment of 
the supply of electronic News services during the 
years 2016-2018 in GET AS, which was acquired by 
Telia Company in 2018. Based on the latest com-
munication with the NTA, it is deemed likely that 
Telia Company will be required to pay an amount 
of approximately SEK 0.3 billion in the first quarter 
2023. However, no material provision has been 
recognized since it is deemed probable that the 
amount will be repaid. 

The Finnish Tax Agency (FTA) has in an advance 
ruling concluded that Telia Towers Finland Oy is to 
be classified as a Real estate company. Telia has 

won an appeal of the advance ruling in Helsinki 
administrative court confirming Telia Towers Finland 
Oy is not to be classified as a Real estate company, 
however, the court ruling has been appealed by 
FTA. The FTA has during the fourth quarter of 2022 
issued a decision requesting Telia Company to pay 
the Real Estate Transfer Tax related to Telia Towers 
Finland Oy of approximately SEK 0.2 billion. Telia 
Company has appealed the decision and also 
requested and received respite with the payment 
until final decision is reached in court. Manage-
ment’s assessment is that it is probable that Telia 
Company will win the final appeal in court and no 
provision has therefore been recognized.

to SEK 32 million and SEK 14 million, respectively. In 
addition to this employee profit-sharing system, all 
Telia Company regions apply performance-based 
variable compensation for different groups of 
employees. In Sweden, for example, all permanent 
employees are included in variable compensation 
schemes, one type for the sales force and one for all 
other staff.

Long-term incentive program (LTI)
The 2010 to 2022 AGMs in Telia Company resolved 
to implement performance share programs (PSP), to 
be offered to a selected group of senior executives 
and key position holders within the group. Mem-
bers of the Group Executive Management team are 
excluded. If the pre-defined financial performance 
conditions are met during the defined performance 
period, participants in the programs shall receive 
a number of Telia Company shares (performance 
shares) at a share price of SEK 0. The financial 
targets include a minimum level which must be 
achieved in order for any allotment of performance 
shares to occur at all, as well as a maximum level 
over which no additional allotment of performance 
shares will occur. Each program shall in total com-
prise no more than 2,194,830 (PSP 2019), 2,355,802 
(PSP 2020), 2,764,502 (PSP 2021) and 3,428,025 
(PSP 2022) Telia  Company shares, corresponding 
to approximately 0.06% of the total number of 
outstanding shares for PSP 2019, 0.06% for PSP 

2020, 0.07% for PSP 2021 and 0,09% for PSP 2022 
respectively.

Recalculation of final allotments of performance 
shares shall take place in the event of an intervening 
bonus issue, a split, a rights issue and/or other sim-
ilar events.

Performance share program 2015 to 2022
Financial targets for the 2015 to 2020-programs 
are earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortization (EBITDA) and total shareholder return 
(TSR). The final allotments of performance shares 
will be based 50% on accumulated EBITDA and 
50% on TSR during the full performance period of 
three years. TSR is measured in relation to TSR of a 
group of comparable telecom companies defined 
by the Board of Directors. The 2021 program got 
a target on Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) in 
addition to EBITDA and TSR. The final allotments of 
performance shares will be based on 25% weight-
ing on accumulated EBITDA, 50% on TSR and 25% 
on ROCE. To align the performance measures with 
the Groups’s strategic priorities, an Operational Free 
Cashflow (OFC) target and an Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) target was introduced for the 
2022-program in addition to the TSR and the ROCE 
targets. The final allotments of performance shares 
in the 2022 program will be based on 40% weight-
ing on TSR, 20% on ROCE, 25% on OFC and 15% 
on ESG. The maximum number of performances 
shares a participant can receive corresponds to 
30% of the participant’s annual base salary. 

Participants are not required to invest in Telia 
Company shares. The final number of performance 

208Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



shares awarded shall be capped at such number 
where the aggregated market value corresponds to 
60% of each participant’s base salary. 

PSP 2019 vested during the spring 2022 and final 
rewards were distributed to 135 participants remain-
ing in the program. Three participants received cash 
payments equivalent to the value of 7,037 shares. 
During the second, third and fourth quarters 2022 
Telia Company transferred 332,875 shares to the 

participants in the “Long Term Incentive program 
2019/2022” (LTI program) at an average price of 
SEK 40.01 per share. The total cost for the trans-
ferred shares was SEK 13 million and transaction 
costs, net of tax, amounted to SEK 0 million.

The summarized performance share program  
activity in 2022 was as follows.

Group Executive Management
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the “Other 
members of the Group Executive Management”  
referring to the three EVPs and the nine SVPs 
directly reporting to the CEO, constituted the Telia 
Company Group Executive Management. 

Guidelines for remuneration to Group Executive 
Management
The Annual General Meeting on April 2, 2020, 
decided on guidelines for remuneration to Group 
Executive Management which have remained appli-
cable during 2022. Group Executive Management 
is defined as the president and the other members 
of the management team who report directly to the 
CEO. The guidelines shall be in force until new guide-
lines are adopted by the general meeting and valid 
for a maximum of four years. A successful implemen-
tation of the guidelines will ensure that the Company 
can attract and retain the best people, enabling the 
Company to execute its business strategies and serve 
the Company’s longterm interests, including its sus-
tainability goals1. 

These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration 
decided or approved by the general meeting. 

Total reward approach 
Remuneration to Group Executive Management 
should be built on a total reward approach and be 
market relevant, but not leading. The remuneration 
guidelines should enable international hiring and 
should support diversity within Group Executive 
Management. The market comparison should be 
made against a set of peer group companies with 
comparable sizes, industries and complexity. The 
total reward approach should consist of fixed 
salary, pension benefits, conditions for notice 

and severance pay as well as other benefits. The 
 Company does not offer any variable remuneration 
to Group Executive Management. For employments 
governed by rules other than Swedish, pension 
benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted 
for compliance with mandatory rules or established 
local practice, taking into account, to the extent pos-
sible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.

Fixed salary 
The fixed salary of a Group Executive Management 
member should be based on competence, respon-
sibility and performance. The Company uses an 
international evaluation system in order to evaluate 
the scope and responsibility of the position. Market 
benchmark is conducted on a regular basis. The 
individual performance is monitored and used as 
a basis for annual reviews of fixed salaries. These 
are reviewed in relation to fulfilment of annual pre-
defined goals (including financial, employee and 
sustainability-based). 

Salary and employment conditions for employees 
In the preparation of the Board of Directors’ proposal 
for these remuneration guidelines, salary and employ-
ment conditions for employees of the Company have 
been taken into account. This is done by including 
information on the employees’ total income, the com-
ponents of the remuneration and increase and growth 
rate over time, in the Remuneration Committee’s 
and the Board of Directors’ basis for decision when 
evaluating if these guidelines and their limitations are 
reasonable. The Remuneration Committee regularly 
consults with the CEO and Head of People & Brand to 
be mindful of employee pay, conditions and engage-
ment across the broader employee population. 

Pension 
Pension and retirement benefits should be based on 
a defined contribution model, which means that a 
premium is paid amounting to a certain percentage 
of the individual’s annual salary, unless legal require-
ments and/or collective agreements state differently. 
When deciding the size of the premium the level of 
total remuneration should be considered. The level of 
contribution should be benchmarked and may vary 
due to the composition of fixed salary and pension. 
The retirement age is normally 65 years of age but 
can vary based on regulatory requirements. The pen-
sion premiums for defined contribution pension shall 
amount to not more than 40% of the fixed annual 
cash salary. 

Other benefits 
The Company provides other benefits and pro-
grams in accordance with market practice which 
may change from time to time. A Group Executive 
Management member may be entitled to a company 
car, health and care provisions, etc. Premiums and 
other costs relating to such benefits may amount to 
not more than 10% of the fixed annual cash salary. 
Internationally hired Group Executive Management 
members and those who are asked to move to 
another country can be offered mobility related 
benefits for a limited period of time. Such benefits 
may not in total exceed 25% of the fixed annual 
cash salary. 

Notice of termination and severance pay 
The termination period for a Group Executive 
Management member may be up to six (6) months 
(twelve (12) months for the President) when given 
by the employee and up to twelve (12) months 
when given by the Company. In case the termina-
tion is given by the Company the individual may 

be entitled to a severance payment. Fixed cash 
salary during the notice period and severance pay 
may together not exceed an amount equivalent to 
the fixed cash salary for two years. Severance pay 
shall not constitute a basis for calculation of vaca-
tion pay or pension benefits. Remuneration during 
termination period and severance pay will also 
be reduced if the individual will be entitled to pay 
from a new employment or if the individual will be 
conducting own business during the termination 
period or the severance period. Additionally, remu-
neration may be paid for non-compete undertak-
ings. Such remuneration shall compensate for loss 
of income and shall only be paid in so far as the 
previously employed executive is not entitled to 
severance pay. The remuneration shall be based 
on the fixed cash salary at the time of termination 
of employment, amount to not more than 60% 
of the monthly income at the time of termination 
of employment and be paid during the time the 
non-compete undertaking applies, however not 
for more than 12 months following termination of 
employment. 

The decision-making process to determine, 
review and implementation of the guidelines 
The Board of Directors has established a Remu-
neration Committee. The committee’s task includes 
preparing the Board of Director’s decision to 
propose guidelines for executive remuneration. 
Proposal for new guidelines shall be prepared at 
least every fourth year and submitted the general 
meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new 
guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. 
The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor 
the application of the guidelines for executive 
remuneration as well as the current remunera-
tion structures and compensation levels in the

The Board of Directors will propose changes to the 
guidelines to the Annual General Meeting on April 5, 
2023, see section ‘Remuneration to executive man-
agement’ in the Directors’ Report.

Company. Remuneration is managed through 
well-defined processes ensuring that no individ-
ual is involved in the decision-making process 
related to their own remuneration. The CEO’s total 
remuneration package is decided by the Board 
of Directors based on the recommendation of its 
Remuneration Committee within the confine of the 
guidelines. Total remuneration packages to other 
members of Group Executive Management are 
approved by the Remuneration Committee, based 
on the CEO’s recommendation. 

Deviation from the guidelines 
The Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to 
deviate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if 
there in an individual case are special reasons where 
a deviation is necessary in order to serve the Compa-
ny’s long-term interests, including its sustainability, or 
to ensure the Company’s financial viability. As set out 
above, the Remuneration Committee’s tasks include 
preparing the Board of Directors’ resolutions in the 
remuneration-related matters. This includes any reso-
lution to deviate from the guidelines.

C33. Remuneration to audit firmsTelia Company offers permanent members of the 
Group Executive Management defined contribution 
pension schemes. A defined contribution scheme 
provides premium contributions to the pension 
scheme as a percentage of the pensionable salary 
or as a fixed amount. The level of pension benefits 
at retirement will be determined by the contribu-
tions paid and the return on investments and the 
costs associated to the plan. 

For defined benefit plans, the main drivers of the 
change in capital value for the obligation are the 
change in discount rate, paid out pension premiums 
and the fact that one member of group manage-
ment has a defined benefit pension plan. 

CEO 
The CEO is eligible to a defined contribution pen-
sion scheme with contributions corresponding to 
14.5% of base salary up to 7.5 income base amounts 
and to 40% for such salary above  
7.5 income base amounts. These contributions for 
Allison Kirkby as CEO add up to a total pension 
contribution of SEK 7,312,924 (compared to a base 
salary of SEK 18,360,000 representing 39.8%). 

The contributions into the scheme are vested 
immediately. The income base amount is deter-
mined annually by the Swedish Government and 
was SEK 71,000 for 2022. The retirement age is 
variable. Contributions to the pension scheme will 
cease at retirement or earlier if leaving the company 
for any other reason. 

Other members of Group Executive Management
The EVPs and the SVPs based in Sweden are eli-
gible to defined contribution pension schemes 
providing contributions corresponding to 4.5% of 
their base salary up to 7.5 income base amounts and 
30% of such salary above 7.5 income base amounts. 

One Member of Group Executive Management have 
an additional contribution of 5% of the base salary. 
One Member of Group Executive Management in 
Sweden have a 30% contribution of base salary up 
to 60 income base amounts. Members of Group 
Executive Management in Sweden covered by the 
ITP plan are in addition to the pension contribu-
tion covered by all collective agreed benefits. One 
Group Executive Management member is covered 
by a defined benefit plan. Group Executive Man-
agement members based in other countries are also 
eligible for defined contributions pension schemes 
(with the exception of legally required defined ben-
efit pension plans in Finland). One member based in 
another country received a cash  allowance as part 
of the pension contribution. The contributions to the 
pension schemes are vested immediately. The retire-
ment age for members of Group Executive Manage-
ment is 65 or variable.

Other former members of Group Executive 
Management
Defined pension benefits earned by former CEOs 
and EVPs until 2008 are pledged and calculated as 
capital values (debt) until all their lifelong pensions 
are fully paid out by Telia Company. Their pensions 
are paid out from the age of 60. Since 2008, Telia 
Company does not offer any defined benefit pen-
sion schemes to CEOs and EVPs.

General
The parent company Telia Company AB’s financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, other Swedish 
legislation, and standard RFR 2 “Accounting for  
Legal Entities” and other statements issued by the 
Swedish Financial Reporting Board. The standard is 
applicable to Swedish legal entities whose equities 
at the end of the reporting period are listed on a 
Swedish stock exchange or authorized equity mar-
ket place. In their consolidated financial statements 
such companies have to comply with the EU regu-
lation on international accounting standards, while 
they still have to comply with the Annual Reports Act 
in their separate financial statements. RFR 2 states 
that as a main rule listed parent companies should 
apply IFRSs and specifies exceptions and additions, 
caused by legal provisions or by the connection  
between accounting and taxation in Sweden.

Measurement bases and significant  
accounting principles
With the few exceptions below, Telia Company 
applies the same measurement bases and account-
ing principles as described in Notes to consolidated 
financial statements, Notes C1 and C3, respectively.

Item Note Accounting treatment

Intra company lendning 
and credit rating

P5, P17 Telia Company has an internal model for credit rating of subsidiaries used when 
pricing internal lending to subsidiaries. The model has two risk categories and, 
depending on risk rating, the model has a credit spread curve to be applied on top 
of the benchmark rate when lending money to subsidiaries. The model is based 
on pricing of inter-company lending at an arms-length basis and if the credit 
spreads used represent an unbiased pricing of credit risk, this is used for calculating 
expected credit losses on inter-company receivables.

Group contributions P6 Under certain conditions, it is possible to transfer profits through group contributions 
between Swedish companies in a group. A group contribution is normally a 
deductible expense for the contributor and a taxable income for the recipient. Group 
contributions are recognized as appropriations in the income statement. 

Borrowing costs P5, P8, 
P9

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 
of an asset are not capitalized as part of the cost of that asset.

Investments in 
subsidiaries and 
associated companies

P5, P11 Shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are recognized at cost including 
related transaction expenses less any impairment. Dividends received are brought 
to income while repayment of certain contributed capital reduces the carrying value.

Provisions for pensions 
and employment 
contracts

P5, P15 Pension obligations and pension expenses are recognized in accordance with the 
simplification rule for pensions in RFR 2 “Accounting for legal entities.”

Untaxed reserves and  
appropriations

P6 Untaxed reserves and appropriations are reported gross excluding deferred tax 
liabilities related to the temporary differences.

Capitalized development 
expenses

P8 The corresponding amount that has been capitalized as development expenses 
in the balance sheet as intangible assets have been recognized in the reserve for 
capitalized development expenses in equity.

Lease agreements P22 All leasing agreements are accounted for as operating leases.

Amounts and dates
Unless otherwise specified, all amounts are in millions  
of Swedish kronor (SEK million) or other currency 
specified and are based on the twelve-month period 
ended December 31 for income statement and cash 
flow statement items, and as of December 31, for  
balance sheet items, respectively.

Recently issued accounting standards
For information relevant to Telia Company,  
see Note C1. 

Judgments and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty

Pension obligations and pension expenses
The employees in Telia Company AB are covered 
by one of the three occupational pension plans 
ITP1, ITP2 or ITP-Tele due to collective agreement. 
ITP2 and ITP-Tele are defined benefit pension plans 
which means that the individual is guaranteed a 
pension equal to a certain percentage of his or  
her salary. All employees born in 1979 or later are 
covered by ITP1. 

Most pension obligations are secured by Telia 
Pension Fund. Certain commitments, such as certain 
supplementary individual pension benefits and a 
right under the employment contracts for certain 
categories of personnel to retire at age 55, 60, or 
63, are provided for by taxed reserves in the balance 
sheet. Pension obligations are calculated annually, 
as of the end of the reporting period, based on 
actuarial principles.

Future contributions and pension payments
As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of plan 
assets exceeded the present value of pension 
obligations. Unless the fair value of plan assets 

during 2023 should fall short of the present value of 
 pension obligations, Telia Company has no intention 
to make any contribution to the pension fund.

Principal actuarial assumptions
The actuarial calculation of pension obligations 
and pension expenses is based on principles set 
by PRI Pensionsgaranti and the Swedish Financial 
Super visory Authority, respectively. The principal 
calculation assumption is the discount rate which, as 

a weighted average for the different pension plans 
and, as applicable, net of calculated yield tax,  
was 2.5 % in 2022 (3.3). Obligations were  
calculated based on the salary levels prevailing at 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

To the general meeting of the shareholders of Telia 
Company AB (publ) corporate identity number

Report on the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts

Opinions
We have audited the annual accounts and con-
solidated accounts of Telia Company AB (publ) 
for the financial year 2022-01-01 - 2022-12-31 
except for the corporate governance statement 
on pages 54-72 and the statutory sustainability 
report on pages 73-127. The annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts of the company are included 
in pages 22-103, 110-114 and 128-247 in this 
document.

In our opinion, the annual accounts have been 
prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts 
Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the parent company as of 31 
December 2022 and its financial performance and 
cash flow for the year then ended in accordance 
with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated 
accounts have been prepared in accordance with 
the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of the group 
as of 31 December 2022 and their financial per-
formance and cash flow for the year then ended in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the 
Annual Accounts Act. Our opinions do not cover 

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters of the audit are those matters 
that, in our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in our audit of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, 
but we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.

Revenue recognition

Risk description
There is an inherent risk around the accuracy of rev-
enue recorded given the complexity of the systems 
generating the revenue, the impact of changing 
pricing models to revenue recognition (tariff struc-
tures, incentive arrangements, discounts etc.) and 
different revenue streams.

Telia Company’s revenues comprise several 
revenue streams such as mobile service revenues, 
fixed service revenues, advertising revenues and 
equipment revenues. Telia Company may bundle 
services and products into one customer offering. 
Offerings may involve the delivery or performance 
of multiple products, services, or rights to use assets 
and as such revenue recognition requires significant 
judgements and estimates on behalf of manage-
ment as to when, and to which amount revenues are 
recognized. 

For further information, refer to notes C1 “Basis 
of preparation”, C3 “Significant accounting poli-
cies”, C6 “Net sales” and Not C18 “Trade and other 
current receivables and assets” of the consolidated 
accounts.

Auditors’ Report corporate governance statement on pages 54-72 or 
the statutory sustainability report on pages 73-127. 
The statutory administration report is consistent 
with the other parts of the annual accounts and con-
solidated accounts.

We therefore recommend that the general meet-
ing of shareholders adopts the income statement 
and balance sheet for the parent company and the 
group. 

Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts are consistent with the 
content of the additional report that has been sub-
mitted to the parent company’s audit committee in 
accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) 
Article 11. 

Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audit in accordance with Inter-
national Standards on Auditing (ISA) and gener-
ally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. 
We are independent of the parent company and 
the group in accordance with professional ethics for 
accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled 
our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements.  This includes that, based on the best 
of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services 
referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 
5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, 
where applicable, its parent company or its con-
trolled companies within the EU.

We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinions.

Audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited 
to:
• assessing the application of the group’s 

accounting policies with respect to delivery 
of services, products and advertising and 
the accounting implications of new business 
models and revenue streams to verify that group 
accounting policies for these models were 
appropriate ;

• evaluating the design and testing of relevant

Carrying value of goodwill and other  
non-current assets

Risk description
Telia Company’s carrying values of goodwill and 
other non-current assets including film and program 
rights represent a significant part of Telia Compa-
ny´s total assets. Telia Company is required to test 
goodwill assets for impairment at least annually 
and all assets whenever events or circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not 
be recoverable. The determination of recoverable 
amount, being the higher of fair value less costs 

248Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other



of disposal and value in use, requires judgements 
and assessments on the part of management in 
both identifying and then valuing the relevant cash 
generating units (“CGU’s”). Management normally 
determines recoverable amounts based on value in 
use. Calculations of value in use are based on man-
agement’s view of variables such as sales growth, 
EBITDA margin development, weighted average 
cost of capital (“WACC”), CAPEX-to-sales ratio and 
terminal growth rate.

For further information, refer to notes C2 “Judg-
ments and key sources of estimation uncertainty”, 
C12 “Goodwill and other intangible assets”, C13 
“Property, Plant and Equipment” and C14 “Film and 
program rights” of the consolidated accounts.

Audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited 
to:
• evaluating the appropriateness of management’s 

identification of the Group’s CGU’s;
• with the support of our valuation specialists, 

benchmarking and challenging key assumptions 
in management’s valuation models used to 
determine recoverable amount, including 
assumptions of sales growth, EBITDA margin, 
WACC, CAPEX-to-sales ratio, and terminal growth 
rate; 

• comparing historical forecasting to actual results;
• testing mathematical accuracy of the cash 

flow models and challenging and agreeing key 
assumptions to the long-term business plans 
approved by the Board of Directors; 

• evaluating the adequacy of disclosures related 
to those assumptions and CGU’s to which the 
outcome of the impairment tests are most 
sensitive; and

give a fair presentation in accordance with the 
Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consoli-
dated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing 
Director are also responsible for such internal con-
trol as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the annual accounts and consol-
idated accounts, The Board of Directors and the 
Managing Director are responsible for the assess-
ment of the company’s and the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. They disclose, as appli-
cable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting. The going 
concern basis of accounting is however not applied 
if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director 
intends to liquidate the company, to cease opera-
tions, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  

The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to 
the Board of Director’s responsibilities and tasks in 
general, among other things oversee the company’s 
financial reporting process.

Auditor’s responsibility
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the annual accounts and consoli-
dated accounts as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted 
auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered 

• evaluating the accounting principles and process 
for impairment tests for other non-current assets 
and film and program rights.

Other information than the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director 
are responsible for other information. The other 
information includes the Remuneration Report and 
the pages 1-21, 54-72, 73-127 and 253-262 in this 
document but does not include the Annual accounts 
and the consolidated accounts or our Auditors 
Report.

Our opinion on the annual accounts and consol-
idated accounts does not cover this other informa-
tion and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion regarding this other information.

In connection with our audit of the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts, our respon-
sibility is to read the information identified above 
and consider whether the information is materially 
inconsistent with the annual accounts and consoli-
dated accounts. In this procedure we also take into 
account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the 
audit and assess whether the information otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.

If we, based on the work performed concerning 
this information, conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the 
Managing Director
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director 
are responsible for the preparation of the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts and that they 

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the eco-
nomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts.

the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts is available on Revisorsinspektionen’s 
website: www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisorn-

report.

Report on other legal and  
regulatory requirements

Opinions
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts, we have also audited the 
administration of the Board of Directors and the 
Managing Director of Telia Company (publ) for the 
financial year 2022-01-01 - 2022-12-31 and the 
proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or 
loss.

We recommend to the general meeting of 
shareholders that the profit to be appropriated 
in accordance with the proposal in the statutory 
administration report and that the members of the 
Board of Directors and the Managing Director be 
discharged from liability for the financial year. 

 
Basis for Opinions
We conducted the audit in accordance with gen-
erally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. 
We are independent of the parent company and 
the group in accordance with professional ethics for 
accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled 

249Our Business Our Strategy Directors’ Report Sustainability Financials Other

https://www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar
https://www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar


our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinions.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the 
Managing Director
The Board of Directors is responsible for the pro-
posal for appropriations of the company’s profit or 
loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an 
assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable 
considering the requirements which the company’s 
and the group’s type of operations, size and risks 
place on the size of the parent company’s and the 
group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity 
and position in general.

The Board of Directors is responsible for the 
company’s organization and the administration of 
the company’s affairs. This includes among other 
things continuous assessment of the company’s 
and the group’s financial situation and ensuring that 
the company’s organization is designed so that the 
accounting, management of assets and the com-
pany’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in 
a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall 
manage the ongoing administration according to 
the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instructions 
and among other matters take measures that are 
necessary to fulfill the company’s accounting in 
accordance with law and handle the management of 
assets in a reassuring manner.

Auditor’s responsibility
Our objective concerning the audit of the admin-
istration, and thereby our opinion about discharge 
from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess 
with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any 

for the operations and where deviations and vio-
lations would have particular importance for the 
company’s situation. We examine and test decisions 
undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken 
and other circumstances that are relevant to our 
opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a 
basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ 
proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or 
loss we examined the Board of Directors’ reasoned 
statement and a selection of supporting evidence in 
order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in 
accordance with the Companies Act. The auditor’s 
examination of the Esef report

Opinion
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts, we have also examined that 
the Board of Directors and the Managing Director 
have prepared the annual accounts and consoli-
dated accounts in a format that enables uniform 
electronic reporting (the Esef report) pursuant to 
Chapter 16, Section 4 a of the Swedish Securities 
Market Act (2007:528) for Telia Company AB (publ) 
for the financial year 2022-01-01 – 2022-01-31.

Our examination and our opinion relate only to 
the statutory requirements.

In our opinion, the Esef report has been prepared 
in a format that, in all material respects, enables uni-
form electronic reporting.

Basis for opinion
We have performed the examination in accordance 
with FAR’s recommendation RevR 18 Examination 
of the Esef report. Our responsibility under this 
recommendation is described in more detail in the 
Auditors’ responsibility section. We are independ-
ent of Telia Company AB (publ) in accordance with 
professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and 

member of the Board of Directors or the Managing 
Director in any material respect:
• has undertaken any action or been guilty of any 

omission which can give rise to liability to the 
company, or

• in any other way has acted in contravention of the 
Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the 
Articles of Association.

Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed 
appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and 
thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with rea-
sonable degree of assurance whether the proposal 
is in accordance with the Companies Act.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing stand-
ards in Sweden will always detect actions or omis-
sions that can give rise to liability to the company, or 
that the proposed appropriations of the company’s 
profit or loss are not in accordance with the Compa-
nies Act.

A further description of our responsibility for the 
audit of the administration is available on Revisors-
inspektionen’s website: www.revisorsinspektionen.
se/revisornsansvar. This description is part of the 
auditor’s report.

As part of an audit in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. The examination of 
the administration and the proposed appropriations 
of the company’s profit or loss is based primarily 
on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit pro-
cedures performed are based on our professional 
judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. 
This means that we focus the examination on such 
actions, areas and relationships that are material 

have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the 
Managing Director
The Board of Directors and the Managing Direc-
tor are responsible for the preparation of the Esef 
report in accordance with the Chapter 16, Section 4 
a of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), 
and for such internal control that the Board of Direc-
tors and the Managing Director determine is nec-
essary to prepare the Esef report without material 
misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance 
whether the Esef report is in all material respects 
prepared in a format that meets the requirements of 
Chapter 16, Section 4(a) of the Swedish Securities 
Market Act (2007:528), based on the procedures 
performed.

RevR 18 requires us to plan and execute pro-
cedures to achieve reasonable assurance that the 
Esef report is prepared in a format that meets these 
requirements.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but it is not a guarantee that an engagement carried 
out according to RevR 18 and generally accepted 
auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the Esef 
report.

The firm applies International Standards on Qual-
ity Management, which requires the firm to design, 
implement and operate a system of quality manage-
ment, including policies or procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements.

The examination involves obtaining evidence, 
through various procedures, that the Esef report 
has been prepared in a format that enables uniform 
electronic reporting of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement in 
the report, whether due to fraud or error. In carrying 
out this risk assessment, and in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, the auditor considers those elements of 
internal control that are relevant to the preparation 
of the Esef report by the Board of Directors and 
the Managing Director, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of those 
internal controls. The examination also includes an 
evaluation of the appropriateness and reasonable-
ness of assumptions made by the Board of Directors 
and the Managing Director.

The procedures mainly include a validation that 
the Esef report has been prepared in a valid XHMTL 
format and a reconciliation of the Esef report with 
the audited annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts.

Furthermore, the procedures also include an 
assessment of whether the consolidated statement 
of financial performance, financial position, changes 
in equity, cash flow and disclosures in the Esef 
report have been marked within iXBRL in accord-
ance with what follows from the Esef regulation. 

Auditor’s examination of the corporate 
governance report

The Board of Directors is responsible for that the 
corporate governance statement on pages 54-72 
has been prepared in accordance with the Annual 
Accounts Act.

Our examination of the corporate governance 
statement is conducted in accordance with FAR´s 
auditing standard RevU 16 The auditor´s exam-
ination of the corporate governance statement. 
This means that our examination of the corporate 
governance statement is different and substantially 
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing and gen-
erally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. We 
believe that the examination has provided us with 
sufficient basis for our opinions.

A corporate governance statement has been 
prepared. Disclosures in accordance with chapter 
6 section 6 the second paragraph points 2-6 of the 
Annual Accounts Act and chapter 7 section 31 the 
second paragraph the same law are consistent with 
the other parts of the annual accounts and con-
solidated accounts and are in accordance with the 
Annual Accounts Act.  

 
The auditor’s opinion regarding the  
statutory sustainability report

The Board of Directors is responsible for the statu-
tory sustainability report on pages 73-103 and 110-
114, and that it is prepared in accordance with the 
Annual Accounts Act. 

Our examination has been conducted in accord-
ance with FAR’s auditing standard RevR 12 The audi-
tor´s opinion regarding the statutory sustainability 

report. This means that our examination of the 
statutory sustainability report is different and sub-
stantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
and generally accepted auditing standards in Swe-
den. We believe that the examination has provided 
us with sufficient basis for our opinion.

A statutory sustainability report has been 
prepared.

on Telia Company ABs (publ) Sustainability Report

This is the translation of the auditor’s report in 
Swedish.

To Telia Company AB (publ), corporate identity num-
ber 556103-4249

Introduction
We have been engaged by the Management of  
Telia Company AB (publ) to undertake a limited 
assurance engagement of the Telia Company AB 
Sustainability Report for the year 2022. The  
Company has defined the scope of the Sustainability 
Report on page 73-127 in this report. 

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and 
the Executive Management for the Sustainability 
Report
The Board of Directors and the Executive Manage-
ment are responsible for the preparation of the Sus-
tainability Report in accordance with the applicable 
criteria, as explained on page 105 in the Annual 
and Sustainability Report, and in the Telia Company 
Sustainability Reporting Framework 2022, available 
at www.teliacompany.com/sustainability/reporting, 
the accounting and calculation principles that the 
Company has developed. This responsibility also 
includes the internal control relevant to the prepara-
tion of a Sustainability Report that is free from mate-
rial misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.

Responsibilities of the auditor 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the 
Sustainability Report based on the limited assurance 
procedures we have performed. Our engagement is 
limited to historical information presented and does 
therefore not cover future-oriented information.

We conducted our limited assurance engagement 
in accordance with ISAE 3000 (revised) Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of His-
torical Financial Information. A limited assurance 
engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily 
of persons responsible for the preparation of the 
Sustainability Report, and applying analytical and 
other limited assurance procedures. The procedures 
performed in a limited assurance engagement vary 
in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a 
reasonable assurance engagement conducted in 
accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
and other generally accepted auditing standards in 
Sweden.

The firm applies International Standard on Quality 
Management 1, which requires the firm to design, 
implement and operate a system of quality man-
agement including policies or procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, profes-
sional standards and applicable legal and regu-
latory requirements. We are independent of Telia 

Management as described above. We consider 
these criteria suitable for the preparation of the  
Sustainability Report.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
conclusion below.

Conclusion
Based on the limited assurance procedures we have 
performed, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report, is 
not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors 
and Executive Management.

Alternative performance measures

Alternative performance measures
In addition to financial performance measures 
prepared in accordance with IFRS, Telia Company 
presents non-IFRS financial performance measures.
These alternative measures are considered to be 
important performance indicators for investors and 
other users of the Annual report. The alternative  
performance measures should be considered as  
a complement to, but not a substitute for, the infor-
mation prepared in accordance with IFRS. Telia  
Company’s definitions of these non-IFRS measures 
are described here and in the Definitions. These 

terms may be defined differently by other compa-
nies and are therefore not always comparable to 
similar measures used by other companies.

Service revenue
Service revenue like for like excludes exchange rate 
effects and is based on the current group structure, 
i.e. including the impact of any acquired operations 
and excluding the impact of any disposed oper-
ations, both in the current and in the comparable 
period, and was part of Telia Company’s Outlook for 
2022 and ambition for 2021-2023.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
Telia Company considers EBITDA as a relevant 
measure for investors to be able to understand 
profit generation before investments in tangible, 
intangible and right-of-use assets. To assist the 
understanding of Telia Company’s underlying 
financial performance we believe it is also useful to 
analyze Adjusted EBITDA. Adjustment items within 
EBITDA are specified in Board of Director’s Report, 
section “Adjustment items”. Adjusted EBITDA like for 
like excludes exchange rate effects and is based on 
the current group structure, i.e. including the 

impact of any acquired operations and excluding 
the impact of any disposed operations, both in the 
current and in the comparable period and was part 
of Telia Company’s Outlook for 2022 and ambition 
for 2021-2023.
