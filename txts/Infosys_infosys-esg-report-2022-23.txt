ESG is an opportunity
Most companies know that being socially conscious and 
responsible is non-negotiable today. By integrating ESG 
practices, businesses can effectively mitigate risks associated 
with environmental and social challenges, enhancing their long-
term sustainability and minimizing negative impacts.

At Infosys, we believe ESG consciousness is about creating 
a sustainable business where we care about including more 
people in our vision so we can drive value together, while at 
the same time, fostering social impact, promoting stakeholder 
engagement, emphasizing ethical governance, and unlocking 
investment and market opportunities. This is encapsulated 
beautifully in our purpose statement – to amplify human 
potential and create the next opportunity for people, businesses 
and communities. At Infosys, we believe ESG is an opportunity 
– an opportunity to contribute to a more sustainable, inclusive, 
and prosperous society.

Join us as we review the progress we’ve made in fiscal 2023 in 
this ESG Report. As always, we welcome and appreciate your 
feedback.

ESG is an opportunity
Dear stakeholder,

The business and ethical imperative for enterprises today is to focus on being sustainable, then 
acting at speed and scale to accelerate impact. At Infosys, whether it is leading from the front and 
being carbon neutral for the fourth consecutive year, on our journey to net zero, or driving digital 
reskilling to impact 8.5 million lives, we’ve been navigating our next in terms of creating a hopeful, 
progressive shared future. That we know is a responsibility.

And yet, for us, ESG is so much more than responsibility.

It is that powerful potential to continue to support the 2,40,000+ rural families who benefit from 
our carbon offset programs. To do all we can to harness tech for good. To energize platforms to 
nurture inclusion and belonging among our diverse employees, facilitate employee wellness and 
experience. With 1,35,355 women making 39.4% of the workforce, we are making steady progress 
toward our goal of 45% women in the organization by 2030. We launched an exclusive learning 
channel for our suppliers too, this year. It drives ESG learning and best practices while providing 
learners an opportunity to discuss, ideate and engage on ESG topics. It’s part of our overall effort 
to build responsible supply chains. It’s the opportunity for us to amplify human potential and 
create the next opportunity for people, businesses and communities.

Ethisphere Institute, the global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business 
practices, recognized our efforts, for the third year in a row, listing us as one of the world’s most 
ethical companies.

For us, however, the true reward of our efforts, continues to be the measurable impact we make on 
the ecosystem - building opportunities for everyone to thrive and grow responsibly.

Because, at Infosys, ESG is indeed an opportunity.

Approach to carbon neutrality

Infosys’ climate commitments
• As a part of our ESG Vision 2030, we 

have committed to maintaining carbon 
neutrality across Scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions, each year. 

• Our Climate Pledge, in partnership with 
Amazon and Global Optimism, is to 
become net zero by 2040. 

• Infosys is the first Indian company to 
participate in the RE 100 initiative and  
set an internal carbon price. 

• Our emission reduction targets are 
validated by the Science Based Target 
Initiative (SBTi).

Climate change

 Human activity has been increasingly driving 
the rise in global temperature, which has 
reached approximately 1.1° C above pre-
industrial levels. This has led to rapid and 
widespread impact on global climate systems. 
The year 2022 was marked by record droughts, 
heat waves, forest fires, floods, and a record low 
level of the Antarctic Sea ice, crippling human 
population across the world. Despite the Paris 
Agreement of 2015 reaching a milestone in 
cooperation among various countries to adopt 
strong measures for limiting global warming to 
1.5°C, the pace or scale of action has not been 
adequate to achieve the stated goals. As a step 

Environment

to mitigate the impacts of climate change, 
nations have adopted the Glasgow Climate 
Pact in 2021 with a goal to transform the 2020s 
into a decade of climate action and support. 
The World Economic Forum’s 2023 Global 
Risks Report focuses on the various sectors 
where the world is at a crucial juncture, calling 
for action to get ready for possible future 
catastrophes, while on the other hand, striving 
to build resilience. The signatories to the Paris 
Agreement, including India, have put forward 
their commitments to reduce Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) emissions in the form of INDCs (Intended 

Nationally Determined Contributions) based on 
their capabilities, circumstances and priorities.

At Infosys, climate change considerations 
continue to play a key role in all strategies: 
from mergers and acquisitions to leasing new 
offices and engagement with our stakeholders. 
While continuing to remain carbon neutral, 
Infosys also integrates strong efforts to better 
our sustainability performance by consistently 
embracing clean technology in our operations 
and client solutions, thereby minimizing the 
impact on the environment.

Emission reduction strategies
Our strategy for carbon neutrality 
remains the same—continue to reduce 
our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and 
offset the remaining emissions.

Scope 1

• Better operational efficiency of our 
Diesel Generator sets

• Better management of fugitive 
emissions from HVAC units

• Transition to Electric Vehicles (EVs) for 
company-owned vehicles

Scope 2

• Design and build or lease new offices 
with low Energy Performance Index 
(EPI)

• Retrofit old buildings to improve EPI

• Source renewable power

Scope 3

• Include a hybrid working model

• Promote EVs among employees

• Promote carpooling, public transport, 
and low to zero-emission modes of 
commute among employees

• Optimize business travel

• Adopt a life cycle approach for capital 
goods

Energy efficiency 
The growth of the IT sector has been 
phenomenal in the past decade and this 
has led to a major expansion of the Infosys 
workforce. 

Keeping this growing demand in mind, Infosys 
has been a pioneer in building sustainable 
campuses. From creating lush green campuses 
to implementing innovative technologies 
like radiant cooling, Infosys has deployed 
one of the largest enterprise-level energy 
conservation programs globally and achieved 
significant reduction in resource intensity over 
the past 15 years. 

Our buildings are the primary consumers of 
energy. We are committed to building our 
new infrastructure in a sustainable manner 
and pursuing energy efficiency projects 
in existing infrastructure. We will continue 
to implement innovative technologies in 
buildings and collaborate with experts and 
academia to ensure our infrastructure is 
greener and smarter. The focus areas for energy 
efficiency measures in green buildings and 
existing buildings continue to be lighting, 
air-conditioning, automation, UPS, building 
façade, data centers, and server rooms. 

In this process, we have not only achieved 
some of the global best standards in 
green buildings, but we have also set new 
benchmarks in green building certification. 

In fiscal 2023, we consumed 199.66 Million kWh 
power in our operations across the globe.

Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of 
buildings
Being a leader in design and construction 
of sustainable buildings, Infosys is doubling 
its efforts to reduce carbon emissions by 
considering a LCA of buildings that looks at the 
upstream and downstream carbon emissions 
during their life cycle. This information is used 
to make a comparative analysis of alternative 
materials and construction technologies that 
can help reduce overall environmental impact.

The LCA can be used for the following 
purposes:

1. Identify potential for improvement of 
environmental performance. 

2. Comparison of environmental performance 
using alternative materials. 

3. Documentation of environmental 
performance for certification, labelling and 
marketing.

4. Drive our climate action agenda across our 
supply chain.

Infosys Kolkata's LCA-based approach has set 
an example for the rest of the corporates. 

Renewable energy
Greening the energy mix
To enhance its efforts towards meeting the 
environmental goal of carbon neutrality, 
Infosys has adopted the use of renewable 
energy in its power mix. Infosys has set up solar 
PV panels on the rooftops of office buildings.  
In total, Infosys has 14.4 MW of rooftop and 
ground mount solar PV panels. Further Infosys 
has set up a 40 MW captive solar power plant 
at Sira, Karnataka. In total, Infosys has 60 MW of 
total installed solar capacity. 

Infosys also procures green energy through 
third-party power purchase agreements. 
Through these measures, Infosys has 57.9%

By collecting and reporting data metrics, 
companies can better understand the impact 
of their operations on the environment, society, 
and governance. This data helps in arriving at 
a baseline against which emissions reduction 
can be tracked and monitored including 
inefficiencies, leakages, and excessive usage of 
resources.

Infosys Hyderabad and Bhubaneshwar are 
utilizing renewable energy from the recently-
launched green tariff mechanism for  
Commercial and Industrial (C&I) consumers.

Infosys collects data continuously through its 
command centers. This command center allows 
us to schedule ‘auto-pilot operations’ using a 
built-in intelligence system. This has enabled 
us to monitor over 35 mn sq. ft. of office space. 
Analyzing this granular data, Infosys has made 
informed decisions in new building design and 
improved operational efficiencies. 

Our command center has also allowed us to 
adopt a data-driven operations approach 
to manage, on a real-time basis, occupant 
comfort, indoor air quality, energy intensity, 
water intensity, the health of critical assets, 
critical operations, renewable energy 
generation, water and waste treatment, and 
the overall performance at all levels within all 
our buildings in our campuses. 

This data has played an instrumental role in 
facilitating Infosys to be a leader in carbon 
neutrality and setting high benchmarks in the 
industry.

Nurturing social development 
Carbon offset program 
Infosys was among the first corporates to 
commit to bold climate action. The Company 
took up active measures to reduce and 
streamline the energy demand in its campuses. 
This demand-focused approach helped in 
reducing carbon emissions to a great extent. 
Infosys has also invested in renewable energy 
(solar PV) plants to avoid emissions. However, 
there are unavoidable emissions due to 
business travel, employee commute etc., that 
had to be offset to achieve carbon neutrality. 

Infosys’ carbon offset program has carefully 
selected grassroots social development 
projects, implemented them at scale to 

Since 2016, we have implemented eight 
efficient cookstove projects, four biogas, one 
each of rural electrification and integrated 
community-based projects (solar, cookstove, 
street lighting and public health center) across 
India. 

Carbon neutral events
Infosys organizes a few public events 
through the year. In 2023, Infosys 
envisioned to make these events a 
hallmark of sustainability. Environment-
friendly measures, like the use of 
sustainable construction materials, 
water conservation measures and zero 
plastic use, emphasized Infosys’ holistic 
approach to sustainability. Detailed 
carbon emissions were calculated for the 
travel of the participants to the event. 
These were then compensated by Infosys’ 
carbon credits. This effort made all the 
major events organized by Infosys in 2023 
carbon neutral with minimum impact on 
the environment.

2,40,000+
rural families continue to benefit 
from our carbon offset programs

generate emission offsets. While this approach 
requires careful long-term planning, intense 
due diligence, and strict management control, 
it is significantly more rewarding.

Infosys partnered with local NGOs to undertake 
projects in rural India that would benefit 
society. These projects include improved 
cookstoves and household biogas plants, 
which improved rural livelihoods, community 
health and social harmony. Improved indoor 
air quality and diversified income have ensured 
a better standard of living for women and 
children.

focus 
For one of the largest Aircraft Maintenance, 
Repair and Overhaul (MRO) providers, 
Infosys is defining and executing a digital 
transformation strategy focused on reducing 
their carbon footprint by implementing a 
Digital Factory solution at scale across the 
client’s manufacturing, assembly, and MRO 
factories across the globe. The solution 
contains several parts such as real-time overall 
equipment effectiveness (OEE), condition-
based monitoring of assets, real-time asset 
tracking, smart asset maintenance, intelligent 
planning and dynamic scheduling. The client 
achieved a 10% improvement of OEE resulting 

in an additional production of 10%. With the 
adoption of smart planning algorithms for 
better machine and workforce utilization, 
energy, and waste management solutions, 
Infosys helped to reduce the carbon footprint 
by over 10% for each of their 20 plants. 

Support to a global research 
facility to cut carbon emissions 
A global research facility wanted to reduce its 
carbon footprint and establish itself as a leader 
in its field. Infosys assisted them by using 
materiality assessment frameworks to identify 
target ESG areas, ranking them from highest 
to lowest in impact and priority. The client’s 
wider procurement rules and processes were 
updated to new environmentally responsible 
policy and processes through workshops and 
online sessions, particularly with category 
managers. Specific training courses were 
creates for teams and individuals. To identify 
and negotiate the optimal solution for the 
requirements of the client, an assessment of 
external ESG best practice measurement tools 
was also done. 

Sustainable materials traceability 
Infosys partnered with a leading apparel 
manufacturer to develop a road map of digital 
product traceability through digital product 
identification. The identification process links 
physical products with the digital world to 
improve product authentication. To track the 
client's progress on the goals of its 'Design the 
Change' initiative, Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) were established. Estimated fabric 
content and sustainable fabric content were 
calculated to provide accurate labeling of fabric 
quality through DataIKU and MicroStrategy.

Infosys also helped implement a report 
system to track the client’s sustainability 
goals through sustainable product certificate 
validation, product authentication, digitized 
value chain, sustainable product KPIs, pre-
production sustainability standards and 
calculated sustainable fabric content. This 
would accelerate the client's journey towards 
achieving the target of having 100% of a unit's 
production meet at least one of the sustainable 
material criteria by 2025.

Live and accurate GHG reporting 
for carbon neutrality 
A leading consumer goods company set 
sustainability goals for net zero emissions 
(Scope 1, 2, 3). The company aimed for 100% of 
carbon strategic suppliers to set science-based 
targets by 2025 and use 100% renewable 
electricity by 2030. Infosys offered a solution 
which focused on creating data products 
related to Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions defined 
by the GHG Protocol, while also helping to 
define KPIs to track progress. The objective 
was to integrate data to provide a single 
cross-system ID for consolidated reporting 
and curating GHG protocol-compliant data 
products through live, automated and accurate 
reporting, which would further reduce 
compliance risks. 

Measuring environmental impact 
of waste 
A major waste processor approached Infosys 
to develop a sustainability data hub, the first 
of its kind in the industry, to gather, organize 
and report measured and calculated waste 
volumes, and the resultant environmental 
impacts. Infosys helped in the integration of 

data from multiple transactional, operational, 
and billing systems, across multiple regions. 
Infosys also aided the development of a 
balanced scorecard to deliver near-real-
time operational waste metrics. The API 
and dashboard-enabled data hub helped in 
delivering daily output and analysis of waste 
and diversion volumes, including resultant 
emissions. 

Support for energy management 
for a leading pharma company 
Infosys’ deep experience and expertise in 
energy management enabled it to help a 
leading pharma company enhance energy 
performance. Infosys’ systematic approach 
helped identify key areas of improvement 
to facilitate incident management and

for American multinational 
Infosys enabled the digital transformation 
of an EHS product portfolio for an American 
multinational involved in heating, ventilation, 
and air-conditioning solutions. With a 
systematic approach, Infosys helped enhance 
the client’s time-to-market. This facilitated 
faster data collection, contextualization, and 
data aggregation to ensure that sustainability 
metrics are properly published addressing 
stakeholder expectations. Infosys also helped 
ensure optimal functionality for the EHS 
modules of the client. 

Mobile and web implementation 
of incident management for 
railroad firm 
Infosys implemented a system to enable the 
client, a railroad firm, to have the flexibility 
to facilitate daily operations. With its deep 
experience and expertise in data management, 
Infosys helped to handle sensitive data 
and prevent problems in a timely manner. 
Infosys developed apps to enable the client 
to enhance its EHS performance while also 
leveraging technology to monitor, report and 
effectively manage the digital transformation. 

Advanced robotic solution to 
clean and coat conductors 
Infosys supported the sustainability agenda 
of the Prysmian Group by partnering for a key

overhead conductor, which has the potential 
to work both in energized and unenergized 
conditions. This robotics innovation project is 
a great innovation for the energy and utilities 
industry. 

End-to-end energy service 
solution for large REIT client
Infosys helped one of its REIT (Real Estate 
Investment Trusts) clients implement a 
sustainable logistics system by offering an end-
to-end energy service solution that focused 
on energy savings and supply insights of the 
client’s warehouse customers. The system 
effectively implemented data collection 
across EV charging, EV utilization, as well as 
third-party data across multiple sites and 
geographies. This optimized energy solution 
integrated with a modular technology platform 
not only enhanced the client’s progress 
towards sustainability goals but also reinforced 
Infosys’ commitment to being a driver in the 
clients’ impactful ESG transformation. 

ESG integrated reporting for a 
large FSI 
When a large financial services company 
sought to build an ESG platform to assess 
climate risks and their impact on other risks 
(credit, market, operational and others), Infosys 
offered a comprehensive solution for emissions 
reporting along with a risk management and 
scenario analysis framework. The goal was 
to report financed emissions internally and 
externally, forecast emission intensity and 
temperature alignment of the company's 
portfolio to well below the 2-degree scenario 
(Paris Agreement) and to achieve net zero 
greenhouse gas emissions from its operations, 
supply chain and financing activities by 2050. 
A solution was formulated to create a process 
to set risk appetite limits and track exposure 
against those limits. 

Sustainability data for investment 
management 
Regulatory requirements to report an 
organization's sustainability performance are 
becoming complex and global. At the same 
time, asset stewardship and engagement 
reporting requires organizations to create 
on-demand reports along with standard ones. 

Climate change Environment

To centralize and share ESG technology and 
operations data across business areas, Infosys 
worked on leveraging ESG and climate data 
sets for client and product reporting. Infosys 
has outlined a simplified and scalable solution 
to support asset stewardship, ESG investments, 
enterprise risk, and client, product and 
regulatory reporting along with automated 
processes for productivity gains. The aim was 
to enhance ESG Business Intelligence (BI) 
reporting capability to assist business groups 
and client Queries via a strategic data platform 
activation.

Water conservation 

WATER 

Rainwater harvesing at Infosys Hyderabad

We have evaluated the water stress zones in 
line with the WRI guidelines for all our locations 
globally. The details of water stress zones and 
withdrawals are available in BRSR. 100% of our 
water withdrawal from various sources has 
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) which is less than 
1,000 mg/L and hence considered as fresh 
water.

We are continuously preparing our campuses 
to be water sustainable by reducing freshwater 
intake and implementing water conservation 
initiatives. Retrofits and consolidation in 
building operations brought down freshwater 
consumption in various locations. Our 
freshwater consumption is solely for human 
sustenance and hence, we believe we do 
not significantly impact water resources. 
We are focused on reducing our freshwater 
consumption through many initiatives. A 
comprehensive water management strategy 
has been devised to achieve water sufficiency. 
Water usage is reduced through demand side 
measures and 100% of wastewater is recycled 
within our campuses.

Environment

UNICEF estimates that by 2025, more than 50% 
of the world’s population could live in areas 
with scarce water resources. Due to severe 
water scarcity, 700 million people could lose 
their lives by 2030. To address this challenge, 
it is crucial to develop sustainable systems 
that can efficiently store and use fresh water. 
Moreover, there is a need for land management 
techniques that preserve the integrity of the 
water cycle. We, at Infosys, are committed to 
minimizing our water footprint and improving 
water accessibility in the communities in which 
we operate. 

Since 2000, the frequency and length of 
droughts have increased by almost a third

Rainwater harvesting
Rainwater harvesting is an important part 
of our water stewardship goal. Our India 
campuses are equipped with rooftop rainwater 
harvesting, harvesting tanks, recharge wells 
and artificial lakes. These reduce our external 
freshwater dependency and also help to 
replenish the groundwater table in the areas 
we operate in. Our campuses in Chennai 
MCity, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad and 
Bengaluru have achieved maximum rainwater 
harvesting last year. We are continuing efforts 
to strengthen rainwater harvesting in our other 
India locations too.

Rooftop rainwater harvesting 
Rooftop rainwater harvesting systems have 
helped us offset freshwater purchases from 
external sources.

Understanding the significance, the UN CEO 
water mandate experienced historic growth, 
and its Water Resilience Coalition, which places 
global water stress on corporate agenda's, also 
experienced record growth. As a signatory to 
the UN CEO Water Mandate, we commit to 
enhancing our operational water conservation 
procedures and expanding our community 
outreach. We are committed to water 
conservation through the 3R (Reduce, Reuse,

Smart water irrigation projects 
Smart irrigation systems have been piloted in 
our Mysuru and Chennai campuses. Projects in 
Gurgaon, Hyderabad (STP) and Bengaluru are 
under evaluation. Careful planning to ensure 
lesser grass cover, the use of native species 
and the continued development of irrigation 
infrastructure including automated irrigation 
and drip irrigation have ensured lesser water use. 

Wastewater treatment plant 
(WTP) and STP retrofits 
Retrofitting WTPs and STPs using latest 
technologies for efficient and economic 
operations is an important strategy. We have 
ensured that all the treated water is reused 
in our campuses and its quality is monitored 
regularly to ensure adherence to all applicable 
norms. New designs for WTPs ensure they are 
better optimized for size, treatment technology 
and improved treated water quality. Old 
treatment plants have been retrofitted with 
advanced membrane bio reactor technology 
that gives better treated water quality, 
meeting all wastewater treatment norms. We 
ensure that we treat and reuse 100% of the 
wastewater generated through our business 
operations within our campuses for flushing, 
landscaping and cooling tower applications. 
Consequently, freshwater withdrawal has 
reduced drastically.

Upgrade of STP to  
Membrane Bio Reactor (MBR) 
Non-MBR Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) 
were upgraded to MBR technology to improve 
treated water quality and utilize treated water 
for all recycling purposes. In fiscal 2023, we 
have upgraded the STP plants in Chennai 
Sholingnallur, Nagpur, Pune Phase I locations.

Waste management 
Today, we use the equivalent of 1.5 Earths 
to meet the resource needs of everyday life. 
According to an estimate of the carrying 
capacity of our planet, it takes the Earth 
18 months to restore what is used in just 
12 months. Every year, the world produces 
2.01 billion tons of municipal solid waste, 
of which, at least 33% is not handled in an 
environmentally responsible way. 

Today, waste management is a crucial 
challenge globally. Waste management 
includes the collection, segregation, and 
disposal of waste. Waste collection is a critical 
step in managing waste. Segregation of waste 
at source helps in quick disposal and has 
monetary advantages like extracting energy 
from the methane generated by decomposing 
waste. Solid waste management operations are 
typically a local responsibility, and nearly 70% 
of countries have established institutions with 
the responsibility for policy development and 
regulatory oversight in the waste sector. 

Infosys’ waste management approach is based 
on the philosophy of Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish, 
Repurpose and Recycle. We seek to uphold 
our ambition of zero waste to landfills through 
active minimization combined with technology 
investment in recycling and streamlining 
systems and processes. With our efforts, we 
contribute to a circular economy and convert 
waste into resources. Infosys has established 
robust waste management practices, focusing 
on waste collection, segregation and disposal 
of waste. 

Segregation at source
Waste segregation at source refers to the 
process of identifying and segregating various 
types of solid wastes at the place or location 
of their generation. We segregate waste 
mainly into two categories - hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste. Separate storage of 
various components of solid waste such as 
biodegradable wastes including landscape 
/ garden waste and food waste and non-
biodegradable wastes including sanitary 
waste and non-recyclable inert waste, various 
categories of e-waste, and construction and 
demolition wastes is practiced. A color code for 
bins has been implemented for different types 
of waste. 

The Infosys waste management practice 
involves segregation of waste at source, 
secondary segregation, efficient collection 
and handling, recycling, and effective disposal 
of all wastes while adhering to applicable 
legislations. This enables reduction of negative 
environmental impacts. We also insist on eco-
friendly packaging for all our purchases.

Reuse
We follow a waste hierarchy and we prefer reuse over recycling. Waste generated at source gets 
segregated and evaluated for reuse if possible. Waste like wood, STP sludge and bio manure slurry 
from bio-methanation plants gets reused inside the campus. Construction and demolition waste 
is sent to government authorized landfill sites where it further gets reused for various purposes 
by the municipal corporation. Used oil from kitchens is utilized in biogas plants as it has high 
codigestion COD (chemical oxygen demand) levels, which in turn generates increased biogas.

tons/day are installed across India locations 
to enable conversion of landscape waste into 
compost, which can then be used as organic 
manure in our landscaping applications.

As on date, our biogas plants have a capacity 
to treat 10 tons of waste a day. The bio-
methanation plants/ bioreactors in Infosys 
are high-rate digesters where the organic 
loading rate is significantly higher even when 
its loaded close to its rated capacity. Bi-phasic 
bio-digestion, known for its effectiveness, 
was tested at one of the Infosys sites. This 
testing helped overcome challenges, such 
as inconsistent input feed rate as well as the 
quality of wet waste. The trial was a great 
success as we were able to establish process 
stabilization at all our bio-methanation plants 
across India.

Recycling
Waste such as paper, plastic and metal, are 
recycled, converted into other usable forms 
and circulated back to the supply chain. 
We have established biogas plants in our 
campuses where food waste and landscape 
waste is treated through bio-methanation 
process, which produces biogas an alternative 
to LPG in our food courts. We also have sludge 
drying beds located next to our biogas plants 
to dry the slurry. Soon after sun drying, dried 
manure can be used for landscaping. Vermi

Waste

Mixed waste challenge 
In fiscal 2023, development centers in India had 
dedicated authorized vendors to collect, sort 
and dispose mixed waste to ensure minimal 
waste to landfills and maximize recycling. 

Co-processing achieves a superior 
environmental performance as compared 
to landfill and incineration which can 
be demonstrated through life-cycle 
assessment of waste. Co-processing 
is also recognized by the UNEP Basel 
Convention as a practical, cost-efficient, 
safe and environmentally-preferred 
option compared to other waste 
treatment options.

Co-processing
Co-processing is the use of waste as raw 
material, or as a source of energy, or both to 
replace natural mineral resources and fossil 
fuels. Generally, waste which cannot be reused 
or recycled and has high calorific value is 
selected for co-processing. 

At Infosys, waste such as tetra packs, tea bags, 
rubber waste, paper packaging, low value 
plastic, plastic gunny bags, thermacol, foam, 
carpets, discarded mop refills, lanyards, ceramic 
waste, flex banners, artificial grass mats, floor 
mats, glass waste, cloth waste etc., are sent for 
co-processing.

Environment

Waste vendor evaluation 
At Infosys, our green procurement policy 
ensures rigorous vendor evaluation. Waste 
vendors undergo a detailed vendor site audit 
against several regulatory requirements. 
Post this, commercial proposals are invited 
and scrutinized to ensure they comply 
with requirements. The proposals are then 
shared with the commercial team for further 
negotiations, if any. Once this process is 
completed, a formal agreement is entered into 
with the vendors. Vendors are audited annually 
based on the waste vendor checklist. 

E-waste management
At Infosys, we have been persistent in our 
efforts to ensure that we reduce, reuse, recycle 
and dispose e-waste responsibly. Our e-waste 
includes computers, desktops, laptops, 
keyboards, mobiles, printers, cartridges and 
batteries. Generated e-waste is always sent 
back to original manufacturers (under buyback 
schemes) or authorized recyclers who provide 
us certificates on the successful recycling 
and recovery of the material. The selection 
of authorized recyclers is done keeping in 
mind the extent of resource circularity in 
their process. E-waste is regulated through 
legislation and hence we evaluate the vendor 
to ensure all compliances are addressed prior 
to disposal.

Environmental compliance
We have a strong environmental management 
system aligned with ISO 14001:2015 standards 
across all India locations in line with our HSE 
strategy and covers a significant portion of 
the employees across the organization.  The 
management system is implemented across 
locations globally based on applicable legal 
requirements and internal benchmarks and are 
a part of our internal audit coverage.  

We ensure adherence to the applicable legal 
requirements across our locations. We conduct 
environmental impact assessments for all our 
routine and non-routine activities and the 
significant concerns creating an environmental 
impact include depletion of resources like 
power and water, waste generation and 
disposal, and emissions that are part of our 
material aspects. 

Environmental impacts of new services, 
activities and changes in process or legislations 
are also conducted. We conduct environmental 
impact assessment studies for all new projects, 
wherever applicable, covering impacts related 
to air, water, social aspects, and biodiversity, 
among others.  

No cases of monetary or non-monetary 
sanctions for violations or environmental 
grievances have been reported in fiscal 2023. 

Our campuses are built on state-approved 
land in industrial areas and are not adjacent to 
protected areas or biodiversity areas. 

A process for monitoring requirements in 
line with legal requirements is established 
and we ensure that all parameters are always 
maintained well within the defined norms.

Waste disposal options
As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 
and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) 
guidelines, bio medical waste, oil-soaked 
cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other wastes 
are disposed of through authorized agencies. 
These agencies incinerate the waste as per 
prescribed guidelines. The resultant ash is sent 
to Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) 
landfills for safe disposal and in a few locations, 
it is diverted for cement manufacturing.

TRUE Certification-  
zero waste to landfill
Infosys’ India centers are heading 
towards the 2030 target of zero waste to 
landfills through the adoption of TRUE 
Zero Waste Certification.

In fiscal 2023, we embarked on a journey 
to obtain TRUE Zero Waste Certification 
through Green Business Certification 
Inc. (GBCI) for our owned  campuses at 
Bengaluru, Chennai and Pune. 

We have diverted 

90.45% of mixed waste

Employees 
We endeavor to provide employees with 
new learning experiences and future-ready 
skills through two large interventions— the 
foundation program and the continuous 
education program.

The foundation training program is designed to 
mold newly onboarded entry-level engineering 
and science graduates into corporate 
professionals. The continuous education 
program aims at upskilling or reskilling existing 
employees and sets the tone for lifelong 
learning.

provide entry-level graduates an exposure to 
the latest technologies.

Continuous education program
Lex, our versatile learning platform, helps 
our employees keep abreast of the latest 
technologies by learning anytime and from 
anywhere. With the remote-first approach, 
Lex also provides technology playgrounds to 
practice, and get certified using the in-house 

employees with hands-on exposure to cloud 
technologies. Some of these interventions 
include Microsoft Cloud Pro, a mega Microsoft 
Cloud Certification drive. 

A web version of the global news publication, 
Financial Times, was launched in Lex for 
employees. We have introduced a LinkedIn 
subscription this year, with over 9,000 courses. 

Foundation education program
The Infosys Foundation Education Program is a 
16 to 19 weeks residential training program, to

Tech for good
Social

Technology presents innumerable opportunities to resolve some of the world’s most challenging 
issues. At Infosys, we are committed to scaling impact and empowering lives through leveraging 
digital technology in the areas of e-governance, healthcare, and education. 

Tech for good in e-governance 
Infosys has embarked on country-wide projects in e-governance. We have joined hands with 
various governments to transform the way government organizations interact with citizens, 
businesses, and other government entities. The goal is to make government services more 
accessible, efficient, and responsive to the needs of citizens. Infosys is leading this in India with 
its ongoing projects in e-governance including income tax, Goods and Services Tax (GST) and 
customs.

Digital shared infra for social good 
Our focus on digital infrastructure as a service (IaaS) seeks to empower social foundations and 
entrepreneurs to help expand the impact of their efforts. This infrastructure includes the Super 
App framework and various microservices for engagement, learning, campaigns, surveys, job 
marketplace, surveillance, case management, supplier management, telemetry, reporting and 
analytics. A modular approach allows these services to be combined and configured on our Super 
App mobile application to meet the needs of social entrepreneurs.

Indian customs portal
Indian Customs Electronic Data Interchange 
Gateway (ICEGATE) is the national portal of the 
Indian Customs of the Central Board of Indirect 
Taxes and Customs (CBIC) that provides e-filing 
services to trade, cargo carriers, and other 
trading partners electronically. ICEGATE serves 
as an interface between the trade users and 
the customs department and acts as a hub for 
exchanging information with external trading 
partners involved in international trade. Infosys 
is currently maintaining and enhancing the 
existing ICEGATE1.0 and has received positive 
feedback from users. The bigger scope of 
work for Infosys is to develop ICEGATE 2.0 
involving technology transformation to a 
microservices / API-based architecture along 
with enhanced and new functionalities to build 
a more efficient, transparent, contactless, and 
paperless ecosystem. 

MOSIP
Infosys has partnered with the International 
Institute of Information Technology, Bengaluru 
(IIIT-B) to support the Modular Open Source 
Identity Platform (MOSIP). MOSIP is a global 
digital public good project anchored by IIIT-B. 
It helps governments implement a digital 
foundational identity in a vendor-neutral, 
interoperable and cost-effective manner. 
MOSIP is currently being adopted by more than 
10 countries, either as national rollouts or as 
pilots. Infosys is contributing to a few modules 
as part of the tech for good effort. Through this 
partnership, Infosys will contribute towards  
ID-led transformation efforts on a national 
scale.Income tax

The Integrated E-Filing and Central Processing 
Center program takes the tax automation 
journey, which started 10 year ago, to the next 
level. The program not only integrates filing 
and processing into a single platform, it also 
brings innovation to each of the layers. In filing, 
the focus was on simplification and scale. With 
innovative features like tax wizard, mobile 
application and pre-fill of tax forms, the new 
portal makes it easier and more convenient 
for taxpayers to file their income tax returns 
and access related services. In processing the 
entire engine was redesigned with modern 
technology tools and patterns resulting in 
dramatic reduction in wait time for release of 
refunds (from 79 days to 7 days).

Goods and Services Tax 
Network (GSTN)
Infosys partnered with the GSTN to 
implement and manage the indirect taxation 
platform for GST in India. The platform was 
designed to assist taxpayers in preparing, 
filing returns, making payments of indirect 
tax liabilities, and maintaining additional 
compliances. This unique and complex IT 
project established a uniform interface for 
taxpayers under indirect taxes, which was 
achieved through a common and shared IT 
infrastructure between the central and state 
governments. This has significantly simplified 
the tax compliance process for taxpayers, by 
reducing the burden of maintaining separate 
systems and complying with varying state-
level tax regulations, and has made it easier 
for taxpayers to maintain their tax records 
accurately.

Museum of Memories Project

‘The Museum of Memories’ project for the 
Dementia Research Institute was launched.

Focused on raising awareness around how 
dementia disproportionately affects women, 
WongDoody created the ‘Museum of Memories’

memories from women who have experienced 
dementia. We brought their precious moments 
to life, in a way that’s not possible in the 
physical word and then stored these memories 
in the blockchain as ‘digital heirlooms’ so they 
can never degrade or disappear.

The website also details positive lifestyle 
behaviour changes that aid in preventing 
dementia in later life.

Supported by short documentaries, nationwide 
advertising placements, and an influencer 
campaign we’ve seen an earned media reach of 
125 million (including coverage in the UK’s BBC 
Radio) plus results from the social influencer 
work reaching 1,25,000 views, 15,000 likes and 
an average engagement rate of 10.5% (the 
industry average is 4.5%).

Employee wellness and experience

For over 40 years, Infosys has set the pace in delivering excellence for clients, valuing employees 
as our greatest asset, and being a responsible community stakeholder, while embracing best 
practices in corporate governance and ethics. 

Our purpose 
To amplify human potential and create the 
next opportunity for people, businesses, and 
communities. 

Our people are crucial to our purpose. To meet 
the challenges that our industry, clients, and 
society face at large, we need people who 
function at their best, creating and developing 
opportunities to move us all forward.

Deeply tied to our purpose are principles that

Client value, Leadership by example, Integrity 
and transparency, Fairness and Excellence. 
These principles permeate everything we 
do. They are deeply embedded in our teams, 
upheld by leaders across the organization, and 
readily recognized by every employee. 

We call our employees ‘Infoscions’ because they 
are the true custodians of the culture, legacy, 
and purpose of Infosys worldwide.

Employee journey map

Digital-first, personalized employee life cycle application 
We have transformed ourselves into a Live Enterprise, offering digital-first personalized experience 
for our employees across life-cycle events. We used our Live Enterprise suite of technologies for 
this. Some of our offerings that deliver employee experience are listed below:

Creating employee experience 
through digital transformation 
We are committed to creating a world-class 
experience for our employees. We believe this 
will inspire employees to deliver their best 
for our clients. As our employees develop a 
digital future for our clients, we want them to 
experience the same in their day-to-day work 
at Infosys. Hence, the digitization of human 
resources processes and practices becomes 
a critical lever to create a great workplace 
experience.

Transforming the employee experience at scale 
in a company of more than 3,43,000 people 
spread across 56 countries is only possible 
through technology. For us, digitization was 
the only way forward. We are reimagining 
experience using a combination of process 
busting, automation and digital transformation 
in people practices to create consumer-grade 
digital experience for our employees. Through 
digitization, we are simplifying our processes, 
eliminating unnecessary approval steps 
and leading straight through processing. 
An example of this is InfyMe, our mobile-
first, self-service platform that brings all 
services to our employees’ fingertips anytime, 
anywhere. InfyMe is designed to be intuitive 
and contextual and aids networking and 
collaboration. We continued to enrich our 
InfyMe app with more services that enable 
teams to operate, connect and collaborate 
easily and it is particularly effective in the 
hybrid work model. More than 200 touchpoints 
for activities have been merged into the 
intuitive interface of InfyMe.

We are making our performance appraisal 
process light, easy and convenient. As a first 
step, we have introduced a senior management 
review interface on InfyMe. Through this, we 
are enabling an enhanced user experience, 
faster navigation, seamless data integration 

and a unified experience around development, 
performance and careers. We are leveraging 
the power of the Live Enterprise platform 
to enable timely nudges around actions, 
performance and development.   

We are also focused on automation of backend, 
administrative activities that can free up 
HR personnel and enable them to focus on 
enhancing employee experience and forming 
strategic partnerships with business. An 
example of this is Launchpad, our onboarding 
platform, which has enabled us to digitize our 
onboarding process. This mobile-based app 
provides a guided flow that helps new hires 
initiate their onboarding process, complete 
all the necessary documentation and data 
updates before their date of joining. With all 
operational processes taken care of prior to 
joining, employees are engaged in a more 
meaningful way with managers, teams and HR 
from Day 1. 

In addition to the above, we are making our 
systems smarter with: 

• Nudges to managers and employees to 
drive the right behavior on closures and 
guide managers to take the right decisions 
in matters like role change, retention, etc. 

• Chatbots that provide instant resolutions to 
queries and transactions 

• Omni-channel experience for employees to 
get on call support using a conversational 
IVR that uses natural language voice inputs 
from callers to direct them to the right 
agents for support 

• Self-service portals 

• Robotic process automations in people 
processes to reduce manual work

Nurturing great managers 
It is our managers who develop and mentor 
teams while making a world of opportunities 
available to them. Preparing managers to 
lead amid change and emerging industry 
challenges is crucial to our success. 

We launched our flagship management 
initiative, the Infosys Great Manager Program, 
to help prepare all our managers for the rapidly

immersive development and nurtures four 
crucial skills: digital mindset, leadership, 
business acumen and operational excellence. 
By mastering these, our managers enhance 
their technical expertise and acquire soft 
skills that enable them to have wide-reaching 
influence. 

Infosys Manager Code
For the third consecutive year, Infosys is among 
the Top 50 Companies with Great Managers 
2022 in India, through the Great Manager 
Awards conducted by People Business and 
Economic Times.

The Infosys Manager Code are guiding 
principles on how to become a good manager. 
It is a comprehensive guide for any manager 
who would want to set an example for his 
team members, especially in this rapidly 
transforming and ever-competitive business 
landscape. A flipbook with enablement 
kits, leader blogs, manager enablement 
sessions, inspiring stories of ‘Awesome 
Bosses’, communication toolkits to manage 
the pandemic were some of our stand-out

controls are implemented, the document is 
revisited to assess the residual risks. A ranking 
is done based on the severity and probability 
of the risk. The Occupational Health and 
Safety (OH&S) hazards in the workplace are 
communicated to all concerned stakeholders 
who are also consulted when there are 
changes in operations. Relevant OH&S hazards 
are identified, and appropriate operational 
controls are implemented. During training, 
the hazards are shared along with directions 
on ways to reduce the risk. Employees are also 
consulted during development and review 
of policies and procedures to manage risks. 
Emergency response procedures for different 
scenarios are established and mock drills are 
conducted to evaluate our preparedness, 
response and learnings. 

Employee wellness and experience Social

Occupational Health and Safety
Safety and well-being at the workplace is 
an important consideration in a responsible 
business and Infosys accords the highest 
priority to this aspect. The Health, Safety and 
Environmental (HSE) Management System 
at Infosys termed ‘Ozone’ is driven by the 
Management commitment, legal requirements 
and expectations of our stakeholders. Ozone 
has not only enabled us to obtain assurance on 

Management System 
The robust management system has enabled 
us achieve certification to ISO 45001:2018 
and ISO 14001:2015 standards across all India 
locations, including Infosys Limited and its 
subsidiaries, in line with our HSE strategy. The 
management system is implemented across 
locations globally based on applicable legal 
requirements and internal benchmarks and 
are a part of our internal audit coverage. At 
the helm of our Health, Safety, Environment 
Management System (HSEMS) is our Executive 
Vice President-Finance and Chief Risk 

a. Risk management
Ozone is based on the Demings cycle 
and has a focused risk-based approach in 
ensuring identification and implementation 
of operational controls in line with hierarchy 
and effective mitigation of hazards. Risk 
assessment is proactively conducted to 
identify hazards for all existing / new / 
modified activities, processes, products or 
services and the implementation of measures 
to minimize or control impacts and monitor 
them in a structured manner. Risk assessment 
is proactively conducted on a yearly basis 
or at the beginning of a new process or 
activity. Reactive risk assessments are also 
carried out at least once every quarter based 
on incidents that have occurred during the 
period. Hazardous conditions present are 
identified and prioritized for elimination 
and control. Once the identified hierarchy of 

the processes instituted through certifications 
but has also fostered a culture of safety and 
well-being across the organization. We ensure 
adherence to all applicable regulations in all 
the regions we operate across the globe. We 
consciously strive to ensure zero accidents, 
physical and emotional well-being, and safety 
of our stakeholders.

Officer. The effectiveness and adequacy of 
the HSE framework, its execution and HSE 
performance are evaluated through periodic 
management reviews. The internal-external 
issues and opportunities for the organizational 
context are identified. Interested parties 
(including all our stakeholders), their 
needs and expectations, our expectations, 
legal requirements, owners and mode of 
communication are also documented. Some of 
the elements of the management system are 
listed below:

b. Incident management
Incidents which include near misses / potential 
hazards / accidents are reported through 
internal applications, supervisors, or mails. Root 
causes of incidents are identified, analyzed 
and appropriate corrective actions are taken 
to avoid recurrence or occurrence of incidents 
leading to injuries / losses.

c. Occupational Health and Safety 
(OH&S) Committees
OH&S Committees comprising cross-functional 
teams are established at each of our campuses 
and offices. The Development Center Heads 

chair the safety committee meetings at their 
respective locations in India. In our overseas 
offices, these committees are formed based 
on the local legislations. The representation 
of employees in safety committees is 100%. 
The committee ensures the establishment, 
implementation, maintenance, and continual 
improvement of processes needed for the 
elimination of hazards and minimization of 
risks. Contract workers are also an intrinsic part 
of the committee, which is one of the ways to 
ensure participation and consultation.

d. Training and awareness 
Embedding HSE culture in the organization 
necessitates competency development. 
Training needs are identified based on 
the nature of jobs, which may have a 
significant impact on the environment or 
may pose occupational health and safety 
risks. Training includes awareness building, 
mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic 
demonstrations. HSEMS training is also a part 
of our employee induction program. To enable 
continuous learning, a HSE awareness module 
is available on Lex, our internal learning 
platform. Job-specific and generic trainings 
are conducted for contractual staff during 
induction and later through refresher training. 

e. Health and safety interventions 
We have always focused on building a culture 
of safety at Infosys. Individual responsibility 
for safety is always emphasized. Safety in the 
workplace is one of the highest priorities. 
Systems have been established to ensure the 
same, including work permits, trainings, Lock 
out, Tag out (LOTO), safety inspections, audits, 
operational controls and monitoring. Policies 
and processes, which cover various aspects of 
safety, have been established. These include 
women’s safety, lone working, transport, 
travel and construction, among others. Gaps, 
learnings, deviations and findings, if any, are 
identified, controls implemented and tracked 
for effective closure. As Infosys is an IT / ITES 
company, there are no product risks but there 
are risks including those related to provision of 
services like ergonomics, emotional well-being, 
risks associated with operation of utilities, 
commute. We have established numerous 
initiatives, interventions, virtual sessions, and 
process controls to address them. Awareness 
sessions are conducted for ergonomics across 
locations. Workstations and furniture are 
designed and procured after considering their 
ergonomic advantages. We have also taken 

care to procure systems which have inbuilt 
features that help avoid glare and hence 
reduce such instances. Sessions on ergonomics 
help address work-related conditions such as 
myalgia. Ergonomic incidents reported are 
treated and exercise regimens suggested. 
During fiscal 2023, 39 occupational ergonomics 
issues were reported.

Various interventions on physical and 
emotional well-being were enabled under 
the aegis of our HALE / SAFE initiatives during 
the year. Well-equipped occupational health 
centers / physiotherapy facilities are available 
on our campuses in India. The telemedicine 
portal through which employees can consult 
our occupational health center doctors online 
was operational in India during the year. 
Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) programs include 
BBS observation for contract staff, periodic 
inspections, trainings, observations from mock 
drills and employee engagement programs. 

f. Participation and consultation 
The process includes: 

• Employee consultation in development 
and review of policies and procedures to 
manage risks 

• Consultation where there are any changes 
that affect workplace health and safety; 
a management of change procedure is in 
place to address health and safety issues 
before a change occurs 

• Representation of employees in health 
and safety matters; the Safety Committee 
includes employee and contract workmen 
representatives 

• The OH&S hazards in the workplace are 
communicated to all concerned including 
contractors and visitors. They are also 
consulted when there are changes in 
operations and the relevant OH&S hazards 
are identified, appropriate operational 

controls implemented and the same is 
communicated to all concerned

• Health promotion programs are conducted 
to encourage employee involvement in 
health and safety. A Safety Week and Health 
Week are conducted annually.

• Employees, including contract workmen, 
are entrusted with the responsibility of 
participation in the ongoing HSE activities. 
Employees are encouraged to participate 
in the process of reviewing risks in their 
respective areas of operations from time to 

time, and developing and sharing strategies 
to eliminate, mitigate or reduce those risks. 

• Employees are required to report all 
incidents to the HSE team to establish 
and implement operational controls to 
avoid the recurrence of the incidents and 
aid in elimination of unsafe behavior and 
conditions.

• The expectation from employees is to 
participate in the emergency mock drills 
and report or identify learnings which need 
to be addressed.

the well-being experience for our employees 
through our HALE program that is aimed at 
increased awareness and overall well-being 
resulting in good health, reduced stress 
levels, safe work environment and improved 
productivity levels. 

Striking a balance between work and life, 
our multi-faceted approach to addressing 
corporate and individual needs helps us

Employee wellness and experience Social

Our employee well-being rates reached an 
all-time high of 91% across locations. The sense 
of connectedness measured at 91% because 
of the ability of different teams to collaborate 
and connect with each other emotionally. 
HALE successfully touched the lives of 1,50,000 
employees through 431 initiatives, where we 
witnessed a three-fold increase in employee 
participation. The key focus for us was mental 
health. We conducted 150 interventions on 
mental health-related topic this year. 

Hybrid well-being
The hybrid work model urged us to consider a 
hybrid well-being awareness and engagement 
approach. We created a page on hybrid 
well-being on our HALE portal and launched 
a hybrid wellness toolkit for employees and 
managers, and a Hello Hybrid widget which 
provided HALE counsellor contacts. Initiatives 
across development centers such as habit-
forming campaigns, Bring Your Kids to Work 
days and story-sharing forums strengthened 
awareness and engagement among 
employees. 

Employee satisfaction 
Infosys has robust mechanisms to gauge 
employee sentiments and feedback. Up 
until fiscal 2020, employee engagement at 
Infosys was measured through the annual 
LITMUS survey. When the pandemic struck, 
the team quickly reimagined this tool for 
the new remote way of work and introduced 
a periodic feedback mechanism called 
Pulse. Pulse collects ongoing and real-time 
feedback from employees anonymously on 
key organization-wide themes that shape 
an employee’s experience at Infosys such as 
work, learning and careers. We poll the entire 
organization through a micro survey every 
month. In addition to this, we also poll our 
employees on select tenure-based milestones 
and specific events including onboarding, 
job rotation and appraisals. This cumulative 
understanding of employee perception, and 
feedback from actual events and milestones 
have strengthened our sensing architecture 
to obtain richer insights of employee 
experiences. To drive change across the

Performance management 
Infosys has established a high-performance 
culture and our employee breathe this each 
day. Our performance management process 
drives a 'meritocracy culture' yet stays 
individual employee focused and development 
oriented. We focus on identifying the best 
performers against standards of performance 
instead of relative comparison of individuals. 
This mechanism helps us to identify our best 
performers through well-defined goals that 
are always relevant, continuous feedback and 
a strong focus on employee development. 
Aligning with this performance management 
philosophy, we have the defined performance 
review and assessment process. 

Continuous feedback is an essential 
element of the process with regular reviews, 
culminating into a rating based holistic view 
of the employee’s performance. Performance 
conversations between employee and manager 
happens on an ongoing basis, given the 
continuous performance process that we have 
in Infosys. The continuous feedback process 

organization, all managers have access to a 
real-time customized dashboard with feedback 
from their respective teams, which enable 
them to engage with their teams better and 
address any concerns. This dashboard has 
multiple views and advanced analytics such 
as heatmaps, trendlines, sentiment analytics 
to enable the managers to prioritize focus 
areas according to their teams. Managers 
along with their respective units HR executives 
and leadership work on making changes or 
improvements at the Unit / team level on the 
ground. Over 50,000 employees participated 
in Q4 with insights gathered around various 
themes of the organization. These insights 
have led us to create focus areas for actionizing 
on a quarterly basis which is socialized with the 
leadership team.

Along with this, employees can seek and share 
feedback with all the colleagues they work 
with. Thus, iCount goes a long way in providing 
a holistic view of the employees performance. 

Resolution hubs 
A safe and positive work environment is what 
we want to be associated with. In keeping with 
this philosophy, we envisage an open-door 
policy. Employees can access several forums 
where they can highlight matters or concerns 
faced at the workplace. This is achieved 
through a well-established and robust 
grievance resolution mechanism comprising 
‘resolution hubs’. The Anti-Sexual Harassment 
Initiative (ASHI) and the Hearing Employees 
and Resolving (HEAR) forums are designated 
as redressal forums for sexual harassment and 
workplace related complaints, respectively. 
Resolution hubs adhere to the principles of 
natural justice, ensure confidentiality, and 
non-retaliation while addressing concerns. The 
concerns are handled with utmost sensitivity 
and are redressed and closed in a timebound 
manner. A detailed investigation process 
ensures fairness and provides an opportunity 
to present facts and any material evidence 
pertaining to the grievance.

Human rights 
Infosys is a signatory to the UNGC. Our 
human rights stand is contained in our Code 
of Conduct and Ethics in an important tenet, 
‘Respecting Each Other.’ The Infosys Human 
Rights Statement articulates our philosophy to 
provide a discrimination-free workplace for all 
employees and contractors. All our employees 
and contractors undergo a mandatory Smart 
Awareness Quiz (SAQ), every year, which 
includes questions on human rights and the 
Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics. The SAQ is 
a comprehensive tool which also includes ‘self-
study’ tutorials, allowing employees to learn 
and then take up the assessments. 

In fiscal 2023, we conducted an independent 
Human Rights Impact Assessment of our 
operations across India. India comprises >80% 
of our employee base. The assessment protocol 
was created based on the Articles contained 
in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (UDHR), ILO, UNGC Principles, the GRI 
Standards, the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) parameters, 
as well as Health and Safety criteria and 
environment management systems. 

 It is our constant endeavor to make Infosys a 
place where people can be the best version 
of themselves. The Talent Pulse Report 2022, 
provides a glimpse into our Employee wellness 
and experience practices. Employee wellness 
and experience is an important ambition 

as a part of Infosys’ ESG Vision 2030. The 
suggestions from the independent human 
rights impact assessment allowed us to 
accelerate our part time and remote work 
policies and inform our hybrid model further. 

The minimum notice period for significant 
operational changes are included in the 
collective bargaining agreements (CBA) 
wherever mandated by law. In countries 
where there is no such mandate to include 
them in the CBA or in countries where CBA 
is not mandated, we abide by the local laws 
prevailing in the land. In all other scenarios, 
Infosys prescribes the notice period based on 
the type of change.

All our security personnel are trained on 
human rights related topics. The Infosys 
Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) has reference 
to human rights and it states, ‘Infosys expects 
its suppliers to support and respect the 
protection of internationally proclaimed 
human rights and to ensure that they are not 
complicit in human rights abuses.’ As part 
of the onboarding process the vendors 
have to accept the SCoC. The procurement 
team ensures that SCoC acceptance is done 
by vendors and maintains a tracker for the 
same. In fiscal 2022, we committed to an 
independent responsible supplier assessment 
for our top 100 suppliers over the next 4 years. 
As on fiscal 2023, 46 supplier ESG assessments 
have been completed.

helps managers provide instant feedback for 
necessary improvements in the work that is 
being done. 

Infosys performance management puts 
equal focus on the future development of the 
employee and the introduction of Individual 
Development Plan (IDP) is a testament to the 
same. IDPs are created by employees under 
the guidance of the manager and are a perfect 
blend of theory and application. Managers 
coach and mentor the employee to set career 
and professional aspirations and reach them 
in a structured manner. Employees are also 
encouraged to take up training to upskill / 
reskill themselves to meet the needs of the 
projects. 

In case of continued lack of expected 
performance, employees are identified for a 
structured performance improvement plan 
where they are given goals and the managers 
support them in achieving these goals. 

At the end of the performance cycle employees 
receive a performance rating. To support the 
process, we have our web and mobile app 
called iCount, where employees can add their 
goals and are encouraged to update progress 
against the same on a regular basis. Managers 
can provide feedback to employees on these 
goals and support them in achieving the 
objectives. Feedback from client stakeholder 
(although not mandated by the process) is 
also a key input that the manager uses during 
performance and development conversations.

Infosys believes in and is committed to partnering with the highest quality suppliers to ensure 
that we deliver best-of-breed business and IT solutions to our clients. As a signatory to the 
United Nations Global Compact, Infosys leverages the UNGC principles covering human rights, 
labor, environment, and anti-corruption as foundational principles for building and improving 
its sustainable supply chain practices. The Company’s Responsible Supply Chain and Supplier 
Diversity Policy is an expression of our commitment to integrate these principles into our 
supply chain relationships and towards building long-term environmental, social, and economic 
opportunities for diverse businesses. This commitment is manifested in our internal activities and 
processes, as well as through the organizations we engage with externally. Integrity and ethics 
govern all our supplier partnerships, while also supporting and encouraging the aspirations of 
diverse businesses. 

Infosys Supplier Code of 
Conduct 
Infosys prides itself in the way it conducts 
its business and has always been a company 
with a strong commitment to ethical business 
practices and sustainability. Infosys encourages 
its suppliers to join in this commitment, based 
on a shared set of values and principles. Infosys 
pursues mutually beneficial relationships with 
its Suppliers and seeks to work with businesses 
that are committed to act fairly and with 
integrity towards their stakeholders, observing 
the applicable rules of law. The Supplier Code 
of Conduct (SCoC) draws inspiration from the 
Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics and the 
principles of the UNGC. It provides a detailed 
account of material topics that we are focused 
on to nurture and sustain responsible supply 
chains. 

Building sustainable and responsible supply chains

Corporate governance Governance

Diligence before empanelment 
As part of the pre-contract and evaluation, 
we perform exhaustive due diligence of 
suppliers in sanctions, corruption, financial 
crimes, litigations and ESG issues at the time of 
onboarding and periodically thereafter, with 
the help of a third-party tool. This assessment 
covers compliance, adverse media, information 
security, physical security and sustainability, 
based on the type of vendor. We have 
onboarded 1946 new suppliers in fiscal 2023. 
Additionally, we have incorporated ESG criteria 
into the supplier onboarding process. 45% of 
our new suppliers were screened using the 
third party tool.

Sambandh 
Sambandh is our biannual supplier 
meeting. This year, the theme at Sambandh 
was ‘Sustainable procurement through 
engagement’.

Over 700 suppliers engaged in Sambandh 
across locations in India. The engagement 
included workshops and discussions on the 
principles contained in the Infosys SCoC and 
ESG-compliant procurement practices.

ESG learning for suppliers
We launched a dedicated ESG learning channel 
for our suppliers on Infosys Springboard. The 
portal contains ESG learning and best practices 
and provides learners an opportunity to 
discuss, ideate and engage on ESG topics.

Corporate governance Governance

ESG assessments 
In 2021, we made a commitment to assess 
100 of our top suppliers (by spend) on ESG 
over a four-year period. As on fiscal 2023, 
we have covered 46 suppliers through 
this assessment. The assessments covered 
governance, ethics and compliance with 
law, fair business practices, labor practices 
and human rights, health and safety, and 
environment. The assessment is based on a 
protocol which leverages the Infosys Supplier 
Code of Conduct (SCoC), ISO 26000, GRI, 
UNHRC, Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and 
other international frameworks. The Infosys 
Supplier Code of Conduct leverages the UNGC 
principles including protecting and upholding 
internationally proclaimed human rights, 
endorsing treating all persons with respect 
and dignity while safeguarding their rights, the 
elimination of forced and compulsory labor, 
the abolition of child labor in the supply chain 
and strong corporate governance practices 
including anti-corruption and anti-bribery and 
promoting fair business practices across the 
supply chain. As an environmentally conscious 
organization, Infosys also urges suppliers to 
protect the environment and make abstemious 
use of scarce natural resources in their 
business processes. As part of the onboarding 
process, all vendors have to accept the Infosys 
SCoC, and this is ensured and tracked by the 
procurement team.

of spending on local suppliers (in India) was 
nearly 66% in fiscal 2023. We did not have 
any significant actual and potential negative 
environmental and social impacts in the supply

The Ethics and Compliance Program at Infosys has two key objectives – to uphold and ensure the 
values of integrity and transparency and to assure enterprise-wide regulatory compliance.

Integrity is key to nurturing a responsible business. Beyond regulation and stakeholder 
attention, there is a growing recognition that good behavior is good for business. At Infosys, our 
commitment to a value-based ethos is enshrined in our Code of Conduct and Ethics.

Our values are the principles we use to run the Company daily and are the source of our Code of 
Conduct and Ethics. Our values are the foundation of everything we do and are encapsulated in 
the acronym C-LIFE (Client value; Leadership by example; Integrity and transparency; Fairness and 
Excellence).

Reinforcing a culture of 
compliance 
1. Code of Conduct and Ethics (Digital 

version): We also have a digital version of 
the Code of Conduct and Ethics. It provides 
user-friendly access to specific topics 
in an interactive manner. It is a unique 
audio-visual experience and is easy to 
navigate. The Code can be accessed on 
mobile devices as well. The digital version 
of the Code aims to help every employee 
understand the behavior we expect and 
the principles and values we uphold. 
We aim to continue to build a culture of 
compliance, where everyone feels they are 
able to do the right thing and prioritize 
legal and ethical choices. The digital version 
of the Code is available here.

2. Code of Conduct and Ethics training: 
Our employees and Board members 
are trained on the Code of Conduct and 
Ethics. We have a Smart Awareness Quiz 
(SAQ) which includes training modules 
that employees are mandatorily required 
to undertake every year to renew their 
commitment to the Code of Conduct and 
Ethics. Our vendor partners were also 
trained on the Supplier Code of Conduct 
through various channels including 
live sessions during the vendor partner 
meet called Sambandh. We also have 
a detailed communication plan to use 
multiple channels of communication like 
emails, video messages, blogs, gamified 
assessments, and storyboards to spread 
awareness about various policies.

3. #SwipeRightforIntegrity: 
#SwipeRightforIntegrity is an annual 
legal and compliance event organized 
by Infosys. The event brings our leaders 
together to reinforce our values of integrity, 

Integrity and compliance transparency and good governance to 
build enduring relationships with our 
clients, employees and partners. It has 
become a platform to create awareness 
and have an engaging dialogue with all 
stakeholders, and influence behavior and 
showcase the Infosys culture. This has 
taken forward the compliance and ethics 
program and created increased awareness 
of expected behavior.

4. Local Compliance Officer program:  
To further raise awareness among our 
employees about ethical aspects globally, a 
local compliance officer (LCO) network has 
also been created across the Infosys Group 
in collaboration with Office of Integrity 
and Compliance. The LCO network plays a 
crucial role, in promoting an organizational 
culture that encourages ethical conduct 
and a commitment to compliance with the 
law, regulations, and policies and helps in 
maximizing the impact of ethics-related 
communication and training.

Corporate governance Governance

Code of Conduct and Ethics 
We firmly believe that following the highest 
standards of business conduct and ethics helps 
us run our business responsibly. Our Code 
of Conduct and Ethics helps us maintain the 
highest ethical standards for our employees.

It complies with the legal requirements of 
applicable laws and regulations, including 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption and ethical 
handling of conflicts of interest. It also 
highlights expectations from our employees. 
The Code of Conduct and Ethics is signed off 

by the Board and the Office of Integrity and 
Compliance is the custodian of the Code of 
Conduct and Ethics. Our business partners 
acknowledge and comply with the Supplier 
Code of Conduct which is based on the UNGC 
principles.

Purpose statement
Our Code of Conduct and Ethics now 
encapsulates our purpose statement:  
“To amplify human potential and create the 
next opportunity for people, businesses and 
communities.”

Recognition as  
one of the world’s  
most ethical companies
Infosys has been recognized as one 
of the 2023 World’s Most Ethical 
Companies for the third consecutive 
year by Ethisphere, a global leader in 
defining and advancing the standards 
of ethical business. Through this 
recognition, Infosys becomes one of 
only four honorees in the software 
and services Industry, globally, and 
the only honoree from India.

Export Control Policy 
The export control policy describes Infosys’ 
export control program and is reviewed 
periodically by the Management. The export 
control program protects the company and 
its employees from potential risk of violation 
of sanctions prescribed under export control 
regulations and facilitates business expansion 
in accordance with these regulations. All our 
customers and vendors are screened against 
various sanctions to ensure that we are 
compliant. As part of the program, training 
modules are rolled out to relevant employees 
to ensure that they are aware and are 
compliant with export control laws. 

We have a self-assessment and certification 
program in place for anti-bribery and anti-
corruption, anti-trust / anti-competition, and 
export control. 

Whistleblower Policy
The Infosys Whistleblower Policy, last amended 
in January 2022, is a comprehensive and 
well-designed mechanism that encourages 
employees, vendors, customers, and any other 
stakeholders to report any unethical conduct, 
violation of applicable laws or the Company’s 
Code of Conduct and Ethics occurring within 
the Company. With strict confidentiality 
measures and multiple reporting channels, 
the policy ensures that whistleblowers are 
protected from any retaliation. The company 
reviews all complaints impartially and takes 
appropriate action, as applicable, while 
providing regular communication to ensure 
awareness about the policy. The Infosys 
Whistleblower Policy is a testament to the 
Company’s commitment to transparency, 
accountability, and responsible corporate 
citizenship.

Corporate governance Governance

Use of technology for effective 
compliance monitoring of 
controls
We have leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
and Machine Learning (ML) technology to 
review and identify exceptions in compliance 
and ABAC controls.

Compliance proof-testing
• Infosys implemented a compliance program 

covering 80 countries and 14 regulatory 
areas across major business enabling 
functions in September 2018.

• The program instituted a self-assessment of 
the compliance status against a compliance 
framework with a maker checker process 
built into it.

• The program also enabled the creation of 
a repository of compliance proofs against 
self-assessment.

• By consolidating compliance proofs across 
countries and regulatory areas, Infosys 
designed an OCR-based technology to 
scan the proofs and validate if the proofs 
corroborate the compliance status.

• The OCR technology was combined with 
a rule engine to test compliance controls 
around timeliness and accuracy of the 
compliance proof.

ABAC program
• Infosys develops and manages multiple 

office facilities and collaborates with 
multiple vendors / service providers during 
the various phases of construction. Infosys 
engages with vendors for infrastructure 
development and facility maintenance. 

Sometimes, services to be obtained include 
permits, licenses, approvals, marketing 
activities / expenses, awareness campaigns 
and liasoning with the authorities for filings 
and reporting requirements.

• To ensure appropriate proof of service 
by vendors is submitted, reviewed, and 
approved before payments are released and 
to ensure that the process of requisitioning, 
purchasing, receiving, paying for, and 
accounting for goods and services, covering 
the entire process from point of order right 
through to payment, is monitored, Infosys 
has implemented the following controls by 
reimagining system logic in procurement 
systems and use of AI and ML techniques:

 – Traceability of transactions at initial 
procurement stages through user 
declaration and OCR technology.

 – Trail of documentation to substantiate 
various milestones and proofs of services 
availed.

 – Built-in escalation matrix to ensure 
timely approval of red flags identified for 
appropriate resolution and action.

 – Tracking of potential red flag indicators 
through keyword searches and OCR 
technology before raising procurement 
request and payment processing.

 – Periodic assessments of transactions on 
sample basis considering factors such as 
high-risk vendors / transactions.

 – In addition, digitized self-assessment and 
certification is also rolled out as part of 
monitoring and controls.

Anti-Bribery and  
Anti-Corruption (ABAC) 
practices and policy 
Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption practices 
and policy is reviewed by the Management at 
regular intervals. 

With an evolving landscape, Infosys is 
committed to a responsible Anti-Bribery & 
Anti-Corruption risk management framework 
to demonstrate a comprehensive risk 
management program to reduce the risks by 
regularly assessing risk in alignment with its 
growth strategies, and to drive an ethical and 
risk intelligent culture, to increase the certainty 
of business outcomes.

Risk assessment for bribery and corruption 
risks is done periodically and the criteria 
used for risk assessment include business 
units / internal departments, location and the 
Corruption Perception Index (CPI) index of 
countries, among others.

Anti-competitive practices 
policy 
The Anti-Trust / Anti-Competitive Practices 
Policy states the objective, scope, applicability, 
and regulatory consequences, and is reviewed 
periodically by the Management. This policy 
includes the three aspects of anti-trust law: 
(i) abuse of dominance; (ii) anti-competitive 
practice; (iii) merger control. Besides, a list 
of do’s and don’ts are communicated to the 
relevant stakeholders highlighting expected 
behaviors.

G20 Smart Cities Alliance Sustainability Taskforce

As the world urbanizes, sustainable 
development and economic growth depend 
increasingly on the successful management 
of urban growth. With the right technology 
and the know-how to govern it, cities can 
lead the way in solving problems in energy, 
transportation, healthcare, education and 
natural disaster response, while making their 
communities more inclusive, resilient and 
sustainable. But progress depends on cities 

adopting the right set of policies to make sure 
that technology is used responsibly, and our 
research shows that most cities do not have 
these fundamentals in place.

Infosys is partnering with the WEF secretariat 
in the role of taskforce lead for the G20 
Global Smart Cities Alliance on Technology 
Governance unites local and national 
governments, private-sector partners and city 

residents around a shared set of principles 
for the responsible and ethical use of smart 
city technologies. The Alliance establishes 
and advances global policy norms to help 
accelerate best practices, mitigate potential 
risks, and foster greater openness and public 
trust. The taskforce is designing principles and 
WLC benchmarks to aid planning applicants in 
designing buildings that have low operational 
carbon and low embodied carbon.

The tools and technologies that we use at work have brought in a great deal of operational ease 
and efficiency, making life much simpler. Often, the incentives to use these are so compelling, 
that choice is only notional. On the other hand, Data Privacy (DP) regulations around the world 
are demanding greater accountability from us, to ensure that these are not intrusive when 
deployed. Many of these tools, platforms and processes have the propensity to breach privacy if 
not deployed with due diligence. Hence, at Infosys, the Data Privacy Office (DPO) an independent 
function, ensures careful balancing before deploying them.

Approach to sustained DP compliance

Diagram 1: A robust framework to continuously improve data privacy 

At Infosys, we constituted the data privacy 
function over a decade ago as an independent 
business enabling function reporting to 
the management and using the globally 
recognized PIMS (Privacy Information 
Management System) framework. We complied 
with all applicable data privacy regulations 
in fiscal 2023 in building applications and 
platforms, or while executing client projects, 
by introducing appropriate privacy safeguards. 
Our Data Privacy Policy published in the 
Company intranet, demonstrates our the 
Management's commitment to privacy and 
applies to the entire operations including 
service providers. To ensure complete 
transparency, we provide privacy notices at 

Governance

the time of data collection to both internal 
and external data subjects and the privacy 
statement for external data subjects is also 
made available in the public domain. These 
are constantly updated to reflect the changes 
in personal data processing or applicable DP 
regulations. 

Privacy Statement
Infosys does not do behavioral advertising. 
Infosys also does not use personal data for 
secondary purposes. Whenever there is a 
change in the purpose, data subjects are 
notified of the new purpose through privacy 
notices.

At Infosys, the Data Privacy Office plays the 
role of architect and checker, while business 
enabling functions and units are the makers, 
with independent audits being carried out 
periodically by our Quality team and external 
bodies. Quarterly senior management reviews 
ensure adequate oversight.

Aspirations in DP 
We make every effort to protect the personal 
information that comes under our purview. 
Our data privacy compliance framework is 
based on ISO 27701 with inputs that include 
convergence of international best practices, 
client-prescribed requirements and applicable 
data privacy regulations across geographies. 

Adopting internationally 
accepted protocols 
We are among the first few organizations 
globally, to have our framework certified 
with accreditation, for ISO 27701 privacy 
information management standard. We intend 
to increase the coverage of the certification 
across the enterprise in phases. 

Privacy by Design (PbD)  
EPIC program
Anticipating the need to make privacy an 
integral part of any process or application 
dealing with personal data, an organization-
wide strategic initiative named EPIC 
(Embedding Privacy by design into Infosys 
Culture) was rolled out in early 2022 by 
the DPO in collaboration with Quality and 
Delivery functions. EPIC embeds PbD into the 
solution development process at Infosys to 
enable responsible data-centric innovation

that complies with DP regulations, leading to 
market differentiation. The program focuses 
on introducing PbD strategies, patterns and 
guidelines to integrate privacy principles and 
requirements into solutions and platforms 
development. To institutionalize privacy by 
design, a two-phased enabling program is 
under way. In phase one, foundational and 
intermediate courses on privacy by design 
were designed and enabled for all employees 
globally. Phase two is focusing on taking the 
privacy by design implementation to clients. 

Vendor DP guidelines 
Vendor DP management of our extended 
entities has assumed strategic significance 
in the current scenario of third-party risks, 
given the increasing volume of data breaches, 
and enterprise dependency on outsourcing 
including cloud service providers. Suppliers 
present difficult and unique privacy and 
cyber security challenges. Compliance with 
diverse data protection laws across the world 
requires an effective mechanism for managing 

supplier-related risks to Infosys. We have 
published comprehensive guidelines for 
suppliers / vendors to ensure that they adhere 
to strict obligations imposed by contracts 
and applicable laws of the land, during their 
engagement with Infosys and its subsidiaries. 
The Infosys Supplier Code of Conduct is 
mandated across all essential suppliers 
involved in processing of personal data, along 
with necessary data processing clauses which 
are agreed prior to their onboarding. Assurance 
is further demonstrated through due diligence 
and annual assessments. 

Robust incident management 
and breach handling 
At Infosys, we have robust mechanisms to 
detect, assess, contain and manage data 
privacy breaches and incidents with well-
defined processes and procedures to respond 
to breach notifications within defined timelines 
in accordance with the laws of the land. If an 
incident or a breach is determined to be of

Driving DP thought leadership 
In this constantly changing privacy threat 
landscape, the Infosys DPO recognizes the 
need for regular engagement with industry 
and government bodies to shape the future 
of data privacy. Towards this, it actively 
participates in various initiatives with 
industry forums and standard bodies globally, 
contributing to developing DP frameworks, 
policies and standards. The Infosys DPO is the 
co-editor for ISO and IEEE standards related 
to privacy engineering, management and 
privacy in emerging technologies, some of 
which have been published while others are 
being developed. Such emerging technologies 
include AI, digital twins, Metaverse and ZKP 
(Zero Knowledge Proof ). 

Recently, AI-based tools and technologies 
have proliferated across the digital industry, 
bringing in rich dividends both for consumers 
and businesses. However, this has also 
introduced hitherto unknown privacy threats, 
particularly on decisional autonomy, basic 
to individual data empowerment. At Infosys, 
data privacy and data ethics are an integral 
parts of the responsible AI framework and all 
AI-based solutions and platforms are subjected 
to privacy assessments before deployment, 
to balance business value derived with data 
privacy.

Data privacy Governance

high impact, and / or if the law of the land 
mandates, such breaches are notified to the 
impacted data subjects and /or supervisory 
authority. We also incorporate key learnings 
from incidents in privacy awareness stories 
and tips sent to employees. Incidents of high 
and critical nature are reported to the incident 
disclosure committee, consisting of senior 
leaders including the CEO & MD. Infosys has 
zero tolerance for any breaches, which in 
addition to appropriate preventive measures, 
are controlled through effective deterrent 
mechanisms including stringent consequence 
management. 

In fiscal 2023, there were no substantiated 
complaints received concerning breaches of 
customer privacy from outside parties and 
regulatory authorities.

Data subject rights 
management 
Data subject rights, which have become an 
intrinsic part of data privacy laws in many 
countries, are legal rights enjoyed by the data 
subject. These rights are legally enforceable, 
but never absolute, which makes the fulfilment 
complex in the current enterprise setting with 
data spread across systems and servers in 
multiple geographies with diverse regulatory 
regimes. Infosys has established necessary 
tools and processes to cater to such data 
subject rights requests within the legally 
stipulated timelines across Infosys locations, 
including subsidiaries.

Raising DP awareness through 
campaigns and events 
Every year, we celebrate the Data Privacy Day 
by hosting engaging interventions and diverse 
online interactive events like crosswords, 
quizzes, chat with DPO and messages from 
senior leaders to spread awareness. The events 
span over several months and rewards are 
offered to promote employee participation. 
Additionally, monthly awareness mailers in the 
form of privacy tips and scenarios reflecting 
changing threats are also sent to everyone in 
the organization to strengthen awareness. We 
conducted International Privacy Symposium 
2022, a virtual conference organized by the 
Infosys Data Privacy Office in association with 
IAPP and ACC, where participants included 
global privacy leaders, CPOs, experts from 
academia and global frontline practitioners 
to reflect on key trends, challenges and best 
practices. Some of the sessions organized 
as part of this included privacy engineering, 
anonymization, privacy-preserving synthetic 
data, AI, data ethics and human behavior, 
privacy standards, data subject rights and 
other emerging areas. A similar symposium 
is proposed to be organized in 2023 in 
collaboration with international bodies. 

All employees and sub-contractors have to 
also mandatorily complete privacy awareness 
quizzes annually, the questions and scenarios 
for which are tailored based on the their 
respective roles.
