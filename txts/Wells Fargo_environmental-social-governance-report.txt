A letter  
from the CEO 

— Charles W. Scharf 
CEO, Wells Fargo & Company

At Wells Fargo, we believe that to be successful 
as a company, we must consider a broad set of 
stakeholders in our decisions and actions, beyond 
shareholders. This is not in lieu of shareholders — 
in fact, we believe a broader focus will enhance our 
returns to shareholders over time. Consumers and 
businesses want to do business with a company 
that actively supports employees, customers, and 
communities — especially those most in need. 

In the pages that follow, you’ll find an overview of 
the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
work underway at Wells Fargo. This includes the 
work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive 
future in the communities we serve. These efforts 
span housing affordability, small business growth, 
financial inclusion, addressing climate change, and 
other initiatives.

We consider this work a sustained, long-term 
commitment. We know that there is much work  
to do, and Wells Fargo is well-positioned to make  
a difference.

Wells Fargo’s  
key ESG themes 
& focus areas

As a leading financial services company, Wells Fargo 
believes that it has a role to play in addressing 
social, economic, and environmental sustainability, 
and the company is committed to sound and 
effective corporate governance practices. The 
company continues to take an active role in 
addressing pressing societal challenges to drive 
positive impact.

Wells Fargo regularly assesses ESG and 
sustainability themes and focus areas that it 
believes are most relevant to the company and its 
stakeholders. The company monitors ESG trends, 
and has periodically engaged with stakeholders to 
identify top-of-mind ESG themes, which inform 
its strategies, goals, and reporting priorities. With 
those topics in mind, Wells Fargo continues to work 
to make meaningful progress with respect to these 
pressing ESG challenges.

Wells Fargo focuses its work on three sustainability-related areas  
of critical importance.

Environmental sustainability  
Wells Fargo believes that climate change is one of the most urgent environmental  
and social issues of our time. That is why in March 2021, Wells Fargo announced its 
effort to support the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting a goal of net-zero 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In 2021, the bank also joined the Net-Zero Banking 
Alliance, an industry leadership group focused on implementing climate targets. In 
furtherance of this net-zero goal, in May 2022, the company published the Wells Fargo 
CO2eMissionSM, a climate alignment and target-setting methodology for its financing 
portfolios, and set its first interim financed emissions targets for two high-emitting 
sectors (Oil & Gas and Power). In 2021, the company also launched an Institute for 
Sustainable Finance to deploy $500 billion of financing to sustainable businesses and 
projects by 2030, as well as to support science-based research on low-carbon solutions, 
and advocate for policies that enable client transitions.

Social impact  
Wells Fargo seeks to support a more sustainable and equitable economy by  
opening pathways to economic advancement, championing quality affordable  
homes, empowering small business growth, and enabling a low-carbon economy. 
Through these and other efforts, the company hopes to help build wealth, enhance 
economic mobility, and strengthen diverse and historically marginalized communities. 
In collaboration with community organizations, civic leaders, and nonprofits at the 
local, state, and national levels, Wells Fargo is working to address systemic barriers to 
financial inclusion and opportunity. Wells Fargo’s resources and expertise can make a 
positive impact in communities, addressing these complex societal issues to help build  
a more sustainable, equitable future for all.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion 
Wells Fargo is dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The company is focused 
on increasing diverse representation at all levels, creating a more inclusive 
workplace, and better serving and growing its diverse customer segments and 
diverse suppliers across all lines of business. This approach is embedded in the 
company’s culture and business practices, products and services, and philanthropic 
giving. Additional details are discussed in the 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
Report (PDF).

As Wells Fargo continues its work on key ESG themes, the company recognizes that its employees, culture, 
and governance are all critical ingredients for making meaningful progress.

Environmental 
sustainability 

Wells Fargo’s focus on environmental sustainability is 
about working toward an equitable and sustainable 
future and to support the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. In March 2021, Wells Fargo announced 
its efforts to support the transition to a low-carbon 
economy by setting a goal of net-zero greenhouse 
gas emissions — including its financed emissions — 
by 2050. 

In addition to Wells Fargo’s net-zero greenhouse  
gas emissions by 2050 goal, the company 
committed to deploying its resources and working 
closely with customers. To drive its execution 
efforts, Wells Fargo established an enterprise-
wide climate initiative to promote leadership 
connectivity and accountability. In addition, 
Wells Fargo’s Independent Risk Management 
(IRM) function provides holistic oversight of the 
integration of climate considerations into the  
Risk Management Framework.

Wells Fargo calculates its operational Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol. Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that 
are controlled or owned by an organization. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with 
the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling, and are a result of the organization’s energy use.

*Wells Fargo's environmental data included in the Statements of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions has been reviewed by an independent 
third-party accountant for the year ended December 31, 2021.
1. MTCO2e stands for metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent.
2. Wells Fargo has purchased carbon offsets to achieve carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since 2019.
3. A location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using grid-
average emission factor data). A market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that Wells Fargo has purposefully 
chosen. It derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for
the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims. 
4. Total Scope 1 emissions in 2019 and 2020 have been restated to reflect a correction to the emissions calculation for
stationary combustion.

*Wells Fargo's environmental data included in the Statements of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions has been reviewed by an independent 
third-party accountant for the year ended December 31, 2021.
1. MTCO2e stands for metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent.
2. In 2020, Scope 3, Category 1 and Category 2 emissions reporting transitioned to USEEIO 1.0 emissions factors from previously 
utilized UK DEFRA emissions factors. This methodology change resulted in a large decrease in emissions. In 2021, USEEIO 1.1 
emission factors were applied resulting in additional accounting refinements.
3. Categories listed above as "not relevant" or "relevant, not calculated" include activities that were not yet calculated, not 
applicable to Wells Fargo's business activities or they have already been included in Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
4. Category 6: Employee business air travel emissions in 2019 and 2020 have been restated to reflect a correction to the 
emissions calculation.
5. Wells Fargo is in the process of calculating this data, but has not made significant enough progress to report figures. Refer to

Growing the renewable 
energy supply 

Consistent with the company's climate and sustainability goals, Wells Fargo is committed to supporting  
the development of new sources of renewable energy. Through the end of 2021, Wells Fargo contracted for  
210 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy generation across 13 states and three countries, supporting 
new job creation and creating resilient communities.

Notes 
1. Self-supply is when a consumer generates and supplies their own electricity. Wells Fargo’s self-supply refers to its on-site solar program.
2. Physical power purchase agreements are contracts for the purchase of power and associated Renewable Energy Certificates 
from a specific renewable energy generator (the seller) to a purchaser of renewable electricity (the buyer).
3. Wells Fargo met 100% of its electricity consumption with renewable energy, primarily from unbundled Renewable Energy 
Certificates beginning in 2017. Its goal is to transition to long-term agreements (defined as contracts with a duration of five years 
or longer) that directly support new sources of renewable energy. New sources of renewable energy are defined as assets where 
commercial operation was achieved no earlier than 12 months prior to contract execution.
4. Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates are sold, delivered, or purchased separately from the electricity generated by the

Supplier  
engagement

Wells Fargo’s Supplier Code of Conduct (PDF) outlines the company's expectation that suppliers not only 
comply with applicable laws, regulations, and contract terms, but also conduct themselves with the highest 
standards of ethical business practices, environmental stewardship, and community investment.

Notes 
1. Wells Fargo encourages its suppliers to demonstrate their commitment to environmental sustainability by participating in the CDP 
survey. The suppliers were selected to participate using a methodology that considered each supplier’s spend, operational criticality to 
Wells Fargo, and whether the supplier is in a carbon-intensive industry. As a result, the majority of participating suppliers represent high 
spend and/or high criticality with many in high-carbon industries.

For example, the ACSCOE recently advised on a major Wells Fargo elder fraud education campaign, which
included direct customer emails, messaging on account statements, ATM banner alerts, and narratives 
delivered through Wells Fargo Stories. Additional consumer education resources were provided and include:

Financial health philanthropy

Wells Fargo is also focused on improving the financial 
stability of low- and moderate-income communities 
through philanthropic programs that increase 
financial inclusion and access, reduce debt, drive 
savings and wealth-building behavior, and transform 
systems so people can achieve better financial 
outcomes in their lives.

The Wells Fargo Foundation's Financial Capability 
Grant Program helps people from diverse 
populations who are underbanked by connecting 
them to income support services and financial 
training. In 2021, program participants saved 
nearly $18 million and reduced debt by roughly 
$38.4 million, more than 27,300 participants 
established or improved their credit score, and 
more than 7,800 participants acquired a financial 
asset. Grantees include Cities for Financial 
Empowerment Fund, International Rescue 
Committee, Local Initiatives Support Corporation 
(LISC), National Association of Latino Community 
Asset Builders, Operation HOPE, and others. 
Additionally, grants expanded access to free, 
virtual financial coaching and counseling, direct 
cash assistance, and other financial resources to 
help people save money, reduce debt, and navigate 
other complex financial challenges. 

Housing affordability solutions

Wells Fargo recognizes that there is a shortage of 
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income 
communities, and high housing costs have amplified 
growing economic inequities. In 2021, the company 
launched the Wells Fargo Dream.Plan.Home.SM 
mortgage, which offers a down payment as low  
as 3% to eligible buyers and supports approval of 
those with nontraditional credit.  

In 2021, the company financed $29.6 billion and 
$7.8 billion for new purchase loans to serve over 
58,000 minority households and over 38,000 low- 
and moderate-income households respectively.

In 2017, Wells Fargo pledged to create at  
least 250,000 new Black and African American 
homeowners in 10 years through lending  
$60 billion for home purchases. Through the 
end of 2021, the company helped over 81,756 
Black and African American families and 
individuals become homeowners with  
$21.4 billion in mortgage financing.

In 2016, Wells Fargo committed to increasing 
Hispanic and Latino homeownership over  
10 years through $125 billion in home 
purchase loans. Through the end of 2021, the 
company helped 207,248 Hispanic and Latino 
families and individuals become homeowners 
through $54.8 billion in mortgage financing.

Housing affordability philanthropy

Wells Fargo’s housing affordability philanthropic 
strategies are focused on keeping people in their 
homes, opening pathways to homeownership, 
increasing initiatives that drive supply of affordable 
homes, and advancing innovation and transformation. 
Wells Fargo’s goal is to support solutions that allow 
people to have a quality and affordable place to call 
home. Since 2020, the company has helped keep 
more than 320,000 renters and homeowners in 
their homes through efforts focused on eviction and 
foreclosure prevention assistance, rental assistance, 
and financial counseling. Wells Fargo has also 
committed $1 billion in philanthropy to supporting 
housing affordability solutions across the nation. 
Examples of Wells Fargo’s housing affordability 
philanthropy initiatives include:

• Through the Wells Fargo Builds program, in 
collaboration with Habitat for Humanity and 
Rebuilding Together, Wells Fargo funded more 
than 482 home build projects across the U.S. 
in 2021. This funding of affordable and sustainable 
housing includes support for new home
construction and repairs, helping older adults age 
in their homes, and neighborhood revitalization.

• Through Wells Fargo's NeighborhoodLIFT®
program, the company collaborates with
NeighborWorks® America and local nonprofits
to support sustainable homeownership by
delivering down payment assistance to low- 
and moderate-income homebuyers. This
program supports individuals, both customers
and noncustomers, in a number of communities
throughout the U.S. While the LIFT program is
focused on serving low- and moderate-income
families regardless of race or ethnicity, the
majority of LIFT homeowners represent those
who identify as Black and African American,
Indigenous, and people of color.

Wells Fargo has a $25 million total 
commitment to support Black and African 
American, Hispanic, and Latino homebuyers 
with financial education and counseling,  
with $15 million committed to Black and 
African American homebuyers and  
$10 million committed to Hispanic and 
Latino homebuyers. Through the end of 
2021, more than $11 million and $9 million 
in funding have been provided in support of 
Black and African American homebuyers and 
Hispanic and Latino homebuyers respectively.

Serving small business 

Small businesses are essential to a vibrant  
economy and for creating employment opportunities.  
Wells Fargo proudly serves over three million 
small business customers by putting the needs of 
customers front and center, innovating experience 
through digital enhancements, and evolving its 
support model to deepen relationships.  
Wells Fargo's goal is to be the bank of choice for 
all small businesses, with a strong emphasis on 
supporting the needs faced by diverse and women-
owned small business owners. Wells Fargo has 
established a number of initiatives, tools, and 
programs to support small businesses to help them 
go from surviving to thriving. 

Wells Fargo has provided approximately 282,000 
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans through 
its 2020 and 2021 lending to support small 
businesses navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Total lending was nearly $14 billion helping keep 
1,739,000 Americans employed. The average 
loan amount for customers was $50,000, the 
lowest among all of the participating large 
financial institutions, and 42% of loans were for 
small businesses in low-to-moderate income 
neighborhoods, or those historically underserved, 
bringing funding to places where it could make the 
biggest impact.

Small business growth philanthropy

Wells Fargo continues to deepen its commitment 
to small business growth through supporting 
innovative nonprofit programs aimed at providing 
entrepreneurs with increased access to affordable 
sources of capital and training so businesses can 
grow, build assets, and create local jobs. 

Wells Fargo established the Open for Business  
Fund in 2020 by voluntarily donating all gross 
processing fees from PPP loans made in 2020 

to provide grants for Community Development 
Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and other nonprofit 
organizations that provide capital and technical 
support to diverse-owned small businesses. In 
2021, Wells Fargo fulfilled its roughly $420 million 
Open for Business Fund commitment to support 
an inclusive economic recovery for small businesses 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the 
Open for Business Fund, from 2020 through the  
end of 2021, grants were awarded to more than  
235 CDFIs and nonprofits, which are estimated 
to serve more than 152,000 small businesses and 
preserve or create more than 255,000 jobs. Roughly 
85% of small businesses served are projected to be 
those hardest hit by the pandemic, including Black 
and African American, Hispanic, Native American, 
and Asian American-owned small businesses.

diverse small business owners with access to capital and technical assistance by teaming up with CDFIs to 
support borrowers in all 50 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico. The program’s CDFI awardees leveraged 
Diverse Community Capital funds to provide $2.9 billion in financing and 2.6 million hours of technical 
assistance, enabling entrepreneurs to sustain more than 369,000 jobs. In 2021, Wells Fargo reached full 
funding of the $175 million program commitment.

called Connect to More℠ to support the 
development and growth of women-owned 
businesses by providing access to expertise and 
specialized resources.

Fund, USA, Wells Fargo launched the Small Business 
Resource Navigator, an online portal helping connect 
small business owners to potential financing options 
and technical assistance through Community 
Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) across 
the country. Since the launch, the Small Business 
Resource Navigator has connected millions of dollars 
in credit requests from underrepresented small

Corporate and  
commercial customers

Wells Fargo strives to support its corporate and 
commercial customers as they seek financial 
solutions to execute their long-term resiliency,  
social impact, and sustainability objectives. In 2021,  
Wells Fargo deployed more than $60 billion in 
sustainable financing with more than 80% of that 
in support of corporate customers’ environmental 
and social activities. Wells Fargo is a leading 
sustainability-linked loan provider helping customers 
finance both environmental and social-related 
activities across a range of industry segments  
and products in lending and capital markets.

The Renewable Energy & Environmental Finance 
(REEF) team at Wells Fargo has invested more 
than $13.2 billion in ~600 wind, solar, and fuel cell 
projects across the U.S., providing financing to ~12% 
of utility-scale wind and solar capacity additions 
between 2005 and 2021.

In 2021, Wells Fargo issued an Inclusive 
Communities and Climate Bond, its first 
sustainability bond, which funded projects and 
programs that support housing affordability, 
socioeconomic opportunity, and renewable 
energy. The transaction built on Wells Fargo’s 
expertise in, and history of, underwriting green, 
social, and sustainability bonds, and advances 
the company’s commitment to accelerate a 
more inclusive and sustainable economy.

Wells Fargo’s Sustainability Bond Framework 
(PDF) is available on the company website. 
Sustainalytics, an external firm with expertise 
in ESG and sustainability, reviewed this 
Framework and issued a Second Party Opinion 
(PDF)†, which found it to be “credible and 
impactful,” aligned with the Sustainability Bond 
Guidelines 2018, Green Bond Principles 2018, 
and Social Bond Principles 2020.

Employee 
volunteerism  
and impact

Wells Fargo is proud of the passion and generosity 
of its employees, who multiply the company's 
community impact through the investment of 
their time, energy, and resources to their respective 
communities. To help encourage this commitment, 
Wells Fargo provides eligible employees with up 
to 16 hours of paid volunteer time every year to 
serve local communities where they live and work. 
Employees are encouraged to use their talents to 
get involved in causes they care about.

2021 highlights include:

• The Global Fellows program provides  
Wells Fargo employees a unique opportunity to 
donate their time and professional skills in support 
of charities inside and outside of the U.S. In 2021, 
the program doubled the number of projects 
and employees participating compared to the 
previous year. Additionally, the program expanded 
its partners to include national grant funded 
organizations in the U.S. that are aligned with the 
Wells Fargo Foundation’s strategic priorities.

• The Community Care Grants program recognizes 
Wells Fargo employees for their giving and service 
activities. Through personal giving or service 
activities, employees may qualify for up to  
$2,000 in Community Care Grants per year 
for their favorite eligible charities through 
volunteering, giving, and leadership. 

• Nearly 4,500 charities benefited from  
Wells Fargo employees sharing their time and 
leadership skills by serving as nonprofit board 
members, making a meaningful impact in the 
communities where they live and work.

Wells Fargo provides 
eligible employees with 
up to 16 hours of paid 
volunteer time every 
year to serve local 
communities where  
they live and work.

Notes 
1. Wells Fargo’s COVID-19 safety protocols prohibited in-person, Wells Fargo-sponsored group volunteerism throughout 2020 and 
2021. Employees volunteered virtually and in their individual capacity. 
2. Employee participation percentage is based on the total number of active, global employees in Wells Fargo’s workforce as shown in 
the Employees section.
3. In 2020, Wells Fargo transitioned from an annual giving campaign to year-round giving campaigns, allowing employees more 
flexibility when determining how and when they want to support nonprofits. This adjustment impacted programming and how 
employees log personal financial commitments in the company’s Community Care Portal. The 2020 and 2021 results reflect employee 
giving that occurred in the Community Care Portal throughout the respective fiscal years.

Diversity, equity, 
and inclusion 

Wells Fargo is dedicated to diversity, equity, and 
inclusion with a belief that companies should 
have their executive ranks reflect the customers 
they serve and the U.S. population more broadly. 
The company also believes financial institutions 
should strive to provide affordable, easy-to-
use products and services, enable the dream of 
homeownership, and help in the formation and 
growth of small businesses in all communities. 
In addition to focusing on diversity across the 
company's workforce, Wells Fargo supports 
strategic opportunities that include diverse 
suppliers in competitive sourcing and procurement 
opportunities within our supply chain. In 2022, 
Wells Fargo released its inaugural Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion (DE&I) report (PDF), providing 
important updates on our efforts in this space. 

In connection with its diversity initiatives,  
Wells Fargo voluntarily requests that its 
employees and Board members self-identify  
their gender. The following tables present  
self-identification data covering both U.S.  
and global employees.

Employee Resource Networks

historically underrepresented groups. With  
Wells Fargo’s support, ERNs are focused on 
professional growth and education, community 
outreach, recruiting and retention, business 
development, and customer insight. There are

Employees

Wells Fargo is committed to being an employer 
of choice — a company where people matter; 
teamwork is rewarded; everyone feels respected 
and empowered to speak up; diversity, equity, and 
inclusion are embraced; and how work gets done is 
just as important as getting the work done.

Culture

Wells Fargo is committed to a culture that attracts 
and retains the best people who help it become  
a better, stronger company. The company's  
culture is reinforced by a customer-centric  
focus, employee engagement and feedback,  
and expectations that guide how employees 
conduct themselves, work with customers  
and colleagues, and make decisions. 

Company expectations are part of the culture — 
from how employees develop and communicate, 
to how Wells Fargo evaluates performance and 
service of its customers and stakeholders.

Wells Fargo continues to refine its culture, instilling efficiency and effectiveness throughout, leveraging 
employee feedback to enhance the employee experience and drive improvements. Throughout the year, 
employees are invited to share their thoughts through surveys, town halls, and other means. Wells Fargo 
launched a new company-wide employee feedback platform called Loudspeaker at the end of 2021. 
Employees have submitted thousands of ideas, some of which have been implemented, leading to  
efficiencies, innovation, and employee engagement. 

Competitive compensation

Wells Fargo's compensation program is linked to performance management and is designed to promote 
prudent risk management and reinforce its culture and operating standards:

The company is committed to providing fair, competitive, and equitable compensation. In November 2021, 
Wells Fargo announced an increase in its U.S. minimum hourly base pay in the majority of its markets. The 
minimum hourly pay range in the U.S. is $18 to $22, based on the cost of labor in each Wells Fargo market. 

The compensation principles include:

Pay for performance: Compensation is linked to company, line of business, and 
individual performance, including meeting regulatory expectations and creating long-
term value consistent with the interests of shareholders.

 
Promote effective risk management: Compensation promotes effective risk 
management and discourages imprudent or excessive risk-taking.

 
Attract and retain talent: People are one of Wells Fargo's competitive advantages; 
therefore, compensation helps attract, motivate, and retain people with the skills, 
talent, and experience to drive superior long-term company performance.

Pay equity review

Wells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices, and we regularly review our 
compensation programs and practices for pay equity. Each year, the company engages a third-party 
consultant to conduct a thorough pay equity review of employee compensation, which considers gender, race, 
and ethnicity. The results of the 2021 review, after accounting for factors such as role, tenure, and geography, 
show that women at Wells Fargo continued to earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by their male 
peers. In addition, U.S. employees of color continue to earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by white 
peers. The results of Wells Fargo’s most recent pay equity analysis and relevant commentary are available in 
the company’s 2022 Proxy Statement.

Work-life programs and  
the COVID-19 pandemic 

Wells Fargo offers many benefits, programs, 
and work arrangements intended to provide 
employees with flexibility and work-life balance. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, close to 100,000 
Wells Fargo employees never left the workplace 
to ensure customers received the services and 
support they needed. Others transitioned to 
working from home. In March 2022, Wells Fargo 
began its Return to Office program for employees 
who had not been working from Wells Fargo 
offices during the pandemic. 

Wells Fargo believes its success depends on 
becoming increasingly collaborative and innovative. 
The company benefits from employees seeing each 
other on a regular basis. When together, it is easier 
to build relationships, get in-the-moment coaching, 
identify career opportunities, and brainstorm ideas. 
Ultimately, when employees work together they 
learn more about the customers and communities 
the company serves and how to serve them better. 
With this in mind, Wells Fargo's approach emphasizes 
spending time together in the office, and also 
provides flexible work options for employees in 
certain jobs. 

The company's expectation for employees working 
in a Wells Fargo location are based on what makes 
sense for different roles. For example, employees in 
customer-facing roles in branches, advisor locations, 
and other customer-facing locations, have been in 
the workplace for most of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Employees in non-customer-facing support teams 
are primarily office-based, with flexibility. In practice, 
this may mean flexibility to have up to two days a 
week of remote work, and spending a minimum of 
three days a week in the office. Expectations for 
other roles, including operations, technology, and 
non-U.S. based employees, vary by business need. 
Wells Fargo understands the challenges faced during 
the pandemic and continues to look for ways to offer 
flexibility to more employees, while moving to an 
increasingly collaborative and innovative culture. 

The company continues to monitor the COVID-19 
situation and will make adjustments as necessary. 
The health and safety of employees and customers 
has been our top priority and has guided planning 
efforts. All employees globally may take up to 
four hours of paid time away for each vaccine 
appointment (including boosters). U.S. employees 
are additionally eligible to receive free COVID-19 
test kits from Wells Fargo or through their medical 
plan, at no additional cost. 

Wells Fargo believes 
its success depends on 
becoming increasingly 
collaborative and 
innovative

In 2021, the Learning and Development team continued to support training virtually in response to 
COVID-19, and the company continues to implement enhancements to training programs to support more 
flexible delivery. Wells Fargo received five industry awards in 2021 in recognition of training excellence, 
including awards for programs in branch banking, small business, technology, and credit. 

Employee training and development

Wells Fargo invests heavily in coaching and training for employees and managers because when our 
employees are properly supported, engaged, and confident in their skills, they’re more effective leaders and 
can provide a better customer experience. The company invests approximately $200 million annually in 
employee learning and development, which includes functional training, regulatory compliance, leadership 
and professional development, and early talent development programs for employees.

Leadership and  
professional development

Wells Fargo's leadership development training 
program contributes to the success of participating 
employees by partnering with them to drive learning 
that is strategic and effective. It is the company's 
mission to contribute to the growth and profitability 
of Wells Fargo by providing employees with the tools 
and training necessary for job excellence and career 
advancement. 

Leadership training opportunities are provided 
through such programs as Leading Through Change 
and Transition, Extraordinary Leader, Coaching and 
Feedback in the Moment, and Crucial Conversations. 

Employment impacts

As Wells Fargo continues transforming its 
businesses, the company recognizes that 
employees may be impacted, and strives to provide 
transparent communication so that employees are 
aware of the programs and opportunities available 
to support them. 

In some cases, restructurings result in employee 
displacements or involuntary separations as a result 
of economic or operational factors. In the event of 
a workforce restructuring involving displacements 
in the U.S., Wells Fargo supports its employees and 
provides tools to assist them with career transitions, 
including:

• Wells Fargo’s Displacement policy requires that 
all displaced employees in the U.S. are provided a 
60-day notice period, unless otherwise required 
by business needs or federal, state, or local laws. 
Regardless of working or nonworking status, 
employees are still considered actively employed 
during the entire notice period.

• Employees are eligible for eight to 52 weeks of 
severance pay, based on years of service.

In countries where Wells Fargo operates outside of 
the U.S., the practices of managing redundancies or 
displacements, and workforce restructuring, vary 
based on legal and regulatory requirements, and 
local market practices. International support may 
include enhanced severance pay arrangements, 
employee assistance programs, and career 
transition services.

• Wells Fargo offers displaced employees Career 
Transition Services through an external vendor.

• Employees and their household family 
members can seek free, voluntary, confidential 
consultation and support for any concerns and 
challenges with Employee Assistance Consulting 
(EAC), a team of behavioral health professionals.

Employee safety and health

Wells Fargo recognizes the importance of providing 
a safe and healthy environment for employees, 
customers, and others who are on its premises.  
The company designed and implemented programs 
to help reduce the frequency and severity of  
injuries and illnesses. Wells Fargo also makes  
special accommodations available to help injured 
employees return to work when they are able. 

Wells Fargo is required to comply with applicable 
facility-related, legally mandated standards for 
workplace safety and health in the countries and 
communities in which it operates. Employees are 
responsible for following safe work practices and 
for reporting any unsafe working conditions. 

Newly hired employees are expected to complete 
safety and health training, and certain employee 
groups have quarterly refresher training 
requirements. Additionally, it is expected that 
managers provide training on job-specific hazards  
at the time of an employee’s initial assignment  
and to provide retraining whenever:

• New substances, processes, procedures, or 
equipment are introduced into the workplace 
that represent a new hazard.

• The manager is made aware of a new or 
previously unrecognized safety or health hazard.

• An employee is given a new job assignment and 
has not received training for that assignment.

Given the nature of Wells Fargo's business, 
cumulative trauma injuries, which are injuries that 
occur as a result of repetitive activity, and those 
resulting from slips, trips, and falls, are the most 
common workplace injuries. Training and awareness 
resources on these and other topics are accessible 
for all employees internally via the company's 
intranet. At some locations where cumulative 
trauma injuries could have higher frequency rates, 
the Site Ergonomic Coordinator Program provides 
access to on-site Wells Fargo employees trained in 
hazard identification and basic office ergonomics. 
Emergency Response and Violence-Free Workplace 
training is also provided on an annual basis.

Addressing harassment  
in the workplace

Harassment is against Wells Fargo policy, may 
violate the law, and will not be tolerated in the 
workplace or at work-related events. The company 
prohibits any form of harassment, including sexual 
harassment, of any employee, contingent resource, 
vendor, employment applicant, or customer on the 
basis of an individual's race, color, gender, national 
origin, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, gender expression, genetic information, 
physical or mental disability, pregnancy, marital 
status, hairstyles or hair texture, status as a 
protected veteran, or any other status protected  
by federal, state, or local law in the U.S.

Board of Directors

The Board remains focused on regular enhancement of its composition, oversight, and governance practices,  
and on Board succession planning to enable it to continue to oversee the company and its business effectively. 

Wells Fargo's Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines (PDF), which provide the framework for the 
governance of the Board and the company, including maintaining the independence of a significant majority of 
the directors on the Board, and all members of the Audit, Governance and Nominating, Human Resources, and 
Risk Committees. Additionally, the Board adopted the Director Independence Standards, which are appended to 
the Corporate Governance Guidelines. These Director Independence Standards consist of the New York Stock 
Exchange’s “bright line” standards of independence, as well as additional standards.

Over the past few years, the Board has undergone significant refreshment to enhance the financial services, 
regulatory, financial reporting, business operations, and corporate governance skills and experiences represented 
on the Board. The Board’s current composition is a result of a thoughtful process informed by the Board’s own 
evaluation of its composition and effectiveness, and feedback received from shareholders and other stakeholders.

compliance risks and includes the following core

customer due diligence, sanctions screening, 
transaction monitoring, reporting, other internal 
controls,  
and independent audit.

In accordance with its policy, Wells Fargo assesses 
customers and transactions for environmental and 
social factors that have the potential to impact 
various risk types, including reputation risk, credit 
risk, and strategic risk. This includes additional due 
diligence on sensitive industries such as oil and 
gas, coal and metal mining, arms and armaments, 
consumer finance, and in-scope Equator Principles 
transactions. 

Wells Fargo recognizes that all companies have a 
responsibility to respect human rights and prevent 
modern slavery from occurring in their operations, 
including their supply chain. 

In 2021, Wells Fargo engaged a third-party law 
firm with expertise in business and human rights 
to undertake a Human Rights Impact Assessment 
(HRIA). In 2022, the company published the Priority 
Recommendations of the Wells Fargo Human Rights 
Impact Assessment (PDF) and actions in response, as 
well as its updated Human Rights Statement (PDF).

In addition, the company outlined its strategies, 
policies, and programs related to the prevention of 
modern slavery, including human trafficking in the 
UK Modern Slavery Act (UK MSA) Statement.

Disclaimer and 
Forward-Looking 
Statements

This document contains forward-looking 
statements about Wells Fargo’s future financial 
performance and business. Because forward-
looking statements are based on our current 
expectations and assumptions regarding the future, 
they are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. 
Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements 
as actual results could differ materially from 
expectations. Forward-looking statements speak 
only as of the date made, and we do not undertake 
to update them to reflect changes or events that 
occur after that date. 

For more information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from expectations, 
refer to our reports filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, including the “Forward-
Looking Statements” discussion in Wells Fargo’s 
most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as 
well as to Wells Fargo’s other reports filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 
discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2021, 
available on its website at www.sec.gov.

While this document describes events, including 
potential future events that may be generally 
significant in the context of our ESG priorities and 
related activities, any such significance does not 
necessarily equate to the level of materiality of 
disclosures required under U.S. federal securities laws.

This document should not be used as a basis for 
trading in the securities of the Company or for 
any other investment decision and should not 
be construed as consisting of investment advice. 
The Company is not providing any financial, 
economic, legal, accounting, or tax advice or 
recommendations. This document reflects certain 
positions and approaches to ESG as of the date 
of this document that are subject to change at 
any time in the Company’s sole discretion without 
notice, and we do not undertake to update this 
document to reflect any such changes. Any 
references to “sustainable investing,” “sustainable 
financing,” “ESG,” or similar terms in this document 
are intended as references to the internally 
defined criteria of the Company, as applicable, 
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory 
definition that may exist. 

Information contained herein is sourced from a 
variety of internal and external sources and may 
be based on emerging or evolving practices. In 
addition, disclosures related to environmental 
sustainability, including disclosures related to the 
Company’s resource consumption and greenhouse 
gas emissions, as well as certain internal estimates 
and assumptions, are based in part on third-party

data. Uncertainties, inaccuracies or omissions in 
any of these inputs potentially have compounding 
effects on the accuracy and completeness of resulting 
emissions and resource consumption figures. The 
suitability of the design and effectiveness of the 
third-party systems and associated controls over the 
accuracy and completeness of the data has not been 
independently assessed. Accordingly, with respect 
to data that is not also included in the Company’s 
Statement of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the 
Company makes no representations or warranties as 
to the quality, completeness, accuracy, or fitness for 
a particular purpose and shall not be liable for any use 
by any party of, for any decision made or action taken 
by any party in reliance upon, or for any inaccuracies 
or errors in, or omissions from, such data. GHG-
Protocols require restatement if better information 
yields materially different base year emissions. Since 
methodologies and approaches continue to evolve, 
information we are currently disclosing could later 
potentially yield materially different emissions and 
may result in restatement. Other than as stated 

herein, the Company does not undertake any duty to 
restate or correct data should such information later 
prove to be incorrect.   

This document provides general information 
regarding a number of the Company’s policies,
