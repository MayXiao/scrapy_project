CIB FINANCIAL INCLUSION & ECONOMIC EMPOWERNMENT

CIB’s Financial Inclusion product offerings are simple KYC products, tailored to best serve the 

unbanked/untapped segments, providing them with access to finance through easy  hassle and free 

onboarding for certain products

The CIB Smart Wallet (SW) was launched

in 2016 primarily to serve unbanked

customers by providing a convenient,

secure, and cost-effective way to make

financial transactions through mobile

devices. Through the wallet, customers

can easily pay bills, recharge their mobile

lines, transfer money to other wallet

holders in Egypt, and deposit or withdraw

funds from any ATM machine or any of

CIB’s authorized Banking Agent’s outlets

The Ameen digital wallet, providing

customers with access to even more

advanced financial services and products

such as savings, loyalty, and lending. The

wallet is intended to gradually replace the

SW and should give the Bank an edge

over other wallets in the market. It will help

the Bank generate additional revenue

streams and provide easier access and

enablement to unbanked and underserved

segments.

Bedaya, the LCY account, was launched in

November 2021, targeting individuals,

entrepreneurs, micro enterprises with a

special focus on housewives, youth, and

freelance professionals. The account aims

to include society’s unbanked segments,

eliminate entry barriers, and encourage

the unbanked population to enter the

banking sector through the simplification

of the account-opening process.

Prepaid cards are only issued for Egyptians,

without the need to open a bank account,

using their valid national ID. Customers can

easily withdraw from any ATM in Egypt and

purchase from any in-store merchant and

Egyptian e-commerce platforms using their

cards. They are cheaper to issue and

transact with versus other debit/credit cards.
