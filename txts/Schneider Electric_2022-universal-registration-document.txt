Integrated Report S T R A T E G I C  R E P O R T

We develop solutions for a world that is 
more digital, more electric, and more 
sustainable.”
Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO

 “

Statement from the Chairman & CEO, Jean-Pascal Tricoire

It goes without saying: 2022 was another hugely challenging year 

for the world. On top of the lingering effects of the pandemic, 

supply chain disruptions, and electronic and resource shortages of 

the preceding years, 2022 brought war, sanctions, soaring interest 

rates, inflation, and an energy and cost-of-living crisis that caused 

hardship for millions of people and weighed on economies around 

the world. And not to forget some of the worst climate-related 

events on record. 

Against this backdrop, we, at Schneider Electric, deployed our 

people and resources across our geographic footprint to make a 

meaningful impact – both supporting the communities impacted by 

the immediate crises, and helping all our stakeholders to improve 

their efficiency, reach for their sustainability goals, digitize to be fit 

for the future and bolster their long-term resilience against future 

economic and environmental shocks. 

It was another year in which we were true to our purpose: to 

empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, 

bridging progress and sustainability for all. 

The inflection point: the new energy future is about 

to materialize 

While there’s a lot to reflect on, it’s best to focus on what this means 

for the future. 

The root cause of both the climate crisis and the energy crisis is the 

same: an unsustainable energy model that relies heavily on carbon-

dense energy sources like gas, coal and oil. In 2022, we saw the 

consequences of having put insufficient investment towards 

remodeling our energy system. Energy prices, aggravated by the 

war in Ukraine, soared to a point that choked the economy.

What all this means is that we’re at an inflection point. The twin 

crises of climate and energy has created a potential turning point in 

the way we generate, manage, and consume energy. 

The medium-term aspiration of reaching carbon neutrality to fight 

climate change now fully aligns with the short-term objective of 

ensuring energy security and shielding economies from the 

volatility and pressure of energy prices.

Accelerating the energy transition has never made more sense.

A year that reinforced our focus on digitization, 

electrification, and sustainability 

The best way to make the energy transition a reality is to 

decarbonize the demand side of the energy equation – how we use 

and consume energy. Think about it: Net-zero buildings, homes or 

cities, cars powered by electricity, ultra-efficient industries. All these 

are less severely impacted by rising energy costs and energy 

supply constraints. And they contribute less to climate change. 

Too often, the debate focuses purely on how to shift energy supply 

away from fossil fuels and towards renewables. This is forgetting 

the most important part: energy transitions happen when we 

transition the demand side. So we must transition demand for 

technologies that benefit users, and the supply will follow. 

We have the opportunity, today, to create a more energy-efficient 

world by combining:

1. Digitization that can save energy in homes, commercial and 

other buildings, infrastructure, data centers, and industry.

2. Greater electrification, on both the production and the 

consumption side. Electricity is much more efficient than the 

combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars and heat pumps are 

clear examples of this. We don’t appreciate enough that 60% of 

fossil fuels today are wasted in the process of conversion. 

3. Decentralization of some of our energy production, via 

microgrids using on-site renewables. 

4. Flexibility of energy supply and demand, via smart grids that 

allow us to optimize how we use or store energy. 

At Schneider Electric we’ve spent the last 20 years building our 

expertise and portfolio in exactly those areas. We develop solutions 

for a world that is more digital, more electric, and more sustainable, 

helping our customers at every stage of their journey towards 

greater efficiency and resilience, wherever they are. 

EcoStruxure, our full IoT, plug-and-play, open, interoperable 

architecture and platform, covers everything from Connected 

Products to Edge Control, and Apps, Analytics and Services to 

meet the needs of customers. 

Our agnostic software and data portfolio provides the toolbox for 

customers to digitize their enterprise. By bringing together all of 

their data into an industrial format, we can build a full digital twin of 

their operations. This enables them to immerse their people in a 

comprehensive metaverse of their enterprise, deliver greater 

efficiency and costs savings, and increase safety, resilience and 

circularity. The recent acquisition of AVEVA allows us to bring these 

possibilities to our customers faster.

Our services offer supports our customers across the lifecycle of 

their assets, from initial consultation to end-of-life and circularity. 

Our sustainability business supports customers with a full-

service consultancy offering, from strategy right through to 

digitization and decarbonization. It starts with measuring their 

carbon and energy footprint, then helping to reduce this footprint 

and bolster their energy resilience, including through sourcing the 

cheapest and greenest energy for their use.

While the majority of our activity is focused on the demand side, we 

also provide solutions to decarbonize and improve the safety of the 

fossil fuel industry. Realistically, fossil fuels will remain a significant 

part of the energy mix for many years. At Schneider Electric, we 

therefore assist this industry in their journey to minimizing their 

carbon and methane footprint, and the impact on environment  

and society.

A year that reinforced our strategy of having ESG 
at the core of everything we do

Business drivers and performance are one side of the story. The 
other is non-financial performance: we don’t see positive 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance as 
something that comes at the price of business performance. 

Since the early 2000s, we’ve put ESG principles at the heart of 
everything we do. Back then, we set ourselves ambitious goals 
around decarbonization, diversity and inclusion, social 
responsibility, among others. Since then, we’ve consistently dialed 
up those goals and commitments. They’ve helped us to expand into 
promising new markets, to innovate, to reduce waste and costs, 
recycle and save resources, and to attract and retain talent.

Today, we are an “Impact Company”, striving to make a long-term 
positive impact across multiple dimensions on the planet and 
societies around us. The logic is simple: if you want to do well as a 
company, you must also do good – and vice versa. And we must 
bring everyone along on this journey. 

Over the course of 2022, we delivered some great achievements 
and received numerous awards and recognitions that attest to our 
performance on these fronts. 

For more detail on all this, please read the overview that Gwenaelle 
Avice-Huet, our Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer, provides 
later on in this report.

A year that underlined the value of our unique 
multi-hub model and culture

Throughout the turmoil of the past few years – and in 2022 in 
particular – our multi-hub set-up has stood us in good stead. 
Having four regional hubs -- in North America, Europe, China and 
India – has provided us with greater resilience amid constant 
change. 

Our teams are empowered to make decisions in light of the local 
situation, adapting and responding quickly to market opportunities 
and local circumstances. They do this while staying close to our 
customers, business partners and other stakeholders, and locating 
our factories and warehouses close to the points of sale, thus 
limiting the carbon footprint of our supply chains.

A year that highlighted that Great People really 
make Schneider a Great Company 

Crises or not, our colleagues in more than 100 countries around the 
world work with purpose, passion and commitment to support our 
customers, our communities, our business, and each other. 

I’m proud to say that’s long been the case, as the numerous awards 
and recognitions we receive every year confirm. But 2022 truly 
highlighted this dedication. 

Our supply chain, sales and customer service teams navigated 
difficulties and worked hard to try to find solutions to the resource 
and delivery challenges that still haunted the world for much of 
2022. Our factory workers in some countries volunteered to spend 
weeks inside their sites to ensure that mission-critical operations 
continued throughout the local lockdowns. And together, our 
people and company raised over €2 million for the Tomorrow Rising 
Ukraine Fund, which we set up to support Ukrainians at this very 
difficult time, and donated a range of electrical equipment, to help 
restore energy in the country.

A year of challenges – and of opportunity

Yes, 2022 was another year full of challenges for economies, 
companies and households the world over. But those very 
challenges are now coalescing to accelerate the transition we so 
urgently need. 

We have the opportunity to create a new energy landscape -- one 
that is connected, smart, efficient, clean, sustainable, and more 
resilient to external shocks. And one that makes access to safe and 
reliable energy a reality for everyone. 

Schneider Electric is positioned right at the heart of these changes: 
our products, systems, services and software; our portfolio, 
people, and multi-hub set-up; and our commitments to making a 
positive impact on the planet and society. All these combine to 
make us a trusted partner and advisor for our customers as they 
navigate this journey towards the new energy future. 

At our 2022 Fiscal results, I made the announcement that as of May 
4 2023, Peter Herweck will become Chief Executive Officer of 
Schneider Electric and I will continue on as Chairman of the Board. 
After thirty-six years at Schneider, of which twenty were spent as 
Chief Executive or Operating Officer, I leave the role of CEO just as 
passionate about the business, people and customers as when I 
first began my career at this company.

Under Peter’s leadership, a new chapter of Schneider Electric 
begins, building on the solid foundation that many have contributed 
to and created together these past two decades. 

I look forward to continuing this journey with Schneider as 
Chairman.

Chairman and CEO

A record year, positioning us well for 
ongoing sustainable growth.”

An interview with Chief Financial Officer, Hilary Maxson

What were the highlights of Schneider Electric’s 
2022 financial performance?

We delivered a strong operational performance in 2022 with a 
focus on execution, enabling us to reach record levels of revenues, 
adjusted EBITA and net income. We made good progress on our 
strategic initiatives of more products, more software and services 
and more sustainability which contributed to us recording +12.2% 
organic growth and reaching an all-time high EUR 34.2 billion in 
revenue. We improved our adjusted EBITA margin by +40 bps 
organic, reaching 17.6%, another record and representing more 
than EUR 6 billion in value. Net Income of EUR 3.5 billion increased 
by +9% from 2021 and was also an all-time high, despite losses of 
~300M associated with our exit from Russia.

The Group saw good volume expansion year-on-year, with price 
actions also contributing strongly to growth. Supply chain 
pressures were evident throughout the year, with progressive 
easing through the second half, though some tightness related to 
the supply of electronic components remains. We faced significant 
inflationary headwinds in the year, from raw materials, freight and 
electronics, and labor costs, which we were able to offset through 
strong pricing. We continued to deliver on our structural savings 
and cost efficiency plan with savings of €203 million in 2022, taking 
us to a cumulative EUR 1 billion over a three-year period. We also 
prepared for the future, with an additional €547 million invested on 
our strategic priorities in 2022. 

We delivered Free Cash Flow of EUR 3.3 billion, reflecting record 
operational cash flow EUR 5.3 billion, but working capital 
requirements continued to impact the free cash flow for the year, 
despite strong recovery in the second half, as the Group prioritized 
securing supply and delivery to customers in an overall strong 
demand environment.

In 2022, we also made good progress on our digital journey, with 
our Digital Flywheel now representing 53% of Group revenue, 
showing good progress towards a target of around 60% by 2025. 
Software & Services represented 18% of Group revenues in 2022, 
impacted by our transition to subscription at AVEVA and supply 
constraints in Services, but with acceleration expected in the next 
years as we drive our transformation to a hybrid-digital company. 
Within Software & Services, around 36% of related revenues were 
classed as recurring, showing strong progress towards a target of 
around 45% by 2025.

2022 was a year of portfolio change, tell us more 
about it?

We are happy to have completed the transaction to acquire the 
entire share capital of AVEVA this year, which will allow us to 
accelerate on our software strategy and towards our ambition of a 
consistent “Company of 25”(1). We also completed our portfolio 
optimization program, disposing €1.7 billion of revenues since the 
start of the program, in 2019. Over the past four years we’ve made 
good progress on our portfolio evolution and are well positioned for 
the future.

What is the outlook for Schneider Electric in 2023?

Our priority for 2023 is to continue to deliver sustainable growth, 
targeting organic growth in our adjusted EBITA within the range of 
between +12% to +16%. 

To deliver this strong performance, the Group will use two levers: 
firstly, organic topline growth where the Group targets between 
+9% and +11% and, secondly, organic adjusted EBITA margin 
expansion of +50bps to +80bps. 

How do you intend to drive shareholder returns in 
the next years?

The themes set out in our 2021 CMD are today more relevant than 
ever, and we are well positioned to benefit in the coming years from 
long-term secular trends set to drive growth across the end-
markets we serve. Our objective is to continue to generate strong 
earnings growth through a combination of top line growth and 
margin expansion supported by these long-term secular trends 
and accelerated by our strategy of more products, more software 
and services and more sustainability.

We retain a strong focus on shareholder returns, and we continue 
our track-record of proposing a progressive dividend for a 13th 
consecutive year, increasing our proposed dividend by +9% to 
EUR 3.15 per share.

I am confident, as CFO, that we have the portfolio, the technologies 
and the great people required to enable sustainable growth for 
years to come, elements which combine to allow us to offer 
attractive returns to our shareholders.

Hilary Maxson,
Chief Financial Officer

Financial Performance Highlights

2022 was a year of strong performance against a complex economic and  
geopolitical backdrop. We navigated the challenges faced with agility, taking  
the next step on our sustainable growth journey. Strong and dynamic market  
demand across most end-markets and segments enabled the Group set new  
record highs in Revenues, Adjusted EBITA and Net Income, while there was  
a strong recovery on Free Cash Flow in the second half of the year, supported  
by progressive easing in global supply chains. 

Revenue Performance
Consolidated revenue totaled EUR 34,176 million for the period 

ended December 31, 2022, up +12.2% organic and up +18.2% on 

a reported basis. Organic growth was driven by a continuation of 

strong and dynamic market demand in the majority of end-markets 

and segments served by the Group, supported by accelerating 

energy transition trends and recovery in late-cycle segments. 

Consumer-linked segments saw softness in some geographies in 

the second half of the year. The Group saw good volume expansion 

year-on-year, with price actions also contributing strongly to 

growth. Supply chain pressures were evident throughout the year, 

with progressive easing through the second half, though some 

tightness related to the supply of electronic components remains. 

Growth was impacted by the Group’s withdrawal from Russia and 

the effects of COVID-19 infections and related lockdowns in China. 

FX impact was +5.7% primarily due to the strengthening of the USD 

against the EUR, while there was a net negative impact of -0.2% 

from acquisitions and disposals.

Energy Management generated revenues of EUR 26,442 million, 

equivalent to 77% of the Group’s revenues and was up +12.9% 

organically. North America grew +18% organic with strong demand 

across all end-markets, including residential buildings. Western 

Europe was up +13% organic with double-digit growth in each of 

the five main economies of the region with continued good traction 

in Data Center & non-residential Buildings, though residential 

markets were impacted by pressures on consumer-spending. 

Asia-Pacific grew +9% organic impacted by the resurgence of 

COVID-19 and softer residential markets in China, but with strong 

growth across the rest of the region, notably in India. Rest of the 

World was up +10% organic with strong project execution in 

resource driven economies and despite headwinds from Russia 

prior to the Group’s exit.

Industrial Automation generated revenues of EUR 7,734 million, 

equivalent to 23% of the Group’s revenues and was up +9.5% 

organically. Growth was led by Discrete automation markets while 

sales into Process & Hybrid markets grew strongly, benefiting from 

recovery in resource driven economies. North America grew +10% 

organic led by performance in Discrete automation markets, while 

strong growth in Process & Hybrid markets was supported by 

execution on a project in Mexico. Western Europe was up +14% 

organic, with strong growth in Discrete automation markets, 

particularly in Italy, Spain and France. Asia Pacific was up +7% 

organic, impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19 in China, but 

with strong growth across the rest of the region, including in India 

and Japan. Rest of the World was up +8% organic despite 

headwinds from Russia prior to the Group’s exit.

Free Cash Flow 2,799 3,330 +19%

Adjusted EBITA margin at 17.6%, up +40 bps organic due to 

better volumes, pricing actions and delivery of the Group’s 

cost savings program.

Gross profit was up +10.8% organic with Gross margin down 

-50bps organic, reaching 40.6% in 2022. The decline in margin 

was mainly driven by lower productivity due to inflationary 

pressures in the supply chain.

2022 Adjusted EBITA reached €6,017 million, increasing organically 

by +14.4% and the Adjusted EBITA margin expanded by +40bps 

organic to 17.6% as a consequence of strong pricing, good cost 

control and improving SFC/Sales ratio.

The key drivers contributing to the earnings change were the 

following: 

• Volume impact was positive, +€761 million.

• The Group’s industrial productivity level was -€457 million. 

Underlying industrial productivity was +€148 million, before the 

headwind from higher costs of freight, electronic components 

and other inflationary items in the supply chain which totaled 

-€605 million. Over a three-year period (2020-2022) the Group 

has delivered underlying industrial productivity in excess of €700 

million (before the impacts of freight and electronics) with 2022 in 

particular impacted by tightness in global supply chains. 

• The net price2 impact was positive at +€1,348 million in 2022. 

Gross pricing on products was positive at +€1,818 million due to 

pricing actions taken throughout the year. In total, RMI was a 

headwind at -€470 million. Net price after taking into account 

freight, electronic components and other inflationary items in the 

supply chain was +€743 million.

• Cost of Goods Sold inflation was -€197 million in 2022, of which 

the production labor cost and other cost inflation was -€123

million, and an increase in R&D in Cost of Goods Sold was -€74

million. The overall investment in R&D, including in support 

function costs continued to increase as expected and 

represented ~5% of 2022 revenue.

• Support function costs increased organically by -€581 million, or 

+8.2% organic in 2022 but the Group was able to reduce the 

overall SFC to Sales ratio from 23.7% to 23.0%, improving by 

90bps organic.

The Group continued to deliver on its structural savings and 

cost efficiency plan with savings of €203 million in 2022. The 

Group invested an additional €547 million on its strategic 

priorities in 2022 including R&D, digital and commercial 

footprint to support future growth. Additionally, the Group faced 

a significant headwind from inflation, which totaled €254 million 

in 2022.

Cumulatively in the period 2020-2022, the Group met its 

objective in delivering €1 billion of structural savings. 

• The impact of foreign currency increased the adjusted EBITA by 

+€333 million in 2022, including an IFRS technical adjustment 

for hyperinflation impact in Turkey and Argentina.

• 2022 performance resulted in a favorable mix effect of +€49

million due to a strong improvement of Gross Margin in the 

Systems business (mainly coming from pricing) more than 

offsetting impacts from the relatively faster growth of Systems 

volumes compared to Products and lower growth at AVEVA.

• The impact from scope & others was -€226 million in 2022, with 

net Scope impacts representing a small negative amount mainly 

associated with Russia, which is treated as a scope item in Q4.

Financial Performance Highlights

(1) Organic change of adj. Net Income and adj. EPS is calculated after removal of impacts from Russia operations in both 2021 and 2022.

(2) Price on products and raw material impact.

Net income up +9%

Restructuring charges were -€227 million in 2022, €2 million 

higher than last year as the Group continued to implement its 

operational efficiency program to generate c.€1 billion of structural 

cost savings in the period 2020-2022. Cumulative restructuring 

charges over the same three-year period totaled €873 million.

Other operating income and expenses had an impact of -€433 

million, consisting of -€287 million losses in relation to the exit from 

Russia (mostly write-off of net book value), -€180 million of M&A 

and integration costs, -€75 million impairment associated with the 

disposal of Transformer Plants in Poland and Turkey, partly offset 

by gains on other disposals made in the year. In 2021, other 

operating income and expenses had a small negative impact of 

-€21 million as gains on disposals mostly offset the costs of M&A 

and integration. 

The amortization and impairment of intangibles linked to 

acquisitions was -€424 million compared to -€410 million last year. 

The increase was mostly due to OSIsoft with a full year of 

amortization in 2022, compared to 9 months in 2021.

Net financial expenses were -€215 million, €39 million higher than 

in 2021. The cost of debt was up slightly year-on-year, and 

additionally there was a negative FX impact on currencies where 

hedging is not possible.

Income tax amounted to -€1,211 million, higher than last year by 

€245 million as a function of the higher profit. The effective tax rate 

was 25.7%, higher due to the impact of the Russia disposal (ETR of 

24.6% excluding Russia, in the expected range of 23%-25% and 

compared to 23.2% in 2021).

Share of profit on associates decreased to +€29 million, down 

-€55 million compared to last year. Net Income from Delixi was 

down -€29 million year-on-year, impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns 

in China and some softness in Residential buildings markets. The 

net result generated by Uplight was also down year-on-year.

As a result, Net Income (Group share) was €3,477 million in 2022, 

up +9% from 2021. The Adjusted Net Income was €3,968 million in 

2022, up +16% vs. 2021.

Free Cash Flow reached €3.3 billion

The Group delivered Free Cash Flow of €3,330 million, primarily 

due to the P&L performance driving record operating cash flow of 

€5,393 million. 

Trade working capital requirements continued to impact the free 

cash flow for the year, as the Group prioritized securing supply and 

delivery to customers in an overall strong demand environment. 

The trade working capital dynamic turned positive in H2 as 

expected, with easing of supply chain constraints supporting 

backlog execution and therefore a reduction in the inventory levels 

held.

Net capital expenditure of €1,024 million remained stable at ~3% of 

revenue, while R&D cash costs of €1,845 million represented 5.4% 

of 2022 revenue.

Schneider Electric SE issued bonds totaling €1,100 million during 

2022.

Schneider Electric’s net debt at December 31, 2022 amounted to 

€11,225 million after payment of €1.8 billion to fulfill the 2021 

dividend, net acquisitions of €0.3 billion, offset by the good Free 

Cash Flow performance of €3.3 billion.

The net debt was also impacted by a technical adjustment of €4.6 

billion to reflect the commitment to purchase the minority shares in 

AVEVA, a transaction which closed on January 18, 2023. Adjusting 

to exclude the impact of such purchase commitments would result 

in a net debt of €6,477 million, comparable to the €7,127 million of 

the previous year end.

The Group remains committed to retaining its strong investment

Accelerating our digital journey
Schneider Electric has built the toolbox for customers to digitize their enterprise and build its full digital twin, 
allowing them to harness insights through data to deliver greater efficiency and savings. This is achieved 
through EcoStruxure, our IoT enabled, plug-and-play open architecture and platform.

Unparalleled portfolio

On top of EcoStruxure, we have built an agnostic software portfolio, meaning software that is not tied to any particular hardware device or 
technology platform, with offers across both Industrial Automation and Energy Management.

EcoStruxure for IoT, Data and Software for a complete Digital Twin

An increased focus on climate change, 
coupled with the recent energy crisis, has 
forced governments and corporations to 
re-think their energy consumption with a 
renewed and urgent need for energy 
efficiency and electrification. Schneider 
Electric believes that the path to energy 
efficiency lies in the ability to digitize 
existing installations across industries with  
a particular focus on mission-critical and 
energy-intensive applications.

For our customers there is a clear need  
for digital solutions across the lifecycle 
covering both the industry twin and the 
energy twin across the enterprise. We 
aspire to be the reference in the industrial 
world for contextualized asset data. We 
believe that customers can benefit when 
data from their enterprise installations  
feeds into a single data hub, accessible  
by specialized software applications for 
tangible efficiency gains and  
sustainability advancements.

Holistic efficency

In the current context, with priority on energy 
security and the resultant rise in energy costs, 
there is a clear need for greater energy efficiency. 
Schneider Electric’s portfolio of software will allow 
customers to converge their enterprise data, 
across domains of process, power and build,  
and provide contextualized data-driven insights 
across the lifecycle of their assets.

Implications for our customers

The combination of AVEVA and Schneider Electric agnostic 

software provides customers with one data hub, and a fast track to 

the Enterprise Metaverse. Doing so will drive benefits for 

customers, creating value through:

• Acceleration of the transition to a subscription model and 

Software as a Service (SaaS)

• Creating one data hub, converging customers process and 

energy data

• Bringing combined process and energy efficiency to industrial 

and infrastructure customers

• Providing one set of applications for the complete Enterprise 

Metaverse

• Leading to a frictionless customer experience

Implications for Schneider Electric

The transaction will serve to accelerate Schneider Electric’s 

software strategy, driving growth through:

• A simplified and co-ordinated agnostic software offering

• Operational flexibility and simplification

• Further convergence of technology through closer co-operation 

on R&D

• A co-ordinated go-to-market and greater customer coverage

Our three principles of Software 
governance

Schneider Electric intends to apply its fundamental principles of 

business autonomy and technological agnosticity to the 

governance of AVEVA by ensuring three “software governance 

principles”, which are: 

1. First, to maintain AVEVA’s software as fully agnostic. This means 

that AVEVA will continue to rely on open architectures and 

interoperable standards providing the equal ability to work with 

or without Schneider Electric hardware.

2. Second, to preserve AVEVA’s business autonomy. This means 

that the AVEVA name and brand will continue and AVEVA will 

have its own, dedicated go-to-market, marketing and R&D 

capabilities, as well as its own P&L. 

3. Third, to keep AVEVA’s specific culture as a software company. 

This means that the AVEVA teams will not be merged or 

integrated with existing Schneider Electric hardware 

businesses, or country operations.

supply chain. Robust data is crucial for a sustainable solution for 

both the organization and its customers.

Resilient – By reducing exposure to hazards and risks to minimize 

unplanned downtime. Monitoring and data analysis helps data 

center teams proactively avoid uptime threats and maintain 

business continuity.

Efficient – More and more data centers are incorporating human 

resources and cost aspects such as CapEx in total cost of 

ownership (TCO). Intelligent sensors and digital services will drive 

more efficient operations.

Adaptive – Speed and precision in delivering goods and services 

is a new business success threshold. Data centers must adjust to 

changing customer demands. Agile designs enable data centers to 

pivot and scale quickly. Meeting these demands is crucial for 

business success.

Innovations introduced in 2022 include:

• EcoStruxure™ IT: Schneider Electric’s comprehensive data

center infrastructure management (DCIM) software solution that

Climate change is the defining issue of our time. We must limit the planet’s warming to 1.5º Celsius, which 
means collectively eliminating three times more carbon emissions by 2030. The good news is, we have tools 
available to make the world less carbon intensive and more energy efficient. But no one can complete the 
decarbonization journey alone. Only by teaming together can we accelerate progress on the world’s path to 
net zero. And that’s what Partnering for Sustainability is all about.

Our 2025 sustainability 
commitments 
With less than 10 years left to reach the 17 United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Schneider Electric has 

accelerated its impact and is making new, bold commitments to 

drive meaningful impact within the framework of its business 

activity. Schneider Electric’s 6 long-term commitments are to:

Act for a climate-positive world

by continuously investing in and developing innovative 

solutions that deliver immediate and lasting decarbonization in 

line with our carbon pledge.

Be efficient with resources

by behaving responsibly and making the most of digital 

technology to preserve our planet.

Live up to our principles of trust

by upholding ourselves and all around us to high social, 

governance, and ethical standards.

Create equal opportunities

by ensuring all employees are uniquely valued in an inclusive 

environment to develop and contribute their best

Harness the power of all generations

by fostering learning, upskilling, and development for each 

generation, paving the way for the next.

Empower local communities

by promoting local initiatives and enabling individuals and 

partners to make sustainability a reality for all.

Our unique  
transformation tool 
Since 2005, Schneider Electric measures and demonstrates its 

progress against sustainability goals with a unique transformation 

dashboard called Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI). 

The SSI is the translation of our six long-term commitments into a 

selection of 11 highly transformative and innovative programs 

executing our 2021 – 2025 sustainability strategy. It has been 

designed to focus on the most material issues, leveraging internal 

and external stakeholders feedback.

Every quarter, the SSI provides, on a scoring scale of 10, an overall 

measure of all the programs’ progress, which is shared with all our 

stakeholders together with financial results. 

At the end of the year, 64,000 employees of the Group are 

rewarded for the progress achieved as the SSI constitutes 20% of 

their short-term incentive plans’ collective share (STIP).

To ensure robustness, the SSI’s performance and monitoring 

systems are audited annually by an independent third party and 

obtain a “moderate” assurance, in accordance with ISAE 3000 

assurance standard, except for SSI #+1. In 2022, the Group 

obtained a “reasonable” assurance for SSI #8 and will 

progressively cover all externally assured KPIs with this new level 

of assurance.

Proud of 2022’s sustainability achievements

The Schneider Sustainability Impact is a scorecard demonstrating that rapid and disruptive changes for a more 
sustainable world are possible across diverse, complex topics. We are committed to taking urgent action to 
co-create a brighter future aligned with the United Nations SDGs, and measuring our impact with transparency.

In 2022, the SSI achieved a great score of 4.91/10, exceeding its 4.70/10 target for the year, and is on track to achieve its 2025 ambition. 

This result represents the average progress of 10 SSI programs, ie excluding SSI #+1 and exceptionnaly SSI #6 as 2022 is the baseline for 

this program.

Significant progress was notably achieved for SSI #9 with 5.5 million people provided with access to green electricity in 2022 alone (vs 4.2 in 

2021). The Group also achieved the rapid transition of 45% of its packaging to plastic-free and recycled carboard (SSI #5), compared to 21% 

one year before. The Decent Work program (SSI #6) was launched for the first year, with more than 500 suppliers committing to join the program 

and some 1.5% already meeting the expectations set by Schneider Electric. Lastly, progress against the nearly 200 local commitments taken in 

all markets where Schneider operates under SSI #+1 can be consulted online, some examples are provided in the opposite page.

• Demand in consumer-linked segments (Residential buildings, 

Distributed IT) to continue deceleration from highs, particularly 

in mature markets

• Government incentives across the world centered around 

energy transition, decarbonization and improved energy 

efficiency to further support growth

• Backlog execution to support growth

• Supply constraints expected to progressively ease; improving 

supply environment should support stronger underlying 

industrial productivity

• Some deceleration of inflationary pressure, though pockets of 

inflation expected to remain 

2023 Target
The Group sets its 2023 financial target as follows:

2023 Adjusted EBITA growth of between +12% and 

+16% organic. 

The target would be achieved through a combination of organic 

revenue growth and margin improvement, currently expected to be:

• Revenue growth of +9% to +11% organic 

• Adjusted EBITA margin up +50bps to +80bps organic 

This implies Adjusted EBITA margin of around 17.4% to 17.7% 

(including scope based on transactions completed to-date and FX 

based on current estimation).

2022–2024 targets and long-term 
ambitions as announced in 2021  
Capital Markets Day

2022–2024 Targets:
• Organic revenue growth of between +5% to +8%, on average 

• A yearly organic improvement of between +30 bps to +70 bps in 

adjusted EBITA margin 

• c.€4 billion Free Cash Flow by 2024

Longer-term ambitions:
• Organic revenue growth of 5%+ on average across the 

economic cycle

• Opportunity to further expand adjusted EBITA margin and Free 

Cash Flow beyond 2024: Operational leverage and continued 

evolution of business mix to positively impact margins

Governance

A new governance effective on May 4, 2023

In accordance with the intention of the Board of Directors announced 

in 2021 to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive 

Officer, the Board, at its meeting of February 15, 2023, has decided to 

implement a new governance structure that splits the office of 

Chairman from that of Chief Executive Officer as of May 4, 2023:

• Mr. Peter Herweck who was Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA, will 

succeed Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chief Executive Officer of 

Schneider Electric, becoming responsible for the general 

management of the Company, as the sole executive corporate 

officer; 

• Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire will remain as Chairman, at the unanimous 

request of the Board of Directors who wants to retain the benefit of 

his experience in significantly and successfully transforming the 

company over the past 20 years.

“The Governance & Remunerations Committee, 
under the guidance of the Board of Directors, has 
conducted over the last four years a 
comprehensive robust process to propose a 
succession plan for the role of CEO. Several 
high-quality candidates were considered. Peter’s 
level of global operational experience, technology 
and software acumen, skills and personal qualities 
were assessed by the Board as being particularly 
in line with the Group’s strategy. His appointment 
was unanimously approved by the Board of 
Directors with Jean-Pascal Tricoire’s full support”.

Governance

Our Executive compensation

The general principles underlying the compensation policy for Corporate Officers and the analysis of their contribution to the Group’s 

performance are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors based on the recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations 

Committee. Executive compensation set by the Board of Directors is aligned with the Group’s global strategy and is based on three pillars 

divided into seven principles:

Pay for Performance Alignment with shareholders’ 

interest

Competitiveness

1.  Prevalence of variable 

components: circa 80% for CEO 

(at target).

2.  Performance is evaluated via 

economic and measurable 

criteria.

3.  Financial and Sustainability 

objectives are fairly balanced and 

distributed between short-term 

(annual variable compensation) 

and medium-term (long-term 

incentive) components.

4.  Significant proportion of the total 

compensation delivered in shares.

5.  Performance conditions support 

Schneider Electric’s strategic 

priorities and are aligned with 

shareholders’ expectations.

6.  To benchmark the Corporate 

Officer’s compensation package 

“at target” in the median range of 

the Company’s updated peer 

group.

7.  To reference the CAC 40 third 

quartile and the Stoxx Europe 50 

median.

Aligned with those principles, the compensation of the Corporate 

Officer is made of the following components: for the variable 

component of the compensation, the Board upon recommendation 

of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, chooses the 

performance conditions directly linked to the Group’s priorities. The 

Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) which includes a climate target 

(see section 2.1.2 of the Universal Registration Document) is used as 

a criterion in the annual variable compensation of the Corporate 

Officer and that of the 64,000 employees benefiting from such 

compensation. In the same way, the Schneider Sustainability 

External & Relative Index (SSERI) is used for the long-term incentive 

plan granted to 3,000+ employees including the Corporate Officer.

(1) LTIP granted during 2023 fiscal year valued in accordance with IFRS standards.

(2) Between 0% and 200%.

Our Stakeholders

Proud to be one of the most ethical 
companies

Present in over 100 countries with diverse standards, values, and practices, Schneider Electric is committed to 
behaving responsibly in relation to all its stakeholders. Convinced that its responsibility extends beyond 
compliance with local and international regulations, the Group is committed to doing business ethically, 
sustainably, and responsibly. Schneider’s business actions and decisions run on trust.

Trust Charter, Schneider Electric’s Code 
of Conduct

Schneider Electric Trust Charter acts as the Group’s Code of 

Conduct and demonstrates its commitment to ethics, safety, 

sustainability, quality, and cybersecurity. Schneider Electric 

believes that trust is a foundational value. It is earned. It serves as a 

compass, showing the true north in an ever more complex world 

and Schneider Electric considers it to be core to its environment, 

sustainability, and governance commitments.

Trust powers all Schneider Electric’s interactions with stakeholders 

and all relationships with customers, shareholders, employees, and 

the communities they serve, in a meaningful, inclusive, and positive 

way. It is implemented via the Ethics & Compliance program with 

responsibilities at Board, executive, corporate, and operational levels.

Our Speak Up Mindset

Schneider Electric employees must feel free and psychologically 

safe to share their ideas, opinions, and concerns, without fear of 

retaliation, this is the base of our Speak Up mindset. All 

stakeholders may report concerns either by contacting an 

appropriate person internally or by using the Trust Line, our 

whistleblowing system, which is available online globally, at all 

times, and protects the anonymity of the whistleblower.

To ensure the effectiveness of that Speak Up mindset and related 

whistleblowing system, the Group created two specific committees: 

the Group Operational Compliance Committee (GOCC) which 

detects and manages cases of non-compliance and reviews 

monthly the effectiveness of the system, and the Group Disciplinary 

Committee which levies sanctions and remediation actions on 

serious non-compliance cases to guarantee a fair and transparent 

disciplinary policy.

All employees are invited to express whether they are comfortable 

to “report an instance of unethical conduct without fear” each year. 

In 2022, 82% of employees surveyed answered “yes”, a 1 pt 

progress vs 2021, on track with the group’s 2025 ambition to raise 

its employee’s confidence by 10 points (SSI #7).

Training and empowering all employees 

Every year, a global campaign of mandatory trainings is run for all 

employees, called Schneider Essentials, and is available in 18 

languages. In 2022, Schneider Essentials trainings were: Trust at 

Schneider Electric, Cybersecurity, We All Have Mental Health and 

The Schneider Electric Story. Other trainings are provided to 

specific businesses or service teams according to their roles and 

positions, such as anti-corruption.

In June 2022, a Trust Month was launched to further raise 

awareness among employees. This internal communication 

campaign has been a great medium to draw together all the pillars 

of Trust into a single event, which consisted of 15 keynotes, 70 

webinars and gathered more than 15,000 webinar attendees.

2022 achievements

15,000+
employees participated 

in the first Trust Month 

event.

97.5%
of all employees 

completed the Schneider 

Essentials trainings.

2022 achievements 

Top 25% 
in external ratings for 

Cybersecurity performance.

250,000 
employees’ working conditions 

improved thanks to the ‘Vigilance 

Program’ for suppliers since 2017.

2,000+ 
suppliers assessed under our 

vigilance plan since 2018.

Schneider Electric’s vigilance plan

In 2017, Schneider started the implementation of a vigilance plan covering its business activities as well as 
those of its suppliers and subcontractors in order to prevent negative impacts on people or the planet within 
its value chain. Since then, this vigilance plan has been continuously reinforced, aiming to expand further 
towards communities. 

An end-to-end, risk-based mitigation plan

The Group’s vigilance plan complies with the provisions of the 2017 French law on corporate duty of vigilance and includes:

• A risk analysis specific to risks that Schneider Electric poses or may pose on its ecosystem and environment;

• A review of the key actions implemented to remediate or mitigate these risks;

• An alert system (Trust Line); 

• Governance specific to vigilance.

In this Registration document, Schneider Electric presents the results of the risk assessment, and the subsequent mitigation actions.  

A synthesis of key risks and actions is presented below.

The plan is governed by the Duty of Vigilance Committee, set up in 2017. The committee meets twice a year, and has met 15 times since its 

inception.

Risk areas Main risk identified Main mitigation actions Risk level

•  Cybersecurity: only high risk for the 

Group’s sites, as Schneider Electric is a

Great people make a great company

As the changes to our world accelerate and transform our industry, we consider the Group’s culture as a key 
business differentiator to achieve profitable and sustainable growth. Schneider Electric is a people company 
where employees come to work for a meaningful purpose and feel empowered to have an impact.

People Strategy in the next normal

The world is moving fast and is at an inflection point: the desire for 

climate neutrality and energy transition are driving our business 

strategy and pushing the Group towards sustainable growth. At the 

same time, digital transformation and changing social needs are 

demanding greater inclusion. The post-pandemic world followed by 

ever growing supply chain constraints due to geopolitical issues 

are creating more opportunities for Schneider Electric to be the 

most local of global companies.

Schneider’s People Strategy supports its business growth as well 

as its culture and leadership transformation. To shape the 

workforce of the future in the “next normal”, the strategy is 

articulated around 3 pillars: 

• Organizational agility – a growth and innovation culture, 

enabled by a leaner, agile and multi-hub/multi-local structure, 

customer proximity, and fast decision making, supported by 

new ways of working. 

• Future ready talent – a diverse, empowered, and digitally 

skilled team. All talents develop current and future skills through 

a personalized experience to realize their potential. 

• Leadership Impact – leaders deliver impact on results and 

transformation through disruption, collaboration and inclusion. 

They build great teams, coach and care to achieve together.

Committed to Schneider Great People

Schneider Electric’s great people are passionate about our 

meaningful purpose. The Group motivates its employees and 

promotes their involvement by making the most of its diversity, 

supporting professional development, and ensuring safe, healthy 

working conditions. Its ultimate ambition is to deliver higher 

performance and greater employee engagement, through 

world-class people practices that are supported by a multi-hub 

model.

By 2025, Schneider Electric has committed to creating equal 

opportunities and harnessing the power of all generations. It will 

achieve this by ensuring all employees are uniquely valued in an 

inclusive work environment and by fostering learning, upskilling and 

development for each generation. In regards to this commitment, 

the Group launched in 2021 the senior talent program to 

accompany employees in the later stages of their career which 

accelerates the transfer of knowledge and skills across all 

generations, and serves as a great enabler to a just transition.

Our Employee Value Proposition is our commitment to engage 

existing and future talent. It is the reason why people join, stay, and 

remain engaged and shows how we differentiate ourselves as an 

employer.

Our Employee Value Proposition

Acting for a climate-positive world  
and preserving resources

Climate change and nature loss are two of the greatest global challenges of the 21st century. They are inextricably 
linked and require joint efforts and solutions to tackle them. Schneider Electric’s climate and resources strategies 
converge to minimize its environmental footprint and to maximize the environmental benefits its offers bring. 

Climate & Resources strategy

Urgent action and a system-wide transformation are needed to 

deliver the enormous emissions cuts necessary to limit greenhouse 

gas (GHG) emissions. With its climate programs, the Group aims to 

limit its carbon emissions by implementing its own Energy 

Management and Industrial Automation solutions and develop 

offers that will help its customers do the same.

Schneider Electric was one of the first companies to have its 

Net-Zero targets validated by the most recent SBTi “Corporate 

Net-Zero Standard” in August 2022. The Group is committed to be 

“Net-Zero Ready” in its operations and to reduce by 25% its scope 

3 emissions by 2030, and to be Net-Zero across its full value chain 

by 2050. In addition, as an intermediary milestone, by 2040, the 

Group will be carbon neutral along its full value chain. With its 

resource programs, the Group aims to minimize the volume of 

resources it needs and optimize the use of these resources. The 

current linear systems and existing infrastructure are not adequate 

to maintain, collect, and redistribute materials effectively for a 

global circular economy. As a result, waste, including plastics and 

e-waste pollutes our land, and the world continues to deplete the 

limited natural resources. Schneider Electric embraces circular 

economy principles all along the lifecycle of products and offers. 

The keystone of Schneider’s circularity approach is EcoDesign 

Way™, a process that is applied to the development of all new 

products. EcoDesign Way™ enables the right trade-offs between 

the environmental impact along the lifecycle of products, allowing 

to co-ordinate the efforts over the whole value chain.

Delivering social impact for  
a just transition 

Around the world, Schneider Electric gives people access to energy and education through initiatives that 
combine training, technological innovation, social innovation, and entrepreneurship. This means thinking 
about the world of tomorrow by empowering everyone, regardless of origin, gender, or socio-economic level to 
build a fair future for individuals and families worldwide.

Bringing access to green electricity 

Today, more than two billion people have little or no access to 

electricity, representing one in four of the world’s population. At 

Schneider Electric, we believe that access to energy is both a 

fundamental right and a means for social and economic 

development. Specifically, access to green electricity offers a 

chance to live a better life, because it can have a positive multiplier 

effect on all socio-economic dimensions of the individual or 

community: livelihood, health, education, security, and 

empowerment of women, while fighting against climate change by 

replacing fossil solutions. 

We call this Electricity for Life and Electricity for Livelihood. 

“Electricity for Life” means delivering access to green electricity as 

a fundamental right, answering to essential needs (such as lighting, 

social connection, or education) for off-grid households, small 

businesses, and the humanitarian sector. 

“Electricity for Livelihood” means delivering access to green 

electricity as a driver of economic development and poverty 

reduction for households connected to an unreliable grid, and for 

productive businesses, In fact, farms, schools, or health centers in 

rural areas, depend on an intermittent grid and need quality energy 

with back-up solutions based on solar energy.

Schneider’s Access to Energy solutions already benefited close to 

40 million people between 2009 and 2022. Our ambition is to 

support a cumulative total of 50 million people by 2025, and 100 

million by 2030.

Empowering youth by education and 
entrepreneurship 

For more than 20 years, training and entrepreneurship have been 

the historical mission of the Schneider Electric Foundation, under 

the aegis of Fondation de France. The Group’s ambition is to train 

one million people by 2025 for energy-related professions. The 

Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program aims to give all 

young people the means to build solutions for a better life, 

contribute to a fairer, low carbon society, and transform the world.

By providing funding, our expertise, volunteering our time and 

collaborating with our partners on the ground, we are empowering 

younger generations and the broader community to achieve a 

better future through sustainable development. 

Our work is divided into three main areas: 

1. Support access to qualitative jobs through vocational and 

entrepreneurship training in the energy field.

2. Learn new skills for the future, technical and soft, giving younger 

generations the boost they need to succeed and build the world 

of tomorrow.

3. Create the right ecosystem to spread entrepreneurial spirit and 

encourage innovation, enhancing younger generations to define 

their future and take part in social and environmental 

challenges.

To do this, the Schneider Electric Foundation draws on a network of 

around 85 delegates across 80 countries. Their role is to select 

local partners in vocational training and entrepreneurship in the 

energy sector and to raise sustainability awareness. The 

Foundation also leverages its VolunteerIn organization to empower 

employees to be local actors and ambassadors of the Group’s 

societal commitments.

Building a Sustainable Procurement 
Strategy

Schneider Electric aims to collaborate with its global supplier 

network for an inclusive and carbon neutral world, where 

ecosystems and resources are preserved, and people get access 

to economic opportunities and decent lives. To achieve this, the 

Group: 

• Provides a Supplier Code of Conduct with fundamental 

requirements that all suppliers delivering goods or services to 

Schneider Electric are expected to adhere to.

• Integrates sustainability criteria in the day to day, operational 

procurement actions. The qualification process focuses on 

people, social responsibility, and environmental management. 

Sustainability criteria account for a significant part of the 

evaluation. 

• Has begun in 2021 a new five-year engagement with ambitious 

targets for each of the thematic areas:

 − Climate action, addressed by The Zero Carbon Project (SSI 

#3), aiming to reduce operational emissions from 1,000 

suppliers.

 − Enhance Circular Supply Chain by increasing the use of 

Green Materials (SSI #4) and Sustainable Packaging (SSI #5)

 − Uphold social commitment related to Conflict Minerals and 

Extended Minerals (cobalt and mica)

 − Uphold human rights and inclusive workplaces by 

implementing best-in-class practices through the Decent 

Work program (SSI #6).

Holistic monitoring approach

To complete the Group’s commitment to environmental and social 

topics, it established a transversal governance mechanism to 

proactively screen, identify and mitigate sustainability risk from 

suppliers and embed preventive controls into the procurement 

processes and integrate in the day-to-day operations.

On the one hand, strategic suppliers are subject to the Group’s 

ambition to promote continuous improvement based on the ISO 

26000 standard evaluation.

On the other hand, our Vigilance program aims at auditing 4,000 

suppliers by 2025, identified as high risk suppliers. 

Suppliers can also report any corporate misconducts through the 

Trust Line, which will be thoroughly and confidentially investigated.

Sustainability and efficiency for Customers

As the digital partner of its customers for Sustainability and Efficiency, Schneider Electric delivers products 
and services empowering them to make the most of their energy and resources. To do so, the Group relies on 
the highest standards of product quality and safety, as well as digital trust and security. 

Green PremiumTM offers

In 2008, Schneider Electric developed Green PremiumTM, its 

product sustainability program, to provide transparent information 

on hazardous substances, environmental impact, and end-of-life 

instructions. 

The new Green PremiumTM is an expression of our innate belief that 

ambitious environmental considerations must be embedded in all 

our value propositions. It is also what customers and business 

partners have been increasingly asking for, in multiple 

geographies, across multiple market segments.

The new label encompasses three pillars: Trust, Transparency, and 

Performance. Trust means Schneider continuing to be transparent 

with customers, and going beyond regulations by applying the 

same rules regardless of the geographies. Transparency is the 

warranty from Schneider to disclose in a digital way the 

environmental impacts of its products, their end-of-life treatment, as 

well as any meaningful environment-related attribute for customers. 

Finally, performance is Schneider’s commitment to deliver products 

with reduced environmental impact.

Today, more than 80% of Schneider’s product sales originate from 

Green PremiumTM offers.

Strive for Premium Quality

Schneider Electric’s priority is to delight customers with an 

outstanding end-to-end experience. It is our ambition to earn the 

reputation as the safest supplier in our industry. This vision is built 

on trust: we are committed to ensuring the safest experiences for 

our customers and we believe it is the personal responsibility of 

every employee at Schneider. Safety is at the heart of innovation at 

Schneider. At Schneider, industry standards are not the goal – they 

are the baseline. We innovate beyond standards and believe that 

technology helps people work safer. Safety demands active 

engagement of all, without exception. We rise to new challenges. 

Moreover, to better fulfill customers’ needs and improve their 

satisfaction, Schneider Electric relies increasingly on data 

analytics, and digital interlocks to secure a zero defect mindset at 

the core of our processes from design, to execution and services. 

The Group’s commitment to quality and customer satisfaction is 

illustrated in its ambition to have zero product recalled from 

customers, by 2025.

From 2022 we have introduced a Customer First Performance 

Criteria in the incentive goals for Group executives, measured with 

our Net Customer Satisfaction through real-time digital customer 

surveys covering six critical touchpoints as part of our customer 

operational interactions. All the results are available in the 

Customer Feedback Management Platform where all the 

employees are engaged to act on the Customer Experience.

Strive for Resiliency

Resiliency is the capacity to quickly recover from difficulty. We use 

a risk centric framework to reduce our exposure to technological, 

environmental, process, geopolitical, and health risks that might 

disrupt our business. Schneider Electric has standardized 

issue-escalation processes in place, as well as risk assessment 

and business impact analysis, and is prepared to manage any 

crisis with disaster recovery and business continuity plans, if 

needed. The Group’s local leaders are empowered to assess risks, 

increase their preparedness and handle all types of crises with a 

rapid and effective response, thanks to processes and tools in 

place to support them.

Strive for trust in Cybersecurity, Data 
Privacy and Protection 

Schneider Electric’s cybersecurity strategy encompasses people, 

processes, and technology across the operational lifecycle. By 

following globally recognized standards and complying with 

certified ‘secure by design’ development processes, the Group 

safeguards digital ecosystem and delivers secure offers, systems, 

solutions and services. The right to privacy and protection of 

personal information is a fundamental human right. Schneider 

considers fairness, transparency, data integrity, quality, security, 

and trust as core principles of how the way it handles data and 

uses it in the products, systems and services they deliver. In 2022, 

the Group was awarded Gold Medal for its first participation to the 

CyberVadis’ assessment, underlining its commitment for 

cybersecurity. By leveraging digital technologies based on human 

centered design with a ‘do no harm’ oversight, solutions benefit 

customers’ sustainable future.

1.1 Trends and opportunities

The medium-term objective of reaching carbon 
neutrality to fight climate change fully aligns with the 
short-term objective of energy security

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC)’s Sixth Assessment Report issued in 2021, 
was described by the UN Secretary General, Antonio 
Guterres, as a “Code Red for Humanity”. Critical 
decarbonization measures are required to stay within 
a global warming trajectory of 1.5°C. 

The year 2022 will go down in the history books as one of the most 

turbulent in decades. Against the backdrop of some of the worst 

climate-related events on record – extreme heatwaves across 

Europe, a dried-up Yangtze River in China, catastrophic flooding in 

Pakistan – economies and societies around the world also faced 

painful geopolitical turmoil, and an energy crisis that caused prices 

to soar and exposed dependencies on supply.

These events brought untold pain for millions around the world. But 

they also generated an opportunity we cannot afford to miss: to 

tackle the energy and the climate crises, hand-in-hand.

Because the root cause of these multiple crises – notably climate 

and energy – is the same, the solution is also the same: diversifying 

and decarbonizing energy sources and empowering all of us to 

better produce and manage the energy we need. The medium-

term objective of reaching carbon neutrality to fight climate change 

fully aligns with the short-term objective of energy security.

Schneider Electric advocates deploying proven digital technologies 

for energy efficiency, and an increased focus on electrification and 

sustainability to urgently decarbonize buildings, transport, and 

industry.

We are at an inflection point.

Being part of the solution 
Technologies already exist to make our companies energy resilient and net-zero.

70%
CO2 emissions can be 
removed using existing 
technologies.

As part of its ambition to deliver a more sustainable future, Schneider Electric uses technologies to help customers in many 

sectors to build net-zero pathways. Our research shows that 70% of emission reduction is achievable with existing, proven,  

and competitive technologies.

Efforts must be done on both the demand and the supply side. And we need a major acceleration on the demand side of the 

energy equation.

The equation for the future: Digital and electric is the recipe for a more sustainable and 
resilient world

Schneider’s positioning for a sustainable future focuses on an All Digital, All Electric world. It’s what we call “Electricity 4.0”:

• Digitization creates resilience and builds a smart future: Data analytics and insights enable more agile, efficient operations and 

continuity, making the invisible visible. Digital Intelligence makes massive amounts of invisible energy waste visible

• Electricity makes greener energy possible: Green energy production offers the best path for decarbonization 

+ =DIGITAL

For Efficiency

ELECTRIC

For Decarbonization 

SUSTAINABLE

Smart & Green

1. All Digital

Digital defines new levels of efficiency. Today’s digital economy is 

driving disruption across every sector, defining new levels of 

efficiency. While life is returning to pre-pandemic levels in places, 

many newly formed behaviors will not change (remote work, remote 

operations).

• Expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) in industrial 

processes, driving an abundance of data: By 2030, the 

number of IoT devices will be six times that of 2020 growing 

from eight billion to 50 billion, resulting in an eight times increase 

in compute workloads(1).

• Growing need to aggregate exponential amounts of data: 11 

billion smart appliances in one billion homes are expected to 

participate in interconnected electricity systems by 2040(2).

• New business models with artificial intelligence, 

algorithms, and platforms that turn vast amounts of data into 

insights and value. It is estimated that 70% of new value created 

in the economy over the next decade will be based on digitally-

enabled platform business models(3).

2. All Electric

On the second part of the equation, we have electrification, a key 

factor in accelerating towards decarbonization. 

• Climate change is an energy challenge:

 − >80% of the world’s CO
2
 emissions are linked to the 

production of energy.

 − >80% of energy demand is still delivered by fossil fuels.

 − Fossil fuels have high efficiency losses, with almost two-

thirds of primary energy being lost during use, while 

renewable energy sources have much lower losses, only 

around 5% in transmission and distribution. 

• Regardless of source – electrification is going to profoundly 

change energy on both sides (usage and supply):

 − Electrification of usage: Energy batteries are expected to 

provide up to five times more energy density by 2030(4).

 − Electrification of supply: More renewables, with a variable 

capacity mix anticipated to reach up to 50% by 2040(5).

In reality, the equation of the future needs to be an equation for today. 

The journey to net-zero is also a journey to energy security. Priorities are:

• Efficiency through digitalization.

• Decarbonization of all sources, with electrification/green electrification at the core.

• Flexibility through grid stability.

We are running out of time, but it is not too late – we need the demand side to take charge.

Why these trends matter for Schneider Electric?

Sustainability is not just a part of Schneider Electric’s business; 

sustainability is the core of our strategy. We integrate 

sustainability everywhere, in our model and culture, to have a 

strong impact at both a global and local level.

We see many of our customers stepping up their efforts and 

investments in sustainability. We have both the technologies and 

the expertise to support our customers on their sustainability 

journeys. Our solutions, from connected devices to software, 

digital services, and sustainability consulting, help our 

customers, whatever their maturity and scope.

Electrification and digitization are key drivers in all our 

end-markets bringing sustainability and efficiency. They fuel 

both of Schneider Electric’s businesses: Energy Management for 

energy transition and Industrial Automation for Industry 4.0.

Schneider Electric’s mission is to be your digital partner for 

Sustainability and Efficiency. We provide energy and digital 

automation solutions for sustainability and efficiency for your 

business. We combine world-leading process and energy 

technologies, real-time automation, software, and services,

1.2.2 The multi-hub company 

The multi-hub approach enables improved resiliency, agility, and proximity with our customers and suppliers.

We are one of the most local of the global companies. Our people are in the regions where we operate, close to our customers. 

Our multi-hub approach continues to be key in Schneider Electric’s strategy. It enables improved resiliency, agility, and proximity with our 

customers and our network of suppliers.

As today’s world is increasingly divided by politics, trade and data regulations, and the ever-evolving health situation, this characteristic of 

Schneider Electric’s model has shown its strategic importance.

Four hubs serve the Group’s different markets (Europe, North America, China and India). Each hub has its own capabilities, while operating 

and contributing together toward the same Group objectives.

Group objectives

Products and offers are adapted 

locally to the specificity and 

standards of local markets, 

leveraging global R&D platforms and 

architectures.

This is key for compliance with local 

standards (e.g., NEMA North 

America, IEC Europe, and CCC Asia 

Pacific), regulations (e.g., data and 

cybersecurity), operating conditions, 

and design specificities.

Schneider Electric’s supply chain is 

organized by region, serving local 

customers with the support of local 

suppliers.

As such, in 2021, 92% of Schneider’s 

supplied goods come from the same 

region as its manufacturing sites, and 

80% of Schneider’s sales are 

produced in the same region as its 

customers.

Schneider Electric’s suppliers are 

becoming increasingly local as close 

relationships are built with 

manufacturers in the region, for better 

flexibility and resiliency.

IMPACT
Company

Paving the way as an Impact Company

Schneider Electric aims to champion environmental, social, and 

ethical issues across its entire value chain and stakeholders, while 

delivering solutions to its customers for sustainability and efficiency. 

We call this dual approach “Impact Company”. 

The Group’s strategy is driven by the conviction that robust 

financial performance is a prerequisite to delivering positive 

sustainability impact. At the same time, this positive impact 

supports the long-term resilience of the Company as we attract 

new customers, investors, and talents. We pride ourselves in being 

an Impact Company and we strive to address the biggest 

challenges of our time, climate change and social inequality, at 

global and local levels. 

Today, Schneider Electric is a recognized worldwide sustainability 

leader, notably ranked #1 in the industry sector by the S&P 

Corporate Sustainability Assessment in 2022, and a member of 

several initiatives to advance on the 17 United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) with common objectives to protect the 

planet, alleviate poverty, and achieve worldwide peace.

Measuring progress with Schneider Sustainability Impact, a unique transformation tool 

For over 15 years, Schneider Electric has measured its holistic 

sustainability performance through a dashboard called Schneider 

Sustainability Impact (SSI) and has set up specific governance 

bodies to ensure that sustainability is positioned within every part of 

the Group’s strategy from the Board of Directors to the operational 

levels.

The SSI is a transformation scorecard demonstrating that rapid and 

disruptive changes for a more sustainable world are possible across 

many complex topics. Its scoring scale of 10 provides an overall 

measure of the Group’s progress on sustainability objectives.

By tracking our performance and publishing quarterly results, we 

uphold our commitments to the SDGs and industry leadership in 

corporate social responsibility. The five-year SSI for 2021 – 2025 

features 11 global impacts plus one local impact linked to six 

long- term commitments. Beyond our SSI, we also instill a global 

and local culture with a meaningful purpose around sustainability 

through trainings and performance incentives for employees and 

leadership teams.

1.2.5 Moving from opportunistic to integrated supply

The onset of unprecedented market volatility has reinforced the need for proactive strategies to source energy 
from providers in a holistic fashion according to organizational demands. 

Further, over the past decade, energy sourcing has grown increasingly complicated and nuanced. Today’s market-leading approaches 

require adaptive, integrated sourcing to help organizations respond strategically to risk, build resilience, and decarbonize their assets/

portfolios.

Market disruption and volatility are material risks for most 

businesses. The current energy crisis in Europe is a clear case. 

Unprecedented short-supply conditions have caused energy 

prices to hit historic levels, jeopardizing not only business 

profitability, but business viability as operations, budgets, and 

ancillary priorities, such as decarbonization goals, suffer. 

In a recent study conducted by Schneider Electric, only about 50% 

of the corporate respondents felt they were “considerably” or 

“extremely” effective in managing energy commodity risk due to 

volatility. 

This is surprising as companies that do proactively manage 

volatility often realize measurable benefits across numerous 

departments within their organizations. 

Rate your organization’s ability to manage energy price and 

energy supply volatility:

Integrated energy commodity risk management and sourcing at Schneider

Schneider Electric’s Sustainability Business helps our customers to meet their risk and sourcing challenges through a holistic and strategic 

approach which:

• Addresses the risks associated with energy complexity, 

including resilience and reliability, geopolitical uncertainties, 

geographic/market barriers, and resource or capital constraints.

• Leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technology combined with 

our industry-leading market expertise to approach sourcing 

solutions using a mind+machine strategy.

• Harnesses the strength of Schneider’s global risk & analytics, 

commodity management, and renewables teams to develop 

and deliver risk profiling, cost analysis, and strategic 

procurement recommendations.

• Maximizes energy flexibility in the form of connected, optimized 

distributed energy resources and other cleaner, greener 

technologies. 

• Advances budget management, cost forecasting, and risk 

preparedness through EcoStruxure™ Resource Advisor, giving 

customers greater insight and access to strategic sourcing 

recommendations.

1.3 Schneider Electric’s priorities  
for sustainable growth

Against a backdrop of market uncertainty, the Group continues to achieve sustainable growth through five 
priorities.

More Products

As customer operations are increasingly digitized, our products are becoming natively 

connected. Coupled with Schneider Electric’s EcoStruxure™ advisors, they deliver 

incremental value and support our customers in their everyday operations. Additionally, 

Schneider Electric strives to continuously increase the quality of its products and offer the 

highest levels of safety and reliability.

Better Systems

The EcoStruxure™ platform is the foundational technology backbone to build and deliver 

Schneider Electric solutions. We will enrich the EcoStruxure™ platform with more segment 

applications and expertise, offering more value. We provide a unified customer experience 

through our open ecosystem and we upskill our people in digital technologies.

We continue to expand our natively connected equipment portfolio with digital tools, 

making condition-based maintenance and connected expert service available to 

customers for more productivity, safety, efficiency, and collaboration.

More Services 

Services are an incremental growth engine for the Group, delivering peace of mind to our 

customers along their lifecycle with safety, resilience, efficiency, and sustainability. We 

continue to accelerate and support our customers, expanding our portfolio each year. We 

see this in 2022 via the additions of EcoConsult, EcoCare, and ECOFIT™ within our 

portfolio, all of which have been built to support customers in their journey to strategize, 

digitize, and decarbonize.

More Software

Schneider Electric customers are looking for integration across phases from Design and 

Build to Operate and Maintain. With our software portfolio across EcoStruxure™, AVEVA, 

OSIsoft, RIB Software, ETAP, Planon, IGE+XAO, and ALPI, and our partnerships, we can 

cover the entire lifecycle of our customers’ buildings and power assets. We also 

understand our customers’ need for a unified, simple way of managing and acting on 

complex data. That is why with our evolving hub capabilities and unique software portfolio, 

we’re putting in place the building blocks of the enterprise metaverse.

More Sustainability

The climate crisis is a significant risk to organizational continuity. In response, stakeholders 

are demanding urgent action from businesses. This pressure has driven more than 4,000 

companies globally to commit to a science-based decarbonization target.

We aspire to both achieve our own aggressive climate targets and support our 

stakeholders in their decarbonization journey through our solutions and experiences. As 

the demand for cleaner energy sources and climate action strategies has grown, so has 

Schneider Electric’s Sustainability Business, which now serves 40% of Fortune 500 

companies.

1.3 Schneider Electric’s priorities for sustainable growth

1.3.5 Sustainability Business

The past year has demonstrated the urgent need for the energy transition. This urgency has been reflected in 
the growth of corporate climate action and a surge in new legislation to increase corporate disclosures on 
climate risk. The combination is leading to a rapid uptake of sustainability among corporations, with more than 
4,000 companies globally committing to a science-based decarbonization target.

Transitioning energy sources remains the fastest path towards decarbonization since energy drives approximately two-thirds of global 

emissions today. As the demand for cleaner energy sources and climate action strategies have grown, so has Schneider Electric’s 

Sustainability Business, which now serves 40% of Fortune 500 companies through a unique combination of strategic consulting and 

implementation services, paired with best-in-class digital solutions.

Our differentiated value proposition is to support our customers on climate, from strategy setting to execution.

Strategize: Define climate strategy to meet client ambitions. 

Decarbonization starts by quantifying environmental baselines and 

definining organizational ambitions. Our consultants help 

companies measure their emissions, set decarbonization targets, 

create a roadmap for action, structure their program and 

governance, and communicate on commitments.

Digitize: Create a single-source-of-truth for energy, emissions, and 

resource data management. AI-powered EcoStruxure™ Resource 

Advisor and award-winning PPA marketplace solutions NEO 

Network™ and Zeigo™ provide clients with the data they need to 

identify savings opportunities, make strategic decisions and take 

action on decarbonization.

Decarbonize: Execute decarbonization strategy using four key 

levers: electrification of operations, reduction of energy use, 

replacement of energy source, and engagement of the whole value 

chain. Ultimately, decarbonization requires action. Schneider 

Electric’s robust portfolio of end-to-end net-zero solutions supports 

clients in their pursuit of their energy and emission ambitions. Our 

global team of experts help customers deploy solutions to 

systematically achieve their decarbonization aspirations.Decarbonize

Digitize Strategize

Collaborating for climate action

Scope 3 emissions

CDP estimates that an average of 11.4 times as many emissions 

can be found in the value chain than in corporate operations. 

This extensive category, classified as Scope 3 emissions by the 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, is also the most difficult to 

decarbonize.

Recently, the Sustainability Business has partnered with clients 

including Walmart, PepsiCo, a group of 15 pharmaceutical 

companies (known as the Energize program), and Schneider’s 

own Zero Carbon Project to reduce Scope 3 emissions, 

specifically within the supply chain.

Walmart Gigaton PPA program

In 2022, the first cohort under the Walmart Gigaton PPA program 

was announced. Consisting of five Walmart suppliers working 

together to go to market as an aggregated buyer’s consortium, 

the cohort worked with consultants from Schneider Electric to 

procure a 12-year wind Power Purchase Agreement from 

Orsted’s Sunflower Wind Farm, expected to generate 

approximately 250,000 megawatt-hours annually of new 

renewable power. The aggregated consortium model allowed 

the cohort participants to gain market access they could not 

achieve alone.

Energize program

At COP27, Schneider Electric announced that the first European 

and U.S. cohorts under the Energize program have also been 

formed and will go to market together. The cohort consists of 

nine companies, representing a potential aggregate of two 

terawatt-hours of electricity demand.

1.3.6 Global supply chain

A vast global network covering the end-to-end value chain

Towards an even more resilient and regional footprint

Moving from 80% to 90% regional sales

Supply chain is well balanced across our regions:

Industrial costs GSC headcount

 Europe    North America    International    China

Each are responsible for their product specifications, research and 

development, supply chain, and suppliers. Our supply chain works 

hand in hand with the regional sales and marketing organization, 

and the multi-hub approach allows us to adapt to the requirements 

of the market at pace, work very closely with all the stakeholders in 

the market, and be as sustainable as possible.

60% to 70% of the products that we are selling in India today have 

been designed in India, with 90% of what is sold there having been 

produced there.

“Companies that want to do well must also 
do good – and vice versa.”

An introduction by Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, Gwenaelle Avice-Huet

I stepped into my new role as Schneider Electric’s Chief Strategy 

and Sustainability Officer in the midst of what was one of the most 

tumultuous years in recent history.

On the environmental front, we saw extreme heatwaves, 

devastating droughts and floods, and reports of record-breaking 

biodiversity loss. On the economic and political fronts, we saw war 

and intensifying geopolitical tensions, lingering supply chain 

issues, soaring inflation, rising interest rates, debt distress and 

widespread energy and food insecurity, plunging many countries 

around the world into recession. 

As the latest United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 

Report remarked, “these cascading and interlinked crises are 

putting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in grave 

danger”.

In this context, combining corporate strategy, quality and 

sustainability into one joint role, as we have done at Schneider 

Electric, makes more sense than ever. My combined remit aims to 

ensure that sustainability drives all corporate decision-making and 

generates maximum impact for both the company and our 

stakeholders, starting with quality which is good for customers and 

also for the environment. 

So, in 2022, despite rising costs and increased political and 

economic uncertainty, we remained focused on accelerating the 

transition to a cleaner and fairer world with our long-standing 

strategy of providing digitalization, electrification, efficiency and 

sustainability solutions that tackle today’s energy, climate and cost 

of living crises hand-in-hand.

Engaging in the pursuit of long-term positive impact 

Addressing these global challenges requires commitment and 

determination. At Schneider, we firmly believe that companies that 

want to do well must also do good – and vice versa. 

Our success reflects the significant investments and efforts we’ve 

made into sustainability and innovation over the past years. These 

have helped prepare us for a new energy future while also 

reinforcing our resilience to upheaval and disruption. As an Impact 

Company, we are committed to bringing everyone along, 

employees, customers and suppliers, and working more closely 

than ever with policy makers and local communities to make a 

difference.

Sustainability achievements to be proud of

In terms of climate commitments, we raised the bar by validating 

our decarbonization roadmap according to new Corporate 

Net-Zero Standards from the Science Based Targets initiative. We 

were one of the world’s first companies to do so.

And prominent, independent ESG rating providers recognized our 

leadership, with best-in-sector rankings from S&P Global, CDP, 

Moody’s ESG Solutions, and Corporate Knights’ Global 100.

We also made good progress on the zero-carbon journey that we 

began with our top 1,000 suppliers in 2021. So far, we’ve helped 

them reduce their operational CO
2
 emissions by close to 10% and 

we’re ready to accelerate this momentum towards our 50% 

reduction target for 2025.

The Schneider Electric Foundation also played a vital role in 

sustaining our commitments to communities in need and to leaving 

no one behind. When the war broke out in Ukraine, our employees 

from around the world raised funds to help local colleagues and 

their families, while our Foundation worked to support refugees 

displaced by the conflict.

We continue to address the complex, systemic inequalities 

associated with energy poverty. Our technologies improve the lives 

and livelihoods of communities with little or no access to energy 

and our training initiatives are creating the skilled workforce 

required to support the growing energy needs of developing 

countries and close the energy access gap by 2030.

I’m proud of what we achieved in 2022, but since attending the 

COP27 summit, I realize that much more remains to be done. I look 

forward to advancing on this at speed and scale by working 

together, building on our achievements, and delivering lasting and 

positive impact for the future.

Gwenaelle Avice-Huet, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer

2.1.1 Our strategic vision 
towards long-term positive 
impacts 

The world is changing

The world is facing multiple challenges that require a significant 

and rapid response from business. The climate crisis is causing 

flooding and droughts that have already resulted in billions of 

dollars in damage and mass population migrations. It is 

jeopardizing access to basic needs and services such as health, 

food, water and energy for billions of people – generating further 

social inequalities. The biodiversity crisis, driven by changes in the 

usage of land and sea, direct exploitation of natural resources, 

pollution, climate change and invasive species will further 

destabilize our economies as the ecological services nature 

provides to an ever-growing population are degraded. Meanwhile, 

the digital revolution is completely changing the way people 

interact with one another, how we interact with machines, and the 

way machines interact with each other.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the geopolitical crisis in 

Ukraine have also set in motion a series of global events which 

have led to significant disruptions, many of which have impacts 

across the world. These include constrained labor availability, 

global shortages of raw materials and electronics, unreliable 

transportation, and reductions in energy availability. Supply chains 

across industries have been challenged by these outcomes.

New expectations and practices have emerged to help the world 

adapt to, or mitigate the impacts of this disruption: 

• Local dynamics in response to ecological and social 

considerations as well as supply chain disruptions

• The mobilization of new generations, demanding a radical shift 

towards a more sustainable economy

• The flourishing of new environmental, social and governance 

regulations for both financial and non-financial undertakings

• New ways of working, which are more flexible and more digital

• Circular business models to preserve the planet’s resources

Articulating our strategy around an Impact 
Company model

While everybody — governments, NGOs, investors, and individual 

citizens — has an important role, companies can be crucial 

players. 

They can be both developers and users of new solutions. They 

have the resources, talent, technology, and geographic footprint to 

make real and fast change and use it to drive sustainable financial 

performance.

The foundation of Schneider’s sustainability strategy and Impact 

Company model is the belief that investing in the transition to a 

more sustainable future - in energy sobriety, gender equity or low 

carbon solutions – is about future-proofing the company. It drives 

the company’s competitiveness, innovation and resilience. It 

secures sustainable growth because any company’s health is 

deeply interconnected with the health of the environmental and 

social systems it evolves in. It encompasses continuous 

improvement of environmental, social, and ethical dimensions 

across an organization’s entire value chain and stakeholders. This 

holistic approach allows the Group to greatly mitigate risks and also 

brings tangible added value by being more attractive to 

stakeholders, while boosting innovation.

The transformation of Schneider Electric reflects this. The adoption 

of an Impact Company model has seen the company triple in size, 

growing from €9 billion in 2003 to €34 billion in revenues in 2022. 

Schneider Electric products, software solutions and services help 

households, companies, buildings, data centers, infrastructure 

projects and entire industries make the most of their energy and 

resources and bolster their energy resilience. With its solutions, the 

Group plays a major role in accelerating the energy transition and 

fighting the climate crisis, while making a long-term positive impact 

on the planet and society.

Our purpose is to empower all to make the 
most of our energy and resources, bridging 
progress and sustainability for all. 

This positive contribution is measured as Impact revenues, which 

represent close to 72% of the Group’s total revenues in 2022. In 

addition, in order to further contribute to a new electric and digital 

world, 100% of Schneider Electric’s innovation projects are aligned 

with its purpose, more than 90% being either strictly green or 

neutral. On this journey for a better planet, the Group is convinced 

that no one should be left behind, and businesses should operate a 

just transition.

Climate change, biodiversity loss and rising inequalities, are all 

issues that have long-term consequences and cannot be 

addressed with a short-term mindset alone: solving these issues 

requires a combination of a long-term vision and concrete 

short-term action presented below.

2.1.2 Our 6 long-term 
commitments and tools to 
measure progress
In response to the societal, economic and ecological worldwide 

transformations, expectations from its stakeholders and aligned 

with its Purpose and the United Nations Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs), Schneider Electric has made six long-term 

commitments. By tracking its sustainability performance and 

publishing quarterly results, Schneider Electric upholds its 

commitments to the SDGs and industry leadership in corporate 

social responsibility.

Our tools to measure progress

The execution of the Group’s 2021 – 2025 sustainability strategy is 

tracked through quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs), 

under two complementary tools: the SSI and the Schneider 

Sustainability Essentials (SSE). Collectively, the SSI 11 Global 

Impacts and its Local Impact, as well as the 25 SSE programs, are 

the Group’s short-term sustainability roadmap and our contribution 

to the 17 United Nations SDGs. 

The SSI is the translation of our six long-term commitments into a 

selection of 11 highly transformative and innovative programs. The 

programs are tracked and published quarterly, audited annually, 

and linked to short-term incentive plans for more than 64,000 

employees. 

The SSE reflects continuous improvement actions taken by the 

Group, complementing the SSI. This tool brings balance between 

the innovative transformation plans of the SSI and the need to keep 

making progress with other long-lasting programs. 

A notable addition to the 2021-2025 program is the local aspect, 

aiming to deploy local actions in the 100+ markets where the Group 

operates in order to better empower all leaders and collaborators to 

unlock meaningful local impacts.

2.1 Sustainability for all

2.1.2.1 The Schneider Sustainability Impact: 
a unique transformation tool

Since 2005, Schneider Electric has measured its sustainability 

performance each quarter in a dashboard known as “Schneider 

Sustainability Impact” (or SSI). Schneider uses this tool to address 

its sustainability challenges and to improve each of the pillars of its 

strategy identified through its materiality matrix. Each SSI mobilizes 

the whole company around holistic sustainability goals impacting 

its ecosystem, shares the Group’s improvement plans with 

stakeholders, and create system value.

A single ESG performance score

The SSI provides an overall measure of the Group’s progress on its 

sustainability goals on a scoring scale of 10. This is achieved by 

converting each KPI’s performance on a 10-point scale, 

considering that base year performance receives a 3/10 score and 

the 2025 target translates to a 10/10 score. For each KPI, the 

relevant score is obtained by linear interpolation and rounded down 

to the second decimal. The overall score of the tool is the average 

of each KPI’s score with equal weight excluding the local 

commitment (SSI #+1). As an exception, in 2022, SSI #6 is excluded 

from the score calculation, as 2022 constitutes the first 

measurement and baseline of the program. In 2022, the SSI 

achieved a great score of 4.91/10 (vs 3.92/10 in 2021), exceeding 

its 4.70/10 target for the year, and is well on track to achieve its 

2025 ambition. The 2023 objective is keep accelerating and reach 

6.00/10.

Transparent quarterly progress disclosure 

The results of the SSI are published every quarter together with 

financial results and made available to all stakeholders via the 

Group’s website. On these occasions, results are collated and 

presented to the Function Committee, which makes decisions on 

any corrective actions that may be necessary to reach objectives. 

The Human Resources & CSR Committee within the Board of 

Directors conducts an annual review of the Group’s Sustainability 

strategy, analyzing, in particular, the performance of the SSI. The 

results are also publicly presented to shareholders by Schneider 

Electric’s Chairman & CEO or CFO, demonstrating the Group’s 

commitment to making sustainability part of the Company’s 

long-term strategy. 

In addition, the results of the SSI are released in various external 

reports (such as the Universal Registration Document including the 

statutory auditors’ report), and are shared during customers and 

investors events. Internally the results are published on the intranet, 

and in various communications to employees (including a quarterly 

internal video featuring the CEO and the CFO on the quarter’s 

results).

  Find all quarterly releases on the Financial Result page  

on www.se.com

Annual publication and external assurance

The annual publication of the SSI results follows thorough internal 

data controls performed by each relevant team and supervised by 

the Sustainability team, as well as a complete “limited” external 

assurance from an independent third-party verifier for all of the SSI 

and SSE indicators (except SSI #+1 and SSE #12), in accordance 

with ISAE 3000 assurance standard. Progressively, Schneider 

Electric aims to obtain a reasonable assurance level on the SSI. In 

2022, the SSI #8 obtained a reasonable assurance level, as well as 

other energy, CO
2
 and safety KPIs.

  See Independent verifier’s  

report on page 270.

Rewarding employees for performance

Since 2011, the SSI score is included in the variable compensation 

of global functions and Company leaders. In France, since 2012, 

the SSI has also been included in the profit-sharing incentive plan 

for the French entities, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider 

Electric France. From 2019, the weight of the SSI criteria has 

increased from 6% to 20% in the collective part of the annual 

short-term incentive, further highlighting the importance of 

sustainability on Schneider Electric’s business agenda. In 2022, the 

SSI performance impacted the short-term incentive plans for 

64,000 employees (20% of collective share), including the 

Executive Committee members and the CEO.

  Read further details in the 2.5.4. “Compensation and 

benefits” section on page 218.

SSI and Sustainable Finance

In November 2020, Schneider Electric announced its first 

sustainability linked convertible bond, due 2026, for a nominal 

amount of approximately €650 million. This bond issuance is linked 

with three programs of the SSI 2021-25 (SSI #2, SSI #8 and SSI 

#11) a .In 2022, Schneider Electric signed €2.7 billion Syndicated 

Sustainable-linked Revolving Credit Facilities with a margin indexed 

on the annual performance of the SSI.

  More information about debt and bonds on the Debt page 

on www.se.com

SSI creation process

The SSI is a cyclical process taking place every 3 to 5 years. In 

2020, a specific SSI Steering Committee was created, comprising 

around 50 members representing each Executive Committee 

member, each geography, function and business unit. Three 

all-hands workshops took place, and the sustainability team 

organized individual follow up interviews with each member to 

define precise and measurable programs. 

The breadth of stakeholders involved in the design of the SSI, and 

the variety of analyses leveraged, makes it a powerful tool to move 

the Group forward on its major challenges.

Three scenarios may emerge from one SSI to the next:

• Programs are maintained and their targets are renewed or 

increased 

• New and more innovative or better-adapted indicators are 

implemented;

• Programs are removed; if for instance they have reached a 

threshold. Any former program may continue to be monitored 

internally if relevant.

The Sustainability department presents a draft version of the new 

SSI to the Human Resources & CSR Committee, which reports on 

its work to the Board of Directors, and to the Group Sustainability 

Committee (now “Function Committee”) for validation. This latter 

Committee includes six members of the Executive Committee: the 

Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer; Chief Human Resources 

Officer; Chief Global Supply Chain Officer; Chief Marketing Officer; 

Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General; and Chief Financial 

Officer. The new SSI is then approved by the CEO.

During the deployment of the SSI, annual reviews take place 

organized by the sustainability team together with internal experts 

and new or complementary programs may be launched or be 

evaluated in more depth. 

Notable SSI achievements and challenges in 2022

SSI #2 delivered +93MTCO
2
e saved and avoided for customers, a 

net improvement compared to 2021 (+84MTCO
2
e), driven by good 

progress in Power Purchase Agreements services and Variable 

Speed Drives sales. 

The Zero Carbon Project (SSI #3) recorded a 10% progress (vs 1% 

in 2021) thanks to the CO
2
 emissions efficiencies achieved by close 

to 1,000 onboarded suppliers.

45% of the Group’s primary and secondary packaging is now free 

from single-use plastic, and uses only recycled cardboard, 

compared to 21% in 2021. This rapid progress was possible thanks 

to the mobilisation of all teams worldwide, and particularly in 

Pacific, India, North America and Europe.

Close to 28% of Group leaders are now women, a 4 points increase 

since 2020, but women hiring remains at 41% and will be a focus 

for 2023.

Lastly, SSI #9 delivered access to green electricity to 5.5 million 

people in 2022 alone, thanks notably to the solarization of Health 

Centers in Greater India and the delivery to Investment Funds. It is 

30.7% more than in 2021 where 4.2 million people benefited from 

these offers.

SSI #6 was launched for the first year, with 59% of suppliers 

committing to join the program and 1.5% already meeting the 

Decent Work expectations set by Schneider Electric. This KPI is 

excluded from the calculation in 2022 as this year constitutes the 

baseline for this program.

One of the most challenging 2025 objectives will be to train 1 million 

people in energy management (SSI #11). Excellent progress was 

delivered in 2022 with close to 70,000 new people trained (vs more 

than 46,000 in 2021) but due to the delay caused by the pandemic, 

an acceleration will be needed in the coming years to reach the 

target. To achieve it, the Group will open trainings to more OECD 

countries and support new types of programs for the youth.

2.1.2.2 Schneider Sustainability Essentials 

The SSE reflects continuous improvement actions taken by the 

Group, complementing the SSI. This new tool brings balance 

between the innovative transformation plans of the SSI and the 

need to keep making progress with other long-lasting programs.  

All SSE KPIs are externally assured each year like for the SSI.

Notable SSE achievements and challenges in 2022

Corporate vehicule fleet transformation (SSI #7) accelerated by 14 

points in 2022 thanks to a strong performance in Europe and 

growing market maturity.

Schneider committed to having 100% of its sites adopt local 

biodiversity conservation and restoration programs, and 100% of 

its sites in water-stressed areas to deploy a water conservation 

strategy and related action plan by 2025. In 2022, SSE #8 made 

good progress with 17% of sites putting biodiversity programs in 

place, as well as SSE #11 as 48% of sites have adopted and 

implemented water conservation action plans.

Schneider upgraded SSE #15 to reflect better its ambition to 

eliminate recalls through the adoption and rigorous execution of a 

quality system consisting of the highest available standards. 

In 2022, 880 new suppliers have been assesed under Schneider’s 

‘Vigilance Program’ in 2022, notably thanks to the increase of 

remote Vigilance assessments (SSE #17). 

SSE #23 was deployed in 2022 and recorded 43% of employees 

who had access to meaningful career development programs 

during later stages of their career.

Improving CO
2
 efficiency in transportation (SSE #4) is a challenge 

as it is primarily driven by the mode mix of the Group’s aggregate 

freight globally, to best serve its customers. 

Deploying a ‘Social Excellence’ program through multiple tiers of 

suppliers is one of Schneider’s 2021-25 objectives (SSE #12). This 

program is stilll in development. 

2.1.2.3 Local Sustainability Commitments

A notable addition to the 2021-2025 program is the local aspect, 

aiming to deploy local actions in the 100+ markets where the Group 

operates in order to better empower all leaders and collaborators to 

unlock meaningful local impacts. 100% of Schneider Electric’s 

Country and Zone Presidents have defined three local 

commitments that impact their communities in line with our 

sustainability transformations. Close to 200 local programs have 

been deployed in 2021.

(1) The baseline year is indicated in front of each SSI baseline performance. 

(2) Each year, Schneider Electric obtains a “limited” level of assurance on methodology and progress from an independent third party verifier for all the SSI and SSE 

indicators (except SSI #+1 and SSE #12 in 2022), in accordance with ISAE 3000 assurance standard (see Independent verifier’s report on page 270). In addition, SSI 

#8 received a “reasonable” assurance level in 2022. Please refer to page 242 for the methodological presentation of each indicator. The 2022 performance is also 

discussed in more details in each section of this report.

(3) Per Schneider Electric definition and methodology. Note that for the reporting requirements under the European Taxonomy Regulation, please refer to pages 253 to 263. 

(4) Calculation methodology for SSI #8 has been expanded in Q2 2022 to include blue collar managers in the scope of front line managers. Due to this methodological 

change, the 2020 baseline for front line managers has been recalculated to 23% instead of 25%.

2.1 Sustainability for all

2.1.3 Contribution to the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals
The 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) are focused on protecting the planet, alleviating poverty, and achieving 

worldwide peace and justice. The Schneider Sustainability Impact and Essentials programs contribute to those global goals, either directly 

or indirectly and for all stakeholders in the company’s value chain. Schneider Electric is an active promoter of the SDGs and a member of 

the UN Global Compact, notably with its CEO being a member of the global Board. The Group discloses each year its Communication on 

Progress and was one of the 850 participants in the UNGC Early Adopters program in 2022. The mapping of Schneider’s contribution by 

SDG and stakeholder presented hereafter has been realized internally by reviewing in detail all 169 targets and leveraging the SDG 

Compass tools.

  Consult Schneider Electric’s commitments to SDGs on the 

sustainability page on www.se.com

 

Schneider Electric operates with the conviction that 

human wellbeing comes first. Living a fulfilling life 

with decent living wage and opportunities for 

development enables employees within the company 

and communities present around, to thrive.

2.1.4 Open dialogue with stakeholders
Schneider Electric engages in open and continuous dialogue with each of its stakeholders. In particular, the Sustainability department takes 

into account the comments, ratings, and evaluations from stakeholders on the Group’s Sustainability strategy and programs. This feedback 

is integrated into the drawing up of the registration document, and new improvement plans, as well as during the design of the SSI which 

takes place every three to five years.

Stakeholder How we create value Key achievements

2.1.5 Analysis of material risks, opportunities and 
impacts

Assessment principles

Each year, Schneider Electric performs risks, opportunities and 

impact assessments, considering issues that can have direct 

positive or negative financial impacts for the company in the 

short-term (3 - 5 years), medium-term (5 - 10 years) or long-term (10 

- 30 years), as well as impacts the company may have on people or 

the planet, directly or indirectly in its value chain. 

The assessments rely on a panel of both internal and external tools, 

take into account stakeholders’ expectations and are coordinated 

by different teams. In particular, the Strategy and Sustainability 

team, the Group Risk Management function and the Duty of 

Vigilance Committee play a key role. Other topic-specific 

committees exist that oversee the Group’s strategy on those issues, 

such as the Carbon Committee, Human Resources Committee, or 

the Ethics Committee.

Key internal tools include:

• An internal and external stakeholder consultation (materiality 

assessment), focused on analyzing key stakeholders 

expectations, is performed prior to each Schneider 

Sustainability Impact program launch every three to five years 

(last exercise done in 2020). This assessment is described in 

the next pages of this chapter;

• The Group risk matrix, led by the Group Risk Management 

function is updated every year and focuses on identifying the 

risks considered by the Group as specific to its business and 

identified as having the potential to affect its activity, its image, 

its financial situation, its results, or the achievement of its 

objectives. For more details about the Enterprise Risk 

Management (ERM) please consult chapter 3, pages 244 to 319;

• The Vigilance risks matrix, which is presented and described in 

chapter 2.2.10 “Vigilance Plan” page 133, focuses on the 

potential adverse impacts the Group may have on people or the 

planet, directly or indirectly in its value chain through its 

business relationships. A dedicated Vigilance report is available 

online. 

• Other specific risk mappings, for instance dedicated to Ethics & 

Compliance risks (including Anti-Corruption and Conflicts of 

Interest risks), Climate, Water and Biodiversity risks, supplier 

risk, cybersecurity risk etc, are done regularly.

Internal tools are complemented with outside-in inputs:

• Regulatory frameworks: for instance, the key topics listed under 

Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Extra-

Financial Performance Declaration), the EU taxonomy or 

upcoming European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS);

• International institutions and Non-Governmental Organization 

(NGOs) and peer working groups and initiatives;

• Analysis of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating 

agencies expectations;

• Specific requests from investors and customers;

• Recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related 

Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Task Force on Nature-related 

Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and various other frameworks 

(SASB, GRI, etc.).

The analysis covers the entire value chain of the Group and its 

stakeholders: suppliers and subcontractors, transactions, 

customers, as well as Schneider Electric’s scope – extending to the 

activities at its Foundation – on cross-functional, environmental, 

social, and societal topics, human rights, and anti-corruption, with 

a double materiality approach.

The main identified risks, opportunities and impacts are quantified 

on probability of occurrence and magnitude of impact by the 

relevant departments to determine gross risks, and an assessment 

of current mitigation measures informs on potential net impacts. In 

this sustainability chapter, we present and discuss gross risks, and 

detail the mitigation actions implemented. Net risks are presented 

in Chapter 3, page 304, in accordance with “Prospectus 3” 

requirements. 

On this basis, the list of extra-financial risks is reviewed and 

validated annually by relevant Senior Vice Presidents, the Board of 

Directors’ secretariat, Internal Audit team, Group Risk Management 

function and presented to the Human Resources & CSR Committee 

and to the Group Sustainability Committee at least every 3 years, in 

coherence with the SSI calendar.

Six main risk categories were identified in 2022 and are presented 

in detail in the following pages:

• Sustainable Supply Chain

• Cybersecurity and data privacy

• Responsible and attractive workplace

• Ethical business conduct

• Product, projects, system quality and offer reliability

• Corporate governance

Creation of the SSI programs and targets 
leveraging the analysis

The Group sustainability team collates the various inputs to identify 

the strategic issues that need to be addressed. Every 3 to 5 years, 

the analysis leads to the creation of new programs under Schneider 

Sustainability Impact. 

For each target and indicator composing the SSI, the ambition is 

defined in consultation with the departments concerned, and 

leveraging the various risks, opportunities and materiality analyses 

as described above as well as best practice benchmarks. 

Zoom on the latest materiality analysis

In 2020, Schneider Electric built its third materiality matrix by 

questioning external stakeholders (such as customers, suppliers, 

international organizations, trade associations, experts and 

shareholders) and top and senior managers within the Group, 

including the Executive Committee. Nearly 200 stakeholders were 

consulted in total. The details of the analysis can be found in the 

Group’s Universal Registration Document 2021 pages 76-77.

Overall, stakeholders pointed to growing instability – whether 

environmental, social, political, or economic. This creates 

uncertainties for businesses, which should work on building 

resilience:

• Climate is the main trend identified externally and internally. It 

includes the trend for energy transition and electrification, on 

which external stakeholders expect Schneider Electric to take 

the lead. 

• Inclusion and the need for a just transition covering the 

Company’s extended responsibility to its ecosystem, in 

particular in the supply chain, to ensure the low-carbon 

transition benefits all equally. Stakeholders also mentioned the 

growing expectations in providing ethical and sustainable 

products.

• Resilience, and the move towards more local supply chains, 

specifically post-COVID-19, can be a way to mitigate 

geopolitical uncertainty and a rise in protectionism.

• Ethics in digital: the growth of digitalization and the need for 

stronger ethics represents both an opportunity and a risk for 

Schneider Electric. This covers topics such as the power of data 

and the ethical use it requires, the potential opportunities and 

dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as people’s 

well-being, or job security in a transitioning world. 

• Resource scarcity and circular economy featured very highly in 

terms of internal expectations. 

During the discussions, a number of matters were frequently 

mentioned:

1. The vision of the Group, endorsing the link between 

sustainability and digital, is complex and not always easy to 

understand for non-experts. Schneider Electric could be 

pedagogic in its advocacy.

2. There are high expectations for Schneider to become a globally 

recognized leader for a decarbonized world, with its products 

and solutions, and in terms of thought leadership.

3. All topics are deemed important, reinforcing our holistic vision of 

sustainability. Issues were prioritized based on three groups:

 − License to operate – fundamental “must have” topics such as 

product quality and safety, and cybersecurity.

 − Standard issues – topics which are on track, and on which 

Schneider Electric must remain mobilized (e.g., health and 

security, environmental excellence, corruption). 

 − Key transformational topics – those which have the potential 

to transform markets and differentiate Schneider Electric 

from others (e.g., climate change engagement, circular 

economy, human engagement).

4. The SSI is a renowned and transformative program which is a 

source of pride internally, and recognition externally, but which 

needs a new lease of life: simplified, with increased internal 

buy-in and awareness.

2.1.7 Integrated and transverse governance of 
sustainable development
At Schneider Electric, sustainability is integrated in the processes and bodies that design and execute 
the Group’s strategy at Board, executive, and operational levels.

Management oversight

The Board of Directors

In 2013, the Board of Directors extended the powers of the 
Governance & Remunerations Committee to include corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) issues. Since 2014, the Group has 
benefited from a specific Human Resources & CSR Committee. 
This Committee meets at the initiative of its Chairperson or at the 
request of the Chairman & CEO. The agenda is drawn up by the 
Chairperson. The Committee meets at least three times a year (6 
meetings in 2022). The Committee may seek advice from any 
person it feels will help it with its work. 

Main responsibilities:

• Employee shareholding schemes and share allocation plans;
• Compensation of Group managers;
• Succession plan for key Group Executives;
• Human resources;
• CSR policy and results.

  More details about the composition and activities of the 
Human Resources & CSR Committee are provided in 
Chapter 4, page 359.

The Function Committee

In 2022, the Group Sustainability Committee (created in 2010) 
became the Function Committee. The committee is composed of 
the Executive Committee members in charge of key Functions: 
Governance, Global Marketing, Human Resources, Strategy & 
Sustainability, Finance and Digital. The committee meets quarterly. 
In 2022, this committee met 4 times. The Committee may seek 
advice from any person it feels will help it with its work.

Main responsibilities:

• Decides the sustainability agenda;
• Sounding board for Functions;
• Escalation body for highly transversal programs, such as the

Schneider Sustainability Impact;
• Informs the Board Human Resources & CSR Committee.

The Stakeholder Committee 

In order to reinforce its sustainability governance further with solid 
external insights, Schneider Electric created a Stakeholder 
Committee in 2021. The Committee comprises eight external 
members who share the Group’s passion for sustainability, and its 
mission is to oversee the delivery of short-and long-term 
commitments undertaken by Schneider Electric in accordance with 
its Purpose and Sustainability strategy. The company strives to 
ensure diversity of the Stakeholder Committee members, in terms 
of origin, gender and experience. The Stakeholder Committee 
meets three times a year and is chaired by Jean-Pascal Tricoire, 
Chairman & CEO of Schneider Electric, while Gwenaelle Avice-
Huet, the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of Schneider 
Electric, acts as its secretary.

  More details about the Stakeholder Committee 
are provided on page 37.

Coordination and monitoring

The Group Sustainability department

The Sustainability department, created in 2002, is part of the 
Strategy and Sustainability department. It has the following 
responsibilities:

• Schneider Electric’s sustainability strategy and rollout of action
plans at Group level with relevant entities;

• Central point of contact for internal and external stakeholders
regarding sustainability at Schneider Electric.

It is organized around four areas:

• Access to energy, with responsibility for the Access to Energy
program;

• Environment, with responsibility for deploying Group climate
and environmental policies, actions and strategies;

• Group performance, in particular by steering the Schneider
Sustainability Impact, and external ESG reporting;

• Sustainability Transformation, in particular driving the ENGAGE
program.

Territory Sustainability Leaders

In 2021, Schneider Electric’s Country and Zone Presidents 
worldwide made 200 local commitments that impact their 
communities, in line with the Group’s six long-term commitments. 
To manage these programs and to better answer the needs of 
Schneider’s local stakeholders, a new model for sustainability 
governance in the company was created with a network of about 
40 Territory Sustainability Leaders. This new network meet every 
two months and works to further instill a culture of sustainability at 
every level of the company, to empower every employee to act, and 
to innovate with disruptive sustainability actions.

Diffusion

SSI and SSE pilots and sponsors

The execution of all Schneider Sustainability Impact and Schneider 
Sustainability Essentials programs is ensured by operational 
managers or “pilots”, and sponsors at SVP-level as well as 
Executive Committee level to ensure proper oversight and efficient 
program implementation.

Other key organizations

Several further Committees and organizations drive progress on all 
pillars of the sustainability strategy, including:

• Global Supply Chain organization, with responsibilities including
safety and the environment;

• Human Resources organization;
• The Ethics & Compliance organization;
• The Corporate Citizenship department and the Schneider

Electric Foundation.

Engage Employees in Sustainability

To support all employees to better understand and act for a more sustainable world, the Group launched a new internal initiative in 2022 

called ENGAGE. This program has the ambition to make every employee an advocate for sustainability, thereby accelerating the Group’s 

transformation and contribution to the UN SDGs. 

The Sustainability School was launched in 2022. Each employee can choose learning paths and find tips to know how to act both in a 

personal and professional way. The training modules cover a large range of topics from the understanding of environmental and social 

challenges of our decade, to the detailed explanation of Schneider’s Sustainability Strategy.

The ENGAGE program builds on other initiatives already underway: 

• the Sustainability Essentials training deployed for all employees,

• the “Act For Green” initiative, which aims at supporting all employees to pursue local environmental actions,

• the UN World Environment Day on June 5th has been celebrated on all sites since 2014. Communities of ambassadors facilitate 

e-learning and workshops (such as Climate Fresk),

• The Schneider Electric VolunteerIn initiative, as part of the Schneider Electric Foundation, enables Schneider employees to participate in 

volunteering missions since 2012.

Internal governance model
Internal policies are the backbone of an organization’s compliance 

and security program. They ensure employees understand how to 

implement critical tasks and meet behavior expectations. 

Regulators have made clear the need for effective policy 

development and management programs. 

It is no longer enough to merely document the existence of policies 

and procedures. Organizations must be able to demonstrate that 

employees know, understand and apply them. To that end, 

Schneider Electric has established a four tier form of 

documentation pyramid of norms, under the umbrella of its Code of 

Conduct called the Trust Charter, strengthened by policies, 

standards, procedures and guidelines. 

Policies consist of formal statements produced and supported by 

the leadership team, that state where the organization stands on 

important issues. Schneider has around 85 global policies. The 

Schneider Electric Global Policy Management Policy provides the 

rules to be followed for global policies. 

Standards defined in these internal policies assign quantifiable 

measures and define acceptable levels of quality. Procedures 

establish the proper steps to take to operationalize a policy and/or 

standard. Finally, guidelines provide additional guidance with a set 

of recommendations to clarify expectations of a given procedure.

Trust Charter 

In 2021, Schneider Electric evolved its Principles of Responsibility  

to the Trust Charter, acting as its Code of Conduct and 

demonstrating its commitment to ethics, safety, sustainability, 

quality, and cybersecurity. It is an executive summary of our policies 

and a guide on how we work. It is available publicly on our website 

in 30 languages. Further details are provided on page 110.

  Discover Schneider’s Trust Charter  

on www.se.com

Human rights & corporate citizenship

Schneider Electric wrote a specific Human Rights Policy as part of 

a broader program on duty of vigilance in its value chain and in line 

with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 

Rights (see page 124). The policy was updated in 2022.

Human resources and safety

The Group’s Human Resources policies cover the following topics: 

diversity, equity and inclusion, health & well-being, safety, security 

and travel, employee engagement, family leave, anti-harassment, 

recruiting, international mobility, training, human capital 

development, talent identification, total remuneration, social 

benefits, and COVID-19. These apply to the Group and are 

accompanied by global processes.

Ethical business conduct

In addition to the Trust Charter, the Business Agents Policy 

specifies the rules to be followed when an external stakeholder is 

solicited to secure a deal and integrates the approval process of 

business agents. The Internal Fraud Investigation directive 

indicates the commitment to whistleblower protection. The Gifts & 

Hospitality Policy was approved by the Group’s CEO in December 

2015 and updated in 2021 before local deployment. It is 

supplemented by an anti-corruption Code of Conduct detailing 

related processes. Other policies cover social media management, 

competition law, conflict of interest, export control, etc. 

Cybersecurity, data privacy and protection

Schneider Electric developed a number of policies to reinforce its 

cybersecurity and respect personal data and privacy, such as IT 

asset management and usage, acceptable use of assets, general 

information security, data classification, global data privacy, user 

access management policy, email security policy, and many others.

Climate and resources

Schneider Electric’s environmental policy aims to improve industrial 

processes, reinforce product EcoDesign and incorporate Group 

customers’ concerns about environmental protection by providing 

them with product and service solutions. It is bolstered by the 

Energy and Environment policies. These policies apply to the 

Group and are accompanied by global action plans. 

Responsible sourcing

In 2016, Schneider Electric renewed the charter for its suppliers, 

called the Supplier Guide Book. It sets the Group’s sustainability 

expectations in five areas: environment, fair and ethical business 

practices, sustainable purchasing, working conditions, and human 

rights. These requirements are detailed in a dedicated document 

called the Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2018, the Group adopted 

the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct for 

suppliers. In 2021, Schneider renewed its Supplier Code of 

Conduct whereby it requires all its suppliers to review their own 

operations, set ambitious targets, and initiate bold actions in the 

areas mentioned in this Supplier Code of Conduct.

Strive for high quality

Schneider’s priority is to satisfy its customers with outstanding 

end-to-end experience. Quality is every customer’s right and every 

employee’s responsibility. Experience is the most important for 

customers, defining the business relationships they sustain with 

suppliers and partners. The Group’s customers place trust in its 

resilient, highly-personalized, multi-channel experience, and the 

superior quality of its products. Hence, the company acts with 

agility, discipline, and good business sense throughout the offer life 

cycle; from creation to supply, manufacturing, delivery, when in 

operation and when being serviced. The Group has deployed a 

specific Quality Directive “Managing Customer Safety Risks” and a 

Quality Procedure “Offer Safety Review” to protect its customers. 

These are supported by the Quality Management System, which is 

improved continuously. It is in full alignment with the Trust Charter 

and the ISO 9001 standard.

Schneider Electric contribution to 
standardization

With many experts actively participating in international and 

national standardization bodies, Schneider Electric is making a 

decisive contribution to the creation and distribution of standards 

that ensure the safety and reliability of electric facilities and 

equipment. These standards address environmental impacts 

throughout life cycles to prepare for a better circular economy, 

support the new energy landscape with the goal of greener energy 

integration, ensure safer energy delivery and better integration of 

prosumers, support the digital transformation of the industry and 

any other customer values.

At National level

Our experts are involved in National Committees in US, China, India 

and European countries. The French Electrotechnical Institute is a 

founding member of CENELEC – European standardization body 

and IEC – International standardization body.

Schneider Electric chairs many French standardization committees 

hosted by AFNOR (French standards organization) and sits on 

other national committees, such as the chair of the French and 

Swedish Committees for environmental standardization. Schneider 

was a major contributor to smart manufacturing initiatives such as 

the AIF (Alliance Industrie du Futur) in France. Notably, it is a 

member of the Council Board and of the IEC Conformity 

Assessment Board.

At European level

CENELEC (European Committee for Electrotechnical 

Standardization), CEN (European Standardization Committee), and 

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) are the 

three official European standardization bodies. They have been 

officially recognized by the European Union and by the European 

Free Trade Association (EFTA) as being responsible for developing 

and defining voluntary standards.

CENELEC

CENELEC is an association that brings together the National 

Electrotechnical Committees of 34 European countries. CENELEC 

prepares voluntary standards in the electrotechnical field, which 

help facilitate trade between countries, create new markets, cut 

compliance costs and support the development of a Single 

European Market. CENELEC supports standardization activities in 

relation to a wide range of fields and sectors including: 

electromagnetic compatibility, accumulators, primary cells and 

primary batteries, insulated wire and cable, electrical equipment 

and apparatus, electronic, electromechanical and electrotechnical 

supplies, electric motors and transformers, lighting equipment and 

electric lamps, low voltage electrical installations material, electric 

vehicles railways, smart grid, smart metering, solar (photovoltaic) 

electricity systems, etc.

Most Schneider Electric activities and offers are covered by 

CENELEC, although CEN and ETSI also benefit. In addition, 

Schneider Electric experts are participating in the development of 

common works and standards in specific joint technical 

committees and joint working groups. 

At international level

IEC – International Electrotechnical Commission

The IEC is a global, not-for-profit membership organization that 

brings together more than 170 countries and coordinates the work 

of 20,000 experts globally. The IEC publishes around 10,000 IEC 

International Standards which together with conformity 

assessments provide the technical framework that allows 

governments to build national quality infrastructure and companies 

of all sizes to buy and sell consistently safe and reliable products in 

most countries of the world. IEC International Standards serve as 

the basis for risk and quality management and are used in testing 

and certification to verify that manufacturer promises are kept.

Our experts contribute through joint technical committees and joint 

working groups to ISO and ITU.

Smart grids and sustainable cities

Schneider Electric participates actively in the standardization of 

smart grids, for which it leads the definition of standards and the 

standardization roadmap within the European smart grids 

coordination group, as well as the group in charge of standardizing 

the interfaces between smart buildings and smart grids.

• Schneider co-chairs the Smart Energy Grid coordination group 

of the CEN-CENELEC-ETSI responsible for ensuring availability 

of an appropriate set of standards for the rollout of smart grids in 

Europe, as well as supporting the coming new legislative “Clean 

Energy Package”.

• It chairs the group at the IEC level in charge of defining the 

roadmap of international standards to support the rollout of the 

Smart Energy sector (smart grids, in addition to interfaces with 

other energies). This roadmap also includes cybersecurity and 

resilience, as well as the impact of the IoT. 

• It chairs and actively contributes to the definition of prosumer’s 

electrical installations, installations integrating local production 

such as PV, wind and storage to ensure they are designed and 

erected with a high level of safety and efficiency.

published standards assessing factors such as durability, 

reparability, reusability, recyclability, and ability to be 

remanufactured, which fall within the scope of the EcoDesign 

directive and the new Ecodesign for Sustainable Product 

Regulation. Schneider continues to contribute to the evolution of 

those standards and their extended scope and has appointed 

active experts in each of the existing and new working groups. For 

example, our experts are highly involved in the development of the 

future standard on circular design: material efficiency within 

environmentally conscious design.

As digitalization is a lever for circular economy and environmental 

performance, our experts are contributing to standards on 

terminology and digital formats.

Standardization to accelerate 
environmental transformation

Since February 2007, Schneider has represented France on the 

IEC’s Advisory Committee for Environmental Aspects (ACEA). 

ACEA works to advise and coordinate the IEC’s efforts to tackle 

environmental issues.

2.1.9 Measuring our contribution to a more sustainable 
world
Schneider Electric has been an early adopter of transparent 

disclosures on sustainable revenues, and created its own 

methodology of “Impact revenues”(1) in 2019, consolidating 

revenues from offers that bring environmental efficiency to its 

customers, while not generating any significant harmful impact to 

the environment, and excluding revenues from carbon intensive 

segments. Recently, the European Union (EU) has shown 

international leadership by being the first to develop a Regulation 

and Taxonomy aiming at driving investments towards 

environmentally sustainable activities, which the Group applauds. 

Both methodologies are somewhat aligned but currently differ in 

the scope of activities included, and in end-segments exclusions.

A purpose-led, Impact Company

Schneider Electric’s purpose is to empower all to make the most of 

our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for 

all. Schneider‘s aim is to be our customers’ digital partner of choice 

to help them realise their sustainability and efficiency ambitions.

The Group proposes an integrated offering of technologies and 

market-leading solutions tailored to customer needs, promoting the 

transition towards more electric, digital, decarbonized, and 

decentralized energy. Those active energy efficiency solutions - 

which consist of optimizing the entire energy cycle using energy 

control products, systems, services, and software – help mitigate, 

adapt, and improve humanity’s resilience to climate change. 

Schneider Electric quantifies this climate impact as part of its 

Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) program and is committed to 

help its customers save and avoid 800 million tonnes of CO
2
 by 

2025 (cumulatively since 2018). As of end 2022, the Group 

delivered 440 million tonnes of CO
2
e of this commitment. The 

methodology and results of this indicator are audited every year as 

part of the extra-financial audit.

Early-adopter of transparent disclosures on 
sustainable revenues

For more than fifteen years, Schneider Electric has led by example 

and transparently presented its sustainability performance to its 

stakeholders, across all environmental, social and governance 

topics and tried to develop new market practices, such as its saved 

and avoided CO
2
 methodology or biodiversity footprint 

assessment.

In 2019, the Group was one of the first companies to proactively 

disclose information on the share of its revenue coming from offers 

that bring energy, climate, or resource efficiency to its customers, 

while not generating any significant harmful impact to the 

environment. Originally called “Green Revenues” to match market 

standards, such sales were renamed “Schneider Impact 

revenues”(1) to avoid any confusion with the new European 

Taxonomy coming into force. In 2021, the Group took a step further 

by committing that Schneider Impact revenues reach 80% of Group 

sales by 2025 as part of its SSI. It is worth noting that each year the 

performance of the SSI impacts short-term incentive plans for 

64,000 employees.

Climate

SSI #1

Grow our Schneider Impact 
revenues to 80%

Schneider Electric supported Live Nation’s Cardiff Arena in 

improving operational efficiency and the situation of 

unplanned outages with MasterPact MTZ™ solution.

MasterPact MTZ™ is a circuit breaker that trips and cuts off 

electricity supply to protect electrical circuits if there are 

overloads due to electricity overconsumption, short-circuits 

due to faults in electrical outlets or earth leakage where 

electricity flows to earth via unintended paths. It also makes 

maintenance easier by sending alerts to a smartphone app, 

which diagnoses problems quickly and avoids downtime. 

In doing so, MasterPact MTZ™ provides energy 

management to identify potential savings due to overloads, 

unbalanced loads, helping users reduce energy and 

maintenance costs.

Live Nation is now able to monitor the health and 

consumption of electrical equipment, receive proactive 

maintenance recommendations so they can make better 

data-backed OpEx decisions in their business.

2019 Baseline 2022 Progress 2025 target

80%70% 72%

Schneider Impact revenues can be split into four categories:

1. Energy efficiency architectures bringing energy and/or resource 

efficiency to customers.

2. Grid reinforcement and smart grid architectures contributing to 

electrification and decarbonization.

3. Products with differentiating green performance, flagged thanks 

to our Green Premium™ program.

4. Services that bring benefits for circularity (prolonged asset 

lifetime and uptime, optimized maintenance operations, repair, 

and refurbish) and energy efficiency (maintenance to ensure the 

operational performance of equipment and avoid a decrease of 

energy efficiency over time).

others are systematically excluded, such as oil & gas, coal mining, 

and fossil-power generation, in line with prevailing corporate 

responsibility reporting and sustainable finance practices, even 

though Schneider Electric’s technologies deliver resource and 

carbon efficiency in such sectors as well. In line with Schneider 

Electric’s strategy to phase out SF

-

containing switchgear for medium voltage applications are also 

excluded. Neutral technologies such as signaling, racks and 

enclosures, access control, or emergency lighting are excluded.

Based on internal assessment, which covers all revenues of 

Schneider as published in the financial statements, the total share 

of Schneider Impact revenues is 72% in 2022 versus 70% in 2019.

In addition, to further contribute to a new electric and digital world, 

100% of Schneider Electric’s innovation projects are aligned with its 

purpose, more than 90% qualifying as impact innovation under 

Schneider’s definition, or neutral. This concerns every innovation 

contributing to a decarbonized world, for instance energy and 

process efficiency, resource optimization, SF

-free projects, or 

Green Premium™ offers. The methodology to calculate this figure is 

similar to the Schneider Impact Revenue methodology and should 

not be confused with OpEx and CapEx eligible under the EU 

Taxonomy.

Schneider Electric’s support to the EU 
Taxonomy

Schneider Electric has experienced both the value and the 

challenges of conducting a mapping of green business activities 

early on. The Group therefore welcomes the European 

Commission’s work to define a common classification system for 

sustainable economic activities and believes that the taxonomy can 

bring greater transparency and reporting alignment among 

non-financial undertakings. 

The Group is willing to share its experience in the measurement of 

revenues contributed to a sustainable world and works 

collaboratively and constructively with relevant stakeholders to 

advance the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon economy. 

In particular, Group experts have contributed to the Platform on 

Sustainable Finance, an expert group assisting the EU Commission 

in developing technical criteria.

Reporting requirements under the 
European Taxonomy Regulation

The adoption of the Taxonomy Regulation(2) in 2020 establishes a 

European Union-wide classification system to identify economic 

activities that are considered as environmentally sustainable as 

part of the European Union’s long-term plan to connect finance with 

its sustainability goals. Dedicated Delegated Acts (DA) specify (or 

will specify), for six identified environmental objectives, which 

activities are included in the EU taxonomy (eligibility), and the 

screening criteria to determine if they are indeed making a 

substantial contribution to at least one of the environmental 

objectives, while also Doing No Significant Harm (DNSH) to the 

remaining objectives and meeting minimum standards on human 

rights and labor standards (alignment).

Pursuant to Article 8 of the regulation and the delegated regulation 

published on 6 July 2021, the proportion of turnover, Capital 

Expendiiture (CapEx) and Operating Expenditure (OpEx) resulting 

from products or services associated with economic activities 

considered sustainable is due to be reported progressively over 

the fiscal years (FY) 2021 to 2024. In FY 2022, large undertakings 

are required to disclose those three Key Performance Indicators 

(KPIs) for activities eligible and aligned to climate objectives 

according to the EU Climate Delegated Acts already published. Full 

reporting on alignment for all six objectives is expected in 2025 (on 

FY 2024).

Importantly, the phased application of reporting requirements, as 

well as the evolving nature of the regulatory framework means that 

the KPIs disclosed in this report may evolve as the regulation and 

its reporting requirements do. To date, Delegated Acts have been 

published for only two environmental objectives (climate change 

mitigation and climate change adaptation) out of six. In addition, 

more activities may be incorporated into the existing EU Climate 

Delegated Acts in 2023. This means that more Schneider activities 

could be included in the EU Taxonomy reference framework 

gradually. For instance, this may concern Schneider’s offers related 

to grid reinforcement and smart grid architectures contributing to 

electrification and decarbonization, products with differentiating 

green performance (flagged thanks to our Green Premium™ 

program) or services that bring benefits for circularity and energy 

efficiency.

Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and 
-aligned turnover

Schneider Electric identified several business activities that are 

eligible (i.e. listed) according to the current EU Climate DA. We 

provide the list of those activities in our methodological notes on 

pages 254 and 255.

Alignment of each activity has then been assessed against 

Technical Screening Criteria (TSC), Do No Significant Harm 

(DNSH) and minimum safeguards criteria with the Group’s experts 

and with the support of external consultants. As a result, 

Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned turnovers amount to 29% and 20% 

respectively, representing EUR 9,775 million and EUR 6,934 million 

respectively out of EUR 34,176 million. 

The difference between eligibility and alignment is first related to 

the Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) for Activity 4.9 (Transmission 

and distribution of electricity). Alignment with this TSC is dependent 

on the carbon intensity of the electricity supply in the country of 

sale and the type of power generation source being connected to 

the grid. 4% of the taxonomy-eligible revenues from this activity is 

made in countries (such as the USA and China) where the carbon 

intensity is above the threshold stipulated in the TSC, or 

contributing to connect to the grid a power generation source with 

carbon intensity above the threshold stipulated in the TSC, hence 

considered as not aligned.

The second reason for the difference comes from the generic 

criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control regarding use 

and presence of chemicals. 

About 1% of Schneider eligible revenues do not comply with the 

Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive and are 

therefore not aligned. In addition, the Taxonomy regulation 

stipulates that products using substances identified in the 

candidate list for eventual inclusion in the list of substances subject 

to authorization, Annex XIV of Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 are not 

aligned, except if they are considered of essential use. However, 

the concept of essential use has not yet been defined by the 

European Commission. Therefore, Schneider has taken a 

conservative approach and declared as non-aligned all revenues 

coming from such products, amounting to 3% of eligible revenues.

All other eligible activities comply with Technical Screening Criteria, 

do not cause any significant harm to any of the other environmental 

objectives and respect the minimum safeguards as specified in 

Annex 1 of the EU Climate Delegated Act.

  Read more about calculation method of  

Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned turnover  

pages 253 to 254.

  Read more about the DNSH  

checks performed page 255.

Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and 
-aligned CapEx and OpEx

In 2022, Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned CapEx amount to 54% and 

27% respectively, representing EUR 854 million and EUR 419 

million respectively out of EUR 1,573 million.

To compute the Group’s Taxonomy-eligible and aligned capital 

expenditure, CapEx related to assets, processes and business 

combinations associated with Taxonomy-eligible and aligned 

activities were calculated using allocation keys of eligible, and 

respectively aligned, turnover per business and operations, except 

for Research and Development (R&D) CapEx and IFRS 16 long 

term leasing of buildings CapEx, which have been qualified 

through the prism of CapEx for eligible and aligned individual 

measures. Indeed, as described more exhaustively in section 2.3.4 

“Investing to achieve the Group’s climate strategy and vision”, page 

158, each and every R&D project of the Group demonstrating a 

substantial carbon footprint saving, CapEx associated to R&D 

projects are both Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned under the 

European Taxonomy activity 3.6 (Manufacture of low carbon 

technologies).

The difference between eligibility and alignment in turnover, as 

explained in the previous section, also applies to capital 

expenditure. In addition, the fact that capital expenditure based on 

IFRS 16, related to long-term leasing of buildings, is fully eligible 

but not aligned increases the difference between the Group’s 

Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned CapEx. 

In 2022, Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned OpEx amount to 50%, 

representing EUR 856 million out of EUR 1,716 million.

To determine the Group’s European Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned 

operating expenditure, only non-capitalized costs related to 

Research and Development (R&D) are analyzed for the 

establishment of the numerator of the OpEx KPIs. This includes 

non-capitalized costs relative to R&D projects but also, among 

others, costs incurred in relation with support and platforming, 

costs of IT global applications dedicated to R&D, costs relative to 

continuous engineering costs for quality, productivity and 

obsolescence. As mentioned for CapEx, each R&D project of the 

Group demonstrating a substantial carbon footprint saving, the 

numerators of the KPIs correspond to operating expenditure 

directly associated to Group’s R&D projects: these OpEx are both 

Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned under the European Taxonomy 

activity 3.6.

of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned capital  

and operating expenditures pages 254 to 255.

Spotlight: Schneider supports the development of 
EVs with EcoStruxureTM EV Charging Expert

While the electrification of transportation is critical in the journey to a net-zero destination, this transition 
will impact the energy demand in multi-family, commercial and industrial buildings since up to 40% more 
energy will be required. Building owners and facility managers need to think smarter to manage their 
buildings’ electricity loads to accommodate this increased consumption. 

EcoStruxure™ for eMobility (with EcoStruxure™ EV Charging 

Expert as the edge control) is the solution to that challenge, 

enabling end-to-end EV smart charging solutions for an 

efficient, resilient and sustainable future all-electric mobility at 

homes, buildings, and infrastructures. This activity is qualified 

as “Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and 

public transport” (6.15) in the EU Climate DA.

Powered by Schneider Electric’s EcoStruxure™ EV Charging 

Expert, the intelligent EV charging infrastructure ensures an 

optimized use of energy where the charging infrastructure 

owners or operators can monitor, control and maximize the EV 

charging more efficiently based on real-time available power in 

the property. By leveraging the existing power infrastructure and 

EcoStruxure™ EV Charging Expert, more EV chargers can be 

installed to respond to an increase in demand without the need 

to increase the existing power capacity. The system can adapt 

and limit the load dedicated to EV charging installations, define 

on-peak and off-peak time-of-use periods to optimize EV 

charging and avoid facility disruption and operating losses. 

Schneider’s EV chargers are Green PremiumTM certified and 

recognized with the efficient use of energy and natural 

resources, optimization of the total cost of ownership of 

customers’ assets, regulatory compliance and strong value 

propositions through third-party labels and services.

Schneider Electric is actively promoting the development of EVs 

with more than 150,000 EV chargers sold in 50 countries. For 

example, in Hong Kong, Schneider Electric recently leveraged 

its strategic partnership with Sino Group and expanded its 

network with another 420+ EV chargers – in addition to 1,700+ 

EV chargers already installed in 53 locations there – at Grand 

Central and the adjacent YM2, the new landmark in Kowloon 

East, making it the largest EV charging site at a composite / 

residential new development in Hong Kong. 

Through close collaborations with all stakeholders, 

Schneider aims to further boost EV charging network by 

offering 15,000 EV chargers across the territory in 2025, 

with the hope of bringing more convenience to the EV 

community and making the city more sustainable.

40%
more energy will be required.

180,000+
EV chargers sold in 50 countries since 2018.

2.2 Driving responsible business with 
Trust 

 “As business risks become more 
interconnected and unpredictable, 
building resilience is top of mind: 
even with the best risk 
management systems in place, 
setbacks are bound to occur. 
Therefore, it is key for companies 
to rely on clear frameworks such 
as the Trust Charter – our 
Schneider Electric Code of 
Conduct – to earn and nurture 
trust with our stakeholders.”

Context and Group’s commitments
Trust serves as an ethical compass for all Schneider Electric’s 

interactions with stakeholders and all relationships with customers, 

shareholders, employees, and the communities they serve, in a 

meaningful, inclusive and positive way. 2022 enabled Schneider to 

strengthen its commitment to Trust by relying on actions and tools 

to helps all stakeholders reinforce their trust in the company and 

collaboration between all actors. Therefore, after creating the Trust 

Charter in 2021, it was time for Schneider to deploy its new Code of 

Conduct.

Present in over 100 countries with diverse standards, values, and 

practices, Schneider Electric is committed to behaving responsibly 

in relation to all its stakeholders. Recognizing that its responsibility 

extends beyond compliance with local and international 

regulations, the Group is engaged to doing business ethically, 

sustainably, and responsibly. At Schneider Electric, we believe that 

trust is earned and starts with walking the talk, in relying on 

mechanisms and not only intentions.

Schneider lives up to the highest standards of corporate 

governance, through initiatives that monitor and educate teams on 

ethics, cybersecurity, safety, and quality. The Trust Charter is the 

evolution of the Group’s Principles of Responsibility and sets out 

the expectations of how we work at Schneider, and it equips teams 

to confront any unethical behavior they might encounter. 

Under our 2025 Sustainability Strategy, we commit to live up to our 

principles of trust by holding ourselves and all around us to high 

social, governance and ethical standards. In this report, we share 

our progress on the transformations achieved in 2022 under the 

Trust pillar of our Schneider Sustainability Impact and Schneider 

Sustainability Essentials programs.

2.2 Driving responsible business with Trust

2.2.1 Trust Charter, Schneider Electric’s Code of 
Conduct

2.2.1.1 Earning trust with people

Trust powers all Schneider Electric’s interactions with its 

stakeholders and all relationships with customers, shareholders, 

employees, and the communities they serve, in a meaningful, 

inclusive, and positive way. Trust is evident in the following ways:

• Trusted Teams that are built thanks to leaders setting the tone 

and exemplifying Schneider Electric’s culture, as well as through 

creating for all our employees equal opportunities, harnessing 

the power of all generations, championing well-being and new 

ways of working, and being S.A.F.E. (Self, Activity, Facility, 

Environment) First;

• Trust with Customers and Partners is earned by striving for 

high quality, resiliency, the highest standards for cybersecurity, 

data privacy and protection, as well as prohibiting any form of 

corruption, requiring third-party integrity, avoiding conflict of 

interest, upholding fair competition, abiding by export controls 

and sanctions, and selecting and managing suppliers 

responsibly;

• Trust with Investors comes from preventing insider trading, 

delivering accurate financial statements, records, and tax 

information, delivering solutions in compliance with financial and 

risk management standards, and preserving information 

technology and related intellectual property assets as well as 

Schneider Electric’s reputation;

• Trust with Communities is possible by acting for a climate 

positive world, being efficient with resources, upholding 

responsible lobbying and political activity, empowering local 

communities, not using “conflict minerals”, and acting as good 

corporate citizens.

2.2.1.2 Trust Charter

In 2021, Schneider Electric launched the Trust Charter, which acts 

as the Group’s Code of Conduct and demonstrates its commitment 

to ethics, safety, sustainability, quality, and cybersecurity. 

Schneider Electric believes that trust is a foundational value. It is 

earned and serves as a compass, signaling true north in an ever 

more complex world, and Schneider Electric therefore considers 

trust to be core to its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 

commitments. 

Leadership at every level of the organization was involved in the 

design, creation, and deployment of the Trust Charter to ensure that 

everyone at Schneider Electric is aware of the importance of trust 

and understands how to get the most out of the Group’s Code  

of Conduct.

As trust fuels empowerment, each section of the charter states 

clear Dos and Don’ts and provides clear references to relevant 

policies and procedures, which are adapted to meet local legal 

requirements when necessary. This Code of Conduct applies to 

everyone working at Schneider or any of Schneider’s subsidiaries. 

It is both an individual and collective responsibility to comply and 

respect laws and regulations, to apply Schneider Electric policies, 

and to uphold strong ethical principles to earn trust at all times. 

2.2.1.3 Deployment of the Trust Charter

In addition to the Trust Charter being available in 30 languages on 

Schneider’s website (se.com), a Trust Portal was made available to 

Schneider’s employees to guide them towards related content such 

as policies, useful contacts, sites, guidelines, templates, and reports 

for each section of the Trust Charter. In 2022, the Group saw an 

increase of global policy views of +72% compared with 2021.

Finally, the Trust portal is an Intranet portal that gives access to the 

right resources to all employees when they face situations in which 

they need support, and to help give them the confidence to alert 

any unethical behavior they witness or even remain informed of the 

news the Group provide on new Trust programs or policies they 

publish. As a testimony of the risen awareness and engagement to 

Trust, more than 17,000 unique views between February and 

November 2022 have been recorded on the Trust Portal.

Leadership at every level of the organization was involved in the 

design, creation, and deployment of the Trust Charter to ensure that 

everyone at Schneider Electric is aware of the importance of trust 

and understands how to get the most out of its Code of Conduct.

2022 was a strong deployment year for the Trust Charter. In fact, as 

a proof of this increasing involvement in Trust at all levels, almost 

23,000 downloads of the Trust Charter on se.com have been 

recorded, which takes into account not only employees but all the 

Group’s other stakeholders.

The mandatory Schneider Essentials trainings aim at ensuring that all 

employees are trained on the most important topics covered by the 

Trust Charter, notably: “Trust at Schneider Electric”, “Cybersecurity 

for Schneider Electric 2022”, “We All Have Mental Health” and “The 

Schneider Electric Story”. Thanks to the high level of engagement of 

all employees and the effort of sensibilization, the course dedicated 

to Trust was completed at 97.5% overall.

The Trust Month, the largest and longest-running global internal 

communication campaign, has been a great medium to draw 

together all the pillars of Trust into a single event. The campaign 

consisted of 15 keynotes, 70 webinars and more than 15,000 

webinar attendees. By offering different activities and involving all 

employees in the events the group noticed a very high level of 

engagement and impact, with 88% of participants agreeing they 

learnt something that impacts their daily work life.

2.2.2 Ethics & Compliance program

2.2.2.1 Context

Over the years, Schneider Electric has earned the trust of its 

customers, shareholders, employees, and communities through the 

quality of its products and its sustainability commitments. To fully 

serve these stakeholders, the Group’s commitment to business 

integrity must be equally robust. This means acting at all times in 

accordance with the ethical principles it has set and in compliance 

with the laws and regulations in force in all the countries where it 

operates.

2.2.2.2 Risk and opportunities 

Unethical practices or non-compliance of Schneider Electric, its 

employees or third parties acting in its name and/or on its behalf 

with applicable laws and regulations may expose Schneider 

Electric to criminal and civil proceedings, reputational damage, 

business interruption and damage to shareholder value. Due to 

broader externalities, the Group’s exposure to those risks has been 

increasing for several years, through its geographic expansion, 

participation in complex projects, and a large range of acquisitions. 

Moreover, over the past years, there has been an increase in law 

enforcement by public authorities, new regulations, and higher 

reputational risk with media exposure.

In 2021, Schneider Electric carried out a specific risk mapping 

dedicated to “Ethics and Compliance” regarding the following 

risks: Corruption, Conflict of Interest, Human Rights & Labor Laws, 

and Sanctions & Export Control. Its objective is to capture 

operational risk exposure at zone level, based on local interviews 

led by the Regional Compliance Officers and the Legal teams. 

The process at regional level was as follows: 

• Step 1 – each region defined its local risk universe taking into 

account local specific risks.

• Step 2 – each region assessed its gross risks and effectiveness 

of its local mitigation measures, generating a mapping of 

regional net risks. In addition, a global risk mapping was 

consolidated at Group level.

• Step 3 – each region defined action plans to reduce the risk 

exposure. In addition, a set of global action plans was 

established at Group level. All action plans were monitored 

during the course of 2022.

By contrast with those risks, there is competitive advantage in 

approaching this proactively. Companies can experience 

significant improvements when they hold themselves to high 

standards of integrity. The primary benefits range from increasing 

employee satisfaction, improving workplace culture, maintaining 

legal compliance and strengthen public reputation. It can also 

reinforce the engagement and loyalty of customers, partners, 

suppliers and local communities.

2.2.2.3 Group policy

Through its Ethics & Compliance program, Schneider Electric aims 

to prevent, detect and mitigate integrity risks, including corruption, 

fraud, violation of human rights, health and safety, responsible 

workplace (including discrimination, harassment and sexual 

harassment), anti-competitive practices, sanctions and export 

control. The program design and operation are influenced by  

the Group’s risk profile, business model, organizational structure 

and culture.

To reflect this commitment to integrity and to enable employees to 

respect the Trust Charter, Schneider Electric deployed global and 

local policies: Anti-Corruption Policy (aligned with French Sapin II 

law requirements), Conflict of Interest Policy, Business Agents 

Policy, Anti-Harassment Policy, Export Control Policy, and Case 

Management & Investigation Policy.

In 2022, the Group also updated and deployed a set of new 

policies: Gifts & Hospitality Policy, Competition Law Policy, Human 

Rights Policy, Whistleblowing Policy, Philanthropy Policy, and 

Sponsorship Policy. Moreover, to ensure that the principles and 

rules of the Ethics & Compliance program apply throughout the 

Group and for new entities joining the Group, the Ethics & 

Compliance department worked on specific Trust Standards. This 

work is part of the Governance Models program (see page 114), 

applicable during the acquired company’s integration.

All Schneider Electric employees are expected to comply with 

Schneider’s Ethics & Compliance program. The Ethics & 

Compliance program is based on management commitment which 

makes its pillars effective and on risk assessment which assists 

decision making, determining the risks to be treated and the priority 

to implement the treatment.

Speak-Up Supervision

The Ethics & Compliance program is managed through a 

dedicated governance framework:

• Board level: Schneider Electric’s Board of Directors oversees 

the Ethics & Compliance program through a dedicated annual 

session of the Audit & Risks Committee during which the 

program, risks and improvements, and action plans, are 

reviewed by the Directors. Once a year, the Directors also 

review the Ethics & Compliance program’s effectiveness and 

the allocation of resources to the program. In addition, the 

Directors agree on the audit plan which covers several audits 

related to the Ethics & Compliance program.

• Executive level: Since April 2022, the Ethics & Compliance 

program is overseen by the Group Executive Committee, 

through the Group Function Committee. This Committee merged 

several existing committees, including the pre-existing Group 

Ethics and Compliance Committee. 

• Corporate level: Schneider Electric has created a standalone 

Ethics & Compliance department, chaired by a Chief 

Compliance Officer acting on behalf of the Group Ethics & 

Compliance Committee, and reporting to the Chief Governance 

Officer & Secretary General, to drive the strategy of the Ethics & 

Compliance program. The Ethics & Compliance department 

includes the following teams: Group Compliance, Group HR 

Compliance, Fraud Examination, Health & Safety, and IT Assets 

Governance. It works closely with the Legal, Human Resources, 

Finance, Digital and Strategy & Sustainability departments, as 

well as Internal Control and Audit; which are directly responsible 

for managing certain specific risks. 

Speak-Up Supervision

Schneider Electric employees must feel free and 

psychologically safe to share their ideas, opinions, and 

concerns, without fear of retaliation. To ensure the effectiveness 

of that Speak Up mindset and related whistleblowing system, 

the Group has created two specific committees: 

• The Group Operational Compliance Committee (GOCC) 

detects and manages cases of non-compliance with the 

Ethics & Compliance program in accordance with the 

Whistleblowing Policy and Case Management & 

Investigation Policy, and reviews monthly the effectiveness 

of the whistleblowing system. The GOCC is composed of 

the following members: Chief Compliance Officer 

(secretary of the Committee), Chief Legal Officer, Group 

Internal Audit & Control Officer, Group Compliance 

Director, Group HR Compliance Officer, and Head of Fraud 

Examination Team.

• The Group Disciplinary Committee levies sanctions and 

remediation actions on serious non-compliance cases to 

guarantee a fair and transparent disciplinary policy upon 

request of the GOCC. The Group Disciplinary Committee is 

composed of the following members: Chief Governance 

Officer & Secretary General, Chief Human Resources 

Officer, Chief Compliance Officer (secretary of the 

Committee), Chief Legal Officer, and one rotating member.

• Operational level: Regional Ethics & Compliance committees 

ensure implementation of the Ethics & Compliance program in 

alignment with risks identified. Operationally, they rely on 

Regional Compliance Officers who drive the implementation in 

the zone, with the support of Ethics Delegates and relevant 

subject matter experts at local levels.

Ethics Delegates, Schneider Electric’s  

Integrity Ambassadors

Ethics Delegates is an honors program designed to enable 

well-respected employees with high personal integrity to 

support the promotion of the Ethics & Compliance program, 

influence the behavior of the people and the culture of 

Schneider Electric, and help embed ethics and compliance in 

how people do their jobs within their business/location. In 2022, 

the community had 250 members.

Experience feedback from Isabel Matos, Ethics Delegates in 

South America in 2022: “I have been an Ethics Delegate for 

four years in South America. I am proud to be part of this 

community. We have the opportunity to guide people to be 

compliant with legal regulations and to make right decisions. 

As the company is totally committed with its Trust Charter, we 

have all support needed from stakeholders and employees to 

have a strong governance and risk management in place”.

2.2.2.5 Actions and impacts

Management Commitment

Rules and policies alone do not suffice. Management sets the 

company standards and promotes a culture of integrity and a Speak 

Up mindset. Top management regularly expressed its commitment 

through statements and extensive communication (called “tone from 

the top”), such as during the Trust Month organized in June 2022. 

This global event marked the deployment of the Trust Charter. Its 

launch was supported by the Chairman and CEO in a video in which 

he notably reminded colleagues of the importance of business 

running on trust and integrity. This integrity is also expressed by 

middle- and first-line management (called “tone from the middle”) by 

spreading the right message in their teams and supporting reporting 

of misconduct. 

Management commitment is evidenced by the participation of 

Schneider’s Chairman and CEO who sits on the global Board of the 

United Nations Global Compact. Schneider Electric also works with 

other companies and stakeholders to build integrity and common 

standards. The Group participates in the initiatives of many 

non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and professional 

associations, such as Transparency International France, Le Cercle 

d’Éthique des Affaires (The Ethical Business Circle), International

Entreprises de France (Movement of the Enterprises of France) and 

Anti-Corruption Committee of Business at OECD (BIAC).

Training and awareness

Internal communication provides employees with essential baseline 

information on Schneider Electric’s integrity commitment while also 

raising awareness and understanding of the Ethics & Compliance 

program. To do this, the Group created a dedicated intranet page, 

a global internal social network group and a specific email address 

to answer questions. Schneider Electric also regularly distributes 

videos and other communication assets on integrity-related 

subjects to its employees. In addition, communication around the 

Ethics & Compliance program is rolled out locally by the Regional 

Compliance Officers and Local Internal Communication teams.

Each year a global campaign of mandatory training is run for all 

employees, called Schneider Essentials, from March to the end of 

September. Training is available in 18 different languages in the 

organization’s Learning Management System. In 2022, Schneider 

Essentials trainings were: Trust at Schneider Electric, 

Cybersecurity, We All Have Mental Health and The Schneider 

Electric Story. For around 40,000 employees exposed to corruption 

risks, an additional anti-corruption training is required each year.

A number of specific trainings are also delivered:

• A dedicated module on Ethics & Compliance was prepared for 

Country Presidents. The module raises Country Presidents’ 

awareness about their role and responsibility in supporting the 

Ethics & Compliance program.

• The Ethics & Compliance program includes dedicated training 

for leaders of companies acquired as part of the integration 

process. The training entails a specific focus on what is 

expected from the leadership teams, including endorsing the 

program and actively following up employees’ completion of 

mandatory trainings on Trust Charter and anti-corruption.

• In 2022, ad hoc learnings were organized for all employees and 

managers as part of the Trust Month in June 2022 (e.g. 

Speak-Up) in sensitive geographic areas (e.g. Brazil, India) or in 

locations where a specific risk is higher (such as the export 

control risk). 

The Group monitors and discloses its completion rate on trainings on 

ethics (Trust Charter and anti-corruption for eligible employees) and 

cybersecurity, aiming for 100% completion each year (SSE #13). The 

performance of this KPI received a “limited” external assurance level 

each year as part of the Group’s annual extra-financial audit. At the 

end of 2022, SSE #13 achieved a 95.5% completion rate.

External communication informs stakeholders of Schneider’s 

integrity and of the design and implementation of the Ethics & 

Compliance program. The Group communicates through a 

webpage dedicated to Ethics & Compliance and the dissemination 

of specific external communications. Schneider Electric also 

responds to several questionnaires from extra-financial rating 

organizations related to ethics and compliance. In 2022, Schneider 

Electric was once again recognized as one of the World’s Most 

Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and 

advancing the standards of ethical business practices.

Third-parties integrity

Third-party relationships may create risks for companies, including 

corruption exposure and impact on brand and reputation. 

Conducting third-party due diligence is important to make informed 

decisions and avoid potential problems associated with 

compliance, regulations and public image:

• Customer questionnaires: Schneider Electric is a third party 

for its clients and is subject to evaluation as such. The Group 

regularly responds to questionnaires and other additional 

requests to demonstrate its integrity to its customers.

• Compliance screening: In 2022, 100% of direct customers 

were screened for both export control and sanctions as well as 

corruption risks. A pilot was also launched to provide automatic 

real-time screening of all direct customers. The Group is also 

working to screen its vendors and started an initial screening of 

its strategic direct vendors in 2022. 

• Business Agents: Schneider Electric has implemented a due 

diligence process for its intermediaries that it qualifies as 

“Business Agents”. The Business Agent Policy sets out the rules 

under which Schneider Electric will determine whether there is a 

legitimate business purpose before engaging. The Ethics & 

Compliance department performs the due diligence and 

manages the approval process by analyzing risks of corruption, 

sanctions, and unethical practices.

• Mergers and acquisitions: M&A operations represent specific 

risks regarding ethics and compliance. A specific process and 

guidelines were put in place in 2020 to ensure full compliance of 

M&A operations with anti-corruption and export control 

regulations: this process was developed by the Ethics & 

Compliance department, the Legal department and the M&A 

team, ensuring a methodology that fits with M&A processes and 

ways of working. In 2021, this process was extended to the 

management of Human Rights risk. In 2022, the integration of 

ESG assessments at each stage of the M&A process has been 

reinforced to further protect the Group and accelerate the 

integration of new entities to its Sustainability Strategy and 

reporting.

Specific accounting controls

Schneider Electric has developed accounting control procedures 

to ensure that books, records, and accounts are not used to 

conceal corruption or the influence peddling. In 2022, a revised 

cross-functional program involving mainly Accounting, Internal 

Control, Digital and Ethics & Compliance, as well as upstream 

functions such as Procurement, Sales, Marketing, was launched to 

further improve and digitalize the defined preventive and detection 

controls with the sponsorship of Executive Committee members. 

The program’s priorities were defined based on the results of the 

2021 Ethics & Compliance risk assessment, i.e. Gifts & Hospitality, 

Travel & Expenses, Sponsorship, Donations, Business Agents, 

Marketing Development Funds, Performance Bonuses.

Whistleblowing

As part of the Speak Up mindset, and as developed in the 

Whistleblowing Policy, Schneider Electric employees have a 

responsibility to report potential unethical behaviors.  

histleblowing corresponds to all methods of reporting available to 

employees, interns or contractors, and external stakeholders 

(suppliers, subcontractors, customers, business agents, etc.) to 

voluntarily report a potential violation of laws and regulations, and/

or of the Group’s Trust Charter and Group policies. 

At Schneider Electric, stakeholders, either internal or external, may 

report concerns either by contacting an appropriate person in the 

Group (manager, HR business partner, Legal Counsel, or 

Compliance Officer) and/or by using the Trust Line, Schneider 

Electric’s whistleblowing system. The latter is available online 

globally, at all times, and protects the anonymity of the 

whistleblower (unless there is legislation to the contrary). In 

compliance with local legislation, this system is provided by an 

external, impartial third-party company and proposes alert 

categories, a questionnaire, and an information exchange protocol 

between the person issuing the alert and the person responsible 

for the case management.

rights and responsibilities of people involved. A significant reinforcement of people protection has taken place in particular with:

• a new procedure to ensure Schneider Electric’s zero-tolerance 

policy against retaliation by prohibiting retaliation or other 

discrimination. 

• a set of protection and care measures that can be offered in the 

course of the investigation, in case he/she needs and as per 

local legislation, such as: security measures (distancing), 

accommodations, flexible time management, change of 

function/service and psychological support. 

• a possibility of internal or external mediation to help rebuild 

respectful collaboration.

In 2021, to measure the effectiveness of the Trust Line, Schneider 

Electric created SSI #7 and added a question to its annual 

employee engagement survey, OneVoice: “I can report an instance 

of unethical conduct without fear”. 81% of employees surveyed 

answered “yes”. Since then, the Group is working to increase this 

measurement by 10 points by 2025 as part of Schneider 

Sustainability Impact. In 2022, 82% of employees surveyed 

answered “yes” which constitutes an improvement of +1 point over 

a 12-month period.

Trust

SSI #7

Measure the level of confidence 
of our employees to report 
unethical conduct

A speak-up mindset exists when employees and 

stakeholders feel safe to speak out about issues, concerns, 

and ideas in good faith, respectfully, and without fear of 

retaliation. It helps protect Schneider Electric and its 

employees from the effects of misconduct, including legal 

liability, serious financial losses, and lasting reputational 

harm. It also fosters a corporate culture of trust and 

responsiveness.

Experience feedback from an employee in France 

in 2022.

“I didn’t feel to do it as long as I was still reporting inside 

the team where I had the issue, so I declared the issue 2 

months after, when I was in my new position. I felt safe 

because several colleagues at VP/SVP level expressed 

their support to me and recommended me to do it, 

mentioning that I would be protected in any cases. In full 

transparency, I called a HR colleague at management level, 

asking him how protected I would be. I got a clear answer 

that I would be 100% protected.”

Corrective actions

Deficiencies associated with the implementation of the Ethics & 

Compliance program – and potentially reported through 

whistleblowing – are analyzed to identify their cause and remedy 

them with appropriate measures, which can take the form of:

• disciplinary measures decided by the relevant managers 

together with Human Resources, or by the Group Disciplinary 

Committee for the most sensitive alerts based on the findings of 

an investigation and depending on local disciplinary policies 

and law;

• remediation measures (such as launching a specific audit, 

reviewing a process or performing training);

• external actions (such as entering civil litigation or similar 

legal proceedings).

Monitoring and audit

The Ethics & Compliance program is an integral part of the Group’s 

Key Internal Controls (KIC). Developed in 2021 and becoming 

effective in 2022 for the first time, this KIC framework has been 

significantly reshaped and enhanced by increasing the number of 

KICs for the Ethics & Compliance program aligned with new 

policies and processes. In addition, in 2022 Schneider Electric 

executed the central monitoring of key processes of the Ethics & 

Compliance program such as Business Agents, Conflict of Interest, 

Whistleblowing and Anti-corruption training results. The outcome of 

these controls is regularly shared with key stakeholders to ensure 

continuous process and design improvements.

Furthermore, the Group’s Internal Audit program includes specific 

tasks related to the Ethics & Compliance program, and to activities 

or subsidiaries for which an evaluation of the maturity and 

effectiveness of the program will be reviewed. Several internal 

audits were conducted in 2022 resulting in recommendations 

related to the improvement of the Ethics & Compliance program. 

  For more details on Key Internal Controls and the Group’s 

Internal Audit. Please refer to page 126.

2.2.3 Zero-tolerance for corruption

2.2.3.1 Context

Corruption is illegal and refers to the abuse of entrusted power for 

private gain. It undermines the effectiveness of any given 

ecosystem by undermining the trust and confidence which are 

necessary for the maintenance and development of sustainable 

economic and social relations. Moreover, it threatens the rule of 

law, democracy and human rights, undermines good governance, 

fairness and social justice, distorts competition, hinders economic 

development and endangers the stability of democratic institutions 

and the moral foundations of society. Over the past years, 

anti-corruption regulations have been strengthened worldwide. 

Fighting corruption has become a legal obligation in several 

countries with more controls and sanctions in case of misconduct.

2.2.3.2 Risks and opportunities 

Engaging in corruption exposes to legal proceedings, prosecutions 

and sanctions for companies and individuals. Companies accused 

or convicted of illicit behavior may then suffer a serious public 

relations backlash and expose themselves or individuals to being 

debarred from public tenders/ public funds. They may also be 

subverting local social interests and/or harming local competitors 

while the cost of funding corruption may be perceived by investors 

as a hidden “tax” or illegal overhead charge, thereby increasing 

costs for companies, and further down the chain, their customers. 

Multiple studies indicate that companies that have anti-corruption 

measures significantly increase profits compared to companies 

that do not. Indeed, such an approach will attract customers, 

investors, employees and suppliers who are concerned about risks 

as well as those who value integrity. It is then translated directly into 

tangible benefits, including risk reduction, cost savings and 

sustainable growth. 

Schneider Electric’s exposure to corruption risk materializes 

through various factors, in particular: 

• Organic growth and mergers and acquisitions in countries with 

a high perceived level of corruption (especially in Asia and 

Africa); 

• Business model relying on a large ecosystem of partners, 

including accountability for activities performed on behalf of the 

Group; 

• Participation in complex projects in sector at risk, such as oil 

and gas, where the amounts invested may be very high and with 

end-users from the public sector subject to more restrictive 

anti-corruption regulations. 

To meet the legal obligations specified by the December 9, 2016 

French law known as the Sapin II law, the Company launched a risk 

mapping exercise focusing on corruption risks in 2018. In 2021, this 

risk assessment was updated as part of the new Ethics & 

Compliance risk mapping, which focuses in particular on 

Corruption and Conflicts of Interest. Please refer to section 2.2.2 

“Ethics & Compliance program”, page 111. In 2021, 8% of the 

confirmed valid alerts, reported through whistleblowing, concern a 

potential violation of the Anti-Corruption Policy. In 2022, this 

represented 13%.

2.2.3.3 Group policy and governance

As stated in the Trust Charter and Anti-Corruption Policy, Schneider 

Electric has zero tolerance for corruption and is committed to 

comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws. This commitment is 

demonstrated by a strong and continuously developing Anti-

Corruption Compliance program, which is part of the Ethics & 

Compliance program and managed by the same Ethics & 

Compliance Governance (see page 112).

Schneider Electric published and rolled out a revised Anti-

Corruption Policy in 2019, meeting the requirements of the French 

Sapin II law, to take into account results of the corruption risk 

mapping and to provide employees with examples illustrating 

situations they may face. This policy acts as a handbook to be 

consulted when in doubt about the appropriate behavior to adopt. 

It is not intended to address every issue one may encounter, but it 

provides appropriate examples of corruption risks and offers 

guidance to resolve many ethical dilemmas. 

2.2.3.4 Actions and impacts

To operationalize the behavior rules of the Anti-Corruption Policy, 

Schneider Electric has created a set of additional policies and 

procedures related to Conflict of Interest, Business Agents, Gifts & 

Hospitality, Philanthropy and Sponsorship and revised anti-

corruption accounting controls program. Moreover, the risks 

associated with onboarding new acquisition targets are numerous 

and consequently, Merger and Acquisition (M&A) guidelines have 

been published to identify, manage, and mitigate those risks at the 

earliest possible stage. These guidelines aim to cover the very first 

steps of identifying potential targets, what to look out for in 

data-rooms, and finally how the Group plans to integrate the 

acquired entity into its anti-corruption compliance framework 

through dedicated Trust Standards. These same rules also apply 

when Schneider Electric decides to make a divestiture with a 

step-by-step approach to managing the transition.

Schneider Electric has also developed a suite of anti-corruption 

e-learnings, providing guidance on real life risk scenarios, 

designed to meet the trainees’ needs and expectations. The 

training is mandatory for targeted employees exposed to corruption 

risks, as identified by the corruption risk mapping. A curriculum of 

modules of e-learnings was deployed in 2020: a general module on 

the “zero tolerance” message against corruption and an 

explanation of the legal framework and risks, and two specific 

modules about third parties and gifts and hospitality. In 2021, four 

additional modules were created on facilitation payments, conflict 

of interest, the conditions that create a climate for wrongdoing and 

how to raise concerns. The modules were supported by videos 

from top leaders demonstrating the “tone at the top” and are 

available in 14 languages. In 2022, those e-learnings were rolled 

out to more than 40,000 employees, with a completion rate of 97%.

Moreover, the year saw ad hoc anti-corruption learnings delivered 

to all employees and managers as part of the Trust Month that took 

place in June 2022 (e.g. Conflict of Interest) and in functions 

deemed to be priorities (e.g. Services). Notably, Schneider Electric 

also organized specific communication campaigns dedicated to 

the new policies for Gifts & Hospitality, Philanthropy and 

Sponsorship.

2.2.3.5 Focus on responsible lobbying, 
political activity, and donations

Through its Trust Charter, Schneider Electric has taken a clear 

stance with regards to responsible lobbying, political activity, and 

donations. As a Company, Schneider has a role to play in the public 

debate addressing leading issues with the global community. It is 

necessary that the Group states its positions clearly, participates in 

technical discussions, and supports responsible public policy 

development. Donations and lobbying activities are risks 

specifically addressed in the Anti-Corruption Policy.

Schneider believes that this representation of interests should be 

conducted in a transparent and fair manner, allowing third parties 

and stakeholders to understand its activities, positions, and 

statements. In particular, Schneider Electric does not engage in 

political activity or political representation and does not make any 

payment to political parties in relation to its public representation. In 

2022, Schneider Electric was not involved in sponsoring local, 

regional, or national political campaigning.

In the US, political contributions can only be made by a corporation 

through a legally formed Political Action Committee (PAC) or Super 

Political Action Committee. Schneider Electric does not engage 

with Super PAC activity nor does it have a PAC in the US and 

therefore cannot make any political contributions in this country. 

Schneider Electric presents information about its lobbying activities 

in the French High Authority for Transparency in Public Life, in the 

EU transparency register, and in the US Lobbying Disclosure Act 

Registration. 

From 2019 to 2022, the Group discloses expenses in membership 

fees towards trade associations, business coalitions, and think-

tanks, that are dedicated by the association to lobbying or 

representation. Generally, the budget allocated to lobbying in these 

organizations is small as these associations mostly organise 

business workshops, peer-learning groups, or work on 

standardization. Schneider Electric updated its reporting 

methodology compared to previous years and now discloses the 

budget allocated to lobbying or representation rather than total 

membership fees. The data collected covers the main Group 

geographies, in particular Europe including France, North America, 

China, India, Indonesia, the UK or Philippines.

Total contributions globally amounted to about €0.5 million in 2019, 

€0.6 in 2020, €1.2 million in 2021 and €1.1 million in 2022.

The largest contributions and expenditures concern two main 

engagement topics:

• The first is “Sustainable energy for all”: Schneider Electric 

believes that energy management and energy efficiency are 

critical to move towards a new energy landscape and therefore 

supports a policy framework that unleashes the business and 

climate opportunities related to the new energy landscape. 

Contributions and expenditures on this topic amounted about 

€0.6 million in 2022 (€0.5 million in 2021) globally;

• The second is “Powering the digital economy”: the Group 

supports the emergence of the digital economy to bring new 

opportunities for businesses and people and therefore supports 

a policy framework that facilitates the digital transformation 

globally. Contributions and expenditures on this topic amounted 

about €0.2 million in 2022 (€0.1 million in 2021) globally.

2.2.4 Responsible 
Workplace 

2.2.4.1 Context 

A responsible workplace is an open and supportive place where all 

employees, no matter who they are, or where they live in the world, 

feel uniquely valued and safe to contribute their best. It is settled 

when everyone is treated fairly, when difference is acknowledged 

and valued, and everyone feels free from any type of harassment, 

victimization and discrimination. 

2.2.4.2 Risks and opportunities 

Not creating a responsible workplace may expose Schneider 

Electric to liability towards the person who has allegedly been 

harassed or discriminated, potential claims from the alleged 

perpetrator and future allegations to not prevent a potential culture 

of harassment and/ or discrimination to flourish or took insufficient 

steps to protect employees. Moreover, the Group could be 

exposed to reputational risk. 

To assess risks relating to the workplace, Schneider Electric 

conducted a risk mapping exercise as part of the Ethics & 

Compliance risk mapping, under the Human Rights risk stream. In 

2021, 30% of the confirmed valid alerts, reported through 

whistleblowing, concern Discrimination, Harassment or Unfair 

treatment. In 2022, this represented 44%. 

Building a responsible workplace establishes trust for employees. It 

also encourages talented candidates to join Schneider Electric’s 

safe and comfortable work environment. Additionally, for the same 

reasons, it retains Talents by developing engagement and 

increasing employee morale. As Schneider’s Employees are first in 

the line of defense, the Group has renewed and deployed its Core 

Values and Leadership Expectations. Each year, Employees are 

evaluated on their global performance, taken into consideration 

their alignment with the Group’s values and corresponding 

demonstrated behaviors. 

  See more details in Chapter 2.5  

page 196.

2.2.4.3 Group policy and governance 

Schneider Electric has “zero tolerance” for any kind of workplace 

misconduct. This commitment is evidenced by a specific HR 

Compliance program, which is part of the Ethics & Compliance 

program and manages by the same Ethics & Compliance 

Governance. 

Schneider Electric published and rolled out an Anti-Harassment 

Policy in 2018, serving as an employee manual to address and 

prevent misconduct that violates the dignity of employees. In 2022, 

the Group worked on a new version and extended the policy on 

discrimination. The new Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination 

Policy will be rolled out in 2023.

2.2.4.4 Actions and impacts 

To operationalize responsible workplace behavior principles, 

Schneider Electric has renewed the Global “Flexibility at Work” 

Policy in 2020 and the Global Family Leave Policy in 2022, which 

both support greater inclusion and care to help its diverse 

workforce adapt to the “next normal” workplace. Moreover, the HR 

Compliance program is applied across the Schneider Electric 

group through dedicated Trust Standards. These are deployed 

during the integration of new entities and the onboarding of new 

employees when they join the company. 

To build a common understanding and alignment, Schneider 

Electric also created a mandatory training entitled “Building a 

Culture of Respect” and assigned it to all employees as part of 

Schneider Essentials (mandatory for all) in 2021. 98% of employees 

completed the training. This training was available to all employees 

who wished to take it in 2022. In addition, some specific trainings 

were deployed in line with local initiatives to prevent harassment 

and discrimination in specific countries (e.g. U.S.). 

In 2022, Schneider deployed a new e-learning called “We All Have 

Mental Health” as a mandatory training for all, to raise awareness of 

the “next normal” working conditions and the company’s care of its 

employees. Due to the sensitivity of workplace-related alerts and 

the human factor involved, the Group has also created a specific 

e-learning for its network of internal investigators. This aims to 

ensure full impartiality and fair common practices everywhere. 

More than 240 HR investigators were trained. In addition, 

workshops have been conducted for internal investigators in many 

geographies. 

Schneider Electric also organized specific communication 

campaigns promoting a responsible workplace as part of the Trust 

Month that took place in June 2022. As part of this initiative, the 

company organized a dedicated awareness session on 

psychological safety. In addition, Schneider Electric encourages 

the Speak-Up mindset to allow employees and stakeholders to 

report any violations of the group’s ethical standards or any 

workplace-related concerns.

2.2.5 Compliance with tax 
regulations
Schneider Electric Group applies a responsible fiscal approach 

supported by strong governance, as outlined in the tax policy of the 

Group which can be consulted on our website at se.com. Tax risk 

management is an integral part of the company’s risk management 

process, and in this context, the Tax Director, under the authority of 

the CFO, is in charge of implementing the Group’s tax policy and 

reports regularly to the Audit Committee. The Group engages to 

comply with the international and local tax regulations applicable in 

each of the countries in which it operates, and to build a lasting and 

transparent relationship of trust with the tax authorities. In this 

respect, the Group provides the tax authorities with all the 

information necessary to enable them to carry out their mission. As 

an example, the Group has entered into a tax partnership - a 

relationship of trust - in France, and works in consultation with the 

tax authorities. Similar steps are being taken in other countries.

2.2.6 High standards for 
the quality and safety of 
our products

2.2.6.1 Context

Schneider Electric holds dear the trust customers and employees 

place in its products and services to protect themselves and their 

property. Continuous quality improvement is therefore central to the 

organization’s strategy and foundational to achieve its overall 

business purpose and mission. Recognizing the opportunity that 

delivering superior quality would bring, the Group began a 

company-wide transformation of quality to accelerate its journey.

2.2.6.2 Risks and opportunities

Schneider Electric operates globally with a wide-ranging portfolio 

of customer solutions. The corresponding complexity of the 

product portfolio and supply chain brings with it risks and 

opportunities for quality. Many of the Group’s solutions serve 

essential industries where product quality and safety are a critical 

topic. Product malfunctions or failures could result in Schneider 

incurring liabilities for tangible, intangible damages, or personal 

injuries. The failure of a product, system, or solution may involve 

costs related to the product recall, result in new development 

expenditure, and consume technical and economic resources. 

Schneider Electric’s products are also subject to multiple quality 

and safety controls governed by national and supranational 

regulations and standards. Maintaining compliance to new or more 

stringent standards or regulations could result in capital investment. 

Risks identified by Schneider Electric in regard to product, project, 

system quality, and offer reliability can be:

• Design quality concerns

• Manufacturing and Logistic issues

• Deficient product safety

• Software quality

• Brand labelling, Supplier & Supply mismanagement

The above-mentioned risks could have a significant impact on the 

financial performance of the Group. The business reputation of 

Schneider Electric could also be negatively impacted. Indeed, the 

Group has been impacted by several recalls. With the quality 

transformation, Schneider Electric has established the visionary 

goal to eliminate product recalls by 2025 (SSE #15). 

2.2.6.3 Group quality policy

In its Trust Charter, Schneider clearly outlines its commitments to 

strive for high quality. 

The Quality Policy of the Group is guided by the following principles:

1 Customer First: Quality is the safety of customers. Schneider 

Electric prioritizes their interests and anticipates customer 

needs through customer journeys and customer personas 

deployment everywhere in the Group. 

2 Offer Quality: Schneider Electric innovates with agility, 

discipline, and good business sense throughout the offer’s 

lifecycle, from creation to supply, all the way through 

manufacturing, delivering, and operations and until services. 

Schneider Electric delivers safe, reliable, and cybersecure 

offers, for products, systems, and software, to secure 

customers’ business continuity.

3 Intelligence: Schneider Electric runs strong analytics to convert 

its process performance and customer experience data into 

actionable information, enabling us to better fulfil customer 

needs, prevent complaints, and improve customer satisfaction 

all touch points. 

4 People: Quality is every employee’s responsibility. Schneider 

Electric puts customer first by empowering them to stop work 

whenever they have a concern and removes internal barriers to 

achieve customer-centric solutions.

5 Ultimate experience: Customer experience is recognized in 

the Group as a strong competitive advantage, to earn trust from 

customers and develop business in a sustainable manner. 

Therefore, the group deeply analyzes customer experience to 

prioritize improvement efforts and investments.

It is the policy of Schneider to only propose products, solutions, 

and services which are safe when properly used for their intended 

purpose or for other reasonably foreseeable purposes contributing 

to the sustainability ambitions of the Group. It is the obligation of 

Schneider to notify customers of safety issues caused by its offer 

that may result in bodily injury or property damage, and include 

instructions for immediate remedial actions, even after the end of 

the useful life of the offer. 

Schneider Electric benefits from a full set of quality directives that 

require the application of systematic processes to properly 

address potential offer safety issues discovered inside or outside 

Schneider. These processes are to be used for all offers sold or 

manufactured by Schneider Electric. They are: 

• Quality Directive “Managing Customer Safety Risks”.  

This directive requires the application of Schneider Electric’s 

systematic processes to properly address potential offer safety 

risks of bodily injury or property damage, discovered inside or 

outside Schneider Electric. These processes are to be used for 

all offers sold or manufactured by Schneider Electric.

• Quality Procedure “Offer Safety Review”. The overall 

objective of offer safety is to reduce the risk arising from the use 

of Schneider’s products, solutions, or services throughout their 

life cycle. Offer safety reviews are conducted by Offer Safety 

Review Committees and are used to focus attention on safety and 

help ensure that offers are safe when properly installed (based on 

safety manual), maintained and used for their intended purpose 

and other reasonably foreseeable use or misuse. 

2.2.6.4 Governance

The Group policy is realized through a robust Quality Management 

System, which is improved continuously to fulfill expectations of all 

relevant parties. It is in full alignment with the Group’s Trust Charter, 

Schneider Electric’s Code of Conduct, as well as in compliance 

with and certification to ISO 9001 standard. 231 Schneider Electric 

manufacturing sites have achieved their ISO 9001 certification.

At Schneider Electric, the customer satisfaction and quality network 

covers all layers, functions, global supply chain, operations, and 

lines of businesses. Within presence of quality throughout the 

Group, Schneider seeks to create a culture of quality and spread 

the customer-first mindset everywhere. 

Schneider has strengthened the governance committee with a new 

accelerated operating rhythm wherein the new Head of Customer 

Satisfaction & Quality (CS&Q), together with the Executive 

Committee, reviews the status of quality across the company and 

guide the quality transformation journey. 

The quality transformation is further informed with first-hand 

experience gained from over 50 quality-focused Gemba walks 

through Schneider operations worldwide. During the Gemba walks, 

the new Head of CS&Q personally compares the current standard 

to actual conditions and to industry best practice to identify 

necessary corrections and opportunities for improvement.

2.2.6.5 Actions and impacts

To accelerate and focus the company-wide transformation of 

quality, the Group has invested in strengthening and reorganizing 

the quality function, beginning with a new Head of CS&Q bringing 

to the Group best practices that produce world-class quality in 

Automotive and Aerospace industries. The Group further enabled 

and accelerated the change through a revised organizational 

structure and investing in new capability. 

Quality System

Building on the foundation of the existing quality system, the Group 

has identified opportunities to simplify the existing processes and 

procedures, while adopting the highest applicable standards in 

every category. To ensure processes are completely implemented 

and procedures followed with discipline, the Group aims to greatly 

strengthen quality internal auditing program.

Quality Planning

The Group continues its ReeD program (Reliability End To End by 

Design), to secure fundamentals and ensure full integration of new 

customer expectations (from Quality to Reliability). Designed with 

R&D at its heart, with huge interactions with all functions and 

businesses of Schneider Electric: 

• By ensuring that new offer development is focused on customer 

promises. 

• By animating mitigation plan until deviation is fixed. 

• By ensuring Excellence in Offer Life Cycle changes. 

• By transitioning from product quality to systems reliability. 

• By combining people’s competency with robust digital 

processes. 

• By leveraging more digital tools to detect issues early and 

reduce the number of bugs seen by customers. 

• Reinforce risk analysis to ensure proper usage of systems, 

software, and products to prevent associated issues and risks. 

It is the obsession of the Group to ensure that “Reliability” is a 

signature value of Schneider Electric branding. Accordingly, the 

program is being further strengthened with dedicated resources 

and the introduction of new processes and methods supporting 

increases in Reliability and Robustness. The new processes and 

methods are being animated though capability-building “design 

fundamentals” training and practices.

Quality Assurance

Schneider strengthened its use of Failure Modes and Effects 

Analysis extending coverage, deepening the analysis, and creating 

a laser focus on severe failure modes, ensuring risk-mitigating 

controls are in place, and successfully reducing the risk on over 

600 processes.

Through the process improvement efforts, the Group recognizes the 

opportunity to integrate and strengthen existing industrialization 

procedures with “Advanced Product Quality Planning” (APQP) which 

seeks to introduce new products with outstanding quality. As APQP 

matures it would enable the Group to bring together the Design, 

Industrialization, Manufacturing, and Service teams to co-create 

solutions that are more reliable, robust, manufacturable and 

serviceable, contributing to the sustainability goals of the group.

Quality Control

Within operations, the Group pursues a twin strategy of “back to 

basics” while it accelerates and leverages its digitization. The 

“quality basics” were developed and are being deployed or 

strengthened across the group. To introduce the quality basics 

special radical change events (kaikaku) were held to immediately 

implement the basics. The radical change events serve to build 

quality capability in participants and organizations, further 

strengthening the Group quality culture. 

Accelerated implementation of digital solutions for real time 

process control and statistical process control, traceability, and 

other digital capabilities to over 300 manufacturing lines. 

Establishing the digital foundation encourages innovative thinking 

and ways the Group can unleash its digital potential. Globally the 

Group identified over 100 applications for Artificial Intelligence (AI) 

and Machine Learning, successfully adding AI to manufacturing 

processes to improve first-time quality and successfully applying 

vision and machine learning to improve quality control.

Quality Improvement

Schneider Electric’s “Issue to Prevention” process continues to 

deliver valuable insights to root causes of problems and their 

corresponding improvement opportunities. The process was 

further strengthened through the implementation and verification of 

corrective and preventive actions, and by creating a mechanism to 

share learning horizontally across the Group.

Schneider has an Offer Safety Alert (OSA) process to alert the relevant 

Line of Business and other interested parties as soon as it is 

suspected that customers’ health or property safety may be put at risk 

by Schneider products, solutions, or projects. The Offer Safety Alert 

Committee (OSAC) is a permanent corporate committee that oversees 

and regulates the management of OSA. Its mission is to ensure all 

OSA are managed with the due diligence and urgency to minimize 

safety risks to customers. Its independent, multi-discipline nature 

allows the OSAC to make decisions in the customers’ best interest. As 

part of the Trust pillar of Schneider Sustainability Essentials 2021–

2025, Schneider has set the visionary objective to eliminate recalls by 

2025 (SSE #15), which is an enhancement of the previous program to 

“reduce scrap from safety units recalled” originally set.

Trust

SSE #15

Zero product recalls by 2025

In 2022 the Group recalled 24 products as approved by the 

Offer Safety Alert Committee, vs 14 in 2021. In addition to 

Safety, recalls have large environmental footprints 

consisting of re-production of the recalled units and 

multiplications of packaging and transportation.

The increase of Offer Safety Alerts in 2022 is consistent 

with the increase of detection policy close to defect “Point 

of Creation”, reducing the magnitude of impact for 

customers and for the environment.

For each alert, Schneider reaches out to customers 

impacted by the recall to arrange for product replacement. 

Investigation will be conducted on products returned to 

Schneider’s premises to determine the final root cause of 

the safety issue. The returned product thereafter will be 

assessed on its reusability and parts which could not be 

reused will be scrapped according to the local 

environmental regulations.

It is the ambition of the Group to eliminate recalls though 

the adoption and rigorous execution of a quality system 

consisting of the highest available standards.

2.2.7 Digital trust and security 

2.2.7.1 Cybersecurity context

Schneider Electric commits to provide solutions to achieve a 

greener low-emissions future, a shift mostly driven by digitalization 

and fueled by innovation. While hyperconnectivity and subsequent 

digital enablers provide transformative business and operational 

value, they also expand cybersecurity threats. 

On top of that the Group operates in over 100 countries, sources 

goods and services from five continents and manages more than 

50,000 unique suppliers. All of this increases the cyber complexity 

under which our companies operate and introduces sources of 

risks.

Cybersecurity is an essential business imperative for Schneider 

Electric. This means that the Group takes a risk-informed approach, 

managing cyber risks thoroughly to better protect its supply chain, 

working to shape a company-wide cybersecurity culture and finally 

partnering with experts to reach the highest cyber standards.

2.2.7.2 Risks and opportunities

Schneider Electric’s strategy aims: 

1. to protect its customers assets and operations

2. to mitigate the possibility of having its operational continuity 

disrupted by an attack by identifying and prioritizing high-value 

digital assets within the company’s operations and enforcing a 

certification discipline across its major sites and assets

3. to comply with global and local regulations where the company 

operates

4. to prevent voluntary and involuntary loss or exposure of its 

intellectual property.

In this journey, Schneider Electric seeks to learn and mature its 

posture. Hence, cyber events are continuously monitored, 

detected, responded to, and learned from. The Group measures its 

improvement thanks to date-based reality checks, internal and 

external reviews, cyber crisis drills, and vulnerability assessments 

to its acquired companies and entities acquired which are under 

control form a business standpoint but whose IT management 

systems are out of our control.

Schneider Electric believes that cybersecurity is everyone’s 

responsibility, hence at Group level, clear expectations shape both 

individual and collective secure behaviors, not only to protect the 

Group but the society at large. Online training on cybersecurity is 

mandatory for all employees. This training helps employees to 

identify the cyber threats they may face and understand how to 

protect themselves. At the end of 2022, 99% of Schneider Electric 

employees had completed this training. Certain employee 

categories received mandatory training for risks linked to their 

activity. Hence there are trainings for: 

• HR teams as they are confronted daily to data 

• 33,000 shopfloor employees are concerned, as well as the 

84,000 white collars of the Group.

• Employees that are directly facing customers, approximately 

20,000 employees, need to validate a “cyber badge” as they 

access customer sites

• Teams in charge of R&D are bound to train as they deal with 

intellectual property on a daily basis. 

Finally, as cybersecurity is a collective play, Schneider Electric 

works collaboratively with the ecosystem sitting along its value 

chain (suppliers, authorities, customers, especially the ones in 

critical infrastructure etc.) to build trust, as it has an ambition to 

raise the defense level of the industry at large. 

2.2.7.3 Group Policy

Cybersecurity policies are foundational to the Group’s security 

posture as they are compulsory for all stakeholders, they set 

management’s tone and provide guidance towards secure 

behaviors (people), practices (processes) and environment 

(technology) throughout the company.

The company’s overarching General Information Security Policy 

and all supporting security policies are in line with broadly 

recognized standards and regulations such as ISO27001, NIST, 

ISA/IEC62443, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

Schneider Electric’s current policy framework governs and 

regulates security behaviors, and encompasses products, 

solutions, services, and sites. These guidelines apply to all 

employees and contractors, and relevant populations are regularly 

trained on them. 

  Our public security-related policies can be found in the 

Cybersecurity and Data Protection page on www.se.com

2.2.7.4 Governance 

Cybersecurity and data protection are integral to the Group’s 

corporate business strategy and digital transformation journey, and 

at the core of the Trust Charter. In addition to corporate commitment, 

executives play a crucial role through the sponsorship of the 

Executive Committee and oversight from the Board of Directors.

A central body governs the companywide cybersecurity portfolio, 

coordinating the execution of strategic and operational initiatives, 

and orchestrating a broader community of security practitioners 

distributed across businesses and territories. The community 

includes:

• Digital and operational Security Leaders appointed to manage 

security risks within their domain (Sales, R&D, Supply Chain, 

Finance, HR, AI, Digital Offers…). They prepare for and respond 

to an incident by coordinating the investigation, containment, 

and remediation.

• Industrial and R&D Site Leaders nominated to act as 

cybersecurity experts in all industrial and R&D sites. They carry 

a strong knowledge of OT assets and technologies as well as 

their plant’s network infrastructure. 

For all security practices and initiatives, monthly updates on 

projects and report on metrics are orchestrated centrally to allow 

continuous improvement on all capabilities. 

The company relies on an open and transparent culture where 

employees are encouraged to self-report any possible issue 

(intrusion, errors, vulnerabilities etc.). Schneider Electric has 

adopted a “see something, say something” approach to encourage 

escalation to facilitate more rapid detection of exposure and 

breaches via “people sensors”.

Coalition.

• A signatory of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, and now works

with its partners towards addressing supply chain security.

• An active contributor to the World Economic Forum, sitting at the

advisory board of Oil and Gas group to strengthen resilience

across the industry, leveraging collective intelligence and

expertise. Public reports (available on Schneider’s website(1))

are an output of this strong collaboration, as well as tighter

connections with leaders from other companies.

Finally, as part of the Trust pillar of its 2021–2025 sustainability 

strategy, Schneider Electric commits to remain in the top 25% in 

external ratings for Cybersecurity performance (SSE #16).

Trust

SSE #16

In the Top 25% in external ratings

Schneider Electric continuously and consistently monitors 

its posture with the support of cyber scoring agencies. This 

enables the Group to identify and address vulnerabilities 

and weaknesses (along with Intelligence-driven detections) 

around main risk categories such as Compromised 

Systems, Diligence, User Behavior and Public Disclosures. 

Addressing findings that can negatively impact overall 

cybersecurity rating and benchmarking Schneider’s 

performance against is supporting the Group’s maturity 

journey on cybersecurity, from a performance, risk, and 

communication perspective.

2.2.7.6 Data privacy and protection

Schneider Electric implemented the General Data Protection 

Regulation (GDPR) requirements and launched specific training to 

manage the major challenges of this regulation. This training is 

mandatory for Schneider Electric employees in Europe and key 

functions.

Schneider Electric believes that the global implementation of a 

digital strategy must reconcile economic objectives and respect for 

fundamental human rights, including the right to protection of 

personal data and privacy.

Schneider Electric has established an organization, work streams, 

policies, procedures, and controls required by the obligations 

stemming from GDPR and data privacy and protection regulations, 

including:

• Internal data privacy policy and Binding Corporate Rules (BCR).

• Training and awareness campaigns.

• Processing registers.

• Online privacy policy and privacy notices.

• Digital assets privacy assessment process.

• Data breach management and notification process.

• Maturity assessment and audit controls.

A governance ecosystem is in place including a Group Data 

Protection Officer (DPO), a DPO network, an implementation team, 

Data Privacy & Protection Champions and Steercos. 

Schneider Electric is rolling out its Global Data Privacy & Protection 

compliance approach beyond GDPR in China, the USA, and India 

and is globalizing its standards to address new regulatory 

challenges like PIPL and CPRA. A new data protection addendum 

has been deployed, including the new Standard Contractual 

Clauses of the European Commission.

2.2.8 Human rights

2.2.8.1 Context 

Human Rights issues have been increasing in terms of risk 

exposure and geopolitical influence. New challenges are emerging, 

due to social, economic, and digital disruptions, such as forced 

labor, living wages, migrant workers or artificial intelligence.

As a global company operating in over 100 countries, Human 

Rights have been a main priority for a long time. Schneider 

Electric’s ambition goes beyond compliance with existing 

regulations. Its ambition is to ensure that Human Rights are not 

infringed upon and to play an influential role with external 

stakeholders by promoting health and safety, diversity, inclusion, 

equity, and decent work for all.

2.2.8.2 Risks and opportunities 

In accordance with the 2017 French duty of vigilance law and its 

ambition to behave as an exemplary company, Schneider Electric 

implemented a specific vigilance plan. In 2022, Schneider 

reviewed and updated its “duty of vigilance risk matrix” which 

highlights the risks the Group poses on its ecosystem including its 

sites, suppliers, contractors, and local communities (for more 

details please see page 133).

This review of risk covers fundamental Human Rights. This includes 

some rights that may be threatened as a result of the evolution of 

the geopolitical context: increased flow of migrant workers and 

threats of modern slavery(1) as a consequence of regional conflict 

and wars, pressure on working hours and individual income as a 

result of tension in the supply chain and accelerated inflation.

In front of these risks, the Group engaged into several programs 

that span across its supply chain and its workforce. A core 

commitment regarding Human Rights is the transformation 

program related to Decent Work launched in 2021. This program is 

based on 10 fundamental Human Rights pillars, with the aim of 

ensuring dignity for all and protecting workers’ rights. The program 

benchmarks current standards around worker rights to ensure that 

fair policies and practices are followed. This was rolled out to all the 

Group’s employees in 2022, and has started to be rolled out for the 

Group’s strategic suppliers (see page 138). 

The Group has also engaged into Duty of Vigilance program. As 

part of this program, Schneider Electric is performing audits of 

risky suppliers to identify potential gaps and suggests areas for 

improvement.

2.2.8.3 Group Human Rights Policy

Schneider Electric’s human rights approach is articulated around 

three principles. 

1. Schneider is committed to fully respecting and applying laws

and regulations in all countries where it operates.

2. Schneider is committed to fostering and promoting human rights

throughout all its operational sites and subsidiaries worldwide.

3. Schneider wishes to support human rights beyond its borders,

leveraging its large network of partners and stakeholders to

promote the implementation of actions that will ensure the

respect of people’s rights.

Schneider Electric’s Global Human Rights Policy(2) is applicable to 

all Schneider permanent or temporary employees working on 

Group premises. It also aims to inspire external stakeholders. For 

all human rights risks identified above, and based on the “Protect, 

Respect, Remedy” principles, the policy provides a framework and 

gives guidance to employees and teams on how to behave in their 

daily operations or when facing a specific situation.

At the end of 2022, Schneider published the second version of its 

Global Human Rights Policy. The Company intends to increase its 

commitments by making clear its position on new challenges such 

as migrant workers and artificial intelligence. It confirms the 

Group’s engagement to strive for the respect of all internationally 

recognized Human Rights and to ensure that Human Rights are 

respected for everyone, everywhere, at all times. The new policy 

includes eight new topics: respect and dignity, human rights in 

cyberspace, migrant workers, conflicts minerals, intergenerational 

solidarity, human rights activities within the Group’s supply chain, 

civic space and human rights defenders, and access to a healthy 

environment. Full deployment including the creation of an 

e-learning is planned for 2023.

• The international human rights principles encompassed in the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights (as part of the

International Bill of Human Rights), which sets out a common

standard for all types of organization.

• The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which

formulate recommendations for companies, including for the

respect of human rights.

• The ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at

Work.

• The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights

(UNGPs) which precisely define the roles and responsibilities of

States and businesses on these matters. Schneider Electric is

committed to these Guiding Principles and to the United Nations

Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The procedures implemented by Schneider Electric, notably its 

vigilance plan and Ethics and Compliance program, ensure that the 

Group adhere to the EU Taxonomy “minimum safeguards” 

requirements referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.

2.2.8.4 Governance

The strategic part of the Human Rights policy as well as the 

measurement and its full deployment is led by the Corporate 

Citizenship Department, composed of Human Rights experts 

supported by Human Resources, Global Supply Chain 

Departments as well as the countries, the internal audit team and 

the compliance functions.

This policy is validated by the Chief Strategy and Sustainability 

officer, Chief Governance officer and Secretary General, the Chief 

Human Resources officer and the Executive Vice President Global 

Supply Chain. 

The Group has joined Entreprises pour les droits de l’Homme (EDH 

– Businesses for Human Rights), a leading French association of 

businesses providing its members with tools and advice on 

implementing the UNGPs. In 2018, Schneider Electric also joined 

the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a non-profit coalition of 

more than 120 companies from the electronic, retail, automobile, 

and leisure industries, for compliance with human rights and 

sharing best practices with regards to on-site auditing and 

monitoring of suppliers’ activity, including forced-labor issues.

The Group also took part in the Global Compact LEAD working 

group “Decent Work in Global Supply Chain”. Lastly, Schneider 

Electric co-leads the G7 Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) 

coalition’s “Advancing human rights in direct operations and supply 

chains” and “Building inclusive workplaces” working groups.

2.2.8.5 Controls, actions and impacts

Internal 

Schneider Electric entities and subsidiaries are monitored through 

the implementation of Key Internal Controls. These controls are 

designed in co-ordination with the Internal Audit team and consist 

of an annual self-assessment covering different operational topics. 

Human rights and health and safety controls are included in this 

annual review. The results of these assessments allow Schneider 

Electric to benchmark the entities and to prioritize mitigation plans 

when necessary.

Internal actions regarding respect and dignity, freedom of 

association, health and safety, working time and leave, wages and 

benefits, harassment, discrimination, diversity and inclusion, and 

development of competencies are described in section “2.5 Great 

People making Schneider Electric a great company”, page 198.

Schneider Electric is implementing training programs that are 

specific to the policies listed above, to raise the level of awareness 

of employees and give them advice on how to react or behave in 

specific situations. Some of these trainings are mandatory, others 

are part of recommended training paths. Such programs cover a 

very wide area of topics, from anti-harassment to well-being, how to 

overcome bias and how to develop an inclusive culture. For more 

details, see section 2.5.3 Talent attraction and development,  

page 211.

Specifically, for health and safety, the Group maintains a follow-up 

of safety metrics. Incidents are reviewed with management, 

corrective actions are implemented when necessary, and 

communications are sent to relevant teams throughout the 

Company. When needed, a global safety alert can be launched to 

alert all relevant employees. Schneider Electric organizes a yearly 

“Global Health & Safety Day”, to inform all employees and keep the 

level of awareness high on this key topic. For more details, see 

section “Employee health and safety”, page 127.

Suppliers

Human rights are included in the approach to select new suppliers. 

Schneider Electric uses a qualification process called Schneider 

Supplier Quality Management (SSQM) to select new suppliers. This 

is based on an evaluation questionnaire combined with on-site 

audits, which include human rights and health and safety 

assessments.

Schneider Electric’s Supplier Code of Conduct states the 

framework in which the Group wishes to operate with vendors. 

Schneider Electric expects suppliers to respect the fundamental 

principles on health, safety, people’s protection, and development 

as defined in this document. Strategic suppliers are also assessed 

through EcoVadis, a third party that leverages ISO 26000 standard, 

and includes Labor and Human rights as one of the four pillars in its 

methodology. Other actions are implemented through the Group’s 

vigilance plan. 

Lastly, Schneider Electric launched in 2022 a Decent Work 

Program (SSI #6) for the Group’s strategic suppliers (see more 

details page 142 to 143).

See more details about supplier programs in the 

Vigilance plan, and Sustainable relations with suppliers 

sections pages 130 to 144.

Consult and download Schneider Electric’s  

Supplier Code of Conduct from the Suppliers  

page on www.se.com

Contractors

Schneider Electric has developed specific actions to mitigate 

human rights risks related to project execution environment. These 

apply anywhere co-ordination with project contractors is 

necessary. 

The Group is working to evolve the project decision-making 

process to incorporate a risk assessment covering ESG topics 

including human rights. The aim is to better calibrate the mitigation 

measures and anticipate their implementation earlier in the project 

process. Pilots have been launched in 2022.

Schneider Electric is also conducting specific on-site audits for 

contractors included into the Vigilance Supplier Audit program. At 

the end of 2022, 17 subcontractors had been audited. For more 

details, see section “2.2.11 Relations with project execution 

contractors”, page 135.

Communities

The risks for these locations were assessed for the first time in 2020 

in the vigilance risk matrix. In 2021 Schneider Electric deepened 

the analysis with a specific segmentation to select potential risks 

that may have an impact on local communities. For more details, 

see section “2.2.13 Vigilance with local communities”, page 146.

2.2.9 Employee health and safety

2.2.9.1 Context

The world in which Schneider Electric operates is changing and 

many aspects of this change accelerated during the COVID-19 

pandemic. Health and Safety is a value Schneider Electric will not 

compromise, which was demonstrated by Health and Safety being 

one of the five Schneider Electric Trust Charter pillars and by 

setting ambitious 2025 Health & Safety Targets. 

The advances in digitization have made the world a smaller place, 

and it is now so much easier for H&S teams across the world to 

work together efficiently, to implement global solutions, including 

virtual audits, remote Factory Acceptance Testing, live 

performance dashboards and working from home. 

In a fast-changing environment, where so many communication 

opportunities are available to everyone, Schneider Electric H&S 

team is making the most of all the new technologies and innovative 

ideas, to convey its messages to all employees.

New technology also exists to identify ‘at risk situations’, and to 

warn employees about risks so they can take action to mitigate 

them. Schneider Electric is constantly exploring how these 

technologies can make the work environment safer. Schneider 

Electric has embedded new digital technologies in many products 

so customers can benefit from improved safety while operating 

their electrical equipment.

2.2.9.2 Risks and opportunities

Key Health & Safety risks include human injury connected with a 

workplace accident, and non-compliance with regulations. These 

risks can potentially impact productivity, customer confidence, 

company image or financial penalties through legal proceedings. 

At the same time, the effort taken to manage risks can create new 

business opportunities through greater trust.

Strategic action plans, based on previous incidents and results of 

risk analysis are performed each year. These plans include 

opportunities to reduce serious and fatal incidents, maintain legal 

compliance, provide safe working conditions, and encourage 

employee engagement in the safety processes. The plans are built 

on the previous Top 5 Hazards, which include driving, electrical, 

falls, powered industrial trucks (PIT), and fixed powered machines 

(FPM).

• Complies to external legal requirements and internal directives. 

• Embeds safety into its business practices and is an integral part 

of all major decisions, from acquisition, product development, 

the launch of a business and change management. 

• Is determined to eliminate hazards and reduce risks. 

The Group communicates in an open and transparent manner and:

• Continually improves its Safety & Occupational Health Systems 

by benchmarking, adopting best available techniques and 

through continuous learning.

• Captures, analyzes and communicates safety improvement 

opportunities, near-misses, and incidents in a systematic 

manner.

2.2.9.4 Strategy and action plan

The Schneider Electric H&S Strategy has been developed to 

deploy the Schneider Electric Health and Safety Policy.

The fundamentals of the Strategy are:

• “S.A.F.E. First” at its core, developed as a personal reminder to 

pause and reflect on safety before beginning any task. 

• Top five hazards, which have been identified and controlled to 

prevent serious accidents. 

• Five guiding principles, which have been defined to set the 

expected H&S behaviors.

• Four strategic priorities, which have been identified as strong 

levers to deliver the Schneider Electric Policy.

Guiding principles

S.A.F.E.
First

Each year a global action plan is generated by the H&S corporate 

team based on previous years’ performance and 2025 vision. In 

2023 the plan will cover the implementation of a new H&S software 

solution, a safe driving initiative, a program on high-risk activity and 

H&S training for front line managers. 

A local action plan, managed by each region, complements the 

global plan and includes the improvements identified by the 

Environment Health and Safety Assessment deployment, the IMS 

implementation and the Safety Culture assessment. In 2022 the 

Safety Culture assessment of Industrial and field service 

employees had a high engagement rate and employees responded 

positively to their sites Safety Culture. In 2023 the Safety Culture 

assessment will be extended to all Schneider Electric employees.

Communication is important to ensure that standards are known 

and implemented to provide a safe workplace for everyone and 

make safety performance visible, so that leaders can take action to 

continuously improve risk prevention. Each quarter, Schneider 

Electric focuses on key safety subjects (Quarterly H&S Spotlights) 

to raise awareness of both workplace and human factors. The 

campaign, promoting the importance of safety globally, is 

supported by training materials, posters, employee videos and a 

quarterly video message from Schneider Electric’s top leaders. 

Schneider Electric engages employees by using the internal social 

media tool, Yammer, to post H&S updates, interact with the 

community and collect feedback from employees. Schneider also 

encourages employees to report safety opportunities, which are 

translated into risk reduction actions to engage employees in the 

H&S program. In 2023, following the good employee engagement 

(1.5 safety opportunities reported per employee), the focus is now 

on the completion of improvement actions connected with the 

safety opportunities. 

2.2.9.5 Governance

Schneider Electric has a strong H&S governance in place with 

several instances of control to ensure the H&S strategy is fully 

deployed.

Steering Committees

Quarterly H&S Report to Executive level: 

A report is created each quarter by the Global H&S VP and 

presented to the Executive level. The report includes H&S 

performance versus targets and H&S program deployment update.

Monthly Global H&S Steering Committee

Each month the Global H&S team share H&S performance versus 

targets and H&S program deployment, with the Regional and 

Organizational H&S VP’s.

Audits & Engagement

Integrated Management System (IMS) – ISO 45001: The key 

elements of certification to ISO 45001 includes annual site 

management review and internal site audit program, and external 

audit program at site and corporate level. This certification is in 

place for 211 locations, including 176 manufacturing and logistics 

sites and the headquarter. 

Annual Environmental Health and Safety Assessments 

(EHSA): To ensure successful implementation of the strategy, 

annual EHSA are performed in industrial and customer facing sites 

worldwide, by the site Safety team and validated by the regional 

H&S specialist. This assessment is a global process which 

measures compliance against H&S directives and identifies 

improvement opportunities and recognizes excellence. The EHSA 

digital Tool has been deployed in manufacturing and logistics 

locations in 2022. 96% of sites have carried out a self-assessment 

and for 84% of sites the assessment has been validated by regional 

H&S expert.

2.2.9.6 H&S Performance Results 

In 2020, Schneider set a 5-year safety target to reduce the Medical 

Incident Rate (MIR) to 0.38 by 2025, from a 0.79 baseline in 2019. 

The Medical Incident Rate (MIR) is the number of work-related 

medical incidents (including injuries and occupational illnesses) 

multiplied by one million hours (average hours of 500 employees 

working for one calendar year) divided by the total hours worked. 

Work related injuries and occupational illnesses requiring medical 

treatment are included. Medical Incidents, where the Injured Party 

requires hospital treatment for 24hrs, are classified as Serious.

Trust

SSE #14

0.38 or below Medical Incident Rate

We believe that all accidents are preventable, and use the 

MIR indicator to measure progress made against this target. 

The Schneider Electric 2025 target of 0.38 MIR represents 1 

accident per 1,450 employees per year, which is a big step 

towards Schneider Electric’s ambition of 0 accidents. Every 

accident that Schneider Electric avoids, prevents pain and 

suffering that a Schneider Electric employee and their 

friends and family would have experienced.

0.380.79

2019 Baseline 2025 target2022 Progress

0.58

The MIR performance has reduced to 0.58 in 2022, which 

represents a 51% progress of the 2021–2025 program. 2022 was 

the best performance ever showing a MIR reduction of 11% 

compared to 2021, this translates to 171 medical incidents, of which 

9 were classified as serious without any fatal accidents.

As a result of all the H&S programs deployed over the last 8 years, 

Schneider Electric has been very successful in meeting goals for 

the reduction of workplace injuries and illnesses, including those 

injuries resulting in lost time days. The frequency of incidents 

(Medical Incident Rate, MIR) has reduced by 69% and the severity 

of incidents (Lost Time Incident Rate, LTIR) by 66%.

2.2.9.8 Future evolution of safety at 
Schneider Electric

Safety is a never-ending journey towards excellence. Schneider 

Electric’s vision is for all employees and contractors to work in a 

safe and healthy workplace, so they can perform to their full 

potential, positively impacting safety for its customers, and 

therefore always returning home safely to their family.

This translates into the following health and safety three-year 

improvement plan:

• To strengthen H&S knowledge, skills, and abilities of all 

employees and contractors.

• To equip all leaders to role model H&S at every opportunity and 

encourage employees to speak up and engage in safety 

program.

• To accelerate transformation with digitization, data analytics and 

promote local innovation to accelerate H&S maturity.

• To develop and implement effective controls for high-risk 

activities and to sustain a safe workplace for everyone.

• To positively impact all stakeholders through effective 

communications.

2.2.10 Vigilance plan

2.2.10.1 Context

Schneider Electric seeks to be a role model in its interactions with 

customers, partners, suppliers, and communities when it comes to 

ethics and the respect and promotion of human rights. The Group 

also strives to have a positive impact on the planet and the 

environment by contributing to finding solutions to limit climate 

change, and by trying to be more efficient with natural resources.

The Group’s vigilance plan reflects this ambition. It also complies 

with the provisions of the 2017 French law on Corporate duty of 

vigilance. The plan includes:

• A risk analysis specific to vigilance risks that Schneider Electric 

poses to the ecosystem and environment (ie externalities)

• A review of the key actions implemented to remediate or mitigate 

these risks;

• An alert system;

• Governance specific to vigilance.

In this Registration document, Schneider Electric reviews the risk 

analysis and describes the actions that mitigate these risks. 

Readers are also directed to other sections of the report for relevant 

and detailed information. For more comprehensive and complete 

information, the full vigilance plan of the Group is available as a 

standalone document and can be downloaded from Schneider 

Electric’s website at se.com.

  Consult and download Schneider Electric’s Vigilance report 

on www.se.com

2.2.10.2 Group policy

Duty of Vigilance is a notion that has been evolving significantly 

over the recent years. In 2017, a French law was introduced, that 

applies to large multinational companies. In 2023, a similar law will 

be implemented by Germany and Norway. In 2023 also, a draft for 

a European directive on vigilance will be presented to the European 

Parliament for a probable vote in the same year, and a transposition 

in local laws for each EU member state starting in 2024.

The objective of Schneider Electric is not only to respect these 

national laws but also to be at the forefront of the notion of vigilance, 

and to implement the actions that will contribute to significantly 

reduce the risk for its ecosystem, whether these actions are part of 

a law, or part of Schneider Electric’s own ambition.

2.2.10.3 Governance

The plan is governed by the Duty of Vigilance Committee, set up in 

2017. The steering committee meets twice a year in normal 

circumstances. Overall, since its inception, 15 Committee meetings 

have been held (five in 2017, and two per year in 2018, 2019, 2020, 

2021 and 2022). The Committee’s objective is to provide a 

discussion on strategic orientation and prioritize initiatives and the 

resources allocated to their implementation. This Committee also 

reviews the actions in progress and their results and defines 

decisions on next steps for action.

2.2.10.4 Vigilance risk assessment

Methodology

Schneider Electric has developed a specific vigilance risk matrix, 

using a methodology consistent with other risk evaluations 

maintained at Group level but focused specifically on adverse 

impacts Schneider has or may have on its environment and 

ecosystem. The methodology is based on interviews with internal 

experts from areas such as Health & Safety, Social Relations, and 

Data Privacy. In 2021, Schneider expanded the scope of the risk 

mapping to local communities living close to Schneider locations 

and customer project sites. In 2022, Schneider initiated specific 

workshops that include members of the European Work Council. 

The conclusions of the workshops will be integrated into the 2023 

risk evaluation. This process will gradually include other 

stakeholders, both internal and external.

The scope of work covers Schneider Electric and its subsidiaries, 

joint ventures, suppliers, and subcontractors. A review of the 

downstream supply chain is carried out for a sample of large 

customer projects.

Risk categories 

Four risk categories have been identified and for a more granular 

assessment of the risk level based on the nature of that risk and the 

magnitude of its impact on Schneider Electric’s ecosystem, each 

category has been divided into specific risk areas.

Overall, these risk areas cover more than 60 natures of risk and 

were selected from a saliency perspective. However, to simplify the 

reading, they have been grouped into the following sections that 

are synthesized as below.

Human rights:

• Decent workplace

• Health and safety

Environment:

• Pollution and specific substances management

• Waste and circularity

• Energy, CO
2
, and GHG

Business conduct:

• Ethical business conduct

• Alert system, protection, and non-retaliation

Offer safety and cybersecurity:

• Offer safety

• Cybersecurity and data privacy

Risk location

The Group has focused on four areas where risks may occur:

• Schneider Electric sites: these have been segmented based 

on categories that present a specific level of risk. For example, 

office buildings, R&D laboratories and production factories each 

carry a different level of risk.

• Suppliers: the level of risk differs based on the type of process 

and technologies used, and the Group has therefore segmented 

the analysis by component category of purchase. The risk level 

is an average assessment. The geographical location is 

factored in when selecting suppliers for the audit plan;

• Contractors: when implementing a customer project, such as 

building a large electrical system at a customer’s site, Schneider 

Electric works with contractors, leveraging their expertise (civil 

work, electrical contracting, etc.). This “off-site” project work 

bears specific risks for contractors. A separate “off-site and 

projects execution” category for contractors has therefore been 

defined for the assessment.

• Local Communities: Schneider Electric has identified two 

distinct segments: communities located around Schneider 

Electric sites and communities located around customer project 

sites. Communities have been assessed against three risk 

categories: human rights, environment, and business ethics.

Risk evaluation and scale

The evaluation combines the probability of occurrence of the risk, 

with the seriousness of potential impacts. The risk level displayed in 

the matrix is an evaluation before impact of mitigation actions 

(“gross risk”). After taking into consideration the impact of these 

mitigation actions, the level of risk may be significantly reduced. 

However, this “net risk” is not reported in the matrix. Risks are 

assessed on the following scale:

1 – Non-existent; 2 – Low; 3 – Medium; 4 – High; 5 – Very high.

In this 2022 risk assessment, no “very high” risks were identified.

Key findings

The overall risk mapping exercise across Schneider’s value chain is 

detailed in the matrix below, and can be summarized as follows:

Medium to high risk: Suppliers

Schneider uses a large panel of suppliers across different 

geographies in the world: more than 53,000 in the first tier, and 

several million at the level of tier 2 and above. 

 − Human Rights have been identified as a key risk, especially 

in countries where labor laws and social protection are below 

average standards. The areas of concern are mostly around 

safety at work, decent workplace and labor standards. The 

most frequent issues detected by Schneider’s audits are 

related to decent working hours, paid leave and proper 

resting time;

 − CO
2
 emissions coming from the transformation of raw 

materials into components, and then the transportation of 

these components, have been identified as an area of risk. 

This risk is quantified in the Scope 3 “upstream” analysis of 

the company’s carbon footprint;

 − A few very specific pollution risks are linked with some 

categories of purchases, due to the nature of substances 

used (solvents, Greenhouse gases, etc…).

2.2 Driving responsible business with Trust

Medium to high risk: Contractors

Among Schneider’s 53,000 tier 1 suppliers, 9,900 are off-site 

contractors (or otherwise called solutions suppliers), working on the 

construction sites for customer projects. Key risks identified are:

 − Health and Safety has been identified as a high risk, mostly 

linked to the physical injuries that can happen during 

construction, or when doing services and maintenance 

operations. Some of the risks are specific to the presence of 

electrical equipment, and some other risks are more general 

to a construction site.

 − Business Ethics is also identified as a risk due to the 

contractual nature of this activity. Specifically, corruption, 

conflict of interest and integrity are the most salient subjects.

 − Human Rights is an area of concern, as these contractors 

often resort to temporary manpower, contracted for the 

duration of the construction at conditions that may not 

respect decent work standards. In several countries, this 

manpower is also coming from other countries of origin, 

therefore at risk of being forced labor or in the difficult 

condition of migrant workers.

Low to medium risk: Schneider entities and sites 

Schneider Electric is operating in 100+ countries, with 162 

production factories, 84 distribution centers, and about 800 

commercial offices and R&D laboratories. The risk evaluation for 

these locations has been assessed from low to medium, with the 

exception of cybersecurity, which is considered high (see below).

 − Health and Safety risks mostly concern production sites, 

especially when the components or equipment manufactured 

are heavy (medium voltage activities) or when electrical tests 

are being performed (project execution centers). The risk is 

also concentrated on the service teams, as their activity is 

performed on customer sites, and in the frequent presence 

of powered electrical systems.

 − Human rights concerns are linked to working hours and 

business pressure, these two subjects also being linked to 

social dialogue. Following the challenge of COVID-19, supply 

chain disruptions have left little room for teams to rest, 

therefore increasing the overall fatigue, and its 

consequences on mental health. 

Specific situation of cybersecurity on Schneider Electric sites 

and systems: as Schneider is a supplier of connected components 

and software for complex, digital solutions, the company is a 

potential target for cyberattacks aimed at reaching its customer’s 

systems. Therefore, Schneider considers this risk as high, and top 

of the agenda for its support to customers.

Low to medium risk: local communities

The ongoing risk evaluation for communities living around 

Schneider Electric sites (factories, offices) demonstrates that the 

level of risk is mostly low to medium, as Schneider Electric 

operations are usually located in large, well-structured urban areas. 

A very limited number of production sites may be an exception to 

this, and they are the subject of a specific review.

As regards customer projects, the review of a sample of large 

projects shows that in most instances, impacts on local 

communities are limited. However, in a few specific cases, 

interactions with communities are significant, and require greater 

attention. As these projects are usually very different from one 

another, a “customized” approach is necessary, both for risk 

evaluation, and selection of mitigation actions.

Special mention of Carbon emissions for customers 
(scope 3)

Since the beginning of the vigilance plan in 2017, the focus has 

been on Schneider operations, on the upstream supply chain and 

the transformation programs associated (supplier vigilance, 

contractors, The Zero Carbon Project, Decent Work, etc.). The 

downstream part of the supply chain has not yet been the subject 

of an evaluation from a Human Rights perspective. However it has 

been analyzed from the perspective of climate and CO
2
 emissions. 

Scope 3 carbon emissions have been quantified, and several major 

action plans are deployed as part of Schneider’s Net-Zero 

Commitment. Schneider considers that acting on carbon and 

climate are key responsibilities of the company. The Duty of 

Vigilance section does not provide details of these measures. For 

more information, please see the description of the program 

included in Chapter 2.3 “Leading on decarbonization”, page 148.

Comparison of the 2022 analysis with 2021:

The following items have evolved:

 − Psycho-social risks are increasing. Although this is difficult to 

quantify, the impact of a complex business environment and 

the pressure it entails is having consequences on employee 

well-being and mental health, This subject is carefully 

monitored at global and local level;

 − Business Ethics is also at risk due to the highly competitive 

pressure commercial teams are facing;

Given the increasing complexity of regulatory environment, 

combined with the increased sophistication of the Group’s software 

and systems, the subject of data privacy (employees and 

customers) is also the subject of specific attention; 

Schneider is using an independent database and risk assessment 

methodology for its suppliers from the Responsible Business 

Alliance (RBA). In 2022, RBA reviewed some of the parameters 

used in its database. Some of the adjustments are merely 

“technical”, and some others reflect a slight degradation of risk 

parameters for specific categories of suppliers. The consequence 

for Schneider is that the number of “risky suppliers” increased from 

1,300 to 3,000. In response, Schneider’s on-site supplier audit 

program remains focused on the top 1,300 risky suppliers. The 

1,700 remaining suppliers are covered by the digital self-

assessment tool; which allows to monitor suppliers that may 

become eligible for an on-site audit (see more details in the section 

“Vigilance plan for suppliers” later in this report).

2023 German Law on Supply Chain Due Diligence: Schneider 

Electric has significant operations in Germany and is subject to the 

new vigilance law that came into force in January 2023. The 

specific requirements of this law are being integrated into the 

global Vigilance Plan.

2.2.11 Relationships with project execution contractors

2.2.11.1 Context

Schneider Electric’s products and solutions are usually combined 

into larger systems such as electricity distribution and energy 

management in a building, or production process automation in a 

factory. The building of such systems can be complex and typically 

involves several different parties before they are commissioned by 

end customers. 

For Schneider Electric, there are two options: to sell components 

through channel partners who take the responsibility to build and 

deliver the system; or to build and deliver the system directly for the 

end customer, as a project. This second option requires 

coordinating several project contractors (panel manufacturers, 

system integrators, building contractors, etc.), usually on the 

premises of the end customer. The common characteristics of 

these projects are that they happen primarily off-site (mostly on 

customer premises, existing or future), and they involve several 

different parties, global or local, bringing their added value. Each 

project is unique in its size, duration, and location. 

Therefore, relationships with contractors are specific to a contract, 

and not necessarily recurrent. In 2022, Schneider Electric worked 

with approximately 10,000 solution suppliers in the Group’s 

portfolio (with a total spend of approximately €1 billion please note 

that not all of them may be simultaneously active during a year).

2.2.11.2 Risks and opportunities

Human Rights: as project sites are located in countries where 

Schneider Electric may not be present, and involve independent 

subcontractors, there is a risk that the standard policies 

recommended by Schneider Electric in terms of health and safety, 

as well as decent workplace, may not be properly implemented. 

The main risks are physical accidents and injuries, or the improper 

treatment of employees (wages and salaries, resting time), 

especially temporary and/or foreign employees.

Business Ethics: Projects that are conducted in countries where 

business ethics standards are insufficient may be subject to ethical 

risks such as corruption, bribery, or pressures of a similar nature.

Cybersecurity: Some subcontractors may have digital interactions 

with the end customer and Schneider Electric at the same time. 

Therefore, their level of cybersecurity and data protection may 

create some risks for the project and the final customer.

A rigorous management of subcontractors supports a reduction in 

risks of incidents or accidents on site, and therefore protects 

workers, the communities living around the project site, and the 

final customer’s employees and assets.

2.2.11.3 Group policy and governance

In 2021, to further anticipate and reinforce its risk mitigation 

measures, the Group introduced an evolution of its project 

decision-making process. The aim is to include a risk assessment 

of human rights and environmental impacts at all key milestones of 

the process, and to select the mitigation measures that will enable 

Schneider Electric to reduce these risks. During the execution of 

the project, a regular review of the efficiency and effectiveness of 

these measures will be conducted. This process evolution has 

been implemented in pilot mode to project reviews in 2022, on a 

selection of projects based on their size. The process will be 

gradually enlarged based on the pilot’s result. 

The overall governance for this topic is under the responsibility of 

the Duty of Vigilance steering committee. The implementation of 

actions is a joint responsibility between procurement teams and 

global customer projects teams.

2.2.11.4 Actions and impacts

Out of the 10,000 solutions suppliers, Schneider Electric has 

identified about 130 solution suppliers categorized as “high risk”. 

Since 2018, around 80 of those suppliers have been audited, with 

17 audits performed in 2022 leading to Schneider raising 190 

non-conformances. Out of these non-conformances, 7 were 

assessed as “top priority” for two suppliers.

The most recurring non-conformances with high-risk solution 

contractors are related to labor, in particular terms of working 

contract which needs to be provided in writing and in workers’ 

native language, and working hours which need to be better 

controlled not to exceeding standard.

As a consequence of 2022 audits, it has been decided to stop 

business with one solution supplier.

In addition to these non-conformances, specific risks related to 

local contract negotiation and relations with local authorities may 

occur.

Actions following non-conformances are the same as with other 

suppliers (re-audits, trainings, workshops). Specific measures are 

implemented for this project environment: Schneider Electric 

implements regular reviews of safety incidents on customers’ sites, 

involving the Global Safety team and the Project Management 

leadership. The Group has also reinforced training on Anti-

Corruption and Business Agent policies for its employees involved 

in commercial negotiations. The project follow-up with contractors 

and the selection processes for contractors have been adapted to 

ensure vigilance topics are considered early in the project stage.

2.2.12 Sustainable relationships with suppliers

2.2.12.1 Context 

Schneider Electric is the most local of global companies, with a 

presence in more than 100+ countries and a revenue and 

employee footprint almost evenly distributed across major 

geographies. While this provides a balanced market position, it 

also results in a supply base that is almost evenly distributed 

across the world. In 2022, Schneider Electric sourced goods and 

services from more than 53,000 suppliers, across more than 60 

categories amounting to approximately €16 billion. This diverse 

supply base represents a unique combination of mature companies 

operating on a global scale, to small & medium scale enterprises 

serving local or niche markets and categories which require simple 

assembly to complex manufacturing activities. Deeply committed 

to advance all UN SDGs, and delivering solutions for sustainability 

and efficiency, Schneider Electric is in a unique position to 

influence and support its supply chain partners to progress and 

embrace more sustainable social and environmental practices.

2.2.12.2 Risks and opportunities

Owing to the location, size and nature of the Group’s operations, its 

operating environment is directly impacted by climate change, 

resource scarcity and human rights issues across its global supply 

base. While the impact of Schneider’s own operations is relatively 

limited, the footprint of its wider supply chain is more significant 

and affected by the evolving trends. As an example, GHG 

emissions from its upstream supply chain is estimated to be 25 

times higher than its operations emissions. 

By taking a combined approach to proactively managing upstream 

supplier risks through Schneider Electric’s Vigilance plan, while 

also driving ambitious Sustainable Development programs and 

processes, Schneider Electric secures its business resilience and 

increases its attractivity to customers, investors or new talents. 

Key risks identified by the Vigilance risk assessment include human 

rights (in particular safety at work, decent workplace and labor 

standards), CO
2
 emissions (especially coming from the 

transformation of raw materials into components and their 

transport), and pollution risks linked with some specific purchases 

categories.

2.2.12.3 Group policy and governance

Our global procurement mission aims to strongly align with our 

company strategy of delivering customer value through 

transformation of energy management. We will do this by 

contributing to top line and bottom line growth, while establishing a 

leadership position in sustainable sourcing. Our key priorities of 

Quality, Innovation, Cost, Cash and Sustainability are strongly 

supported by our people, our Tailored, Connected, Sustainable 

Supply Chain and Digitization. As a key part of our end-to-end 

supply chain, we count on our suppliers to be strong contributors 

across all aspects of performance.

Schneider Electric embeds sustainability at every stage of supplier 

lifecycle. It starts with the mission of the global procurement 

organization, which embodies sustainability in its core. In addition 

to top line growth and bottom-line impact, sustainability in sourcing 

operations is one of the three key enablers for procurement 

function and firmly institutionalized. 

In order to sensitize all current and potential suppliers about 

expectations and various stages of collaboration with Schneider 

Electric, a Guide Book is documented, initially launched in 2016 

and updated regularly. The document articulates expectations for 

suppliers on sustainable development in the following five areas: 

environment, fair and ethical business practices, sustainable 

procurement, labor practices, and human rights and subsequently 

dwells on various stages for approval, qualification, and 

performance evaluation.

Supplier collaboration steps

Schneider Electric deploys a three-step process comprising of 

Supplier Approval Module (SAM), Supplier Qualification Module 

(SQM) and Supplier Performance Module (SPM), to qualify new and 

legacy suppliers for continued business association, where 

Sustainability performance is a key evaluation criteria. 

Supplier Approval Module (SAM)

The journey of a new supplier starts with the SAM. This module has 

a dedicated evaluation on labor, ethics, environment, and 

occupational health & safety, in addition to other elements. It is a 

questionnaire-based evaluation combined with on-site audits by 

Schneider Electric auditors. For all new suppliers, it is mandatory to 

undergo this evaluation and only approved partners can proceed 

to next stage of functional and technical audits required for 

business qualification. Legacy suppliers are also required to 

periodically renew the approval module. 

Supplier Risk Management (SRiM)

The SAM assessment results have an impact on the overall risk 

profile of the supplier managed by the SRiM process. Suppliers 

with low and medium risk are favored for business association, and 

those with high risk are requested to work on risk mitigation plan. 

Supplier Qualification Module (SQM)

Post the successful approval module the suppliers undergo SQM, 

which evaluates the technical feasibility with respect to the 

supplies, and after successful completion the supplier can begin 

the commercial association by supplying products to Schneider 

Electric.

Supplier Performance Module (SPM)

During the commercial stage the performance of supplier is 

constantly evaluated by the SPM. Different functional teams 

evaluate different performance parameters, including sustainability 

as one of the pillars and the overall performance has an impact on 

the nature of business relationship (strategic or non-strategic).

The results of approval and performance evaluation are available in 

real time on the Schneider Electric supplier portal (SSP-SRM) and 

are accessible to global supply chain community, making supplier 

interactions/decisions more fluid and preventing any supplier with 

poor sustainability performance from entering into the supply base. 

The supplier performance is tracked by Schneider Electric supplier 

leaders on a monthly or pluri-annual basis depending on the 

severity of the risks and classification of the supplier. All business 

reviews with suppliers and internal functional business reviews with 

department Executives cover the sustainability performance as a 

key criteria of evaluation. 

General Procurement Terms and Conditions 

All Schneider Electric suppliers must abide by the General 

Procurement Terms and Conditions: each supplier undertakes to 

apply the principles and guidelines of the ISO 26000, the rules 

defined in the ISO 14001 standard. 

Suppliers also commit to respect all national legislation / 

regulations, REACH regulation, RoHS directives, and, more 

generally, the laws and regulations relating to the prohibition or 

restriction of use of certain products or substances. Lastly, 

suppliers are expected to report the presence and country of origin 

of any and all conflict minerals supplies in accordance with the 

requirements of the US Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 known as the 

“Conflict Minerals” law. In this context, Schneider Electric has a 

“conflict-free” objective.

  Consult and download Schneider General 

Procurement Terms and Conditions from the 

Suppliers page on www.se.com

Supplier Code of Conduct

The foundation of Schneider Electric’s sustainability ambition is its 

own Supplier Code of Conduct. It is the mother document of all 

supplier relationships and lists out the basic expectations with its 

suppliers across, but not limited to, environment, human rights and 

decent work, fair business practices, sustainability procurements, 

occupation health and safety. The document also provides access 

to remedy by means of Trust Line, which is the ethics hotline of 

Schneider Electric. Any partner can access this help line to raise 

concern associated with ethical or sustainability standards with 

respect to business association. The Supplier Code of Conduct is 

also included in General Terms & Conditions, and in all other 

contractual documents. 

  Consult and download Schneider Supplier Code of Conduct 

from the Suppliers page on www.se.com

2.2.12.4 Sustainable Procurement 
framework and strategy

Schneider Electric has deployed a Sustainable Procurement 

Framework, which institutionalizes strong governance mechanism 

to proactively screen, identify and mitigate sustainability risk from 

suppliers and embed preventive controls into the procurement 

processes and integrate in the day-to-day operations. This ensures 

sustainability is embedded in the routine operational activities of all 

procurement team working around the world. 

The framework also identifies thematic areas across ESG 

spectrum, where Schneider Electric has material impact and can 

play an industry transforming role. Collaborating and engaging with 

supply partners to develop maturity on climate action, circularity, 

human rights and challenging status-quo allows to unlock newer 

areas of growth. The Group’s ambitious sustainability roadmap 

leads its partners to define the next wave of evolution of industry, 

making them fore-runners who shape the future. This pursuit of 

sustainability helps identify new and several hidden avenues of 

efficiency, operational improvement and creating and capturing 

new markets, which provide competitive advantage and positively 

corelate with financial performance. All engagements within 

Schneider Electric and its supply base establish that sustainability 

is good for business and has to be looked at as an opportunity.

2.2.12.5 Vigilance plan for suppliers

Supplier risk categories and audit plan

In order to evaluate and mitigate the sustainability risk from its 

global suppliers, Schneider Electric conducts a risk evaluation of its 

entire supply base on an annual basis. This evaluation covers 

sustainability risks and specific parameters such as the type of 

industrial process used by the suppliers, their technology, and the 

geographic location. This allows the Group to factor in risks that 

may arise from a country’s specific situation (social, political, etc.). 

These parameters are compiled in a third-party independent 

database (Responsible Business Alliance methodology, RBA, 

ex-EICC, of which Schneider Electric has been a member since 

January 2018). Schneider Electric’s entire network of about 53,000 

tier 1 suppliers is processed through this methodology and is 

refreshed every year with the new supplier baseline in order to 

identify high risk suppliers.

Overall plan

The audit plan started in 2018. 2020 was the third year of 

implementation and Schneider Electric completed 3 years 

schedule with 374 audits.

From 2021 to 2025, Schneider Electric has defined new objectives 

as part of its sustainability strategy: expanding from the previous 

plan, the Group set an objective to conduct 1,000 on-site audits of 

high-risk suppliers and deploy 3,000 self-assessment audits for 

other suppliers not in the high-risk category. This audit plan is 

integrated into the Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE #17) 

and progress is externally assured and published each year.

For the Group’s 2022 plan, about 1,300 “high risk” suppliers have 

been identified; this number varies depending on the year.

On-site audits

Schneider Electric’s on-site audit questionnaire and audit 

methodology are fully aligned with the RBA framework. The RBA 

framework is linked to the Duty of Vigilance risk matrix categories 

as follow:

• Human Rights and decent workplace: 36 questions

• Health and safety: 40 questions

• Environment: 21 questions

• Offer Safety: non-applicable in RBA framework. More details 

about Schneider’s quality strategy are provided in section “2.2.6 

High standards for the quality and safety of our products” page 

119.

• Business Conduct: 11 questions

• Cybersecurity: non-applicable in RBA framework. More details 

about Schneider’s end-to-end cybersecurity approach are 

provided in section “2.2.7 Digital trust and security” page 122.

• In 2022, despite COVID-19 travel restrictions during the first part 

of the year, notably in Asia, the Group conducted 223 initial 

on-site audits with suppliers (audits conducted for the first time 

with a supplier). These audits allow Schneider Electric to identify 

non-conformances and request the supplier to implement 

corrective actions. Re-audits were then conducted to review the 

corrective actions implemented to remediate non-conformances 

identified during the initial audit and validate the closure.

Information and findings regarding on-site audits with new 

suppliers are described below.

Most non-conformance in 2022 were related to health and safety, 

labor standards and management systems (32%, 27%, and 23% 

respectively). Graph 3 provides the breakdown of non-

conformances by topic and graph 4 by geography.

For the most serious non-conformances, each case is escalated is 

to the Chief Procurement Officer level. An analysis of the 172 “top 

priorities” raised in 2022 shows the following issues are the most 

recurring:

• Labor standards (47% of top priority non-conformance issues): 

lack of respect of working time and resting days (time 

measurement systems are often insufficient); poor overtime 

reporting and payment; lack of formalization of working 

contracts.

• Health and safety (44% of top priority non-conformance issues): 

weak emergency procedures; insufficient emergency training 

issues and preparation drills; insufficient fire alarm and 

protection systems; lack of medical response equipment

• Environment and management systems (9% of top priorities): 

lack of administrative compliance, management tools, and 

systems; and insufficient waste management and pollution 

prevention systems.

As of end of 2022, Schneider Electric has closed 90% of 2021 and 

28% of 2022 non-conformances (all types). Schneider Electric’s 

approach is to help suppliers remediate the issues by sharing good 

practices and providing them with guidance and training. When 

non-conformances are not remediated (mainly top priorities), 

escalation to the Chief Procurement Officer may lead to the end of 

the business relationship. In 2022, two relationships with suppliers 

were terminated, including a contractor for project execution.

In 2022, Schneider Electric implemented a program to review a 

selected number of audits that were carried out in previous years to 

review whether the non-conformances resolution measures were 

still in place and durable. So far, no major drift has been identified, 

confirming the efficiency of the program.

Self-assessments

In 2021, a specific self-assessment questionnaire was developed, 

building on the experiences of on-site audits performed during 

previous years. Among the questions asked, the core ones aim to 

check whether the suppliers are compliant on mandatory subjects 

of labor, human rights, environment, and health and safety. The two 

main goals of this assessment are to help the supplier to reflect on 

its compliance to vigilance standards, and for Schneider Electric to 

identify whether on-site audits may be necessary.

Trust

SSE #17

4,000 suppliers assessed under our 
‘Vigilance Program’

Overall, the resolution of non-conformances identified 

since the program’s inception in 2017 has supported the 

improvement of the working conditions for 250,000 

employees.

•  Decent Work: during an audit, Schneider Electric 

identified a medium size company active in plastic 

molding that did not correctly pay overtime to workers. 

The overtime was measured, but not paid in full as it 

should have been. The supplier acknowledged the 

situation and proceeded to recalculate the amounts due. 

Two months after the audit, the situation was corrected. 

After the re-audit, Schneider Electric validated the 

resolution, and the non-conformance was closed. The 

supplier now precisely tracks the working hours and 

makes payment of overtime at the legal rate.

•  Health & Safety: during an audit, Schneider Electric’s 

auditor noticed that the fire alarm/fire detection system 

was not operative. An analysis of the root cause showed 

that the emergency activation point was blocked. The 

supplier worked with its safety contractor to analyze the 

root cause, and subsequently implement remediation 

actions. A comprehensive maintenance plan was 

implemented following this event. After two months, a 

reaudit was carried out to verify compliance and 

Schneider Electric decided to close the 

nonconformance.

During 2021, 624 suppliers submitted answers, and 657 in 2022. 

Procurement teams reviewed the answers and identified a few 

suppliers where on-site audits were conducted to ensure suppliers 

have implemented corrective actions.

In order to reinforce the co-ordination between Schneider Electric 

teams and suppliers on vigilance topics, a specific training 

program has been implemented. The primary target audience is 

the Schneider Electric Procurement team, and the training modules 

aim to increase their knowledge on the nature of risks, so they can 

integrate these topics early in the discussions with suppliers. At the 

end of 2022, approximately 800 employees have taken this training. 

These trainings combine in-class experience with e-learning 

sessions.

To raise suppliers’ awareness, improve their ability to identify risks 

earlier, and implement mitigation solutions, Schneider Electric 

organized face-to-face workshops dedicated to vigilance subjects. 

At the end of 2022, approximately 1,000 supplier team members 

had attended these events. These sessions include in-class 

face-to-face workshops and digital webinars.

Impact

From the beginning of the program in 2017 to the end of 2022, 

about 800 suppliers had been audited on site, and 10,000+ 

non-conformances were raised, and subsequently remediated. 

Most were related to health and safety and labor issues. Among the 

most serious ones are issues of fire safety, protection of workers 

from accidents and injuries, respect of a decent working time 

including proper resting periods and payment of overtime.

Schneider Electric is well on track to reach the new target. The 223 

on site audits performed in 2022 have allowed Schneider to raise 

2,700+ non-conformances. Out of these non-conformances, 170+ 

are assessed as “top priority” and are given very specific attention 

during the re-audits of the suppliers. Schneider Electric’s objective 

is to close 100% of all types of non-conformances identified, 

whatever their priority level.

2.2.12.6 Promotion of a continuous 
improvement process based on the ISO 
26000 standard for strategic suppliers

Sustainable development is one of the pillars to measure supplier 

performance, allowing the highest-performing suppliers to become 

and remain “strategic” suppliers. Performance resulting from the 

EcoVadis / ISO26000 evaluation is a key element of the sustainable 

development strategy and SRiM process. The results of the 

assessment are an integral part of the business reviews scheduled 

between buyers and suppliers on a quarterly to yearly basis. The 

goal is to share with suppliers all improvement plans to put in place 

before next assessment, in order to improve all aspects of their 

sustainability posture, based on facts and clear recommendations.

The Group has set out to engage all its strategic suppliers in a 

process of continuous improvement in sustainability. At the end of 

2022, strategic suppliers represented c. 55% of Schneider 

Electric’s purchases volume. Strategic suppliers who have passed 

the third-party evaluation process cover 70%+ of total strategic 

purchasing volume.

In 2018, the Group took on the ambitious target of achieving +5 

points out of 100 in the average ISO 26000 assessment score of its 

strategic suppliers between 2018 and 2020 as part of the SSI. In 

2019, this target was raised to +5.5 points. At the end of 2020, +6.3 

points were achieved, with an average of 57.4 points.

The new ambition for 2021 – 2025 is to raise the bar even higher to 

achieve an average of 65 points within 5 years.

2021 end of year result was +1.3 points with an average of 58.7 

points, and , the target set at +1.6 points was achieved, so to reach 

60.3/100 average score. Overall, since end 2017 the average 

ISO26000 score of Schneider’s strategic suppliers has increased 

by more than 9 points.

mature than the global average.

2.2.12.7 Conflict Minerals program

In August 2012, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 

adopted the Conflict Minerals rule as part of the Wall Street Reform 

and Consumer Protection Act. As defined by the legislation, “conflict 

minerals” include the metals tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold, often 

called “3TG”, which are the extracts of the minerals cassiterite, 

columbite-tantalite, and wolframite, respectively. The legislation 

focuses on the sourcing of these minerals to be “DRC conflict free” – 

meaning when these minerals were extracted, they did not directly or 

indirectly benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo 

(DRC) and adjoining countries. This rule requires companies to 

conduct a “reasonable country of minerals’ origin inquiry” and due 

diligence to determine whether “conflict minerals”, as defined in the 

rule, are used in their supply chain.

Although the US SEC Conflict Minerals rule does not apply directly 

to Schneider Electric – since it is not registered with the US SEC – it 

is deeply concerned about social and environmental conditions in 

some mines that could supply metals for its products. As part of the 

Group’s sustainable business practices, it is committed to 

increasing its responsible metal sourcing efforts.

In working towards these commitments, Schneider Electric has 

taken numerous steps including:

• Updating its Procurement Terms and Conditions to reflect its 

expectations of suppliers.

• Establishing a “Conflict Minerals Compliance program” 

supported and sponsored by its top leadership. This program 

was developed based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance 

for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict 

Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRA) and other appropriate 

international standards, which covers a wider scope of minerals 

and countries.

• Identifying the use of conflict minerals in its products.

• Engaging with its suppliers so that they respond in a timely 

manner to its requests for evidence of compliance.

• Participating in smelter outreach program.

Schneider Electric is working with an expert third party, collecting 

information from its suppliers to identify the source of the minerals 

in question and ensure they are recognized as “conflict-free” within 

established international standards such as the Responsible 

Minerals Initiative (RMI), the London Bullion Market Association 

(LBMA), and others. The Group is aware of the complexity of this 

task, and that it will take time to collect the required information, but 

it is committed to contributing to this responsible sourcing initiative 

as well as responding to its customers’ potential concerns.

At the end of 2022, 88% of the smelters and refiners identified in 

Schneider Electric’s supply chain were designated as compliant 

with a recognized third-party validation scheme or actively 

engaging in same approach (equivalent to approximately 67% of 

the relevant spend being compliant). The reduction of 14% points is 

due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and the campaign is still 

ongoing, and the Group is still working on eliminating all unwanted 

smelters from its supply chain. At the time of the creation of this 

report the due diligence process is still ongoing and the campaign 

will close at the end of February 2023. Schneider Electric is actively 

working with its suppliers and closely monitors its supply chain to 

comply with the Conflict Minerals regulations and meet the 

Customers’ expectations as much as possible. Based on current 

knowledge, the Group has no reason to believe that any conflict 

minerals the Group sourced, have directly or indirectly financed or 

benefitted armed conflict in the covered countries, nor supported 

illegally operating or sanctioned entities.

on www.se.com

Cobalt and Mica program

Mid-2020, Schneider Electric added cobalt to its Conflict Minerals 

Compliance program and added Mica in 2021, shifting to Extended 

Minerals Program. Cobalt and Mica sales have been identified as 

potentially funding or supporting inhumane treatment, including 

human trafficking, slavery, forced labor, child labor, torture, and war 

crimes in known CAHRA. These areas are identified by the 

presence of armed conflict, widespread violence, or other risks of 

harm to people, and are often characterized by widespread human 

rights abuses and violations of national or international law.

The program is focusing on the responsible sourcing of cobalt used 

as a key element for lithium-ion batteries in Schneider Electric’s 

supply chain. With 64% data collected (that is relevant to 90% of 

the spend of selected suppliers), 100% of the smelters and refiners 

identified in the Group’s supply chain were designated as 

compliant with a recognized third-party validation scheme or 

actively engaging in same approach. Therefore, the Group has no 

reason to believe that any Cobalt or Mica the Group sourced, have 

directly or indirectly financed or benefitted armed conflict in the 

covered countries, nor supported illegally operating or sanctioned 

entities.

2.2.12.8 REACH and RoHS

Schneider Electric is rolling out several eco-responsible initiatives 

with its suppliers.

For example, Schneider has chosen to go further than the 

European REACH and RoHS regulations. The approach is rolled 

out in the Group over the whole product portfolio and to all 

suppliers, regardless of their geographic origin. To support the 

REACH and RoHS projects, Schneider has implemented a data 

collection process supported by a dedicated team to gather the 

required information from its suppliers. This has allowed it to 

significantly reduce its response time to collect such information 

and therefore be quicker to respond to its customers’ inquiries. In 

addition to data collection, the Group put in place a review process 

for this data to guarantee its quality. Through this process, the level 

of verification required for a given supplier can be adjusted in order 

to make the controls more stringent in cases where deviations have 

been detected.

Another example is Schneider’s commitment to supporting the 

small and medium enterprises (SME) network. This support is 

enabled by working in an adapted manner with certain suppliers.  

In France, Schneider Electric is a major player in the International 

SME Pact.

Finally, by the very nature of its activity, the Group continually 

encourages its ecosystem (including customers and suppliers) to 

implement energy efficient solutions.

2.2.12.9 The Zero Carbon Project (SSI #3)

In 2022 Schneider Electric’s new Net-Zero commitment was 

validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The Group aims 

to reduce its scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2030 and by 90% by 

2050 against a 2021 baseline. This means that all Schneider 

factories and transportation, and those of its suppliers in the entire 

upstream value chain need to transition towards operating without 

using any fossil fuel and run only on clean energy. To achieve this 

ambitious target, as a first step Schneider has launched The Zero 

Carbon Project, which aims to cut 50% of operational carbon 

emissions from its top 1,000 suppliers by 2025 (SSI #3). At the end 

of 2022 SSI #3 achieved a remarkable 10% performance and has 

laid the ground to accelerate decarbonization in the coming years.

Read more details on The Zero Carbon Project in 

Chapter 2.3 “Leading on decarbonization” page 148, and 

in chapter 2.7 “Methodology and audit of indicators” 

page 242.

Consult our webpage dedicated to The Zero Carbon 

Project from the Sustainability section on www.se.com

2.2.12.10 Green materials (SSI #4) and 
sustainable packaging (SSI #5)

Green Materials (SSI #4)

Similarly, an initiative has been launched to increase the proportion 

of green material in Schneider products to 50% by 2025 (SSI #4).

The scope of this initiative currently includes about 30% of 

Schneider’s procurement volume: 

• thermoplastics (direct and indirect purchase); 

• steel (direct purchase); and 

• aluminum (direct purchase). 

Other kinds of materials such as steel purchased as fabricated 

components, other non-ferrous metals (such as copper, silver or 

brass), and thermoset, both direct and indirect procurement, will be 

considered for the next phases. At the end of 2022, 18% of 

materials in scope were qualified as “Green”, following specific 

criteria.

For thermoplastics, the 2022 performance was achieved mainly by 

embedding recycled plastics in products and by obtaining supplier 

proof for both recycled and green flame retardant.

For steel, good progress was made, notably due to the certification 

of large steel suppliers to Responsible Steel in 2022, as well as 

sourcing from suppliers using Electric Arc Furnaces.

For aluminum a similar approach to the one for steel will be applied, 

focusing on building trust and transparency with suppliers.

  Read more details on the Green materials program  

in chapter 2.4 “Be efficient with resources”,  

page 174, and in chapter 2.7 “Methodology and  

audit of indicators” page 242.

Sustainable Packaging (SSI #5)

Resource efficiency and conservation are the underlying principles 

that guide all actions at Schneider. During the period of 2018 – 

2020 the Company implemented an initiative to successfully move 

to 99% of cardboard and pallets used in the transport of goods to 

be sourced from recycled or certified sources.

In 2021, this ambition was extended to use recycled cardboard in 

all primary and secondary packaging and remove all single use 

plastic from Schneider packaging by 2025 (SSI #5). To achieve this 

transformation, a two-pronged approach is deployed. On the one 

hand, a cross functional team is deployed to review the packaging 

design and explore and authorize the use of alternate materials for 

packaging; on the other hand, various procurement teams engage 

with suppliers across regions to ensure the deployment of the 

roadmap by the suppliers to meet the prescribed requirements.

To ensure streamlined actions, dedicated categories of packaging 

material were identified to be included in the transformation. As a 

result of concerted efforts by various teams, over 45% of the 

packaging spend in scope was attributed to sustainable packaging 

and the end of 2022, vs 21% end 2021.

  Read more details on the sustainable packaging  

program in chapter 2.4 “Be efficient with resources”,  

page 174, and in chapter 2.7 “Methodology and  

audit of indicators” page 242.

2.2.12.11 Decent work

Context

Supply chains power the economic engine of the world. On the one 

hand they help companies leverage the global capabilities and 

benefit from collective genius; on the other hand, they help 

economies progress and engage in global commerce. However, 

the benefits of this global integration are often unequally 

distributed. One of the areas where this is prominent is working 

conditions and rights available to the workers in their workplace.

Working condition crisis

Studies and research across the world have shown that mere 

involvement in global commerce is not sufficient to uplift 

underprivileged populations. According to the United Nations, over 

700 million workers lived in extreme or moderate poverty in 2018 

and as per estimates by civil society organizations, more than 50 

million people are trapped in modern day slavery worldwide, with 

more than 70% being women and children. The COVID-19 

onslaught had a catastrophic impact on employment conditions. A 

survey by the United Nations Global Compact revealed that global 

labor income declined by an average of 10% in the first three 

quarters of 2020 compared with 2019. Widespread job losses and 

loss of earning members increase insecurity, making workers 

vulnerable to poor and exploitative working conditions. The scale of 

this challenge is too great to be handled by governments alone. 

Corporations need to take responsibility and do their part in 

ensuring that worker rights are respected universally.

Decent Work Program 

The extent and severity of the crisis requires a systematic, broad 

based, ecosystem approach and not simple rectification of 

observed malpractices. The focus needs to be opening dialogue 

and normalizing universal worker rights irrespective of the 

geography or the context of employment. 

The Decent Work Program focuses on engaging suppliers to 

protect worker rights, going beyond the regulatory requirements 

and prevailing normative practices. The initiative is aimed at 

implementing preventive controls that act as an additional buffer 

against any potential violations and reduce the likelihood of any 

malpractices. Gradually, such actions need to become the new 

norm for evaluating performance of the supply chain.

The key requirements of the initiative are based on the principles of 

decent work, promulgated by the International Labour Organization 

(ILO), and also leverage concurrent issues, to make it 

comprehensive. The details of the 10 pillars forming the foundation 

of the program are outlined on the next page.

Implementation

The scope of the program includes strategic suppliers across 

direct (also known as production) and indirect (known as non-

production) procurement. 

The initiative adopts the approach of a development program, 

acknowledging that the program criteria may be new for many 

suppliers and Schneider Electric will need to support them by 

handholding, capacity building, and constant engagement for 

implementation. To facilitate the execution by suppliers in a gradual 

way, the program is split in two stages.

The evaluation of supplier performance will be carried out through 

an online questionnaire that is rolled out via SSP-SRM – Schneider’s 

supplier relationship portal. A specifically trained team of 

associates from the Global Procurement Services (GPS) lead the 

launch of the initiative. The suppliers are required to respond to the 

questions and upload evidence to support the responses. All 

responses and accompanying evidence are evaluated to meet the 

minimum criteria of decent work. In cases where the supplier 

actions do not meet the minimum requirements, feedback is given, 

and corrective actions need to be implemented by the suppliers in 

a timely manner. Upon rectification, the information needs to be 

resubmitted along with the evidence for the re-evaluation.

To formally record suppliers’ commitment to the Decent Work 

Program, a participation confirmation survey is sent to the 

suppliers. Once the supplier responds in the affirmative, the decent 

work program stage 1 survey is sent to them for participation. 

During the year, 765 suppliers were invited to participate in the 

Decent Work Program and by the end of 2022, more than 525 

suppliers agreed to join the program, and engagements are 

underway to onboard other eligible suppliers. Owing to the 

dynamic nature of the supplier categorization, Schneider Electric 

will review the list of eligible suppliers on an annual basis and 

ensure inclusion of relevant suppliers in the program. In addition to 

English, the program requirements were also translated into 

Mandarin, including trainings to ensure adequate coverage for 

suppliers. 

Trust

SSI #6

100% of our strategic suppliers 
provide decent work to their 
employees

During the year Schneider Electric conducted four 

dedicated sessions for procurement teams worldwide, to 

introduce the program, its objective and requirements of 

implementation. These sessions were attended by more 

than 225 procurement staff. 23 sessions were organized 

during the year to sensitize and equip the suppliers about 

the rationale, structure and implementation requirements of 

the program. These sessions included focused group 

trainings as well as one to one dedicated trainings for the 

suppliers and were attended by more than 350 supplier 

participants. As of end of 2022, 473 suppliers have been 

invited to respond to the decent work program stage 1 

questionnaire, 104 suppliers have responded to the survey 

and 13 suppliers were assessed as compliant post the 

evaluation of their responses and validation of required 

documentation.

2.2.12.12 Supplier diversity program in the 
United States

Schneider Electric’s US supplier diversity program strives to 

identify, include, and engage qualified diverse suppliers to support 

the company’s goals and foster equal opportunities.

Schneider Electric US is in constant pursuit of qualified businesses 

that are certified as one, or more, of the following business 

classifications and provide quality products and services at 

competitive prices: 

• Small Business Enterprise (SBE); 

• Veteran (VET);

• Minority-Owned Enterprise (MBE);

• Women-Owned Enterprise (WBE); 

• Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone).

• LGBTQ+-Owned Enterprises (LGBTBE)

As of end of December 2022, the Group is on target to spend more 

than 4% of its total US Procurement spend with uniquely diverse 

businesses. This represents an increase of nearly 0.5% vs. 2021. 

Schneider Electric is aware of the work it has to do in this area and 

is committed to growing its program within, and outside, the US to 

bring more opportunities to the diverse business community. 

In 2022, Schneider Electric enhanced its Supplier Diversity 

program in the following directions:

• Expanded relationships with supplier diversity partner 

organizations

• Performed data cleansing exercises quarterly to reflect the 

diversity more accurately in its supply chain

• Updated policies, procedures and web site content to more fully 

articulate its efforts in supplier diversity 

• Conducted robust training across the North America 

organization for both procurement and other employees who 

have authority to purchase good/services on behalf of the 

company

Key pillars of the Decent Work program include:

1. Employment 

opportunities 

Employment opportunities should be available to all eligible, in a transparent, well-informed manner, and 

without any charges, as a right. In case of any expense incurred by the worker towards obtaining 

employment, the same should be reimbursed by the employer. The work should respect and uphold the 

dignity of employees and proactively create an environment to address and resolve modern slavery, forced 

labor, and bonded labor. There should be a process to ensure no child is employed.

2. Adequate 

earnings and 

productive work

Employment should be a source of economic independence and dignified living. The gradual decline of 

industrial wages and the COVID-19 crisis have severely impacted the economic outlook of the workforce, 

globally. Companies should review wage policies to ensure the affordability of a dignified living by the 

workers. Additionally, employment should equip the workforce to improve current skill sets and knowledge 

for future employability.

3. Decent working 

hours

Excessive working hours is a legal violation, often accepted as “necessary”. It is generally connected with 

low industrial wages and used as an excuse to not provide appropriate wages. Companies should review 

and remediate excessive hours and should align with the legal and/or international requirements.

4. Stability and 

security of work

Employment should be a source of economic stability and peace of mind. Uncertainty of job security 

increases stress and makes the workforce vulnerable to abuse and hazardous working conditions.  

The problem has been exacerbated due to COVID-19-related job losses.

5. Social dialogue 

and workplace 

relations

Employees should have the right to engage with management and collectively put across their concerns 

and demands. Collective bargaining encourages workers to raise concerns in a timely manner, acts as a 

barometer and early warning system to assess worker satisfaction and reduces worker vulnerability.

6. Fair treatment in 

employment

Employment should be based on merit and the ability to do the job, and fair treatment should be extended 

to all employees. Differences in lifestyle, choices, etc., often become a source of discrimination, 

victimization, and harassment. This curbs freedom of expression, hiding preferences, and creates mental 

health challenges. Companies should ensure a workplace that accepts diversity and provides an inclusive 

work environment.

7. Safe work Employment should result in economic independence and augment the ability to exercise a healthy and 

prosperous life. It should not result in ill-health, risk to well-being, or be a source of injury/misery.

8. Social protection Industrial wages are often not sufficient to provide adequate living standards. The problem is exacerbated 

in cases of health emergencies. Social protection, provided by employers/governments, provide a much-

needed safety net from economic shock, descent into poverty, and vulnerability. Companies should ensure 

that all employees have access to the social security safety net.

9. Purchasing 

practices

Purchasing practices and requirements significantly impact working conditions. They influence the working 

culture of the supplier organization to meet customer requirements. The power of procurement can be a 

strong driver for positive change to include decent work conditions as a pre-requisite among the supply 

chain partners, when balanced with other commercial criteria.

10. Balancing work 

and family life

Family responsibilities disproportionately impact genders and result in unequal participation in economic 

activities. Workplaces should strive to create a level playing field and provide all possible opportunities to 

employees to participate in economic activities without compromising the family responsibilities, which may 

require periods away from work (e.g., maternity, family care, flexible hours, adequate child care). Work 

environment should act as a leveler/equalizer and not augment the disparity.

2.2.13 Vigilance with local communities

2.2.13.1 Context

In 2020, Schneider Electric extended the scope of its vigilance risk 

analysis to communities in geographic proximity of Schneider’s 

local operations. As a result of this proximity, people’s conditions of 

living could be affected by the Group’s activity. Schneider’s local 

operations are of two types:

• Local facilities, such as a factory or an office building.

• Local project sites where Schneider is operating as a contractor 

or subcontractor for a customer.

2.2.13.2 Risks and opportunities

The risk overview exercise has been carried out for the top 30 

Schneider Electric sites throughout the world and a selection of 40 

customer projects and is still in pilot mode. The main risks that have 

been explored were related to the impact of Schneider Electric’s 

activities on the local infrastructures such as transportation and 

mobility, access to energy or water, access to staple-good and 

utilities, safety, and protection against ethical breaches.

Opportunities have also been identified in the form of improvement 

of infrastructures, better access to education, support to socio-

cultural local projects, and improvement of local employment.

2.2.13.3 Governance

The overall governance is under the responsibility of the Duty of 

Vigilance steering committee, throughout the pilot phase. In the 

next phase, the steering committee will bring in additional 

stakeholders to implement the actions that will be decided.

This subject is governed by Schneider Electric’s Human Rights 

policy as well as the ambition set forth in the Group’s vigilance plan. 

At a later stage, some specific policy may be drafted to further 

structure the framework.

2.2.13.4 Communities living around 
Schneider’s sites

Vigilance risk assessment for Schneider Electric’s 

30 largest sites 

The overall result shows that the level of risk to local communities 

living around Schneider Electric sites is “low” in most cases. This is 

mainly due to the fact that the Company is usually located in large, 

urban, or peri-urban areas, crowded with many similar or larger 

companies. In the case of factories, they are mostly located in 

already existing dedicated industrial areas, with stable 

infrastructures and transportation networks, and Schneider 

Electric’s presence does not have an impact on these areas. 

Among the top 30 sites, the Group only identified a very limited 

number that may have a “moderate” impact on local communities 

and found no site where Schneider Electric could have a “high” or 

“very high” impact.

It is to be noted that although Schneider Electric speaks about risks, 

the notion of impact can also be positive, as it is part of Schneider 

Electric’s policy to include local parameters in its sourcing policy: 

providing employment; including a percentage of local companies 

and contractors for services (catering, maintenance, etc.).

2.2.13.5 Communities living around 
customers’ project sites 

In 2021, Schneider Electric extended its risks assessment to cover 

local communities residing close to the sites where the Group is 

implementing projects for customers. These projects can be, for 

example, the building of an electrical switchgear station to distribute 

electricity, either to the grid or to private large users (factories, 

professional buildings, etc.). Depending on the profile of the 

end-customer, these projects necessitate the on-site coordination of 

several types of contractors: civil engineering, industrial process 

experts, electricity specialists, communication infrastructure experts. 

Relations with local communities, when relevant, are usually handled 

by the main contractor, or by the end-customer.

To identify the main sites presenting potential risks, Schneider 

Electric has pre-selected customer projects based on the 

combination of two criteria: country risk and customer activity. 

Country risk is a compound of several external publicly available 

indicators (transparency, human rights, etc.). Customer activity is 

based on the industrial process specific to the end-customer. For 

illustration, the top five risks are ranked as follows:

Top country risk Top customer activity risk

Chad Mining, minerals and metals

Mauritania Oil, gas and petrochemicals

Angola Power and grid

Nigeria Life sciences

Tanzania Water

Based on the combination of these criteria, a sample of 40 projects 

have been selected for review.

Evaluating the impact for selected sites

Projects reviewed can be grouped into three categories, each 

reflecting the type of involvement of Schneider Electric, and the 

mitigation capabilities of Schneider.

• Type 1: Schneider Electric provides switchgear and/or industrial 

equipment, is also the main contractor for the project, and is 

present on site. Mitigation actions can be decided and 

implemented by Schneider.

• Type 2: Schneider Electric provides switchgear and/or industrial 

equipment, but it is not the main contractor. Mitigation 

capabilities are limited.

• Type 3: Schneider Electric provides software and control, and is 

mostly working remotely, being present on site only for final 

testing and commissioning. Mitigation capabilities are very low.

Among the projects reviewed, two were of type 1, six of type 2, and 

six of type 3.

• A study of the two projects of type1 shows the following risks 

and benefits to local populations:

 − Temporary/brief disturbance in transportation and mobility 

due to large materials and equipment delivery.

 − Temporary and planned power outages.

 − No environmental or pollution risk.

 − Local security implemented by final customer, with no or little 

impact on the neighboring communities.

 − The project is a source of employment for local companies.

For type 1 projects that have been reviewed, Schneider Electric 

and the contractors under its responsibility were not found to create 

major or significant risks for communities. Some points of 

improvements that would contribute positively to the communities 

were identified, such as for example: additional focus on local 

education and technical training, awareness of energy-related 

subjects, or more emphasis on local hiring. Globally, a more 

structured communication and pattern of interaction with 

communities or their representatives would bring value.

• Among the 12 projects of type 2 and 3, six are projects with 

significant impact on the local communities (petrochem, etc.) 

and six have limited impact (desert or remote location). For the 

projects with significant impact, relations with local communities 

are handled by the end-user or the main contractor. Given the 

small size of Schneider Electric’s contribution to the overall 

project investment, the capacity of Schneider to be a significant 

contributor to the mitigation measures is very limited. Specific 

policies, adapted to these project profiles, are currently under 

review.

2.3 Leading on decarbonization 

 “The fight against climate change is 
driving a profound transformation 
of our economic and energy 
systems. Schneider Electric is one 
of the world’s first companies to 
validate science-based Net-Zero 
targets and so far, we’ve made 
good progress in meeting them. 
Yet this requires faster and more 
concerted action, and we’re ready 
to engage with all our stakeholders 
and lead the way.”

Context and the Group’s commitments
As the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) points out 

in its Emissions Gap Report 2022, the window to limit the global 

temperatures rise to 1.5°C is closing. The world is not on track to 

reach the Paris Agreement goals, and global temperatures could 

reach a 2.8°C average increase by the end of the century. Urgent 

action and a system-wide transformation are needed to deliver the 

enormous cuts in emissions necessary to limit GHG emissions by 

2030. 

The number of companies pledging to align their business 

strategies to a 1.5°C (or well below 2°C) trajectory has increased. 

Since 2018, more than 2,000 companies have set science-based 

reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative 

(SBTi). To determine science-based targets and align with Net-Zero 

ambitions, the SBTi released the SBTi “Corporate Net-Zero 

Standard” at the end of 2021. Schneider Electric was one of the first 

companies to have its Net-Zero targets validated by the SBTi with 

this new standard in August 2022. But pledges are not enough – 

and Schneider Electric is committed to action, acknowledging that 

the world needs to move from pledges to progress. 

As an Impact Company, the Group’s climate strategy addresses all 

its stakeholders, from employees to supply chain partners, 

customers, as well as local communities and institutions, and 

shows that there are ways for companies to “do good while doing 

well and vice-versa”. First, the Group takes responsibility for its 

carbon footprint, across its operations and full value-chain. 

Second, it adapts and improves the solutions and products it offers 

to its customers to help them in their decarbonization journey. 

Concrete actions for the 2021-2025 period are monitored and 

shared transparently in Schneider Sustainability Impact, and 

Essentials. They are overseen by various dedicated Committees up 

to the Board of Directors. In the longer term, the Group is 

committed to be Net-Zero in its operations by 2030, and across its 

entire value chain by 2050. It has made specific commitments for 

energy efficiency, electrification, and renewable electricity under 

the EP100, EV100, and RE100 initiatives of the Climate Group. 

Schneider Electric also aims to deliver to its customers 800 million 

tonnes of saved and avoided CO
2
 emissions between 2018 and 

2025 thanks to EcoStruxure™ solutions.

2.3 Leading on decarbonization

2.3.1 Climate risks, opportunities and impact 
management
Schneider Electric’s Net-Zero Commitment is part of a broader 

awareness of the climate-related risks, opportunities, and 

associated sustainability and resilience measures that any 

company must undertake. The Group is assessing its risks and 

opportunities following the recommendations of the Task Force on 

Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2022, it conducted 

a forward-looking climate scenario analysis, expanded its 

climate-related risk governance and defined its strategy to address 

climate-related risks and opportunities. 

Risks are identified and assessed with specific internal and 

external metrics, but also with interviews with experts and leaders, 

run by the Internal Audit Department and the Group Risk 

Management Department, to update the list of general risks at 

Group level each year. The risk assessments cover market risks, 

acute physical risks, chronic physical risks, legal risks, current and 

emerging regulations as well as reputational risks. In 2022, around 

40 of the Group’s top managers were interviewed in addition to 

Board members. 

Climate-related risks are included in Schneider Electric’s Enterprise 

Risk Management framework built around 3 lines of defense and an 

independent control: 

• businesses and operations manage risks while achieving 

organizational objectives;

• risk domain leaders act as risk overseers, set guardrails and 

review the risk management systems;

• the Group risk management is accountable for the overall risk 

governance with oversight by the Board of Directors.

Internal Audit acts as an independent assurance to advise on the 

adequacy and effectiveness of governance and risk management. 

  More details in chapter 3 page 292  

“How we manage risks at Schneider Electric”.

Schneider places dependency analysis at the heart of its risk 

management and performs a forward-looking climate risk and 

vulnerability assessment to identify and price the materiality of 

physical and transition climate risks that may affect its own 

operations and sites, its extended value chain (upstream and 

downstream), and overall economic activities in the short-term, 

medium-term and long-term, using scenario analysis.

The Group has developed a scenario-based analysis of climate 

physical and transition risks, applying climate-related risk 

scenarios entailing different emission pathways between 1.5°C and 

>4°C temperature rise by 2100, with a digital-twin of the company 

including financial projection, market breakdown, supply chain, and 

carbon footprint to quantify financially the physical and transition 

risks for the Group. Five emissions pathways have been 

considered: SSP5-8.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP2-4.5, SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9 

by 2050, 2070 and 2100.

2.3.1.1 Climate-driven opportunities

The climate crisis calls for significant action and innovation across 

businesses, industries, and governments. Increasing awareness of 

the risks posed by climate change has led thousands of 

businesses to make commitments to act on decarbonization, 

energy efficiency, electrification, renewable energy procurement, 

and more. More than 4,000 companies have either set or made a 

commitment to set targets in line with the Science-Based Targets 

initiative. However, only a fraction manage to reduce their carbon 

footprint in line with 1.5°C to 2°C scenarios.

2022 saw an unprecedented number of changes in climate or 

Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSR) regulations – from the 

CSR Directive (CSRD) in Europe and the implementation of the 

climate objectives of the European Taxonomy Regulation, to the 

Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) Climate Disclosures 

consultation in the US and the Business Responsibility and 

Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) in India.

Schneider Electric is uniquely positioned to seize opportunities 

from the growing demand for greener, low-carbon products and 

services, and to help its suppliers and customers in their 

decarbonization journey. The Group promotes a three-step 

approach with its ecosystem: strategize, electrify, and decarbonize. 

The Group sees the energy and climate transition as an opportunity 

for companies that are “part of the solution” to grow their revenues. 

Schneider’s Energy Management and Industrial Automation 

solutions help customers use their energy and resources more 

efficiently, and reduce their CO
2
 emissions. Furthermore, smart grid 

technologies unlock the potential to electrify and, optimize energy 

usage, powered by renewable electricity.

Following internal research, the Group sees an acceleration in the 

dominant roles of:

• electrification: the world is becoming more electric, with 

demand growing potentially up to 3x by 2050;

• digitization: with the increase in connectivity, complemented by 

real-time information and competitive computing capabilities, 

digital technologies play a major role in reaching 

decarbonization targets while augmenting economic 

productivity, notably around efficiency in energy, resource use, 

and circularity, as well as increased resiliency and security.

All these findings, and their potential financial impact on Schneider 

business has helped the Group fine-tune key development areas 

that will allow it to actively contribute to the low-carbon transition, 

enabling it to develop its portfolio of sustainability-related products 

and solutions.

In 2022, 72% of the Group’s revenues qualified as “Impact”, 

meaning revenues from products and solutions that generate 

energy or resource efficiency to customers. The Group aims to 

grow its Impact revenues to 80% by 2025 (SSI #1). Additionally, 

more than 90% of Schneider’s innovation projects contribute to 

solutions relating to climate change mitigation and environment 

protection.

  See more details about Schneider Impact revenues and 

EU taxonomy in chapter 2.1.9 page 100. 

2.3.1.2 Climate-related risks

Reputation risk

As Schneider Electric has been working to reduce its own GHG 

emissions for over 15 years and has a proven track record of 

success with its past commitments related to reducing its own 

emissions, the Group does not anticipate significant reputational 

risk. Yet, the risk from the Group’s actual or perceived failure to 

achieve its environmental targets, or commitments could negatively 

impact its reputation or otherwise materially harm its business. This 

risk is also tied to growing and moving environmental regulations.

Risk monitoring and management

The Group monitors and manages its reputation risk by:

• continuously monitoring its sustainability performance and 

revising its strategy to adapt to regulations, and customer 

demand;

• consistently and transparently presenting its sustainability 

performance to its stakeholders, across all environmental, 

social, and governance topics;

• considering the possible financial impacts of future CO
2
 costs 

on its activities, by taking into consideration both operational 

and supply chain footprints. Given the relatively low level of the 

Group’s Scopes 1 & 2 carbon emissions, carbon pricing has 

indirect rather than direct impacts, resulting in increased supply 

chain costs or product costs;

• working collaboratively with relevant stakeholders to develop 

and strengthen regulatory frameworks, advance standards to 

create common methodologies to measure the environmental 

footprint of products, and to improve corporate carbon 

accounting. 

Supply chain disruption 

Schneider Electric has over 200 industrial and logistics sites 

globally and is exposed to the physical effects of climate change in 

the form of more frequent and severe acute weather events. This 

could result in damage to assets, disruption to business operations, 

and human consequences. Extreme weather events do not only 

threaten Schneider’s assets and properties but also the overall 

supply chain. Shortages or logistic bottlenecks in the upstream and 

downstream supply chain can translate directly into revenue losses, 

higher costs, and increased working capital requirements. Delays 

in production and delivery can impact customer experience.

Risk monitoring and management

To understand the risk exposure of Schneider’s sites and extended 

supply chain and identify mitigation and adaptation actions, the 

Group performed a physical climate risks and vulnerability 

assessment. In this assessment, the Group developed a digital-

twin of the company including geographic location and 

dependency of key facilities, and quantified for each site the 

exposure of both assets and business operations to acute and 

chronic climate-related perils, calculating the exposure of the 

Group’s economic activities in the short, medium (2030) and long 

term (2050) under different scenarios from the Intergovernmental 

Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), from 1.5°C to >4°C temperature 

rise by 2100. 

The Group monitors events across 10,000 nodes (such as ports 

and critical supplier locations) to shorten reaction time should 

events occur, and thereby minimize business impact. In addition, 

an analysis of criticality of industrial sites is performed by 

independent experts, covering areas including interdependency 

analyses, alternative supply, and time to recover in case of 

damage. At present, the impact of natural hazards is not material to 

the Group’s financial statements. Indeed, the magnitude of impact, 

whether on physical or supply chain risks, is considered “medium 

to low”, and likelihood “as likely as not”, however the Group is 

proactively monitoring this risk. The Group’s Supply Chain uses a 

resiliency index that includes natural and climate-related hazards to 

assess and mitigate business interruption risks. 

To mitigate and adapt to these risks, the Group launched the 

“Power of Two in Manufacturing”, a project to bolster greater supply 

chain resiliency. The project aims at ensuring that no product is 

manufactured in a single location, or with only one supplier for any 

critical parts or components. More information on Schneider’s 

measures to adapt to climate change are provided in the next 

section.

Finally, the Group’s Property Damage and Business Interruption 

program, aligned with ISO 22301 standard, maps substantive risks 

on the business and ensures crisis management, from the initial 

phase following an incident all the way to the recovery of critical 

activities.

Adaptation measures

Schneider Electric’s approach to climate change adaptation 

consists of several resilience initiatives. Weather risks are part of 

the Group’s Business Continuity & Risk Management program, 

leading to preventive investment to secure assets and mitigate 

material climate risks.

Firstly, Schneider’s management method consists of risks 

quotations. Climate-related physical risks including floods are part 

of the risk assessments and standard practice reviews made by 

independent global risk experts (GRC), thereby defining potential 

financial impacts as well as the cost of response.

2.3 Leading on decarbonization

GRC measures and weighs (external and independent standard 

measurement): 

• passive (exogenous) threats relating to floods, hurricanes 

(windstorms), earthquakes, construction, occupancy, other; 

• active (endogenous) risks relating to physical protection, human 

exposure, natural hazards, business continuity plan. 

All industrial and logistics sites worldwide are evaluated every 

three years. Risk profiles of each site are regularly updated, and 

recommendations are made to mitigate and adapt to identified 

risks. 

The Group deploys protection measures to mitigate or avoid the 

risks. Action plans are being developed for its sites potentially 

exposed to floods. Plans may include installing flood gates or 

moving equipment to a higher level, production increase or 

reduction, delivery increase, checking external areas for possible 

objects that could float, and so on. As of 2022, eight Schneider 

sites are protected by levees. 

The cost of management can be approximated by that of insurance 

plans. The cost (including tax) of the Group’s main global insurance 

programs, excluding premiums paid to captives, totaled around 

€28 million in 2022.

In addition, the supply chain strategy called STRIVE, launched in 

2021, includes an increased focus on resilience to ensure supply 

chain flexibility is continually improved. More than 80% of selected 

CapEx is engaged in the “Power of Two in Manufacturing” project, 

whereby the Group is proactively working to qualify alternate 

factories for same products and suppliers for all critical parts and 

components to improve continuity of supply. By doing so, the 

Group can dual-source critical components from partners in 

different geographies to help ensure availability regardless of 

business disruptions that may occur, such as natural disasters. As 

a result of the STRIVE strategy, 84% of top manufacturing risks are 

secured with strategic stocks, and 51% of top supply risks are 

secured under a specific multi-sourcing project.

For example, in the Philippines, the Group identified products at 

risk based on revenues, and then conducted a study to assess 

whether it should implement its Power of Two resilience strategy. 

The industrial planning team investigated associated existing 

technological challenges and budgeting. The site then worked with 

partners in the region (for example, in Vietnam) and invested in 

tools and equipment to mitigate potential business interruptions 

and secure the cost of goods sold (and therefore revenues), with 

the objective of securing around 35% of its sales through a 

business continuity plan by 2024.

2.3.1.3 Governance

Overall, the different governance bodies involved in the definition 

and monitoring of the sustainability commitments and programs are 

responsible for defining strategic mitigation programs in response 

to the risks and opportunities identified. Strategic programs 

defined at Group level are then cascaded into business divisions, 

down to the sites for implementation, and are monitored through the 

digital platform, EcoStruxure™ Resource Advisor. Each program of 

the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) has a dedicated pilot in 

charge of driving the transformation and is sponsored at the Senior 

Vice-President and Executive levels to ensure management control 

and oversight.

The sustainability strategy, including climate, is overseen by the 

Board of Directors with the assistance of the Human Resources 

and Corporate Social Responsibility (HR & CSR) Committee. 

Schneider was one of the first companies to address this topic at 

the Board level with the creation of the HR & CSR Committee in 

2014. The Group further addressed the topic by deciding that the 

annual variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and of 

the more than 64,000 employees (who benefit from a variable 

compensation), includes ESG criteria, part of which relates to 

climate. The long-term incentive plan is also correlated with ESG 

criteria (for more details on compensation, please refer to section 

2.5.4, page 218).

Several other governance bodies are involved in this matter: the 

Executive Committee and its Function Committee, the Stakeholder 

Committee and the Sustainability department. At Group level, the 

Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, who is part of the Executive 

Committee, helps determine and enforce the Group’s 

environmental goals and underlying transformations. Three 

Committees involving Group Executive Vice-Presidents and Senior 

Vice-Presidents are dedicated to oversee the implementation of the 

Group’s decarbonization roadmap, respectively focusing on the 

supply chain, low-carbon product design, and the decarbonization 

of Schneider’s operational emissions.

Schneider Electric’s Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer is the 

head of the Global Environment team, leading the overall 

environmental vision, strategy, and program execution, including 

climate. The Global Environment team participates in the Group 

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, which identifies, 

assesses, and prioritizes risks and, through regular reporting and 

discussion, assists senior management and the Board with 

governance of risk. The team gathers input from climate experts 

across the company to support this reporting.

In addition, environmental transformations are driven by a network 

of leading experts in various environmental fields (eco-design, 

energy efficiency, circular economy, CO
2
, etc.). On an annual basis, 

a process identifies and recognizes those individuals who own a 

specific expertise that the company is keen to maintain and grow. 

Various governance bodies enable these communities of experts 

and leaders within the environmental function to meet every month 

or every quarter, depending on the topics and entities, to ensure 

consistent adoption of environment policies and standards 

throughout the Group. To implement these policies, Environment 

leaders coordinate a network of more than 600 managers 

responsible for the environmental management of sites, countries, 

product design, and marketing.

2.3.1.4 Climate scenarios embedded in the 
Group’s strategy

In line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

(TCFD) recommendations, Schneider Electric launched a 

prospective approach on climate change and energy transition 

three years ago, by setting up a dedicated organization, the 

Strategy Prospective & External Affairs team. This team is in charge 

of climate and environment scenario analysis, and reports to the 

Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer.

Several scenarios to 2050 were developed in 2019. Those included 

critical reviews of the geopolitical landscape, commodity and 

resource availability, economic and financial evolutions, climate 

sensitivity and evolving policies, energy transition pathways, and 

technology developments, among others, with quantified 

consequences, taking into consideration ten regions and a number 

of sectors individually, framing the business landscape in which 

Schneider operates. 

In 2020, those scenarios were further updated. Beyond long-term 

impact analysis, the COVID-19 short-term impact assessment has 

also been reviewed in detail, including the importance and 

feasibility of climate-compatible recovery plans. 

Finally, in 2021, Schneider published a set of scenarios exploring 

the feasibility of a 1.5°C trajectory. The scenarios developed by 

Schneider demonstrate that a net-zero carbon future, aligned with 

IPCC’s 1.5°C scenarios, is still possible. 

Key findings are regularly cross-checked with new publications, 

particularly the ones from the International Energy Agency, BNEF, 

and the IRENA, among others. Both short- and long-term analysis 

are shared internally and used to inform strategic priorities across 

businesses and operations.

2.3 Leading on decarbonization

2.3.2 Schneider Electric’s Greenhouse Gas footprint
Schneider Electric calculates its end-to-end carbon footprint 

(Scopes 1, 2, and 3) annually in line with the Greenhouse Gas 

Protocol Standards, and obtained a “reasonable” assurance from 

an independent third-party verifier on Scopes 1 & 2 reported 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and a “limited” assurance on 

Scope 3 reported GHG emissions. 

The charts below represents Schneider’s 2022 carbon footprint for 

Scopes 1, 2, and 3, including all GHG emissions, from the 

upstream activity of all its suppliers to the use and end-of-life of its 

products sold to customers.

14% <1% 86%

Emissions from Scopes 1 & 2 are primarily from the use of 

electricity, gas, and fuel for the company fleet (respectively 43%, 

23%, and 24% of total Scopes 1 & 2). Scope 3 emissions represent 

more than 99% of the Group’s carbon footprint, of which:

• 77% are due to the use phase of products: these emissions 

correspond to the electricity consumption of Schneider’s 

products throughout their lifecycle, through heat dissipation 

(Joule effect). This value is based on a lifecycle approach, 

leveraging the Product Environmental Profiles (PEP) of products. 

This number is calculated following the GHG Protocol Scope 3 

guidelines for category 11, use of sold products. It is not the 

volume of CO
2
 emitted in the reporting year from the use of 

products sold and in use by customers. It is a forward-looking 

view and an estimate of emissions resulting from the use of 

products sold in the reporting year, during their full useful life. It 

is worth noting that the Group’s products have long lifetime, 

which can be up to 30 years in calculations. 

• 12% result from the purchase of goods and services: the 

calculations are based on the purchasing database combining 

spending and volumes (e.g., tonnes). The methodology 

considers the wide heterogeneity of the Group’s procurement 

portfolio: raw materials, electronic and electrical products, 

printed circuit board assembly, fabricated components, along 

with purchases that are not directly related to production (e.g., 

services such as insurance and banking services). As per the 

principles of carbon accounting, calculations are based on 

physical quantities as much as possible, using the tonnes of 

metals and plastics purchased for instance. 

• 8% are from the products’ end-of-life, and more specifically 

end-of-life treatment of SF
6
: the calculation is based on the 

SF
6
 gas used by Schneider in products sold in 2022, and that 

may be released at the end of product life. An assumption is 

made on the release in the atmosphere of SF
6
 at product 

decommissioning, based on Schneider’s research, considering 

that some SF
6
 in equipment is being recycled, while the majority 

is not recycled.

Coverage of reported emissions is 99% for energy, fugitive SF

emissions, waste, purchases, capital goods, commuting, travel, 

and freight (coverage is estimated using a relevant activity indicator 

for each source of emissions, such as spend on purchases and 

business travel, surface for energy and capital goods, headcount 

for commuting and waste). Schneider Electric reports no GHG 

emissions on franchises, investments, or downstream-leased 

assets, because these emission categories are not considered 

relevant for its activities.

 footprint reduction performance 

Over the last five years, since 2017, emissions from Schneider 

Electric’s operations (Scopes 1 & 2) have decreased by 67% 

absolute, while the emissions from the value chain, both upstream 

and downstream, have been more challenging to control. 

On operations, direct emissions from Scope 1 have decreased by 

36% since 2017, thanks to efforts focused on energy efficiency and 

electrification of the Group’s onsite processes and company cars. 

In addition, targeted efforts to reduce SF
6
 have yielded great 

results. On Scope 2, emissions have decreased by 79% between 

2017 and 2022. On Scopes 1 & 2 combined, the emission reduction 

has historically been driven by energy efficiency, leveraging the 

Group’s portfolio of EcoStruxure solutions. 

Between 2021 and 2022, the emission reduction (-22%) had three 

main drivers: 

• consumption behavior changes linked to the energy crisis (with 

electricity consumption at sites decreasing by 5% and gas 

consumption by 20% as compared to 2021);

• energy efficiency (SSE #5): 6.6% in 2021, 7.8% in 2022. An 

additional modeled savings of 10GWh compared to 2021;

• the switch to more renewable electricity consumed by the 

Group’s facilities, whether directly, via onsite renewable energy 

or green tariffs from the utilities serving Schneider’s operations, 

or indirectly, via unbundled and bundled market mechanisms. 

 

On Scope 3, emissions have decreased by 12% between 2021 and 

2022. This is the result of two opposite evolutions in upstream and 

downstream emissions:

• the emissions from the supply chain upstream emissions, have 

increased by 5%. This increase is mainly due to the increased 

volume of purchased goods and services driven by the growth 

of the Group’s activity, despite the efforts to support suppliers’ 

decarbonization with the Zero Carbon Project, and to source 

green materials. Indeed, the outcome of these programs are not 

yet reflected into the Group’s corporate carbon accounting due 

to necessary methodology and emission factors updates that 

are not yet implemented. The Group is working on the 

reconciliation of the data in 2023.

• the Group’s downstream emissions, mostly emissions from the 

use of sold products, have decreased by 14% between 2021 

and 2022. This is mainly due to external factors and the 

decarbonization of the grids that the Group’s consumers rely on. 

The emissions under the “use of sold products” category 

correspond to the lifetime emissions from the use of products 

sold by Schneider during the year of reporting. These emissions 

are attributable to electricity consumption of products, either 

due to internal consumption or due to heat dissipation (Joule 

effect). When calculating these emissions, the Group has to 

factor the useful life of the products and the projected carbon 

intensity of the grids where its consumers are located over that 

lifetime. The Group has historically based the emission factor of 

the grids where its customers are located on a scenario from the 

International Energy Agency (IEA) that models the future 

decarbonization of the grids. Previously, the emission factors of 

the grids were based on the Reference Technology Scenario of 

the “Energy Technology Perspectives 2017” (IEA, 2017).  

For the 2022 carbon footprint, the GHG emissions from electricity 

have been updated with the most recent scenario, to better reflect 

the current stated policies of countries (Stated Policies Scenario 

from the “World Energy Outlook 2022” (IEA, 2022), which is based 

on current policies, as well as policies announced by governments 

at the time of publication). This update of the emission factors of the 

electricity grids, where customers are located, is the major driver 

for the significant reduction in the emissions from category 11 

between 2021 and 2022: -15% as compared to the reported 

emissions in 2021 for this category. To better illustrate the evolution 

of the emissions from this category under the evolution of 

Schneider Electric’s activities, the 2021 emissions from category 11 

have been re-calculated using the same scenario for the evolution 

of the carbon intensity of the grids. With this recalculation, the 

difference between 2021 and 2022 is a 3% emissions reduction. 

• The rate at which Schneider can implement emission reductions 

is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time, 

ranging from the Group’s business growth and its geographic 

distribution, its supplier mix and their own decarbonization 

journey, to the rate of decarbonization of the grids that power 

the products the Group sells. 

• The Group will work to develop increasingly robust and precise 

activity data and use more granular or higher quality emission 

factor datasets. The quality and granularity of the emission 

factor datasets are critical to support greater accuracy and 

reliability of GHG measurement and reporting. For example, on 

supply chain emissions, the Group is engaged with the 

Pathfinder Framework, a guidance for the calculation and 

exchange of product-level carbon emissions data across value 

chains.

2.3 Leading on decarbonization

2.3.3 Schneider Electric’s Net-Zero Commitment
In August 2022, Schneider Electric was one of the first companies 

to see its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction targets validated by 

the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), aligned with its 

“Corporate Net-Zero Standard” published in October 2021. As part 

of its Net-Zero Commitment, the Group has defined mid- and 

long-term targets. Ultimately, the Group is committed to be 

Net-Zero across its entire value chain by 2050, which means that 

the Group aims to reduce its 2021 footprint by an absolute 90% by 

2050 and neutralize residual emissions with high quality and 

durability carbon removal credits.

The four milestones towards Schneider’s Net-Zero Commitment are 

presented below together with the key decarbonization levers, and 

are detailed in the subsequent sections of this chapter. Please note 

that this graph is intended to provide a simple visualization of the 

Group’s roadmap, so the proportions between Scopes 1, 2, and 3 

have been adjusted to facilitate readability. lt is not representative 

of year over year targets. Yet, what is important to note is that 

between 2040 and 2050, the above and below the line are 

symmetrical, meaning the emissions that are not reduced need to 

be compensated, and by 2050 at the latest removed.

By 2030, reduce value chain emissions by 
25% and be “Net-Zero ready” in operations

Schneider Electric commits to reduce its absolute Scope 3 GHG 

emissions across its entire value chain by 25% from a 2021 base 

year. This encompasses all Scope 3 emissions, in particular 

upstream emissions from purchased goods and services, as well 

as downstream emissions from the use of electricity by its sold 

products.

Schneider is already carrying out concrete actions to engage its 

value chain in decarbonization under its Climate and Resources 

commitments:

• engage 1,000 top suppliers to reduce their operational CO
2
 

emissions by 50% with The Zero Carbon Project (SSI #3);

• increase green material content in products to 50% (steel, 

aluminum, and plastics) by 2025, favoring bio-sourced, 

recycled, and sustainable options (SSI #4), and improve the 

end-to-end lifecycle environmental footprint of its offers with 

EcoDesign Way™; 

• have 100% of primary and secondary packaging free from 

single-use plastic and made from recycled cardboard (SSI #5);

• propose SF
6
-free alternatives for all medium voltage 

technologies by 2025 (SSE #2); 

• increase CO
2
 efficiency in transportation of goods by 15% by 

2025 (SSE #4), and replace at least 5% of conventional jet fuel 

use with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 (WEF First Movers 

Coalition);

• reduce CO
2
 emissions from waste management, and reach 200 

“Waste-to-Resource” sites (SSE #9).

Having “Net-Zero ready” operations means the Group plans to 

reduce absolute emissions from Scopes 1 & 2 by 76% from a 2021 

base year (equivalent to a 90% reduction compared to 2017) and 

neutralize residual emissions from its operations with carbon 

removal credits of growing quality and durability (see details 

thereafter). 

To deliver on this operational target, the Group has launched 

several transformations:

• reach 150 Zero-CO
2
 sites by 2025 (SSE #1);

• source 90% of electricity from renewables by 2025 (SSE #3), 

and 100% by 2030 (RE100);

• increase energy efficiency in its sites by 15% by 2025 (SSE #5), 

and double energy productivity by 2030 compared to 2005 

(EP100); 

• shift one-third of corporate vehicle fleet to electric vehicles by 

2025 (SSE #7), and 100% by 2030 (EV100).

By 2050, reach Net-Zero CO
2
 emissions 

across the entire value chain 

To reach its Net-Zero Commitment, the Group will reduce its 

absolute Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by at least 90% from a 

2021 base year, and compensate residual emissions with carbon 

offsets, in line with the SBTi “Corporate Net-Zero Standard”.

Schneider Electric has already implemented a solid foundation of 

initiatives, which will be reinforced and completed by additional 

actions. Considering the company profile in terms of GHG 

emissions, meeting the targets will require to engage even more 

with customers and suppliers on decarbonization, leveraging the 

Group’s portfolio of solutions to grow the energy efficiency of the 

global economy, the electrification of the energy mix, and the 

sourcing of renewable electricity.

In addition to that, the growing share of circularity services in the 

revenue of the company, along with the greater environmental value 

added by the Group’s Green PremiumTM offers, are enablers to lead 

to the decoupling of company activity from absolute emissions.

Reach carbon-neutral operations and a 
carbon-neutral value chain in 2025 and 
2040 respectively

To achieve carbon neutral operations by 2025, Schneider Electric 

will compensate residual Scopes 1 & 2 GHG emissions with quality 

carbon offsets. Similarly, by 2040, the Group aims to compensate 

its end-to-end carbon footprint.

Since 2011, Schneider has invested in the Livelihood Carbon Fund 

(LCF) and renewed its engagement with the LCF2 and LCF3 funds. 

These funds invest into three kinds of projects combining climate 

change resilience with strong social and economic impact: 

1. agroforestry and regenerative agriculture (which combines 

productivity and biodiversity restoration);

2. reforestation and restoration of key natural ecosystems, 

including mangrove restoration (mangroves are powerful carbon 

sequestration agents and natural barriers to coastal areas);

3. rural energy (the fuel-efficient cookstoves distributed by 

Livelihoods decreases wood consumption by half, preserves 

forests, and mitigates climate change).

The return of the fund is measured in carbon credits from the 

highest available standards (VERRA and Gold Standard). To date, 

those credits have not been used to compensate the Group’s GHG 

emissions, but some have been used to compensate emissions 

from the Schneider Electric Paris Marathon.

  Read more about Livelihoods in  

chapter 2.6 pages 224 to 241.

To fulfill Schneider’s Net-Zero targets, solely carbon removal will be 

used to “net” the company’s emissions. At this stage, the current 

market maturity, lack of standard definition regarding quality and 

durability of carbon removals make it challenging to define the 

nature and composition of the company’s carbon removal portfolio.

2.3 Leading on decarbonization

2.3.4 Investing to achieve the Group’s climate strategy 
and vision 
Schneider Electric has defined short and medium-term financial 

investments priorities in order to set the course towards its SBTi 

validated Net-Zero Commitment, and more broadly to meet its 

long-term commitments for climate, and to preserve natural 

resources.

These investments mainly relate to the following areas:

1. The evolution of the Group’s portfolio towards a greater 

proportion of Digital and Services, expanding the Group’s 

portfolio of connected solutions for efficiency and sustainability. 

Those investments typically vary year on year.

2. Research and Development (R&D) to design products that use 

fewer virgin resources, bring additional CO
2
 or resource 

efficiency for customers, have longer lifespans and lower 

end-of-life impacts, such as SF
6
-free products. 5.4% of turnover 

(about €1.8 billion) was invested in 2022, and the Group expects 

a step-up in strategic R&D investments over the coming years.

3. The decarbonization of the Group’s own operations, by investing 

progressively in energy efficiency, site electrification, renewable 

energies, and electric vehicles. In 2022, the Group has 

estimated the remaining cumulative investments needed until 

2030 at about €200 million. 

4. The decarbonization of the Group’s upstream supply chain and 

decoupling business growth from virgin resource consumption, 

by improving traceability, and controlling that Schneider 

Electric’s ESG expectations, including for climate (SSI #3) or 

resources (SSI #4 and #5), are met by its suppliers, while 

securing business resilience. Long-term investments required 

are under assessment.

Mergers and acquisitions 

In 2022, Schneider Electric acquired the remaining minority shares 

of AVEVA, which will allow the Group to accelerate its software 

strategy, building a single data-hub to bring together the digital 

industry twin and the energy twin of its customer’s enterprise, for 

holistic efficiency across domains, and across the lifecycle of 

assets and installations. The Group also performed early-stage 

acquisitions with EnergySage, Autogrid, EV Connect, and QMerit, 

and all of them are part of the new energy landscape, maximizing 

digitization and energy efficiency. Such investments can typically 

greatly vary year on year.

Redesigned investment tools and processes to 

embed low-carbon and resource criteria 

In order to track and steer its low-carbon investments, the Group’s 

investment monitoring and approval tool was redesigned in 2022 in 

order to:

• prioritize low-carbon investments, with a dedicated validation 

workflow; 

• monitor investments to decarbonize its own operations, notably 

for Zero-CO
2
 sites (SSE #1).

 

This process will improve both qualitative and quantitative 

information on individual low-carbon investments, thereby 

facilitating decision-making.

Investments in R&D 

About 99% of the Group’s carbon footprint are either related to 

upstream emissions from the transportation and transformation of 

raw materials by its suppliers, or to downstream emissions from 

product use or end-of-life that all depend on product design and 

R&D investments.

Schneider has been embedding environmental considerations into 

product design for more than 15 years, since the creation of its 

internal Green PremiumTM label. In 2022, the Group revamped its 

EcoDesignWayTM process to better manage the environmental 

impact throughout the lifecycle of products, and to coordinate 

efforts across the value chain. In addition to that, Schneider is 

reinforcing its process at an early stage of product development, 

so that all future generations of products achieve substantial 

carbon footprint savings, meaning that any new product developed 

by the Group will result less greenhouse gases than the previous 

generation.

Schneider has been stepping up its investment in R&D, both in 

value and as a percentage of Group revenues, investing about 

4.8% of its turnover in R&D between 2012 and 2016, 5.1% between 

2017 and 2021, 5.4% in 2022 and, as outlined during its 2021 

Capital Markets Day, expects a step-up in strategic R&D 

investments over the coming years with a strong focus on ensuring 

return on investment. In 2022, this represented an investment in 

R&D of approximately €1.8 billion. The Group estimates that about 

90% of its innovation is either strictly green or neutral according to 

its Impact revenues methodology. More details on Schneider’s 

Impact revenues and EU Taxonomy indicators is provided in 

Chapter 2.1.9 page 100.

An example of investment priority is on SF
6
-free products, in line 

with Schneider Electric’s target to substitute 100% of relevant offers 

with SF
6
-free medium voltage technologies by 2025 (SSE #2). For 

SF
6
-free products, more than €100M have already been invested in 

both R&D and CapEx in factories, and a total future spend 

(2023-2027) close to €100M more is already planned.

Decarbonizing operations 

For the past years, the Group has invested between €5 million and 

€15 million each year in energy efficiency, deploying its own 

solutions in its sites, which enabled equivalent savings on energy 

costs, and a reduction of 67% of Scopes 1 & 2 CO
2
 emissions 

compared to 2017. The last miles in Schneider’s journey to be 

“Net-Zero ready” in 2030, achieving 90% CO
2
 reductions vs. 2017 

will be the hardest. 

To support this objective, an estimated €200 million will be invested 

by 2030, in technologies such as heat pumps to substitute comfort 

gas or to install electric vehicle chargers. Such investments are 

usually not linear year on year as large projects may take a few 

years to design and implement, and opportunities at a given time 

depend on the local economic and regulatory context.

2.3.5 Decarbonizing the Group’s operations by 2030
Emissions from operations are the Scopes 1 & 2 of the Group’s 

carbon footprint, representing 229,348 tonnes of CO
2
e in 2022, and 

0.4% of the company’s GHG footprint. Direct Scope 1 emissions 

result mostly from the natural gas consumption of sites that are not 

yet electrified, from the fuel used by company cars as well as a 

small amount from SF
6
 leakages in a limited number of 

manufacturing plants. Indirect Scope 2 emissions result primarily 

from the electricity consumption of sites (manufacturing and 

offices). 

To deliver its “Net-Zero ready” target on these emissions by 2030, 

the Group leverages its Power and Building EcoStruxure™ IoT 

architectures, to monitor and optimize energy consumption, 

manage assets and grid infrastructure, manage distributed 

renewable energy resources and electricity load, and power 

electric vehicles. 

Schneider set best-in-class operational ambitions engaging with 

the Climate Group on their EP100, EV100 and RE100 programs. 

The Group’s approach has three pillars:

• save: foster energy conservation and avoid SF
6
 leakages;

• electrify: switch from gas or car fuel to electricity;

• decarbonize electricity: use renewable energy, either from 

onsite generation, or through external procurement of renewable 

power.

2.3.5.1 Group energy policy and 
management system

Group Energy Policy

The Group’s Energy Policy requires sites to implement the following 

actions: 

• improve energy efficiency, sustainably decoupling energy 

consumption from activity growth;

• decarbonize energy consumption;

• adopt Schneider’s own Energy Management and Automation 

EcoStruxure™ solutions, wherever feasible, to showcase the 

Group’s solutions for customers and business partners, and 

help them embark on an energy excellence journey.

Progress against these goals is tracked in the Group’s Schneider 

Sustainability Impact (SSI) and Schneider Sustainability Essentials 

(SSE) programs. Relevant SSI and SSE targets are SSE #1, SSE #3, 

SSE #4, SSE #5, and SSE #7.

ISO 50001 Energy Management System

The Group certifies all sites consuming over 5GWh with ISO 50001. 

As of end 2022, 132 Schneider Electric sites are ISO 50001 

certified as part of the Group’s Integrated Management System to 

drive energy excellence, focusing on the highest energy-

consuming sites. ISO 50001 certification is complementary to ISO 

14001 certification and enables the company to define and sustain 

robust energy governance. With the support of this certification, 

sites are able to understand and reduce their energy footprint. 

Resource Advisor data management system

Global, regional, and site energy reporting is delivered with the 

EcoStruxure™ Resource Advisor software suite. EcoStruxure™

Resource Advisor provides a data visualization and analysis 

application that aggregates volumes of raw energy data into 

actionable information. EcoStruxure™ Resource Advisor is a 

cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) model. It provides 

reduced solution costs, increased data storage capacity, and a 

flexible and mobile energy solution enhanced by Schneider expert 

services.

2.3.5.2 EP100: deliver efficiency from the 
inside out

Schneider Electric measures its energy program in a variety of 

ways. Two such ways are energy productivity and energy 

efficiency. On the one hand, energy productivity is the amount of 

output the Group produces vs. the amount of energy consumed 

(turnover/MWh), and the goal is to increase this value by both 

increasing the Group’s business performance while simultaneously 

reducing the energy consumed in its operations. Energy efficiency, 

on the other hand, uses linear regression models to predict how 

much energy the Group would consume based on various inputs 

(production, weather, worked hours, etc.) vs. the actual energy 

consumed. The goal here is to reduce energy consumption 

compared to predicted value by driving energy efficiency in its 

operations.

Schneider Electric has been a member of Energy Productivity 100 

(EP100), a Climate Group initiative, since 2017. Schneider’s target is 

to double energy productivity by 2030 against the 2005 baseline, 

which means doubling the economic output from every unit of 

energy consumed within 25 years. In 2022, the Group achieved 

129% energy productivity (against a 2030 target of 100%) 

compared to 2005. This huge jump compared to 2021 performance 

(76%) is a result of strong business performance and intensified 

energy savings efforts. Achieving its commitment 8 years early, 

Schneider demonstrates the feasibility of decoupling business 

growth from energy consumption. Simultaneously it tangibly 

illustrates Schneider products, solutions, and services are a core 

foundation to energy saving opportunities. The Group will re-

evaluate its energy productivity program in 2023 to identify its next 

ambition.

SSE #5

15% energy efficiency in our sites

A good example to illustrate the SSE #5 program is the 

Wuxi plant in China. Wuxi is an electronic manufacturing 

site that manages a large product mix. As one of the 

Group’s Smart Operations showcase sites, the Wuxi 

campus embraces Schneider Electric’s 4IR-based 

EcoStruxure™ technologies to rebuild its end-to-end value 

chain. Using the latest digital tools like automated supply 

chain management, 5G-supported flexible production, 

augmented reality, and digital twins, the site has achieved 

improved flexibility, efficiency, time-to-market, and 

sustainability. These implementations have earned the 

plant the following recognitions: 

• 2021 End-to-End Advanced Manufacturing Lighthouse 

by World Economic Forum (WEF);

• Schneider Zero-CO
2
 Site since 2021;

• 2021 Carbon neutral certification by Bureau Veritas;

• 2019 Green Factory by the Ministry of Industry and 

Information Technology of China.

The site has achieved the following results by implementing 

Schneider Electric EcoStruxure™ solutions in its site: 

• Building Operation (EBO): EBO AI- box for Heating 

ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) operation 

optimization reduced energy consumption of the HVAC 

system by 14% in 2022 compared to 2020;

• Power Monitoring Expert (PME): Optimizing with 

Power and Buildings has driven 721MWh energy 

reduction, and 38.4% water use reduction compared to 

2020;

• Microgrid Advisor (EMA): 100% of site energy sourced 

from renewables, with onsite solar power and Power 

Purchase Agreements (PPAs).

Despite being low consumers of energy compared with other 

industries, due to its discrete and assembly-based industrial 

processes, Schneider has had a clear obsession with efficiency 

since long before its EP100 commitment. The Schneider Energy 

Action program uses site energy experts along with Schneider’s 

Sustainability Business consulting team to report and analyze 

energy consumption, identify energy saving opportunities, and 

deploy actions. Since 2005, the Group has fixed annual objectives 

for energy efficiency each year. Schneider met or exceeded its 

energy efficiency goals during the previous four Company 

programs (2009–2011, 2012–2014, 2015–2017, and 2018–2020), by 

achieving 10%, 13%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. In 2021, the 

Group renewed its commitment to improve energy efficiency by 

another 15% between 2019 and 2025, tracked under SSE #5. 7.8% 

were achieved in 2022, totaling over 50% reductions between 2009 

and 2022.

The Group measures energy efficiency in its 200+ largest 

energy-consuming sites, which account for 85% of the total energy 

consumption of the Group. At the end of 2022, this program 

enabled the following achievements:

• around €6 million and 75.7 million kWh were saved in 2022 

compared to the 2019 baseline;

• around €5.8 million were invested, of which €5.5 million were 

capital expenses and €0.3 million were operating expenses.

 

Schneider Electric leverages the power of its EcoStruxure™ 

architecture to deliver energy savings, and uses its own sites as 

showcases for customers and business partners. In its smart 

factories and distribution centers, the Group implements the 

three-layer EcoStruxure™ architecture, with connected meters and 

sensors to monitor energy consumption and quality, Edge Control 

Power Monitoring software to optimize daily operations, and 

analytics and services to benchmark performance and optimize 

energy and maintenance. Asset Performance Management also 

enables the Group to optimize operations and maintenance, for 

maximum uptime and longevity. 

Five of Schneider’s Smart Factories have been designated as 4th 

Industrial Revolution (4IR) Advanced Lighthouses by the World 

Economic Forum (WEF), with the newest 2022 member Hyderabad 

in India joining four others in China, France, the US, and Indonesia. 

In 2022, the Le Vaudreuil plant in France joined the Lexington 

facility in the US as a Sustainability Lighthouse designated by the 

WEF. At the time, these two factories were among only six 

worldwide facilities receiving this new recognition by the WEF. With 

its Smart Factory and Distribution Center (DC) programs, the Group 

has deployed advanced manufacturing technologies in over 120 

smart factories and DCs in the past 6 years.

In offices, Schneider Electric’s EcoStruxure™ solutions Building and 

Workplace Advisor enable analytics of Building Management 

System data alongside space, utilization, and comfort metrics. 

These smart solutions enable the Group and site leaders to actively 

benchmark, and develop occupancy and facility management 

strategies to ensure continuous right sizing of its footprint and site 

occupation to keep energy consumption and resultant emissions to 

a minimum, while reducing costs and improving employee 

experience and comfort.

2.3.5.3 RE100: switch to 100% renewable 
electricity by 2030

In 2022, electricity consumption in Schneider Electric’s sites 

generated 98,312 tonnes of CO
2
e emissions, i.e. 59% of emissions 

from energy consumption at sites. In 2017, Schneider joined 

Renewable Energy 100 (RE100) and committed to sourcing 100% 

of its electricity from renewables by 2030, with an intermediary 

target of 90% by 2025 (SSE #3).

Group is committed to reducing the amount of unbundled certificates and 

increasing the amount of onsite renewables and bundled certificates as it 

moves towards 2030. 

3 Contracted unbundled renewable energy credits include options such as 

Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) and unbundled Renewable Energy 

Certificates (RECs). Contracted bundled renewable energy credits include 

options such as “green tariffs”, power purchase agreements (PPAs), virtual 

PPAs (VPPAs), bundled RECs, etc.

Since 2017, Schneider Electric has accelerated renewable 

electricity sourcing and the installation of on-site solar panels, 

coupled with EcoStruxure™ metering and power architectures. As 

its program has progressed, the Group has progressively 

increased the share of renewable electricity coming from onsite 

renewable generation and bundled renewable electricity sourcing.

2.3 Leading on decarbonization

The Group will continue to focus on additionality where feasible and 

prioritize onsite sourcing of renewables or bundled renewable 

electricity opportunities. It will progressively reduce the reliance on 

unbundled certificates as it moves towards its 2030 goal of 100% 

renewable electricity. Critical to the success of this program is 

leveraging Schneider Electric’s Sustainability Business (SB), an 

expert in sourcing renewable electricity with additionality benefits. 

SB helps Schneider and many customers source renewable 

electricity. Their expertise on renewable electricity markets around 

the world is key to finding solutions in less mature renewable 

markets as well as monitoring the evolution of marketing offerings, 

funding mechanisms, and sourcing requirements (e.g., RE100 2022 

revised technical criteria).

90% of electricity sourced from 
renewables

In 2022, 14 countries signed contracts to source 100% 

renewable electricity for Schneider operations in their 

country, and 203 ISO 14001 sites sourced 100% renewable 

electricity which accounted for 60% of the Group’s 

measured electricity consumed. Additionally, there are 56 

sites generating onsite renewable electricity, for a total of 

23,000 MWh. Onsite generation and bundled certificates 

now account for 64% of the Group’s total renewable 

electricity consumption, up from 58% in 2021.

2.3.5.4 EV100: shift 100% of company fleet 
to electric vehicles

Company cars generated 56,856 tonnes of CO
2
e emissions in 

2022, 25% of Schneider Electric’s Scopes 1 & 2 emissions. 

To reduce these emissions, Schneider looks at opportunities to 

reduce the use of cars for travel by improving the accessibility of 

sites, with commuting shuttles, secure bicycle storage, personal 

lockers and changing areas, as well as pedestrian-friendly access 

paths connecting to local routes. The Group also promotes flexible 

working arrangements to avoid unnecessary or avoidable trips 

thereby reducing travel-induced emissions by enabling employees 

to connect remotely, to work from home, and at customer sites. 

Additionally, Schneider began its journey towards 100% electric 

cars by 2030 in 2019, with an intermediary target of one-third by 

2025 (SSE #7). The Group demonstrates this commitment by being 

a member of Electric Vehicles 100 (EV100), a Climate Group 

initiative bringing together forward-looking companies committed 

to accelerating the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and making 

electric transport the new normal by 2030. At the end of 2022, 

electric vehicles represented 14% of the Group’s corporate car 

fleet.

The United Kingdom (UK) has significantly accelerated the 

deployment of electric vehicles, starting in 2019 with less 

than a 2% electrified fleet and achieving 41% at the end of 

2022. The country has achieved this strong growth despite 

facing global challenges around supply chain shortages, 

increased vehicle costs and delays in infrastructure 

deployment. UK maintains its vision to roll out a green fleet 

in line with Schneider Electric’s values, ensuring the 

deployment strategy is agile, and provides the right vehicle 

to each driver without penalizing the employee or the 

performance of the zone.

2.3.5.5 Going further with Zero-CO
2
 sites

The Group aims to eliminate fossil-based energy consumption from 

150 of its sites by 2025 through electrification and sourcing 

renewable electricity, and biofuels.

In 2022, emissions from energy consumption at sites accounted for 

167,715 tonnes of CO
2
e, which is 73% of Scopes 1 & 2 emissions, of 

which 53,895 tonnes from natural gas consumption. The path 

towards “Net-Zero ready” operations by 2030 will require more than 

just powering sites with renewable electricity. While many 

applications can be electrified, some applications from industrial 

sites are more challenging to electrify with current technologies. As 

such, Schneider Electric has begun identifying applications at sites 

that currently have electrification alternatives as well as those which 

will require the use of fossil-free fuel solutions under the current 

circumstances. 

As a general rule, a Zero-CO
2
 site emits no greenhouse gases 

related to energy and monitors energy digitally, meaning:

• no fossil fuels from energy consumption (exceptionally up to 3% 

of a site’s total energy can be exempted from the fossil-free 

requirement, on a case-by-case basis, if the application does 

not have a feasible fossil-free alternative on the market. In 2022, 

15 out of 77 Schneider’s Zero-CO
2
 sites benefitted from this 

exception);

• digital energy monitoring;

• no SF
6
 leaks;

• no CO
2
 offsets.

Beyond using renewable electricity and fuels, it remains critical to 

continuously improve energy efficiency. That is why the program 

also requires digital energy monitoring. For large sites, this means 

installing meters to monitor the site’s significant energy uses and 

connecting them to systems like EcoStruxure™ Power Monitoring 

Expert, EcoStruxure™ Resource Advisor, or EcoStruxure™ Building 

Operation to ensure real-time monitoring of energy consumption, 

which allows for active energy management and efficiency 

improvement.

In 2022, thanks to the Zero-CO
2
 sites, Schneider reduced 54,000 

tonnes of CO
2
.

 sites 

AHM is a site located in Hungary, established in 1964. The 

site is part of Schneider Electric’s Global ETO Power 

System and manufactures medium voltage switchgears 

(PIX, MCSet). In 2022, as part of the company’s Zero-CO
2

sites commitment, the site worked to electrify and 

decarbonize a paint line, and oven renewal process for its 

equipment, which had been built over forty years earlier.

With the help of governmental subsidies and the Hungarian 

Investment Promotion Agency (HIPA), the site achieved 

three major successes:

• surface pre-treatment modernization which resulted in 

less usage of chemicals and decreased water 

consumption;

• automatized powder recovery unit which reduced 

painting powder consumption by 70%;

• 100% renewable electricity powered drying oven, which 

reduced the natural gas consumption of the entire 

paintline by 33%.

In 2023, the site will implement actions to fully power the 

paintline with 100% renewable electricity, reducing CO
2
 by 

nearly 140 tonnes annually. This transformation to electrify 

its operations, combined with Schneider Electric Building 

and Power Management technologies, highlights one of the 

many actions the Group is taking in its commitment to 

decarbonize its operations. For the benefit of customers 

and the industrial community, that illustrates the importance 

of electrification and renewable sourcing, and 

demonstrates the real and tangible opportunities and 

solutions that exist today.

2.3.5.6 Reduce SF
6
 leakage on sites

SF
6
 is an excellent gas in terms of insulating properties, which is 

why it is commonly used in the electric power industry. Yet, SF
6
 is a 

harmful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25,200 

times higher than CO
2
 over 100 years. While Schneider Electric’s 

product portfolio is progressively moving away from SF
6
 (see 

additional information in section 2.3.7.1, page 170), SF
6
 is used in 13 

of the Group’s manufacturing sites. Handling this greenhouse gas 

can inevitably result in leakages despite having good practices in 

place. Converted into CO
2
-equivalent, these leakages represented 

4,777 tonnes of CO
2
e in 2022, which is 2% of emissions from 

Scopes 1 & 2. The GHG emissions at end-of-life is 4,477,721 tonnes 

of CO
2
e, which is 7.3% of total GHG emissions of 2022.

All the Group’s manufacturing sites handling SF
6
 gas in their 

processes are working hard to actively reduce SF
6
 leaks and 

emissions during the different phases of their activities. A 

worldwide community of SF
6
 experts shares best practices for 

processes, including procedures, equipment, and training. 

In 2022, an advanced and digital system of emission monitoring 

has been designed, to be deployed at the Group’s biggest 

manufacturing sites in 2023. This technology allows for continuous 

measurement of SF
6
 concentration in enclosures around devices 

and piping networks. In the event of any deviations, an alarm 

notification is automatically sent to maintenance teams. 

Additionally, the seal testing processes of the products are mainly 

carried out with helium instead of SF
6
. This method ensures that no 

emissions come from non-compliant enclosures during production.

Thanks to this global activity and to the commissioning of efficient 

equipment, the Group achieved 0.08% leakage rate globally in 

2022, exceeding the 0.11% target set for 2022 and systematically 

decreasing from 0.26% since 2018. This SF
6
 leakage reduction 

enabled the avoidance of 900 tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent in 2022 

versus 2021. 

2.3.5.7 Energy sufficiency plan in Europe

In 2022, Europe faced an unprecedented energy crisis: risks on 

energy supply (mainly electricity and gas), along with escalating 

prices placed pressure on businesses and households. On 

companies especially, this had an impact on costs, profits, and – in 

some cases – business continuity. 

Tackling Europe’s energy security problem and the climate crisis 

are two sides of the same coin. Reducing both our use and 

dependence on fossil fuels, increasing electrification and the 

transition to renewable energy are now essential to tackling both 

the current energy crisis and reducing Europe’s greenhouse gas 

emissions.

In this context, Schneider Electric implemented an energy 

sufficiency plan to adapt quickly to the fast-changing energy 

situation. Criticality assessments were conducted at Schneider’s 

sites across Europe, assessing the potential likelihood that 

electricity or gas supplies may be cut. Business continuity plans 

were proactively put in place to ensure the Group is able to 

continue to serve customers through this time of uncertainty. 

Schneider adopted European Commission recommendations on 

energy consumption reduction as targets for sites in Europe: gas 

consumption by 15%, and electricity consumption by 10%. 

From August to December 2022, Schneider Electric succeeded in 

reducing gas consumption by more than 32% and electricity 

consumption by more than 10% for its operations across Europe, 

as compared to the same period in 2021 and with no disruption to 

operations or service to customers.

  More about Schneider Electric’s management  

of the energy crisis can be found on Schneider’s blog.

Spotlight: sufficiency actions at “The Hive”, 

Schneider Electric’s Paris headquarters

Schneider Electric is responding to the energy crisis with a plan 

that supports France’s EcoWatt charter and aims to reduce energy 

consumption by 10% and shed or shift loads to avoid demand 

peaks when required.

Enabled by integrated EcoStruxure solutions, the indoor 

temperature at this Schneider building has been reduced a few 

degrees, with ventilation and heating start times adjusted. In 

addition, hot water to washroom taps has been cut all year long. 

The kitchen lighting and ventilation schedule is optimized. Corridor 

lighting is reduced from 100% to between 40 and 70%, and car 

park lighting hours are reduced. All employees have been 

encouraged to take additional steps.

In total, electricity consumption has been reduced by almost 300 

MWh per year. The facility can also automate responses to EcoWatt 

peak period alerts, reducing demand by more than 500 kW by 

controlling heating and ventilation, limiting or shifting EV charging, 

and more.

2.3.6 Decarbonizing the Group’s supply chain by 2050
In 2022, upstream emissions in Scope 3 accounted for 8.6 million 

tonnes of CO
2
e, which is 14% of the total carbon footprint of the 

company. Purchases are the predominant source if emissions, and 

transportation of goods make a significant contribution as well.

Decarbonizing the world at scale requires immediate collective 

action. Schneider Electric is already taking concrete actions to 

meet its absolute 25% reduction across its value chain by 2030 and 

to be on track for its net-zero emissions by 2050. This includes:

• the Zero Carbon Project (SSI #3), which aims at halving 

emissions from operations of the top 1,000 suppliers;

• sourcing more and more green materials, including materials 

such as steel and plastics with lower carbon footprints (SSI #4);

• increasing the CO
2
 efficiency of transportation of goods 

(SSE #4).

2.3.6.1 The Zero Carbon Project 

Carbon emissions from Schneider Electric’s procurement of goods 

and services (emissions from its suppliers up to the last tier) 

represented 7.6 million tonnes of CO
2
e in 2022, which is 12% of its 

cradle-to-grave carbon footprint, and 88% of its cradle-to-gate 

industrial footprint. This is the largest contributor to the Group’s 

Scope 3 upstream emissions. The Zero Carbon Project (TZCP), 

launched in April 2021, is the first step of a journey to reduce the 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Schneider Electric’s 

suppliers. 

The ambition of TZCP is to collaborate with 1,000 suppliers and 

reduce their operational (Scopes 1 & 2) GHG emissions by 50% by 

2025 (SSI #3).

Participating suppliers are required to make public commitments 

for their reduction targets and share the emission reduction 

progress with Schneider. The participating companies in the 

program are based in more than 50 countries, represent 60 

procurement categories and vary in terms of carbon maturity and 

size. To adapt to this diversity, the participating suppliers are 

allowed flexibility to customize their reduction plans by defining 

their own base year and baseline and adopting relevant reduction 

targets and time frames. 

The fundamental actions that need to be implemented by suppliers, 

as part of this program include:

• quantifying their GHG emissions (Scopes 1 & 2 are mandatory 

and Scope 3 is optional for now);

• establishing an ambitious emission reduction target;

• implementing an action plan to achieve the target.

As of 2022, more than 1,000 suppliers have committed to 

participate in the program, achieving an overall operational 

emission (Scopes 1 & 2) reduction of 10%.

The GHG emission reduction reported in Schneider Sustainability 

Impact (SSI) #3, is measured as the average supplier carbon 

intensity reduction for the proportion of the reporting suppliers out 

of 1,000 suppliers. This normalization helps achieve a more reliable 

picture of the overall progress of all participating suppliers.

The extensive capacity building efforts towards the quantification of 

carbon footprint and decarbonization actions have resulted in: 

• increased participation and quality of carbon accounting 

response from suppliers. As of December 2022, 946 suppliers 

out of 1,013 participating suppliers have calculated their CO
2
e 

emissions. This is 6 times higher than at the end of 2021, when 

126 suppliers reported their CO
2
e calculations. 

• strong supplier actions, resulting in ~10% GHG reduction for 

1,000 suppliers vs. 1% reduction at the end of 2021. Schneider 

Electric remains committed to working together with its partners 

to strengthen their efforts for stronger decarbonization. The 

Group will continue to record its suppliers’ GHG declarations on 

an annual basis to ensure the most accurate and updated 

information is available for reporting performance.

1,000 suppliers’ operations by 50%

To accelerate the decarbonization journey of Schneider 

Electric suppliers, partnership is at the heart of The Zero 

Carbon Project. This is especially important as over 70% of 

participating suppliers had no previous experience of GHG 

emission quantification. Schneider Electric deployed an 

extensive supplier support framework. This framework 

focuses on three focal areas:

1. Capacity building

2. Digital support

3. Expert consultation

Capacity building

One of the first barriers for suppliers to embark on their 

sustainability journey is measuring their carbon footprint and 

understanding what they can do to reduce their carbon footprint. 

Extending Schneider’s spirit and effort of collaboration from the 

quantification of the GHG emissions to the implementation of 

decarbonization actions, an acceleration plan was developed and 

deployed with the suppliers. This acceleration plan identified 

various levers of emission reduction that can be implemented by 

the suppliers. Each lever was analyzed in detail and compared with 

the characteristics of the participating supply base to determine 

the reduction potential per lever. To increase the practicality of 

implementation, individual actions were identified for each lever. 

More than 130 live, training, mentoring and experience sharing 

sessions were conducted for suppliers in a variety of settings 

(group; focused; 1-1). Building on the foundation of the end-to-end 

decarbonization training delivered in 2021, a common feedback 

received from suppliers was the need for guidance and 

implementation support for the first steps towards decarbonization. 

Schneider Electric defined a simple step-by-step roadmap of 

decarbonization, and explained each step in detail. 

iAccelerate

To drive and scale up the adoption of emission reduction levers by 

suppliers, Schneider Electric adopted an innovative approach and 

curated a dedicated workshop under the aegis of “iAccelerate Zero 

Carbon Day”. The India Middle East Africa (IMEA) and East Asia 

Japan (EAJ) regions of Schneider Electric, led by the local 

Procurement leadership teams successfully piloted its execution in 

Singapore and this is now being rolled out to other regions. 

The fundamental idea behind iAccelerate workshop is that 

suppliers lack the practical knowledge to decarbonize, and if this 

information gap were filled, they would readily adopt emission 

reduction practices. To ensure this gap was bridged, a suitability 

analysis was conducted to identify the appropriate decarbonization 

levers and the specific actions that are feasible and applicable 

across various geographies. Specific diagnostic tools were then 

developed and shared with suppliers to analyze their own 

operations and identify their most relevant actions. These 

diagnostic tools included:

1. Low-hanging energy efficiency checklist

2. Solar energy suitability calculator

3. Digital emission calculator

In addition to the diagnostic, which was self-administered by the 

suppliers, subject matter experts were identified within the 

Schneider Electric ecosystem. The main task of these experts was 

to demystify and explain to the suppliers in very practical terms, for 

each action, what needs to be done, how it impacts their in-house 

processes and what are the overall benefits to the organization. In 

addition, service/solution providers were identified who can 

support suppliers in the execution of these actions. The Schneider 

Electric procurement team executed an expression of interest to 

identify the right companies and held screening discussion to 

ensure they were aligned with the idea and objective. This created 

a pool of service providers, in case they were needed. 

Following this background preparation, the suppliers were 

engaged in an intensive five-week pre-workshop process to review 

the GHG emission data, results of diagnostics and commitment of 

the leadership to overall decarbonization. During the iAccelerate 

Zero Carbon Day, the supplier teams were able to listen to and 

understand subject matter experts who explained how individual 

actions can help their companies, and subsequently were able to 

visit the roadshow organized by the service/solution providers and 

engage on implementation modalities. 

The purpose of the iAccelerate workshop is to provide an overview 

of actions and approaches to decarbonize and no commercial 

interests are associated. The suppliers are free to learn and 

discuss with the stakeholders, to treat it as a educational 

experience and then to explore the market to find the most suitable 

partner to engage for implementing decarbonization measures. 

The power of peer-to-peer experience sharing was also harnessed. 

Separate sessions were organized with participating companies 

who are leading the decarbonization journey, to share their 

experiences and lessons learnt with other suppliers. We are 

thankful to Henkel AG and ArcelorMittal teams, who shared the 

actions and processes implemented in their companies and 

provided practical suggestions for enhancing decarbonization 

efforts.

A dedicated series on renewable energy procurement was 

organized, enabling experts from the cleantech domain to explain 

various renewable energy options including onsite/offsite 

installations and various market instruments that can be adopted, 

including suitability conditions. 

The outcome of the iAccelerate event resulted in the strong 

acceleration in the decarbonization commitment from the supplier 

partners. As a result of the exercise, the emission reduction 

forecast for the two regions increased.

Digital support 

To ensure that participating suppliers have access to all the latest 

knowledge, research, trainings, and tools for decarbonization, the 

Group developed a dedicated web portal on decarbonization, 

which is exclusively available to TZCP member companies. The 

portal hosts all the key trainings conducted so far. To automate the 

supplier emission calculation, a digital tool was developed and 

made available to suppliers. This tool removes the need to identify 

appropriate emission factors and manual calculations. The 

suppliers can simply collect and enter the usage data of various 

energy sources and the tool refers to the appropriate emission 

sources and gives the emission sources, standardizing and 

improving the quality of the data reported by suppliers. 

Supply Chain Renewable Initiative

A dedicated program called “Supply Chain Renewable Initiative” 

(SCRI) is under implementation to help suppliers with low electricity 

demand to access renewable electricity.

Expert consultation 

Suppliers can engage deeply with Schneider, and leverage its 

in-house expertise. Several visits of factories and offices were 

organized for suppliers to learn about operational decarbonization 

solutions. Specific knowledge-sharing was done on energy 

management, field services and automation. 

In addition, Schneider leveraged its partnership with organizations 

delivering best-in-class trainings. The Group invited 500 suppliers 

who are CDP members to respond to the survey and use their 

resources. In Singapore, Schneider launched a SME kickstarter 

decarbonization program, leveraging incentives offered by the 

Government to SME to decarbonize.

2.3.6.2 Buying more Green Materials

Schneider Electric has committed to increasing the volume of 

green materials in products to 50% by 2025, for about 30% of its 

procurement volume, and is tracking quarterly progress as part of 

the Schneider Sustainability Impact program (SSI #4). 

While this program does not focus solely on CO
2
, but also mitigates 

other environmental impacts such as resources, biodiversity or 

toxicity, it will contribute to reducing the Group’s Scope 3 upstream 

emissions, in line with its Net-Zero Commitment. To achieve this 

ambition, Schneider is actively participating with industry leaders in 

dedicated working groups to become a change agent of the 

low-carbon economy while enhancing the traceability of materials. 

At the end of 2022, 18% of materials in scope were qualified as 

“Green”.

  Read more details on the Green Materials and Sustainable 

Packaging programs in chapter 2.4 “Being efficient with 

resources”, page 182, and in chapter 2.7 “Methodology 

and audit of indicators” page 242.

2.3 Leading on decarbonization

2.3.6.3 CO
2
 efficiency in the transportation 

of goods

Schneider Electric uses a robust transport network to connect 

factories and distribution centers, and to deliver to customers. The 

related CO
2
 emissions are part of the Scope 3 upstream emissions 

of the Group’s carbon footprint, as this activity is performed by 

external transport suppliers. 

In 2022, emissions from the transportation of goods represented 

1.1 million tonnes of CO
2
, which is 2% of the Scope 3 upstream 

emissions company-wide. The transportation that is directly paid 

by the Group (about 60% of the freight CO
2
 emissions) is closely 

monitored, with primary data coming from detailed shipment 

information from the top 70% of transport suppliers. The CO
2

emissions are then calculated including the emissions from the full 

lifecycle of fuels, which means upstream emissions in the energy 

sector and the direct emissions at point of use. 

From 2015 to 2017, CO
2
 emissions intensity from transportation was 

reduced by 10%, and an additional decrease of 8.4% was 

achieved between 2018 and 2020. With its Schneider Sustainability 

Essentials (SSE) 2021-2025, the Group aims to further reduce CO
2

intensity in transportation by 15% compared to 2020 (SSE #4).

For 2022, continued shortages and supply chain challenges early 

in the year led to the use of more expedited modes of transport. 

Additionally, internal focus on building resilience within operations 

through increased regionalization of manufacturing resulted in an 

increased use of regional road freight and a decrease in 

international sea freight. Together, these factors shifted the 

transportation mode mix, resulting in a 7.7% increase in transport 

CO
2
 emissions intensity compared to 2020. Looking forward, as 

operations normalize, there will be a continued focus internally to 

optimize the transportation mode mix towards lower CO
2
 options.

As part of its efforts to reduce the CO
2
 intensity of 

transportation, Schneider Electric is focusing on both the 

optimization of its transport networks, modes, and 

utilization, and on piloting low-carbon transportation 

technologies such as electric vehicles. 

For example, for one of the Group’s critical transport lanes, 

from Singapore to France, a multi-model solution was 

implemented to replace airfreight with a hybrid sea 

freight-airfreight solution. This achieved an estimated 47% 

annual reduction in CO
2
 emissions for this flow. Additional 

multimodal opportunities have been deployed globally and 

new ones are being identified as the Group seeks to 

reduce the overall impact of airfreight emissions.

In Europe, an annual road freight optimization contest is 

held internally within plant and distribution center 

operations to reduce the total number of outbound road 

freight trips. This has led to a reduction in the number of 

trucks used by 419 and resulted in saving 347 tonnes of 

CO
2
 across 14 sites in the past two years, with plans to 

expand this best practice globally to scale the CO
2
 savings 

opportunity.

In 2022, Schneider joined the World Economic Forum (WEF) First 

Movers Coalition, a global initiative harnessing the purchasing 

power of companies to decarbonize seven “hard to abate” 

industrial sectors that currently account for 30% of global 

emissions: aluminum, aviation, chemicals, concrete, shipping, steel, 

and trucking; along with innovative Carbon Removal technologies. 

The 50+ companies who make up the Coalition seek to send a 

powerful market signal to commercialize zero-carbon technologies. 

To jump-start the market, the coalition’s members commit in 

advance to purchasing a proportion of the industrial materials and 

long-distance transportation they need from suppliers using 

near-zero or zero-carbon solutions, despite the premium cost.

  More about the First Movers Coalition of the World 

Economic Forum can be found on the organization’s page

Schneider made an initial commitment to the aviation working 

group to replace at least 5% of conventional jet fuel use with 

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. This commitment to the 

use of SAF, in conjunction with a focus on reducing company use of 

air freight, will have a significant impact on Schneider’s carbon 

footprint from the hard-to-abate aviation sector. Additionally, the 

Group further enhanced CO
2
 reporting capabilities to not only 

report on freight CO
2
 footprint, but to provide analytics to facilitate 

engagement internally, and with transport suppliers, on 

decarbonization initiatives.

Collaborative engagement with the Group’s transportation 

suppliers will continue, focusing on the pillars of optimizing existing 

transport footprint, as well as supporting and piloting advanced low 

carbon transportation technologies across all transport modes – 

air, sea, and overland freight.

Evidence of Schneider’s initiatives to mitigate the impact of 

transport-related CO
2
 emissions include:

• ongoing reviews globally of lead-time requirements, allowing a 

shift to lower CO
2
 emissions transport modes and introduction of 

multimodal solutions;

• network design optimization to move towards more direct flows 

or opportunities to source products closer to the customer;

• in all regions, pilot implementations of electric vehicles for final 

mile customer deliveries;

• in Asia, implementation of a rail solution from China to Singapore 

to replace existing air, sea, and road freight solutions;

• with the Group’s key transport providers, identifying 

opportunities to use sustainable fuel options where zero-

emission options are not available.

2.3 Leading on decarbonization

2.3.7 Decarbonizing the Group’s downstream emissions 
Downstream emissions are by far the largest category of emissions. 

They represent 86% of Schneider Electric’s footprint, and largely 

come from the electricity consumption by the Group’s customers 

during the use phase of the products. 

Schneider’s strategy to decarbonize its downstream emissions is 

articulated around 4 main pillars:

• innovating and eco-designing in product development: 

eco-design principles aim at reducing the environmental impact 

of products, including the product carbon footprint, for instance 

by increasing the energy efficiency of products in use phase;

• substituting all relevant offers with SF
6
-free medium voltage 

technologies by 2025: since end-of-life emissions from sold 

products are predominantly due to their SF
6
 content, this 

substitution will result in a significant drop in the downstream 

carbon footprint;

• using the Group’s voice for influencing the transition towards a 

more electric, digital, and decarbonized world;

• supporting customers in their own decarbonization journey by 

providing products and services that drive significant 

decarbonization of their operations.

  Ecodesign is developed in chapter 2.4 “Being efficient 

with resources”, page 180, and the decarbonization of 

customers with Schneider Electric’s products in section  

2.3.8, page 172.

2.3.7.1 Developing SF
6
-free offers and SF

6
 

recovery services 

The SF
6
 gas has excellent insulating properties and has therefore 

been widely used for building switchgear – especially medium 

voltage gear – for the past 30 years, as it allows a reduction in the 

size of the electrical equipment. The electric power industry uses 

roughly 80% of all SF
6
 produced worldwide, and the global 

installed base is still expected to grow by 75% by 2030. 

SF
6
-free AirSeT, a suite of award-winning medium 

voltage innovations

While helping ensure the safety and quality of certain medium 

voltage equipment, SF
6
 gas has a Global Warming Potential (GWP) 

25,200 times higher than CO
2
, making it one of the highest 

greenhouse gases. Schneider is therefore innovating its offers to 

move away from SF
6
 gas, as part of the SSE #2: 100% substitution 

with SF
6
-free medium voltage technologies by 2025. In 2021, 

Schneider’s promises to deliver new SF
6
-free medium voltage 

switchgear became a reality with the installation of innovative 

products at several customer sites. 2021 was the year of the 

industrialization of several new product lines, free of SF
6
, to prepare 

for the full commercial launch of this new generation of products. In 

2022, Schneider unveiled the latest equipment in the SF
6
-free 

medium voltage solutions contributing to the global fight against 

climate change, with GM AirSeT, a breakthrough primary gas-

insulated technology for electrical networks and demanding 

applications in industrial buildings and critical infrastructure. 

Schneider’s technology has been piloted at numerous electric 

utilities, infrastructure and buildings, by customers such as 

GreenAlp in France, EEC Engie in New Caledonia, Renault Group 

in France, and Azienda Trasporti Milanesi in Italy. AirSeT has also 

received multiple recognitions, most recently at the Greek Energy 

Mastering Awards 2022 and by the International Carbon Handprint 

Award at Climate Week NYC. 

The average RM AirSeT switchgear installation removes the need 

for up to 3 kg of SF
6
 gas, the equivalent of over 75 tonnes of CO

2
.

SF
6
 recovery services

In 2013, Schneider Electric started offering its customers a 

seamless service for the removal and/or recycling of obsolete 

equipment called “SF
6
 recovery services”. Today, recovery 

services are available in France and 10 other countries, and 

customer support is being developed to expand a model adaptable 

to different markets in different countries all over the world. The 

ambition is to offer recovery services to any SF
6
 Schneider legacy 

by 2025.

The recovery service allows the Group’s customers to dispose 

correctly of their machinery, against a green disposal certificate, 

thus granting them peace of mind. The service consists in 

collecting the equipment and, together with our partners, 

dismantling and reusing, recycling or disposing of all the 

components (such as metals or thermoplastics) appropriately. 

Specifically, SF
6
 is extracted from machines and sent to a specialist 

company for regeneration and destruction.

As part of its sustainability strategy, Renault Group is 

transforming its factory in Flins, France, into a Refactory: 

Europe’s first circular economy factory dedicated to 

mobility.

Electrical distribution was identified as an area to deploy an 

innovative solution that reduces greenhouse gases; 

therefore Renault Group chose AirSeT MV switchgear that 

eliminates SF
6
 and offers lower total cost of ownership.

AirSeT switchgear also addresses the Group’s concern to

2.3.7.2 Using the Group’s voice to drive 
collective action 

Getting to net-zero is going to take more than commitments, and 

technologies. Policies underpin the pace and the progress that the 

world will be able to make towards decarbonization. The Group will 

use its voice to speak out on public policy issues that Schneider 

Electric thinks can advance the world’s carbon efforts:

• public policy initiatives that accelerate the electrification, 

digitization, and decarbonization of the economy;

• the removal of regulatory barriers to help catalyze markets to 

enable carbon-reduction technologies to scale more quickly;

• the use of market and pricing mechanisms so people and 

businesses can make more informed carbon decisions;

• the empowerment of consumers through transparency based 

on universal standards to inform purchasers about the carbon 

content of goods and services.

In 2022, Schneider Electric signed Corporate Knights’ Action 

Declaration on Climate Policy Engagement together with more than 

50 other companies to support climate action aligned with the Paris 

Agreement when engaging with policymakers, work with trade 

associations to advance alignment with the Paris Agreement and 

monitor and disclose climate policy alignment.

Schneider is engaged in sectoral and multi-stakeholder 

organizations that drive ecosystem change. 

  Read more details on Schneider Electric global and local 

external commitments to move forward collectively in 

chapter 2.1.8 page 95, and on Schneider Electric lobbying 

activities in chapter 2.2.3.5 page 118.

Electrification policies

Schneider advocates for strong climate and clean energy policies 

in many jurisdictions where it operates. The Group supports 

innovative technologies and projects that reduce carbon dioxide, 

modernize and digitize the grid, accelerate clean energy, and 

strengthen resilience to the impacts of a changing climate. In the 

USA, Schneider submitted comments to the U.S. Securities and 

Exchange Commission’s proposal for The Enhancement and 

Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors. 

In Europe, Schneider engages actively with the European 

institutions advocating for rapid electrification and decarbonization 

of the grid. For example, in May 2022, it submitted its views about 

the REPowerEU plan of the European Commission, a strategy plan 

that aimed to fast forward the green transition. Schneider’s own 

position paper highlighted ten ideas to move forward Europe policy 

framework into that direction.

  Discover the white paper “REPowerEU: Empowering energy 

consumers for a more sustainable and resilient Europe” 

on www.se.com

The Group engages with local governments on the electrification, 

digitization and decarbonization of the economies. 

Carbon policies

Schneider Electric calls for policymakers to define robust and 

predictable carbon pricing for companies, enabling companies to 

integrate collaterals on climate into their strategy. A high and stable 

price for carbon will strengthen incentives to invest in sustainable 

technologies and to change behaviors.

Schneider supports the implementation of carbon pricing. 

Internally, the Group is incorporating an internal or shadow price for 

carbon to test its portfolio’s resilience to climate scenarios. The 

Group internal shadow price is meant to uncover inefficiencies, 

incentivize low carbon innovation, and understand the potential 

impact of external carbon pricing on the profitability of a project, a 

new business model, or an investment. Schneider uses different 

carbon price scenarios, varying from EUR 50-130/ton (depending 

on time horizons) to inform the Group’s climate strategy. 

The internal carbon price is used to assess the performance and 

resiliency of operations. The cost of carbon is evaluated for 

industrial activities, taking into account CO
2
 emissions from energy 

consumption and SF
6
 leaks at industrial sites. CO

2
 cost is also taken 

into consideration in industrial network modelling to account for 

future CO
2
 prices in industrial decisions. This enables the 

measurement of the potential impact of CO
2
 pricing on the Group’s 

supply chain.

2.3.8 Enabling customers to decarbonize with 
EcoStruxure™

2.3.8.1 Schneider Electric helps customers 
decarbonize and aims to avoid 800 million 
tonnes of CO

2
 emissions by 2025 

Schneider Electric products and services can help customers 

decarbonize and reduce their environmental footprint, thanks to 

various value propositions that leverage the IoT-enabled 

architecture EcoStruxure™. Examples include: 

• energy Efficiency: the Group helps companies become more 

efficient and reduce their CO
2
 emissions, for instance with 

variable speed drives or energy performance contracting;

• renewable power generation: Power Purchase Agreements or 

microgrids lead to the consumption of less carbon-intensive 

electricity;

• reduced GHG leakage: SF
6
-free equipment or SF

6
 recovery 

services lead to reduced emissions;

• materials efficiency: circularity business models (e.g., 

refurbish) or lead battery recycling lead to reduced emissions 

for manufacturing virgin materials.

To demonstrate this positive impact, a new indicator was launched 

in 2018 which tracks how Schneider’s offers enable its customers to 

save and avoid emissions. The Group has committed to reaching a 

cumulated 800 million tonnes of CO
2
 of saved and avoided 

emissions by its customers between 2018 and 2025 (SSI #2). This 

commitment is one of the three performance indicators of the first 

ever convertible Sustainability-Linked Bond launched by the Group 

at the end of 2020. Overall, from 2018 to 2022, Schneider Electric 

helped customers save and avoid 440 million tonnes of CO

 emissions to our 

customers (cumulated between 
2018 and 2025)

Altivar variable speed drives were awarded as “Most 

Climate-Positive Carbon Handprint Product Award” at 

Climate Week 2022. By allowing motors to operate at the 

ideal speed for every load condition, Altivar variable speed 

drives can generate up to a 30% reduction in energy 

consumption in industrial processes. 

Consequently, it’s estimated that over 180 million tonnes of 

CO
2
 emissions could be saved or avoided during the 

service life of the drives sold by Schneider Electric during 

the 2018-2022 period.

To transparently measure these saved and avoided emissions, the 

Group developed a methodology that is publicly available on the 

Group’s website. It was developed with Carbone 4, an expert CO

accounting consulting company. The methodology is designed to 

become a shared industry standard. Its principles are applicable 

across the capital goods and consumer durables sectors. 

Attention was given to defining rigorous calculations, with 

conservative assumptions. The methodology was first published 

in July 2019 and was independently reviewed by the audit company 

EY with regards to its consistency, accuracy, understandability, 

neutrality, completeness, and relevance. The methodology has been 

assessed in view of the requirements of ISO 14067 and ISO 14021.

 emissions arise from the difference 

between the induced emissions of Schneider Electric’s offer 

compared to the induced emissions of the reference situation. 

For both cases, induced emissions are evaluated on the expected 

lifetime of the offer and cover the full lifecycle (manufacturing, use 

and end-of-life). The reference situation is carefully defined, and 

transparently described, in order to reflect the most realistic market 

situation in the absence of the sale of the offer. Saved emissions 

are delivered on brownfield (retrofit) projects when emissions are 

actually reduced compared to a previous situation, whereas 

avoided emissions are defined with respect to greenfield sales 

(new infrastructures), where emissions are smaller than the 

reference situation, yet lead to an increase in emissions, due to the 

fact that there are new assets.

2.4 Being efficient with resources 

“2022 was a challenging year for 
supply chains with continuous 
disruptions. We have taken further 
actions to strengthen resilience for 
the short, medium, and long term 
— making significant capacity 
investments, accelerating 
regionalization, and simplifying 
flows. With our strategic supply 
chain partners, we are building 
additional resilience, improving 
energy efficiency, reducing carbon 
emissions, advancing circularity, 
and preserving local biodiversity.”

Context and the Group’s commitment 
Ecosystem services provided by nature such as food, clean water, 

medicine, and shelter are essential for humanity to thrive. 

Nevertheless, growing human activity puts an increasing pressure 

on the planet, using and consuming more resources than Earth can 

renew. The threat to our natural ecosystems is now greater than  

ever. 

The world is facing a twin crisis of climate change and nature loss, 

which are inextricably linked and require a unified effort to be 

addressed. On the one hand, climate change is the third driver of 

biodiversity loss (IPBES 2019), and is projected to become the first 

in the years to come, unless we achieve the objectives of the Paris 

Agreement. On the other hand, nature has historically provided 

carbon sinks to help balance the growing carbon emissions 

created by human activity. These sinks are now disappearing 

rapidly, due to deforestation. 

Schneider Electric’s long-term commitment is to be efficient with 

resources, by behaving responsibly and making the most of 

technology, including digital technology to preserve our planet. 

Concretely, its strategy is to minimize the lifecycle environmental 

footprint of its products and solutions, while maximizing the 

environmental benefits they can bring. This strategy has three pillars: 

first, to be efficient with resources and responsibly source materials, 

second to protect, and restore biodiversity and third to innovate with 

circularity as the end game.

With Schneider Sustainability Impact and its concrete programs, 

the Group is constantly innovating, so its offers contribute to a more 

circular economy, in industrial processes, product design, and 

business model. In 2022, the proportion of sustainable packaging 

doubled, from 21% to 45%, and the Group joined The Copper Mark 

and Responsible Steel to accelerate responsible material sourcing 

for metals.

2.4 Being efficient with resources

2.4.1 Minimize the Group’s impacts and dependencies 
on nature

2.4.1.1 Context

A sustainable future for people and economies will only be possible 

if nature, climate, and people are addressed in an integrated way. 

Climate change is among the main drivers of biodiversity loss, 

while nature is part of the climate solutions. If the limit of warming of 

1.5°C becomes impossible to reach, climate change will likely 

become the dominant cause of biodiversity loss in the coming 

decades. WWF “Living Report 2022” points out that rising 

temperatures are already driving mass mortality events, as well as 

the first extinctions of entire species. Every degree of warming is 

expected to increase these losses and the impact they have on 

people. 

An analysis of 163 industry sectors and their supply chains found 

that over half of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - US$44 

trillion of economic value generation - is moderately or highly 

dependent on nature and its services. Pollination, water quality and 

disease control are three examples of the services an ecosystem 

can provide. As nature loses its capacity to provide such services, 

the economy could be significantly disrupted. This report found 

that many industries have significant “hidden dependencies” on 

nature in their supply chain and may be more at risk of disruption 

than expected. 

2.4.1.2 Risks and opportunities

When considering this “climate-nature nexus”, Schneider Electric 

recognizes the inability to mitigate – or adapt to – the impacts of 

climate change without protecting, restoring, and enhancing our 

global stocks of nature. The Group used the Taskforce on Nature-

related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework to conduct a 

double materiality assessment: impacts and dependencies; risks 

and opportunities related to nature. The double materiality 

approach looks at the two-way interaction with nature: how nature 

impacts a company and its operations, but also how the operations 

of a company impact nature. 

Schneider assessed impacts and dependencies on the four realms 

of nature defined by TNFD (land, ocean, freshwater, and 

atmosphere), and five main drivers of nature change: climate 

change, resource exploitation, land and sea use change, pollution 

and invasive alien species.

Risks 

As a discrete manufacturing industry, Schneider Electric’s physical 

footprint from its operations and value chain may impact nature’s 

capital, local and global ecosystems.

To measure its impact on nature, Schneider Electric has conducted 

an end-to-end biodiversity footprint assessment, quantifying 

biodiversity-related risks and identifying opportunities for reducing 

these risks across its value chain, with a global and scientific 

approach. The Group’s biodiversity footprint shows that most of its 

impacts are indirectly caused by its carbon emissions, and that 

dependencies come mainly from the use of resources in 

manufacturing, and logistics. 

Opportunities

Schneider Electric is convinced that the circular economy can help 

create a win-win-win-win ecosystem: 

• good for the planet, because it reduces the use of virgin 

resources; 

• good for customers, because it enables lower total cost of 

ownership, or increased lifespan of assets; 

• good for business resilience because it improves customer 

intimacy and stickiness as well as overall stakeholder 

attractivity;

• good for collaborators because it provides a meaningful 

purpose.

Schneider Electric has a fantastic opportunity to enable more 

repair, retrofit, and recycling services, provided the product 

categories concerned are adequately maintained, and serviced by 

qualified and certified experts.

The regionalization of environmental regulations is creating 

complexity for companies across the value chain and requires 

enhanced product traceability. Schneider’s worldwide approach of 

environmental product stewardship directives fed by a local 

network of experts enables the group to adjust promptly to future 

requirements, providing Schneider with the opportunity to 

strengthen its relationships with its suppliers, and to provide its 

customers with the robust product life cycle information they 

demand.

2.4.1.3 The Group’s commitment 

Schneider Electric reduces its GHG emisions by engaging and 

transforming its value chain to be efficient with resources, 

increasing recycling and responsible behaviors towards raw 

materials, plastics and wood used. Finally, Schneider acts locally, 

engaging employees and partners to implement local biodiversity 

conservation and restoration programs. Site managers and 

biodiversity leaders define their site’s biodiversity program. 

Guidelines define the rules applicable for the Schneider 

Sustainabiity Essentials target and share best practices across 

sites for continuous improvement.

2.4.1.4 Biodiversity footprint measurement

The quantification of the Group’s impacts on biodiversity is an 

essential firs step to understand its impacts and dependencies on 

nature and take appropriate action. In 2020, Schneider Electric 

became the first company to publish the end-to-end Biodiversity 

Footprint Assessment (BFA) of its activities, using the Global 

Biodiversity Score (GBS) tool developed by Caisse des Dépôts et 

Consignations (CDC) Biodiversité. By sharing its experience with 

other companies and publishing the results transparently, the 

Group aims to demonstrate that measuring biodiversity footprints is 

a key first step in helping companies define relevant and impactful 

biodiversity strategies, across their entire value chain.

The GBS gives detailed and modular results which can be split by 

input line (for example, by raw materials such as metal, plastic, or 

timber); by pressures on biodiversity (such as land use, climate 

change, fragmentation, or encroachment); or it can be presented 

by scopes in Mean Species Abundance per square kilometer 

(MSA.km²). Synthetic, easy to understand and widely available, this 

metric has the potential to become the international standard. 

The results of Schneider’s BFA are presented hereafter illustrating 

the Group’s dynamic terrestrial impact, with details by pressure. 

The pie chart highlights the weight of greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions, which represent almost 70% of Schneider Electric’s 

pressure on biodiversity. Land use accounts for almost 30% of 

“cradle-to-gate” impacts.

“cradle-to-gate” impacts.

Read more about Schneider Electric’s 

commitment to biodiversity on www.se.com

The BFA allowed Schneider Electric to identify the main levers of 

action to reduce its biodiversity footprint across its value chain: 

• Reduce GHG emissions in the Group’s own operations and in 

the supply chain. Climate change is one of the major pressures 

on biodiversity globally and is the Group’s main impact on 

biodiversity (close to 70%). Therefore, Schneider’s Net-Zero 

Commitment will have a significant impact on reducing the 

Group’s pressure on biodiversity. 

  More details on Schneider’s climate programs 

and achievements are presented in chapter 2.3 

pages 148 to 173.

• Reduce the “land use” due to the extraction of raw 

materials. The main driver of land use is the extraction of wood 

and metals. Wood is mainly used for packaging purposes 

(cardboard, pallets, boxes); metals are the core of the Group’s 

products (silver, copper, steel, aluminum...). Greater 

transparency and access to data on end-to-end supply chain is 

key to understand how to minimize the Group’s impacts and 

dependencies on nature. Nevertheless, whether on climate or 

nature, data quality should not get in the way of necessary 

immediate action. Schneider made several commitments : 

− Source 100% deforestation-free wood by 2030; 

− Source 50% “green materials” in its products by 2025 (SSI 

#4);

− Use 100% of sustainable primary and secondary packaging 

by 2025 (SSI #5).

2.4 Being efficient with resources

2.4.1.5  Actions to minimize the Group’s 
impact on biodiversity

Deforestation-free wood by 2030 

In June 2022, Schneider Electric made the commitment to be 

deforestation-free by 2030. Deforestation is currently running at a 

rate of 10 football fields a minute in the areas most critical for 

carbon storage and biodiversity. Last year, primary tropical forests 

the size of the Netherlands were destroyed. There is no path to 

net-zero that does not address deforestation and supports 

nature-based solutions.

To date, the deforestation-free wood program runs largely through 

the SSI #5 (100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free 

from single-use plastic and uses recycled cardboard), which 

addresses the large majority of wood consumption by Schneider 

Electric. In parallel, streams of work are being created to address 

the complementary topics, such as technical wood or marketing 

materials.

Use the Group’s voice for mandatory  

disclosure on nature

In October 2022, Business for Nature launched the United Nations 

Biodiversity Conference of Parties (COP15) advocacy campaign 

(#MakeItMandatory) to call on governments to mandate 

assessment and disclosure on impacts and dependencies on 

biodiversity for businesses and financial institutions above a certain 

size across the 196 member states of the UN Convention on 

Biological Diversity (CBD). Schneider signed the campaign, joining 

more than 330 companies calling on Heads of State and 

Governments to include in COP15 agreement Target 15, mandatory 

requirements for all large and transnational businesses and 

financial institutions to assess and disclose their impacts and 

dependencies on biodiversity, by 2030. During the COP15 

Biodiversity, Schneider supported an ambitious Target 15, shared 

its actions to date and ambitions relating to nature, and learned 

from others public and private sector actors. Leading businesses 

already recognize the multifaceted benefits and opportunities that 

come with investing in nature, and the risks that come from 

inaction, and are working towards assessing and disclosing their 

impacts. COP15 also showed how Schneider and others are 

already accelerating efforts to restore ecosystems, including 

anticipating and avoiding asset stranding, circumventing value 

chain disruptions and protecting vital habitats through responsible 

sourcing.

2.4.1.6 Governance 

Because Schneider Electric builds products that can help people 

and businesses decarbonize and digitize, environmental 

sustainability is core to every step of the cradle-to-cradle product 

lifecycle. The Group works hard to minimize the environmental 

impact of how it designs, manufactures, delivers, and maintains its 

products. The Group engages with partners and suppliers on the 

materials it uses, and integrates strict social and environmental 

accountability standards that address considerations around 

business ethics, human rights, and environmental impact.

The Group’s environmental performance is delivered with the 

involvement of its strategy, R&D, manufacturing, procurement, 

finance, human resources, transportation, sales, marketing and 

services teams. This environmental performance is core to the 

customer value proposition, and is reported and discussed during 

leadership meetings of concerned entities, including the Global 

Supply Chain, the Decarbonization Committee, the Low-carbon 

product design Committee, the Board Audit & Risks Committee, the 

Board of Directors, the Executive Committee, Human Resources & 

the CSR Committee, and with the ExCom Function Committee. 

The environmental transformations are driven by a global network 

of over 600 managers and experts responsible for the 

environmental management of sites, countries, product design, and 

marketing. The network of leaders driving environmental 

transformations consists of the following:

• For the design and development of new offers: Sustainable 

Offers managers and leaders in each business are in charge of 

integrating key environmental considerations into the 

development of new products and producing expected 

environmental information for customers.

• For the management of industrial, logistics, and large 

tertiary sites: Safety, Environment, and Real Estate Vice-

Presidents are nominated in each region, with dedicated teams. 

They are responsible for implementing the Group’s policies 

across all sites in their geographical remit. In each region, 

directors coordinate teams across a group of sites (clusters), as 

well as on site. These environmental and safety leaders are in 

charge of reporting on performance as well as executing 

environmental progress plans in the field.

• For logistics: The Logistics Senior Vice-President and his/her 

teams within the Global Supply Chain department are in charge 

of measuring and reducing CO
2
 emissions from freight at Group 

level.

applicable (e.g., national transcriptions of the Waste from 

Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in relation to 

end-of-life product management, and monitoring national 

substance regulations such as RoHS China); the proactive 

management of local environmental initiatives; and finally, 

relations with local stakeholders.

• Edison experts: a process recognizes individuals who have a 

specific expertise that the Group is eager to maintain and grow. 

There are 10 specific domains in which Edison experts are 

identified, one of them being environment. Each year, an 

Environment Edison expert is expected to dedicate 10% to 20% 

of his/her time to lead a global initiative related to his/her 

expertise, such as the development of an e-learning course, a 

new standard, or an innovation.

Various governance bodies enable those communities to meet 

every month or quarter to ensure consistent adoption of 

environmental policies and standards throughout the Group. This 

network has access to a wide range of resources including 

standards, policies, best practices, benchmarks, and guidelines, 

all of which are shared on the dedicated intranet site and 

databases.

Group Operations’ Environment policy

Schneider Electric’s operational environment strategy aligns with its 

broader sustainability strategy. Under this strategy, the Group’s 

ambition is to operate sustainably within the limits of the planet and 

reconcile beneficial global economic growth and progress with the 

need for environmental preservation and regeneration.

Within its global environment policy, Schneider sets operational 

goals that emphasize the steps necessary to help advance towards 

its ambition. These goals are: 

• Continuously improve the environment management system and 

meet compliance obligations (see section 2.4.4.1);

• Continue protecting the environment, preventing pollution, 

limiting emissions, and promoting biodiversity (see section 2.4.2 

The Group’s commitment to product sustainability);

• Decouple our supply chain from natural resource consumption 

(see section 2.4.2 The Group’s commitment to product 

sustainability).

Targets enabling those goals are defined in the Group’s Schneider 

Sustainability Impact (SSI) and Schneider Sustainability Essentials 

(SSE) scorecards. Relevant SSI and SSE targets are SSI #5, SSE 

#8, SSE #9, and SSE #11.

2.4 Being efficient with resources

2.4.2 The Group’s commitment to product sustainability
At Schneider Electric, every product or solution fulfils strict 

environmental performance. The Group has embraced a circular 

approach throughout the lifecycle of its products, and aims to 

design products with minimal material footprint and maximal 

lifetime value. Implementing a circular model that minimizes waste 

requires interventions up and down the value chain – innovative 

design, materials, service business models, reuse and 

redistribution processes, collection, and more. 

2.4.2.1 Design with circularity in mind

Circularity is a key enabler and lever to climate change mitigation 

and biodiversity preservation. With circularity in mind, the Group 

can maximize the value retention of everything it produces through 

the products’ lifetime.

To embed circular principles in its products and offers, the Group 

adopted EcoDesign Way™, a process developed to understand and 

manage the environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of 

products, and to coordinate efforts across the value chain.

Any circular journey starts with the design phase, designing new 

business models, products and systems that use less resources, 

reduce the CO
2
 emissions and keep materials in use. Schneider’s 

designers embed circular design, integrate recycled and bio-

based materials, and aim to design durable, repairable and 

upgradable products that can be either repaired on-site while 

they’re being used, retrofitted on-site or taken back to the Group’s 

ECOFITTM and repair centers.

The designers benefit from Ecodesign tools, playbooks and 

trainings that are regularly updated, easily available on the Group 

intranet. From the corporate level to the design squads, several 

teams define the Ecodesign and circularity strategy, develop 

materials to support the designers’ upskilling and deployment of 

the circular design, and contribute actively to the development of 

standards at European and international level regarding circularity 

and material efficiency. This ensures that the internal practices are 

aligned with the latest standards and that the Group’s expertise is 

well incorporated in the standardization landscape.

Finally, the circular design actions are valued through the Green 

PremiumTM program, communicating the environmental 

performance of Schneider’s offers, with transparency, on aspects 

relating to durability, repairability, recycled content or recyclability.

2.4.2.2 Ecodesign approach

Ecodesign is the design of products or services that aims to 

minimize the environmental impact throughout a product’s lifecycle.

In 2015, to respond to customers’ growing demand for products 

with a smaller environmental foootprint, and to embed circular 

principles in its products and offers, Schneider Electric adopted 

EcoDesignWay™, a process to understand and manage the 

environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of products, and to 

coordinate efforts across the value chain. In each phase of the 

product lifecycle, ecodesign principles are defined and followed.

and end-of-life 

management of products

• Scale-up take-back 

programs to give a 

second-life to products or

option is feasible

In 2022, the Group revamped its ecodesign strategy on two levels.

Ecodesign in business strategy:

• Each business unit defined its sustainability targets and 

roadmap to reflect operationally the resources required to 

achieve a decarbonization plan. The Human Resources 

department performed a thorough assessment to ensure each 

business unit was correctly staffed to foster ecodesign. It 

includes roles and responsibility descriptions and upskilling 

plans.

• Environmental attributes (green materials, circular performance, 

low-carbon were included systematically in R&D priorization. 

The inclusion of a carbon price in R&D projects has also been 

tested. The objective is to include a carbon price in all R&D 

investment decisions in 2023.

Ecodesign in projects:

• The Group has continued to rely on the EcoDesign WayTM 

process to incorporate ecodesign principles into every project. 

EcoDesign Way is a project scorecard that provides an 

exhaustive list of ecodesign performance attributes, fully 

aligned with the Green PremiumTM program.

• Apart from the EcoDesign Way Scorecard, environmental 

footprint tools such as Simplified Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) have 

been tested. In 2023, Schneider aims to develop a web-based 

ecodesign calculator to enable easier and faster environmental 

footprint by project teams, and help identify the most relevant 

ecodesign features.

• Group Ecodesign experts have working with the Offer 

Excellence Academy to define an ecodesign training path to 

ensure all resources are available for the R&D community to 

raise awareness, train and upskill their teams. The training 

modules of the ecodesign training path will progressively be 

available in 2023.

2.4.2.3 Substances management to 
eliminate hazardous substances

Schneider Electric continues to remove hazardous chemicals from 

its products, processes, and supply chain, to minimize the potential 

harm for the environment and people health. The Group has 

tackled this issue for many years as part of its environmental 

programs reducing and managing its waste, emissions- and 

water-related risks, including pollution. It constantly substitutes 

substances or substance groups listed among the declarable and 

regulated substances in its products, whenever this is technically 

possible. The recent development of the new medium voltage 

switchgears without SF
6
 (one of the most impacting greenhouse 

gases) is an illustrating example.

The Group operates in different jurisdictions with evolving 

regulations on environmental, health, safety, and product 

compliance. The regionalization of environmental regulations (e.g. 

California Prop 65, China RoHS, UAE RoHS) creates complexity, 

with thousands of suppliers. Therefore, Schneider has put in place 

a strong governance, relying on a worldwide approach of 

environmental product stewardship directives fed by a regional and 

local environmental steward network. Because substance 

presence identification and traceability is key, the Group is 

investing in robust digital systems to preform and report the 

environmental compliance of its wide portfolio of products, across 

several hundreds of thousands of commercial references. 

RoHS and REACH 

Schneider Electric has adopted, for many years, a proactive 

implementation of the RoHS European Directive. This means the 

Group strives to have products compliant with RoHS and REACH 

substances restriction even if it is not in the legal or geographical 

scope of the directive. This includes all Schneider’s offers, its local 

or independent name brands, manufactured in its plants or only 

labelled.

2.4 Being efficient with resources

Schneider is committed to fulfill its legal obligation and pursues the 

product compliance coverage to the largest possible extent making 

business sense. It continues to work to reduce the number of 

products under the RoHS directive exemptions, and it continues to 

reduce the number of global exceptions to REACH and RoHS. 79% 

of products globally (83% of revenue) are compliant with RoHS 

restrictions, among which 36% without directive exemptions. 

Research programs are carried out to find alternative solutions to 

the presence of lead in some metallic alloys, brominated flame 

retardants in PCBs, cobalt in surface treatments, to anticipate 

future possible restrictions. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 

(PFAS) is a wide family of substances that are targeted by both 

Europe and the United States of America in coming regulations. A 

first identification action was carried out in order to map the 

different usages both in the Group’s products and manufacturing 

processes. The concept of “essential use” will be associated to the 

regulation and Schneider must identify which of its applications are 

in line with this concept (which is not yet fully defined by the 

legislator) and where substitutions will be required.

In Europe, the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 

and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the Restriction of 

Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment 

(RoHS) directive are engaged in a refit process. Schneider actively 

participates in the public consultations through the professional 

organizations (FIEEC, Orgalim, Digital Europe), making some key 

proposals to improve efficiency and limit the administrative burden.

Compliance system

A strong data management system is key to ensure product 

compliance and anticipate substitution actions. Internal IT 

processes are continuously adjusted with the goal of taking a more 

proactive and safe approach to the use of materials and 

substances, and to more efficiently fulfill the declaration 

requirements such as those of the European Substances of 

Concern In Products (SCIP) database through direct link or IEC 

62474/IPC1752 structured data exchange formats.

In addition to IT tools, supplier compliance data collection is 

continuously improved with a new workflow and a wider scope of 

requests, pushing for full material disclosure information.

WEEE

Related to RoHS is WEEE, which stands for Waste from Electrical 

and Electronic Equipment (also known as “e-waste”). It refers to 

regulations, typically passed at a country or state level, aimed at 

promoting the reuse and recycling of electrical and electronic 

equipment and thereby reducing resource consumption and the 

amount of e-waste going to landfill. Requirements of WEEE 

regulations include, among others, financing the collection, 

treatment, recovery, and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE. 

With the rapidly expanding use of electrical and electronic 

products globally and the resulting growth in e-waste, more and 

more jurisdictions are enacting WEEE regulations.

The European Union (EU) WEEE Directive, is implemented through 

national regulations in all European Economic Area (EEA) countries 

including all EU member states, Norway, Liechtenstein, and 

Iceland. Schneider closely monitors developing WEEE legislation 

and complies with the EU WEEE Directive and EEA national 

regulations, as applicable. 

Requirements of the EU WEEE Directive 2002/96/EC and national 

regulations generally include, among others, the following:

• financing the collection, treatment, recovery and 

environmentally sound disposal of WEEE resulting from 

products on the corresponding market which have reached their 

end of useful life ;

• labeling products with a crossed-out wheelie bin symbol to help 

minimize WEEE disposal as unsorted municipal waste and 

facilitate its separate collection. All applicable Schneider 

Electric products in the European markets need to comply with 

WEEE regulation and carry the “Wheelie Bin” sticker.

2.4.2.4 Reach 50% of green materials in 
products by 2025

Risk relating to sourcing materials 

The acceleration of electrification globally is increasing competition 

to access some critical raw materials. For example, renewable 

power generation is shifting dependency of the energy sector from 

fossil fuels to mineral resources. The electric vehicles industry is 

expected to increase the demand for lithium 50-fold by 2040 and 

the demand for cobalt and graphite 30-fold, according to the 

International Energy Agency (IEA). 

Evolving economic trend, global overexploitation, and limited 

access can result in shortages of natural resources within the 

Group’s operations and its value chain. This can result in business 

disruptions and rising costs in both the short- and long-term, and 

additional challenges to secure supply for sustainable 

transformation programs (green materials, substances substitution, 

sustainable packaging).

Risk monitoring and management

Risks are taken into account in the STRIVE initiative of the Group’s 

Global Supply Chain and covered by the Property Damage and 

Business Interruption program at site level. 

The Group approaches access to resources at different time 

horizons, to ensure supply resilience both now and in the future. 

The Group is:

• building short-term resilience in securing supply and protecting 

operations against price volatility with real time alerts to notify 

and activate action plans;

• de-risking its portfolio with technological solutions and circular 

business models;

• shaping the future with long-term material resilience and 

sustainability with disruptive actions.

To address uncertainty in long-term resource disruption, Schneider 

has added resource parameters in product EcoDesign and defined 

substitution strategies for critical resources. R&D actions are in 

place, focusing on materials with main strategic functions 

accompanied by communication channels to escalate and alert.

Green materials in the Group’s products

Schneider has committed to increase green materials in its 

products to 50% by 2025, as part of its Schneider Sustainability 

Impact program (SSI #4). With that commitment, the Group aims to:

• Be a change agent to accelerate the transformation toward a 

low-carbon and circular economy of the material industry;

• Reduce Scope 3 upstream emissions, in line with the Group’s 

Net-Zero Commitment;

• Differentiate Schneider’s products by using low CO
2
, circular, 

and safer materials.

According to Schneider, a green material has a lower 

environmental and social footprint, meaning low greenhouse gas 

emission, high recycled content, and no negative impact on people 

and the planet.

Therefore, performance could be achieved, either through 

selecting material and/or supplier with a proven lower 

environmental footprint (e.g. proof of a material produced out of a 

100% recycled content), or strengthening the traceability of 

sustainable initiatives in the value chain. 

While the first action is particularly relevant for thermoplastics 

materials, the second action is a priority for metal commodities 

where visibility of the environmental impact and technology-origin 

of procured metals is low.

The lower environmental footprint attributes are defined for each 

commodity in scope, as the environmental performance of metal 

cannot be based on the same attributes as plastic. In 2022, the 

scope of green materials focused on three types of commodities 

covering around a third of purchased materials in volume:

• Thermoplastics (including both direct and indirect 

procurement). Thermoplastics are qualified as “green” when the 

supplier provides evidence of a minimum recycled content, 

biobased content (the minimum threshold depends on whether 

the compound is halogenated or not) or is using a green flame 

retardant. 

• Steel (direct purchases). Steel is qualified as “green” when the 

supplier provides evidence that the mill of origin is an Electric 

Arc Furnace (EAF) or has a Green certificate such as the ones 

delivered by Responsible Steel. 

• Aluminum (direct purchases). Aluminum is qualified as “green” 

when the supplier provides evidence that the product carbon 

footprint is below 8 tonnes of CO
2
 per tonne of aluminum, is 

using a minimum of 90% of recycled content in its product or 

that the mill of origin has a Green certificate such as the ones 

delivered by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative.

2.4 Being efficient with resources

The inclusion of other commodities like copper, thermoset, and 

indirect steel will be reassessed in the next phases, as the program 

matures and the transparency of supply chains improves. In 2022, 

Schneider Electric businesses strengthened their green materials 

implementation targets and roadmap to accelerate the demand for 

greener alternatives from suppliers. 

Partnerships to accelerate the sourcing of green 

materials

In 2022, Schneider Electric accelerated its engagement with 

suppliers regarding their sustainable transformation by building 

stronger connections and by securing the first volume of certified 

green steel.

In 2022, Schneider purchased 700 tons of Bluemint® Steel, a 

high-quality flat steel with reduced carbon intensity, from 

ThyssenKrupp. Purchasing Bluemint® Steel comes with a third 

party certificate to ensure CO
2
 is directly reduced at the 

ThyssenKrupp Duisburg production site. Opting for such branded 

products helps Schneider to reduce its Scope 3 upstream 

emissions, enhance traceability in the steel supply chain and 

strenghten trust with suppliers. The Group is working to further 

develop this alternative and to leverage environmental benefits at 

offer level.

Schneider also contributed as official partners to industry-wide 

associations and certification schemes. For example, the Group 

participated in Responsible Steel working groups, the world’s first 

global scheme for responsibly sourced and produced steel. The 

Group supported the definition and publication of the latest 

ResponsibleSteel™ International Standard V2.0, launched in 

September 2022, and incorporating additional requirements on 

GHG emissions and the sourcing of input materials. 

ResponsibleSteel™ International Standard defines 13 principles 

covering environmental, social and governance issues.

In 2022, Schneider became an official partner of The Copper Mark, 

which aims to accelerate responsible material sourcing for metals. 

Joining The Copper Mark will help the Group to improve the 

environmental and social aspects of the copper value chain. 

Schneider is looking forward to engaging further in pursuit of 

responsible materials sourcing goals together with The Copper 

Mark, and encourages its suppliers to participate in The Copper 

Mark Assurance Process, and aim collectively at responsible 

copper production.

Ultimately, Schneider aims to include all types of products, which is 

why definitions for copper and thermosets were prepared and 

tested with its suppliers in 2022.

Increase green material content in 
our products to 50%

The Merten Ocean Plastic family of products was 

recognised in 2022 by the CES of Las Vegas as a 2022 

Innovation Award honoree in the Sustainability Category. 

To develop this range from postconsumer recycled plastic, 

the Group partnered with DSM, a Netherlands-based 

company, converting fishing net waste into high-grade 

technical plastic that can be used in electrical devices. 

DSM collaborates with several local communities in India to 

recover and collect discarded fishing nets, providing a 

significant benefit to the local economy and environment. 

The abandoned fishing nets are then cut up, cleaned, 

extruded, and inspected for quality before being sent to 

DSM for processing into Akulon Repurposed compound. 

The carbon footprint of this new compound is 82% lower 

than the traditional virgin material used in similar products, 

reducing the potential impact on global warming, air 

acidification, and photochemical ozone formation in its 

manufacturing process.

2.4.2.5 Sustainable Packaging

Packaging is the first visible asset seen by customers and is 

associated with major environmental challenges such as resource 

depletion, waste generation, and marine pollution. Schneider 

Electric sustainable packaging program aims to foster innovative 

packaging solutions to ensure a safe and frustration-free 

packaging experience with a reduced impact on the environment.

Globally, a growing number of regulations require the development 

of packaging alternatives, with a focus on recyclability. To comply 

with these regulations and avoid current or upcoming polluter-pays 

packaging taxes, innovation and partnership with suppliers are key. 

Schneider suppliers are required to comply with applicable laws 

and regulations, including compliance with the European Union’s 

Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (1994/62/EC), as 

amended by 2018/852/EU and CEN packaging standards (EN 

13427:2005), as well as the US Toxics in Packaging legislation. 

Schneider is working with its suppliers to ensure adequate supply 

of sustainable packaging materials. 

By 2025, Schneider Electric is committed to reach:

• 100% of primary and secondary packaging with recycled 

cardboard. Cardboard is considered as recycled when it 

includes at least 70% of recycled fiber by weight, if legally 

accepted. Exception may be approved to avoid any 

compromise in product protection, safety or quality standard. 

Temporary exemption is made for North America, where an 

average of 50% of recycled fiber by weight is required to be 

considered as recycled.

• 100% of primary and secondary packaging free from single-use 

plastic. At Schneider, the definition of Single Use Plastics (SUP) 

is based on the European Plastic Pact : “A single-use plastic 

product means a product that is made wholly or partly from 

plastic and that is not conceived, designed or placed on the 

market to accomplish, within its life span, multiple trips or 

rotations by being returned to a producer for refill or reused for 

the same purpose for which it was conceived.”

  Source: Directive 2019/904/EC of 5 June 2019 on the 

reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the 

environment. 

In 2022, Schneider’s packaging teams worked to:

• establish partnerships with key suppliers to secure alternative 

packaging options;

• build up traceability in the supply chain by collecting suppliers’ 

declarations and certificates for recycled cardboard;

• update the sustainable packaging guideline and associated 

tools to facilitate sustainable packaging adoption in projects.

In 2023, the teams will work on: 

• accelerating SUP phase-out program to ensure new and legacy 

products switch to more sustainable packaging options;

• strengthening procurement systems to better track single-use 

plastic packaging.

2.4 Being efficient with resources

2.4.3  Lead with transparency: provide environmental 
data to customers 

2.4.3.1 Green PremiumTM

Schneider Electric launched in 2008 its Green Premium™ program 

to transparently communicate the environmental value of a product 

to customers, with both qualitative and quantitative data. The Green 

Premium label means that a product follows the EcoDesign 

principles, and :

• is compliant with RoHS and REACH regulations; 

• has an estimated lifecycle assessment impact (LCA); 

• has clear end-of-life instructions.

In 2015, the Green Premium label added other environmental 

criteria. For example, the Green Premium label signals circularity 

business models, such as “take-back” programs. An example of a 

take back program is for customers who have purchased one of the 

Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) to have access to 

complementary recycling when the battery in the product reaches 

its end of useful life. In 2022, this service collected more than  

15,000 tonnes of batteries globally for recycling.

In 2022, Schneider has redefined the program to encompass three 

pillars: Trust, Transparency, and Performance.

• Trust means Schneider continues to be transparent with 

customers, providing RoHS and REACH substance information 

and going beyond regulations by applying the same rules 

regardless of the geographies. That is and will remain the core 

of the Green Premium™ program.

• Transparency is the commitment from Schneider to disclose in 

a digital way the environmental impacts of its products, their 

end-of-life treatment, as well as any environment-related 

attributes meaningful for customers. This is crucial in the 

Group’s strategy, as the first step for improvement is 

measurement and quantification.

• Performance is Schneider’s commitment to deliver products 

with reduced environmental impact. Performance can take 

several forms:

 − use of lower impact materials such as recycled plastics;

 − enhanced product recyclability to reduce waste, and loss of 

critical raw materials;

 − energy efficient products with at least 10% of improved 

energy efficiency with respect to the market average or to 

previous generations;

 − improved durability and the ability to function as required 

under defined conditions of use, maintenance, and repair, 

until a final limiting state is reached (which should be at least 

5% higher than market average);

 − SF

-free products;

 − easy repair of product parts.

In 2022, Schneider revamped the pages of its online catalogue to 

make all environmental information more easily available to 

customers, so that they can quickly identify Green Premium 

products and can choose the product they want according to 

environmental features.

80% of product revenues covered 
by Green Premium™

In 2022, Schneider Electric received an increasing number 

of customer inquiries requesting detailed information 

regarding the material content and environmental impacts 

of its products. In response, the Industrial Automation 

Environmental Experts of the Group generated more than 

75 new Product Environmental Profile (PEP) documents. 

This has enabled the certification of a larger number of 

products through the Green Premium™ program to deliver 

even more transparent information.

2.4.3.2 Product Environmental Profiles

A greater number of customers, regulators, and standards bodies 

request quality and detailed environmental data. Many building 

standards and local regulations demand or promote offers 

providing Environmental Product Declarations. 

An environmental footprint is a product or solution-related 

measurement that provides quantitative information based on Life 

Cycle Assessment (LCA, according to ISO 14040-44 standard). It 

enables the assessment of multiple environmental impact 

indicators, including the carbon footprint, for all product or solution 

lifecycle stages. The scope of this assessment is also referred to as 

“cradle-to-grave”. Environmental footprint is a mandatory 

requirement in the Green Premium™ program.

Schneider Electric relies on Product Environmental Profiles (PEP) to 

fulfill this requirement. A PEP is defined as a product-oriented 

“summarized” version of a full LCA. It relies on Product Category 

Rules (PCR) or Product Specific Rules (PSR). 

At Schneider, there are two types of PEP available:

• Certified – a type III Environmental Declaration in compliance

with ISO 14025. The certified PEP is externally reviewed by an

accredited verifier and published by a program operator

according to the rules provided by this operator (for example,

PEP Ecopassport).

• Internal – the internal PEP follows the exact same rules as the

certified one. However, an internal PEP is reviewed internally

and therefore cannot be registered through an independent

program operator. A process of accreditation for internal

verifiers guarantees the adequate level of internal PEP

verifications. Verifiers check PEPs from lines of business other

than their own, thus ensuring independence. Internal PEPs

comply with the ISO 14021 self-completed declaration.

In 2022, more than 2,000 valid PEP were publicly available online, 

covering all of Schneider’s product lines, and 87% of product lines 

are covered by an ISO 14025 type III declaration. 

PEP Ecopassport PCRed4

In 2021, Schneider Electric made a major contribution to the 

development of the new Product Category Rules of the PEP 

Ecopassport association (PCRed4 issued in September 2021), 

which are:

• Compliance with the EN 50693:2019 standard: Product

category rules for lifecycle assessments of electronic and

electrical products and systems – currently being mirrored in

the IEC/TC111 Working Group 15 (IEC 63366);

• Full alignment with the EN 15804+A2 standard: Sustainability of

construction works – Environmental product declarations – Core

rules for the product category of construction products;

• Integration of key elements of the EU Product Environmental

Footprint (PEF), such as mandatory impact indicators, end-of-

life formulae, and quality ranking;

• Alignment with ISO 14067:2018: Greenhouse gases – Carbon

footprint of products – Requirements and guidelines for

quantification, integrating the latest requirements of the French

regulatory texts from RE2020.

The application of PCRed4 enables electrical and electronic 

equipment manufacturers to produce product environmental 

declarations in accordance with the best-known international 

standards, thus fostering cross-region and cross-industry 

recognition. Schneider aims to use this new PCR document to 

influence and strengthen the environmental footprint practices of 

the sector through standardization (TC111 Working Group, ZVEI 

initiative) and regulations (Sustainable Product Initiative of the 

European Commission, Green Taxonomy).

In 2022, Schneider updated its LCA tools in order to include new 

requirements from the PEP Ecopassport PCRed4. From 2023 

onwards, all PEPs published by the Group will be compliant with 

the PCRed4.

By relying on the PEP Ecopassport PCRed4 methodology and the 

acceleration of environmental impact data digitization, Schneider 

strives to provide quantified environmental footprint information 

systematically and seamlessly to customers to differentiate its 

sustainable offers, and therefore, be a change agent towards a 

low-carbon and circular economy.

2.4 Being efficient with resources

2.4.4 Manufacturing products sustainably
In addition to the ever-increasing offer of digital solutions such as 

its various EcoStruxure™ software, consulting and advisory 

services, and field services teams, Schneider Electric still relies on 

traditional manufacturing to produce its wide range of energy-

saving products. 

In order to continue manufacturing into the future to help its 

customers deliver on their sustainability and business objectives, 

while simultaneously preserving the environment and its limited 

resources, the Group is committed to minimizing its impact on 

natural resources and operating with sustainability principles at its 

core. 

The Group aims to progressively move towards closed-loop 

systems in its operations and with its partners in order to prolong 

the life and use of the resources it depends on.

Schneider Electric real estate footprint

Schneider Electric’s real estate footprint is made of approximately 

1,000 sites in total, across six continents, with a total occupied floor 

area of approximately 5 million square meters. Around two thirds of 

this surface is occupied by large industrial facilities for 

manufacturing and logistics purposes. The remainder consists of 

office buildings, that vary in size and characteristics. Overall, 

Schneider’s largest 100 sites account for about 50% of the Group’s 

footprint and its largest 200 sites account for approximately 80%. 

For this reason, the KPIs in the following sections are built around 

those 200 largest sites, ie those with the most material impacts.  

2.4.4.1 Risks and opportunities within 
manufacturing operations

Environmental risks related to manufacturing include soil, water, 

and air contamination. For instance, the release of hazardous 

substances can be harmful for fauna, flora, and human health. It 

can also disrupt continuity of operations and tarnish reputation. In 

addition to that, with factories and distribution centers spread 

across dozens of countries and different national environmental 

regulatory frameworks, risks of non-compliance exist. These risks 

include effluent management, handling of waste, and greenhouse 

gas-related expectations.

A proactive approach towards site and property environmental 

risks and compliance helps preserve the continuity of operations, 

reduce reputational and legal risks, and avoid expensive 

remediation steps. 

Resource and energy efficiency not only delivers financial savings, 

but also limits the Group’s exposure to commodity-price volatility 

and shortage risks. Electrification megatrends are increasing 

competition to access some raw materials, creating shortage risks 

for Schneider Electric. The risk extends to the reliability of the 

energy on which a facility relies to maintain production. 

The Group’s CO
2
 emissions contribute to climate change and may 

also incur additional costs as carbon taxes become implemented 

worldwide. Facilities and industrial assets themselves are also at 

risk of acute and chronic climate events which can disrupt the 

supply chain and endanger lives.

The Group believes environmental performance is a powerful tool 

to innovate towards a more efficient and resilient supply chain and 

generate bottom-line savings. By using its own EcoStruxure™ 

architecture to achieve this ambition, the Group also showcases 

carbon efficient architectures to its customers.

Environmental regulatory compliance, environmental management 

systems, and engagement programs with key stakeholders are the 

foundation of Schneider Electric’s environmental risk management, 

prevention, and continuous improvement program for current, 

former, and prospective operations.

Compliance with environmental regulations

Historical environmental liabilities are managed at a regional level 

to ensure that local expertise, regulatory knowledge, and cultural 

awareness are applied. Using external consultants, known 

environmental issues are thoroughly investigated, and, if 

appropriate, remediated or otherwise managed through 

engineered or institutional controls to reduce potential risks to 

non-significant levels and in compliance with local regulations. 

Environmental risks and provisions are reviewed with local and 

corporate finance, as well as legal functions.

During 2022, no new material environmental impacts were 

identified. See section 2.4.4.4 page 193 for more information. 

Furthermore, no Schneider Electric sites are Seveso-classified.

Environment management systems

Schneider has put in place an Integrated Management System 

(IMS) which allows for standardized, streamlined, and collaborative 

deployment of its various management systems. The IMS covers 

the Group’s plants, distribution centers, and large offices, and 

hosts ISO 14001, ISO 50001, ISO 9001, and ISO 45001 compliance 

management systems. Each site is audited periodically, either 

externally by Bureau Veritas (every three years), or internally. In 

particular, the relevant management system for the environment is 

ISO 14001.

ISO 14001 certification allows Schneider Electric to define and 

maintain robust environment governance on its sites, supporting 

continuous improvement to deliver environmental performance. The 

Group certifies all industrial and logistics sites with more than 50 

employees and all large tertiary sites with more than 500 

employees, within two years of their acquisition or creation.

243 sites were certified ISO 14001 as of the end of 2022, 

representing approximately 76% of the Group scope based on the 

share of site surfaces, 82% of the Group scope in terms of energy 

consumption, and over 83% of the Group scope in terms of water 

usage, waste generation, and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) 

emissions. 

The Group’s environmental reporting scope and targets are based 

on all ISO 14001 sites. Environment reporting metrics are shown in 

the table on page 269 and include energy consumption, Scopes 1 

& 2 CO
2
 emissions, waste generation, water usage, and VOC 

emissions.

With the Sustainability, Environment and Real Estate (SERE) 

network working hand in hand with the Customer Satisfaction & 

Quality (CS&Q) network, a robust governance is in place to mitigate 

environmental risks and drive continuous improvement. 

The internal Energy and Environment Policies supported by the 

Global Environment Directives on legal compliance, event reporting 

and alerts, and environmental liabilities provide clear expectations, 

scope and accountability rules, enabling the harmonization of 

environment and energy governance across regions and activities. 

Each site is assessed under more than 240 indicators consolidated 

under the Environmental, Health and Safety Assessment (EHSA) 

and published to all Global Supply Chain sites in a global EHSA 

dashboard. Sites are also benchmarked based on best available 

techniques documented and shared within SERE and CS&Q 

networks.

Engagement programs

Environmental risk management and prevention require more than 

just the appointment of technical environment experts. Robust 

governance with key stakeholders across the entire organization is 

critical to achieve and maintain success in the numerous areas 

surrounding environmental risk and prevention. 

The Group has therefore established the following engagement 

programs:

• The Company-wide Look at Environmental Assessment and 

Risk Review program (CLEARR), which focuses on historical 

and current potential environmental site risks, surveys new and 

existing selected manufacturing sites each year.

• Thorough environmental due diligence reviews of mergers, 

acquisitions, and disposals, at any site where chemicals are or 

have been used. Any environmental risks or liabilities identified 

are addressed through proper risk management activities.

• Third-party services assess the risk profiles of key sites in 

relation to certain external risks such as fires, earthquakes, 

floods, and other natural disasters.This process is combined 

with the business continuity planning efforts to gauge related 

risks and anticipate possible steps which would be required.

• Risks and mitigation actions are presented to the Board Audit & 

Risks Committee.

Resilience materials program

The Group approaches the access to resources at different time 

horizons, to ensure materials supply resilience both now and in the 

future. The Group is:

• building short-term resilience in securing supply and protecting 

operations against price volatility with real-time alerts to notify 

and activate action plans;

• de-risking its portfolio with technological solutions and circular 

business models;

• shaping the future with long-term material resilience and 

sustainability with disruptive actions.

To ensure materials sourcing resiliency, Schneider has added 

resource parameters in product EcoDesign and defined 

substitution strategies for critical resources. R&D actions are in 

place, focusing on materials with main strategic functions 

accompanied by communication channels to escalate and alert.

2.4 Being efficient with resources

2.4.4.2 Waste-to-Resources

Schneider Electric is committed to mitigating the potential adverse 

impacts of hazardous waste on environment and health. Two main 

levers have been identified through the “Waste-to-Resource” 

program. First, all sites generating hazardous waste ensure 

visibility of handling and end-of-life treatment paths. They must also 

seek to add value to waste where possible (through material or 

energy recovery) while neutralizing its hazardous nature. Secondly, 

top hazardous waste-generating sites should work to reduce the 

volumes of waste generated in the first place, notably by 

implementing “Best Available Techniques” (BAT) in their industrial 

processes. Such BAT processes lead to superior performance 

from a resource efficiency perspective, and/or chemical 

substances use, and/or emission reductions. 

In 2022, global challenges with supply chains, material shortages, 

and increased visibility towards waste pollution such as ocean 

plastics have confirmed that Schneider is heading in the right 

direction with its circularity strategy.

In its previous 2018-2020 program, “Towards Zero Waste to 

Landfill”, the Group placed strong emphasis on diverting waste 

from landfill through alternative solutions. 

In its new program called “Waste-to-Resource” (SSE #9), 

Schneider Electric takes its waste recovery program even further: 

sites must now achieve 99% recovery for all waste not classified as 

hazardous and still achieve 100% hazardous waste recovery using 

the best available handling/treatment options locally. Additionally, 

to promote and emphasize the importance of circular economy, 

“Waste-to-Resource” sites are not allowed to use waste-to-energy 

solutions for more than 10% of their waste. This provides an 

opportunity for sites to work collaboratively within their internal 

supply chains, and alongside external suppliers and waste 

management providers, to find innovative reduce, reuse, and 

recycle solutions.

In 2022, the Group did successfully add 19 new Waste-to-

Resource sites in 2022, but removed 18 sites that were Waste-to-

Resource in 2021, of which half were either closed, sold, or 

transferred to third parties for business reasons. The other half, 

while collectively achieving a commendable 98.7% recovery with 

only 5.2% waste to energy, still missed the very challenging 99% 

recovery target. 

In 2023, the Group will pursue its Waste-to-Resource efforts to 

more sites, thereby strengthening its culture of circular economy 

across its operations.

Schneider generated around 131,000 tons of waste in 2022, most of 

it being solid waste. Continuous improvement plans have been 

deployed to manage this waste, in line with the ISO 14001 

certification. Despite the challenges with the Waste-to-Resource 

program, the Group still managed to improve from 96% to 96.3% 

recovery of reported waste, and from 91% to 91.3% recycling rate 

without energy recovery in 2022 compared to 2021. The recovery 

ratio has increased from 81% to 96.3% since 2009, thanks to 

site-by-site waste management action plans.

By 2025, the ambition is to reduce hazardous waste intensity by 

30% against the 2017 baseline. In 2022, hazardous waste 

generation intensity was 0.24 tonnes/million EUR of revenue, which 

represents an evolution of -44% versus 2017.

200 “Waste-to-Resource” sites

The SEPSL plant located in Bangalore, India is a 

manufacturing site that produces cabinet enclosures. 

Sheet metal is a mandatory raw material in this production 

process. While the site takes action to reduce scrap metal 

where possible, there is still some remaining scrap in the 

process. Instead of simply recycling or selling the scrap, 

the site has undertaken a circular economy project to reuse 

the scrap metal internally.

The site analyzed opportunities to reuse the scrap and 

discovered there were wooden pallets being used for 

in-house material movement and storage, but that these 

pallets would routinely need replacement, and there were 

issues with shortages of the needed pallets. By fabricating 

pallets from the scrap metal, the site was able to increase 

the longevity of the pallets’ lifespan, decrease the reliance 

on wooden pallets, eliminate shortages issues, and reduce 

the metal waste linked to the production process.

This project has saved the site 220 wooden pallets to date 

and resulted in more than €36,000 savings annually. 

Moving forward, the site continues looking for ways to 

implement circular economy practices and reduce the 

waste generated.

2.4.4.3 Water withdrawal, discharge, 
and stress

Schneider Electric regularly assesses water-related risks. The 

Group conducted a materiality analysis, with both internal and 

external stakeholders. In 2022 a specialized consultancy was 

mandated to map its corporate water footprint across the value 

chain, covering water consumption, scarcity, eutrophication, 

ecotoxicity, and acidification. The assessment showed that direct 

water use and indirect energy water use in facilities amounts for 

less than 1% of Schneider Electric’s overall water footprint. This is 

explained by the nature of most of Schneider’s industrial processes 

(manual and automatic assembly), which have limited water use.

The impact on water quality is considered minimal as well; the 

highest impact on water quality indicators comes from the use of 

products and upstream purchases categories. In 2022, water 

management and performance information were disclosed in the 

CDP Water Security program, and Schneider was awarded a B 

rating. 

Water withdrawal

The Group measures water withdrawals per source, with details on 

water withdrawn from the public network, groundwater, surface 

water (for example lakes and rivers), and other sources of water 

(including rain and recycled water). 

Water is primarily used for cooling and sanitary purposes and, at a 

few selected sites, for processes such as surface treatment. Water 

drawn for the sole purpose of cooling is immediately released 

without alteration and is also monitored separately. 

Schneider Electric aims to reduce water intensity (in m3 of water 

withdrawn per euro of turnover) by 35% in 2025 versus 2017, with a 

focus on sites with high water withdrawal and within water-stressed 

areas. In 2022, water withdrawal intensity was 56 m3 per million 

euro of revenue, an evolution of -48% against the 2017 baseline.

2.4 Being efficient with resources

Water discharge

The majority of water discharged by Schneider Electric is sent to a 

third party for treatment without requiring additional prior treatment 

in Schneider’s facility. Whenever water is used for industrial 

processes requiring additional internal treatment (e.g. surface 

treatments), resulting water discharges are subject to appropriate 

treatments to reduce pollutant potential and subject to a monitoring 

plan. All sites with such water usage have designated water quality 

and treatment experts to ensure all local regulations are followed 

regarding water discharge. 

For example, at the Isle Espagnac plant (Poitou-Charentes, France), 

water is used as part of a chrome plating process and 

systematically treated before being discharged in sewers with 

adequate water quality as set by the local water discharge 

convention, which is monitored by an independent laboratory 

accredited by the local public administration. In addition, the site is 

investing EUR 1.7 million between 2022 and 2024 to transform its 

operations and discharge no water thanks to a closed water loop 

approach. This means that the site will no longer discharge water in 

sewers, with estimated savings of at least 2,000,000 liters per year 

and 330 tonnes of CO
2
 per year as the site will ship less filtered 

waste to incineration/landfill.

Water stress

Schneider Electric is also committed to minimizing its impact on 

water. The Group fully realizes the importance of water to local 

communities, especially those that are located in water-stressed 

areas. The Group therefore monitors the water stress level of all ISO 

14001 sites using the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Aqueduct 

Water Risk Atlas. Using the baseline water stress methodology, the 

Group considers sites classified as “high” or “extremely high” to be 

a water-stressed site, regardless of the amount of water withdrawn. 

85 sites have been identified under this methodology, accounting 

for about 44% of total water withdrawals, including factories, 

distribution centers, and large offices, with water usages such as 

process-based, HVAC, sanitary/canteen, and irrigation. The Group 

has set the target that 100% of its sites in water-stressed areas 

have a water conservation strategy and related action plan by 2025 

(SSE #11). In 2022, the Group achieved 48% of its 2025 target.

100% of sites in water-stressed 
areas have a water conservation 
strategy and action plan

The E&A Vadodara plant in India has a plating operation 

which represents a significant amount of the site’s water 

withdrawal. The site is located in a water-stressed area, so 

it is especially important to be efficient with water at the 

site. Hence, the site’s effluent treatment plant (ETP) was 

designed to recycle & reuse wastewater. Three major 

actions were implemented to optimize the process:

1. Segregation of input effluent to ETP (generating source).

2. Improve the existing treatment process.

3. Develop a new system to recycle and reuse of treated 

ETP water to make it suitable for the plating process.

The existing ETP treatment system was improved by 

converting two sand filters to one sand and one carbon 

filter and installing a new five-micron bag filter in the 

existing cartridge to improve treated water quality. A 

two-stage reverse osmosis system was also installed along 

with a special process to avoid chemical accumulation and 

biological growth on repeated water use in the closed loop.

These actions and improvements resulted in the following 

impacts:

• 80% recycling of treated wastewater to reuse in the 

plating process 

• 60% reduction in the freshwater intake for the plating 

process

The site continues working to improve efficiency and has a 

target to achieve an 80% reduction of the freshwater intake 

in the future.

2.4.4.4 Pollution mitigation 

Conditions of use and release into the soil

Schneider Electric’s sites are mainly located in urban or industrial 

areas. None of the Group’s businesses involve extraction or land 

farming. In 2022, Schneider’s manufacturing sites conducted their 

annual review of pollution risks as part of the ISO 14001 monitoring. 

No spills or discharges causing soil pollution occurred in 2022.

Hazardous materials are stored, handled, and used in compliance 

with regulations and with appropriate pollution protection 

mechanisms. As part of the “Waste-to-Resource” program, 

additional focus is placed on hazardous waste, with efforts to 

eliminate, substitute, or improve treatment.

Discharge into the water and the air

Because Schneider is mainly an assembler, its discharge into the 

air and water is very limited. The Group’s manufacturing sites are 

carefully monitored, as part of the ISO 14001 certification. 

Discharges are tracked locally as required by the current 

legislation. No spills or discharges causing water or air pollution 

occurred in 2022.

Emissions of NOx (Nitrogen oxides), SOx (Sulphur oxides) and 

particles into the air are monitored at site level in accordance with 

applicable legal requirements, with monitoring of these emissions 

verified via ISO 14001 audits. 

Schneider is committed to preventing air pollution and adverse 

health impacts from Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, 

and for this reason, the Group works to reduce VOC emissions from 

industrial activities by 10% every three years. VOC emissions, 

which are primarily linked to production, decreased from 29 kg/

million EUR in 2017 to 9 kg/million EUR in 2022 (-69%). The Group 

engages with each of its industrial sites that contribute the most to 

VOC emissions, and which together account for over 90% of the 

Group’s VOC emissions. For these sites, environment, health and 

safety, and industrialization teams, come together and actively 

collaborate to ensure conditions of use are strictly adhered to, and 

health and environmental risks are known and mitigated. Those top 

VOC-emitting sites also investigate opportunities to reduce and 

phase-out concerned chemicals from industrial processes 

wherever possible.

Finally, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and Hydrochlorofluorocarbon 

(HCFC) emissions are monitored locally, in accordance with 

applicable regulations. These emissions are mainly due to the 

operation of air conditioning systems and are not directly linked to 

Schneider’s industrial activities.

Noise, odors, and light

All Schneider’s sites comply with local regulations on noise and 

odor. Given the nature of its activities and distribution model, the 

Group does not have any significant external light pollution. 

2.4.4.5 Biodiversity actions at sites 

With the objective of gaining an overview on biodiversity priority 

sites, informing risk management, and addressing potential 

biodiversity impacts, the Group ran a multi-site report with the 

Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT). Developed through 

a partnership with Bird Life International, Conservation 

International, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 

and United Nations Environment World Conservation Monitoring 

Centre (UNEP-WCMC), IBAT collects and enhances the underlying 

datasets and maintains that scientific information.

The IBAT report enables users to assess the biodiversity-related 

features of multiple operational sites for risk management and 

strategy setting. In particular, the report is relevant for Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard GRI 304: Biodiversity. 

For each operational site, the report provides the counts of 

protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) within a 

1-kilometer radius.

The results of the “IBAT multi-site Report, 2021” include all 

Schneider sites and show that, within a 1-kilometer radius:

• 21% of its sites are in proximity of a protected area as defined 

by the IUCN, of which:

 − 8% are in category 1a, 1b and 2 (just 6 sites are in proximity 

of a category-1-protected area);

 − 29% are in category 3 or 4; 

 − 31% are in category 5 or 6;

 − 32% are not applicable, not assigned or not reported.

Among the sites in proximity of a protected area, 33% are either 

industrial sites (characterized by discrete industrial processes such 

as assembly lines) or distribution centers (warehouses and 

logistics); the remaining 66% are office buildings.

• 3% of the Group’s sites are in proximity of a key biodiversity area 

(defined by IBAT as either “Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE)” or 

“Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs)). 

All the results are made available to sites, so that they can better 

understand the local threat to biodiversity and restoration potential. 

Sites use these results at their discretion to drive the local 

bodiversity actions previously described.

2.4 Being efficient with resources

The Group has committed to increase its biodiversity site actions 

and raise the awareness of employees. Site activities such as 

energy consumption, water withdrawal, building infrastructure, 

food, landscaping, waste generation, light, sound and other forms 

of pollution, exert a pressure on biodiversity that can be reduced. 

For example, manicured, non-native landscaping could potentially 

increase water withdrawal and promote invasive species that don’t 

support native wildlife. 

The objective is to achieve 100% of sites with a local biodiversity 

conservation and restoration program by 2025 (SSE #8). To meet 

this target, Schneider sites have to define and deploy a biodiversity 

program consisting in the elimination of single-use plastics (relating 

to office use) and at least one local action with significant 

ecological impact, structured governance and stakeholder 

involvement. 

The scope of the single-use plastics ban for the biodiversity 

program is “consumer” plastics (e.g. cups, cutlery, gifts/souvenirs, 

etc.). “Industrial” plastics (e.g. primary/secondary packaging, 

products) are covered in Schneider Electric’s SSI #4 and SSI #5 

programs.

The program was launched in 2021 and many sites have already 

started on their journey, understanding the complexities of 

biodiversity, assessing their impact and identifying the right local 

stakeholders to engage in a preservation or restoration program. 

The program requires a complete elimination of single-use plastics, 

and the adoption of impactful biodiversity actions. As projected, 

there has been a slow ramp-up in terms of global performance. 

Nevertheless, the new governance structure adopting in 2022, 

allowed to accelerate the deployment of the program. The current 

governance is based on nominated country biodiversity leaders 

who lead and animate a group of sites biodiversity leaders that 

follow the daily operation of the biodiversity actions. This renewed 

structure has allowed the Group to accelerate from no reported 

progress in 2021 to 18% in 2022.

Resources

SSE #8

100% of sites with local biodiversity 
conservation and restoration 
programs

Schneider Electric is engaged to act at local level. Every 

site will engage in at least one action pursuing an 

ecological impact with social benefits. 

For example, in Grenoble (France), three sites (IntenCity, 

Technopole and Electropole) have been labeled “Wildlife 

Shelter” by a national NGO working on wildlife protection 

and restoration (Ligue de Protection des Oiseaux). To be 

granted this label, the sites have committed to a 

transformation journey with the NGO, where they 

understand how to optimize the management of their green 

areas to welcome and restore local biodiversity, notably 

with reasoned mowing, and a ban of pesticide usage. With 

the support of biology experts, the sites are in the process 

of creating hibernaculum and ponds to allow for a favorable 

environment to endemic species.

2.4.5 Product use phase and end-of-life
Schneider Electric aims to maximize the environmental 

performance of its products. To achieve such ambition, the Group 

develops services and business models to extend the useful life of 

its products, and when no option is possible, take back the 

product, assess whether a second-life is possible, and ultimately 

ensure the product or components are recycled. 

This section presents the Group’s actions to keep products in use 

and increase their recyclability at the end-of-life, through:

• services for maintenance and repair;

• business models to take products back and give them a second 

life;

• the maximization of the products’ recyclability at the end-of-life.

2.4.5.1 Services for maintenance, 
repairability and circularity – EcoCare & 
ECOFITTM

Schneider Electric Services experts and partners are dedicated to 

extend the lifespan of assets and systems while making customers’ 

operations safe, efficient, and resilient every day. 

With EcoStruxure’s digital capabilities, innovation, and expertise 

across multiple technologies, the Group advises, modernizes, 

monitors, and maintains the health of its customers’ energy and 

automation assets and systems around the clock and the globe.

Throughout the lifecycle of the installed base, Schneider Electric 

Services’ expertise answers customers’ needs by:

• providing EcoCare recurring services to monitor and maintain 

the installed base during its use;

• providing access to spare parts and repair services;

• advising and triggering optimization recommendations to 

increase safety, reliability, and efficiency;

• digitizing and modernizing the assets to increase life and 

prolong reliable operations;

• supporting the handling of end-of-life through recovery services 

(for example, for batteries, SF
6
, and modernized equipment)

These historical activities are critical to address the “maintain and 

prolong” loop of circularity, no matter the customer typology or 

sector of activity. 

Retrofit of equipments with ECOFIT™

Schneider quantifies its circular economy efforts (repair, reuse, 

refurbish, and recycle) and targets to avoid 420,000 metric tons of 

primary resource consumption through “take-back at end-of-use” 

by 2025, cumulatively since 2017 (SSE #10). This program enables 

savings in waste, material, energy consumption, CO
2
 emissions, 

and/or water.

Activities in this program will be extended in line with the Group’s 

increasing focus on circularity business models, and currently 

include:

• Take-back and recycling of batteries;

• Volume of devices refurbished and repaired in our repair 

centers (such as UPS or drives);

• Volume of medium voltage, low voltage and transformers 

refurbished or recycled in our ECOFIT™ Centers.

In order to properly promote the environmental benefits in 

terms of CO

 and material savings, the ECOFITTM teams 

have developed a calculator making use of the 

environmental impact database (based on Product 

Environmental Profiles – PEP created by Schneider). 

The calculation method of this calculator has been 

independently reviewed by an audit and assurance leading 

firm to ensure reliability of the information provided to the 

customers.

Modernizing and upgrading low voltage and medium voltage 

switchgear equipment does not necessarily mean demolishing the 

existing infrastructure. Schneider’s retrofit modernization combined 

with proper switchgear maintenance can help clients to improve the 

reliability of their installation. They can choose to replace the 

existing electrical installation with new equipment or can pinpoint 

where they will benefit from retrofitting existing equipments, 

modernizing, and upgrading those equipments for pre-equiped 

sensors, which are more cost-effective, enabling innovative service 

plans with 24/7 remote monitoring, and reducing operational 

downtime of the customer, compared to buying new equipment.

The ECOFITTM service can, for a customer’s system 20 to 40 years 

old, retrofit equipments in a very short time to the latest 

technologies and get them connected for real-time monitoring. The 

equipments that cannot be retrofitted can be taken-back to be 

reused, rebuilt and sold as second-hand products.

This approach makes ECOFITTM service an end-to-end value 

proposition to customers, avoiding up to 90% waste.

2.4.5.2 Circular business models

Schneider Electric creates shared value for its customers through 

circular capabilities such as local models of reuse, retrofit, repair, 

refurbish, and take-back, and by unleashing the potential of IoT, 

connecting and digitizing products (predictive maintenance, 

performance optimization, leasing, pay-per-use, performance 

contracting).

Most of Schneider’s new products are digital, connectable, ensure 

full product lifecycle management and predictive maintenance, and 

guarantee optimum performance, hence enabling the Group to 

move towards customer-intimate models like subscription, 

performance contracting, and leasing.

The first focus, before considering end-of-life, is to prolong the 

lifespan of products. These solutions, using up to 60% less 

materials than using brand new equipment, enable pull-through 

and constant payback, increase customer stickiness, and build 

long-term relationships.

There are opportunities to leverage the circular economies, both 

externally with customers and internally in operations. Schneider’s 

value propositions have long delivered resource efficiency, 

enabling customers to “do more with less”.

The risks that Schneider Electric has identified are around the 

perception of “one size fits all” for circularity, as well as the 

temptation to see it through a waste or recycling lens, and the focus 

on developing the related guidelines, governance, and standards 

based on this perception.

• Product durability versus shorter-term waste loops: All 

resources are not equal in their thermal, mechanical, or 

electromagnetic profiles. For the industrial sector, the biggest 

impact of the circular economy will come from the promotion of 

repairability, upgradability, “retrofitability”, extension of lifespan, 

and of related “product second- and third-life services”. 

Schneider’s products are highly technical in nature with a long 

lifespan and are highly unlikely to end up as ocean plastic 

waste. Yet a risk that the emerging regulations may be too 

“resource/waste-centric” can be identified. To meet quality and 

safety expectations, and adhere to stringent electric and 

electronic equipment standards, recycled materials are 

sometimes not available in either quantity and/or quality. The 

Group actively advocates sector-specific approaches. 

• Ensuring the safety of people and assets through qualified 

and certified services. In fact, while promoting services to 

extend the products’ lifespan, Schneider grows the ranks of 

certified experts on its products (through thousands of Field 

Services Representatives). Leveraging the circular economy, 

there is a fantastic opportunity to enable more repair, retrofit, 

and recycling services, on condition that concerned product 

categories are adequately maintained and serviced by qualified 

and certified experts.

Second life distribution center

Since 2019, Schneider has developed additional capabilities to 

address more circularity loops, to ensure a maximized second life 

for its products. 

These capabilities include:

• repack: repackaging of Schneider products when packaging 

has been damaged.

• give a second chance: sorting, selecting, redistributing 

never-energized Schneider products which cannot be sold 

anymore.

• refurbish and remanufacture: developing refurbishment and 

remanufacturing capabilities for relevant products to deliver on 

manufacturer-level circularity and provide state of the art 

second life solutions across selected markets.

• recycle: dismantling of products to recover and resell the 

valuable materials.

In 2022, Schneider significantly increased its offer of circular products 

to serve the growing demand for circular products, doubling the 

number of references available up to 6,400. In 2023, the Group 

expects to add more than 3,000 new references to its offer. 

To achieve that, new refurbishment capabilities have been 

developed on the industrial sites, increased take-back from various 

sources. Spare parts production has also been expanded to 

enable the repair of new references.

In 2023, Schneider Electric will continue to grow circular industrial 

capabilities to support business innovation and differentiating 

offers to customers:

• more repack and reuse;

• more refurbish;

• easier access to take-back and second life solutions.

Case study: Remanufactured MasterPacT MTZ

One great example of a circular product is the remanufactured 

MasterPacT MTZ. For the first time, Schneider has developed 

production lines, quality test, engineering expertise to collect, 

disassemble, and remanufacture MasterPacT MTZ. To offer the 

same guarantee as the new, these remanufactured breakers are 

assembled in the same production lines as the original new 

products. The Group is proud to announce that each 

remanufactured MasterPacT MTZ sold helps to cut by 45% the CO
2
 

emissions and requires 45% less resources. With this new product, 

Schneider strongly reinforces the link between sustainability and 

business, also ensuring business continuity, customers’ trust, and 

the development of the Group’s circular economy journey. In 2022, 

71.5 tonnes of CO
2
 emissions were avoided thanks to the 

remanufactured MasterPacT MTZ sales.

2.4.5.3 Managing the end-of-life of 
products

End-of-life regulations

Schneider Electric has deployed a process that ensures a safe 

treatment and recycling of its products at the end of their lifecycle.

In compliance with the Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment 

(WEEE) directive, Schneider implements product identification and 

selection actions, establishing recycling streams, and pricing the 

taxes to be applied following the regulations of each country where 

the Group’s products are sold.

For products falling within the scope of the WEEE directive, a 

circularity profile including detailed end-of-life instructions is 

systematically provided through the “Check A Product” public 

website.

Enhance recycling

Schneider’s unique approach for the modernization of aging 

equipment, minimizing waste and maximizing safety, efficiency, 

and resiliency, avoids up to 90% of waste by upgrading customers’ 

equipment with the latest technologies using sensors and 

connectivity to optimize uptime and extend the assets’ lifespan 

replacing the core components. This approach also enables the 

take-back of products, to reuse, rebuild, resell and recycle them 

when no other option is possible.

Case study:  
Azalys, Suez Hélyséo – 
Carrières-sous-Poissy, 
France

Azalys Suez site in Carrieres-sous-Poissy 
(France) is a household waste to energy  
facility, managing 125,000 metrics tons of waste 
and producing 50 gigawatts/hour of electricy 
each year.

The goals of the project were to add capacity to the electrical 

installation replace outdated equipment without a lengthy 

interruption to service, and to enable predictive maintenance. 

This involved installing state-of-the-art RM6 and SM6 

switchgears in place of FluoKit units, which were later 

recycled. In addition, starting in 2022, recovered Fluokit 

equipment by Schneider are reused as part of the circularity 

offers: providing prolonged service life and spare parts to 

customers.

Developing a win-win solution through circularity models is 

good for the Group’s customers and the environment, and is 

the avenue Schneider Electric continues to innovate and 

accelerate in this area.

2.5 Great people make Schneider Electric a great company

2.5.1 2025 people strategy and vision 

2.5.1.1 Context

The world is moving fast and is at an inflexion point: the desire for 

climate neutrality and energy transition are driving our business 

strategy and pushing the Group towards sustainable growth. At the 

same time, digital transformation and changing social needs 

demand greater inclusion. 

The post-pandemic world followed by ever growing supply chain 

constraints due to geopolitical issues are creating more 

opportunities for Schneider Electric to be the most local of global 

companies. 

Being agile by demonstrating resilience and adaptability is the 

most important prerequisite for success in today’s unprecedented 

environment of uncertainty. It requires the leverage of both human 

capabilities and digital technologies. Schneider Electric’s People 

Vision and People Strategy help achieve this. 

2.5.1.2 Schneider Electric’s People Vision 
– Employee Value Proposition, Core Values, 
and Leadership Expectations 

People Vision 

Schneider Electric’s People Vision provides the impetus to change 

the way we work and accelerate the cultural transformation at the 

company. Comprising Employee Value Proposition (EVP), Core 

Values and Leadership Expectations, the People Vision is a strong 

anchor to the People Strategy. 

The People Vision consists of the following: 

1
Our Employee Value Proposition is our commitment 
to engage existing and future talent. It’s the reason why 
people join, stay, and remain engaged and shows how 
we differentiate ourselves as an employer. 

2
Our Core Values determine who we are, what we do, 
and define the way we work together and deliver on our 
EVP promises. Our values guide our choices and 
illustrate the behaviors we expect our employees to 
demonstrate. 

3
Our Leadership Expectations show how we expect 
leaders to drive the Company for the future. They 
emphasize how our leaders will transform Schneider 
Electric by stepping up individually and collectively. 

Employee Value Proposition

The Group is also looking to establish a strong name as an 

employer and communicate around its Employee Value Proposition, 

which is our promise to current and future employees.

We believe that great people make Schneider Electric a great 

company. We are driven by our meaningful purpose and 

continuously create an inclusive environment where employees are 

empowered to be at their best and innovate.

Our Employee Value Proposition continues to evolve in line with the 

business. Making the emotional connection as to “Why Schneider 

Electric?” is fundamental to the ability to not only attract the best 

talent and be an “employer of choice”, but also to have it resonate 

as authentic with employees as a form of encouragement, 

motivation and inspiration

Our Employee Value Proposition

MEANINGFUL

Our mission is to be your digital partner for 

Sustainability and Efficiency.

We empower all to make the most of their 

energy and resources, ensuring Life Is 

On everywhere, for everyone, at every 

moment.

We adhere to the highest standards of 

governance and ethics. 

INCLUSIVE

We want to be the most diverse, inclusive 

and equitable company, globally. 

We value differences, and welcome 

people from all walks of life. 

We believe in equal opportunities for 

everyone, everywhere.

EMPOWERED

Freedom breeds innovation. 

We believe that empowerment generates 

high performance, personal fulfillment 

and fun. 

We empower our people to use their 

judgement, do the best for our 

customers, and make the most of their 

energy.

Core Values define the way we work together

Customer First. We surprise and delight customers as we would 

be nowhere without them. So, not only do we put ourselves in their 

shoes, but we also anticipate their needs and go the extra mile. We 

champion our sales people, because they are the face of our 

Company. Whatever our role, we can have an impact on the 

customer’s experience.

Dare to Disrupt. Innovation is our middle name. Good is never 

good enough, and that’s why we are constantly experimenting, 

taking risks, and disrupting the status quo. We think fast, and we 

act even faster. Setbacks don’t hurt us. They motivate us. That’s 

why we are not afraid to make our bets bigger and our decisions 

bolder to power the digital economy through energy management 

and automation. We, at Schneider, ensure Life Is On.

Embrace Different. We are 100% committed to inclusion. 

“Exclusion” is not even in our vocabulary. We believe in equal 

opportunities for everyone, everywhere. This means welcoming 

people from all walks of life, ages, and cultures, embracing 

different perspectives and calling out bias when we see it, so that 

every person feels uniquely valued and safe to be at their best. To 

us, a stranger is simply a friend we haven’t met yet.

Learn Every Day. To stop learning is to stop growing. We are 

genuinely curious, never done with learning. To us, there is no such 

thing as knowing it all or having all the answers. We believe in 

life-long learning. Every minute of every day brings a new chance 

to listen, open up our minds, and widen our horizons. We are never 

too experienced to learn.

Act Like Owners. Entrepreneurs at heart, we take responsibility 

and ownership of everything we do. This is not somebody else’s 

company. It’s ours! We are individually empowered and collectively 

driven to collaborate and beat the competition together. In the end, 

we do what is right for Schneider first – always with integrity and 

honesty.

Our Leadership Expectations

Shape our future. In a world that is in constant flux, we cannot sit 

around and wait for the future. We have to imagine, disrupt and 

lead our industry. Be an entrepreneur of digital transformation with 

customers. Think big and be bold, create disruptive strategies and 

architecture ahead of the curve and execute with agility, quality, 

and speed. Take initiative and learn from success and failure. After 

all, the only thing certain in the next normal is change.

Free up Energy. Free up your and your team’s energy to focus on 

customers, transformation and what really matters in life and work. 

Keep things simple, but never at the expense of ethics or safety. 

Remove roadblocks and unnecessary bureaucracy. Champion new 

ways of working - more digital, flexible, and efficient. Empower 

teams throughout multi-local, multi-hub model and agile methods. 

Speed is our ultimate differentiator.

Build the Best Team. Step up to lead in a digital world while 

building strong human connection with customers and colleagues. 

Give and ask for coaching and feedback every day. Care for your 

health and well-being and that of others. Be inclusive and build 

psychological safety. Hire great and diverse talent and develop 

them to their fullest potential. Drive team engagement and high 

performance. The sign of a great leader is a great team.

Achieve together. It all starts with making a human connection and 

working together with customers, partners and colleagues. 

Connect across our teams with an ‘easy to do business with’ spirit. 

Share information freely, don’t hide it. Engage in constructive 

dialogue, don’t avoid tough conversations. Collaborate with focus 

and in attitude; be inclusive but efficient on who to involve. 

Collaboration is the seed for innovation and winning.

Use your judgement. Ultimately, we are accountable and 

empowered to make the right decisions for the company. Trust your 

own judgment and common sense and empower teams to do the 

same. Don’t overcomplicate decision-making. Give clear direction 

in the face of ambiguity. Be agile and curious and use your best 

intuition and logic. Let ‘doing the right thing, in the right way’ be 

your compass.

2.5.1.3 2025 People Strategy 

Schneider Electric aspires to achieve its purpose and mission by 

empowering and developing its people to their fullest potential. The 

Group acts with agility and trust to innovate for its customers and 

strives to win in the market.

Launched in 2021, Schneider’s People Strategy provides the Group 

with the framework to support business growth and culture 

transformation. To achieve the mission of its People Strategy and 

shape the workforce of the future in the “next normal”, the 

framework includes three outcome-based themes: 

Organizational agility – a growth and innovation culture, enabled 

by a leaner, agile and multi-hub structure, customer proximity, and 

fast decision making, supported by new ways of working. 

Future ready talent – a diverse, empowered, and digitally skilled 

team. All talents develop current and future skills through a 

personalized experience to realize their potential. 

Leadership Impact – leaders deliver impact on results and 

transformation through disruption, collaboration and inclusion. They 

build great teams, coach and care to achieve together. 

2.5.1.4 Organization and Governance

At Schneider Electric the 3-pillar model has been followed within 

the HR function by adapting the various responsibilities in 

accordance with organizational context.

HR Business Partners focus on defining and implementing 

strategic people transformations (key talents, competencies, 

workforce planning, training for their community, footprint) in their 

respective entities. They provide strategic support and deliver day 

to day local support towards operational activities for managers 

and employees.

HR Solutions shape the future in line with the people vision, focus 

on a limited number of global priorities, define strategic 

transformation and priorities, develop global governance, policy & 

processes, and drive digital.

HR Services manage HR operations, standardize programs and 

systems, simplify processes, and drive digital transformation to free 

up energy.

Since 2020, Schneider Electric reinforced the governance of the 

Group, the professionalism of its processes, and its foundations for 

trust. In line with our Corporate Governance directions, the Group 

follows HR Governance led by a single point of contact with 

corporate organizations such as M&A, Internal Audit, Internal 

Control, Ethics & Compliance, and Data Privacy, which facilitates 

an agile response to corporate directions.

2.5.1.5 Employee Engagement 

Engaged employees are key to enable the company to be at its 

best and support the achievement of the Group strategy. By 

measuring engagement and responding to feedback, Schneider 

Electric can foster an environment in which people feel connected 

to their work and strive to perform.

Key updates in 2022

• High survey response rate of 85%, with a relatively stable 

engagement score, against the backdrop of an increasingly 

uncertain world. 

• Employees feel empowered in their work, with flexibility to 

enable how they work, while remaining connected to Schneider 

Electric’s purpose in an inclusive environment. 

• Emergence of two critical areas related to the employee 

experience and engagement: recognition and effectiveness. 

1. OneVoice Survey

As an inclusive company, all employees are asked to provide their 

honest feedback through the annual OneVoice survey, which 

evaluates their engagement and measures nine drivers of 

engagement, including leadership, development, and 

empowerment. This process helps the Group identify key avenues 

for improving employees’ engagement and their unique life at work.

Attributable to a continued high participation rate, the results of the 

survey are robust and representative, empowering leaders to focus 

on the right topics to drive change in their teams. The ability to 

maintain an engagement score above pre-pandemic levels 

illustrates the positive impact of providing stability and a vision for 

the future in the face of an increasingly uncertain global landscape. 

Schneider’s ambition is to achieve 75% engagement score by the 

end of 2025 (SSE #24). 

The Top 4 Drivers of Engagement from the 2022 results 

demonstrate that employees feel empowered in their work, 

benefitting from flexible work arrangements, while drawing 

inspiration from Schneider Electric’s purpose and goals in an 

inclusive environment.

2. Turning insight into action

Supported by a global network of engagement partners, leaders 

communicate results to their teams, followed by formulating 

impactful action plans. 

A holistic approach is taken to guide leaders on next steps 

following survey closure:

• Communicating the high priority of the topic among leaders

• Ensuring full understanding of the why, what and how of 

engagement

• Manager resources to facilitate action planning with their teams 

• Embracing transparency through open dialogue with teams on 

what could or could not be acted upon

• Committing to continuous communication of the action plan 

progress

One example of local teams turning insight into action is France’s 

‘Next Normal’ program, which is delivering on 10 initiatives for an 

improved employee experience. With an updated work from home 

and office policy, supported by remote work training, a system of 

management for hybrid teams, and an emergency protocol, 

leaders have responded to employees’ feedback. The program 

also includes training and hosted discussion forums for managers, 

bringing the program to life across all teams, driving strong 

leadership with employee empowerment and recognition at the top. 

New in 2022, a nudge communication template was developed to 

bolster communication of actions taken in response to employee 

feedback.

3. Focus on recognition and effectiveness to sustain 
the employee experience

With a Recognition score of 63% across 2021 and 2022, 

Schneider Electric launched the refreshed recognition platform, 

Step Up, introducing enhancements to how employees can be 

appreciated for their work. Read more about this initiative in section 

2.5.4 “Compensation and Benefits”, page 218.

A second engagement driver of attention relates to Effectiveness, 

ensuring teams have the tools and resources to support their work, 

while simplifying processes where possible. In response, the 

Schneider Digital team has prioritized simplifying the digital 

landscape, including several initiatives aimed at creating a ‘Lovable 

Employee Experience’. Focused on offering a best-in-class digital 

workplace, the aim is to engage employees with a personalized 

digital environment that enhances employee efficiency, supports 

new dynamic ways of working, and improves their sense of 

purpose and well-being, while boosting their overall experience at 

Schneider Electric. 

Generations

SSE #24

75% employee engagement score

In alignment with being the most local of global companies, 

managers are empowered to work with their teams to 

generate action plans to drive meaningful change. The 

2022 survey results show increased scores for both action 

plan awareness and impact. 

With an engagement score +6pts vs 2019, and +2pts vs the 

2022 Global Average benchmark, the resiliency of 

employees is clear. The verbatim analysis indicates that 

employees appreciate a workplace sustained by positive 

peer and customer interactions, a company mission 

committed to sustainability, and feeling supported during 

times of crisis.

2.5.2 Diversity, equity, inclusion, and well-being 

2.5.2.1 Context

At the turn of the decade, Schneider Electric observed a clear shift 

regarding the risks and expectations surrounding Diversity, Equity 

and Inclusion (DEI). With continuous global social unrest and a 

global pandemic that exacerbated inequalities and impacted 

underrepresented groups the hardest, inclusion and care is 

needed now more than ever. This paired, with the rising importance 

of Envrionmental, Social, Governance topics (ESG) for 

organizations, stakeholders and investors puts DEI at the forefront 

of Schneider Electric’s business, and people priorities.

Data shows that companies with a diverse set of employees 

experience greater financial performance. For example, one study 

from McKinsey1 found that over a three-year period companies with 

ethnically-diverse and gender-diverse workforces experienced an 

increase in cash flow. These companies were 36% and 25% more 

likely to have financial returns above their respective national 

industry medians than those with less diverse workforces. The 

bottom line is that more diverse companies can attract and retain 

top talent, improve overall employee and customer satisfaction, and 

achieve greater innovation. 

Taking all of this into context, Schneider Electric is keenly aware of 

the ever-increasing need to focus on mental health. The pandemic 

has accentuated existing vulnerabilities. According to Mercer2, 81% 

of employees felt at risk of burnout in 2021, compared to 63% in 

2019. Companies must make mental health a priority and integrate 

it into their overall inclusion and care efforts. 

2.5.2.2 Risks and opportunities

Diversity, equity and inclusion is a business imperative. Without a 

clear focus on these priorities, companies open themselves up to 

risks. For example, fair and equitable talent practices are 

imperative to providing equitable access to job opportunities, 

career development and advancement. When companies do not 

have a focus on these areas, they risk making biased and 

discriminatory talent decisions. In addition, companies without 

clear policies and practices that embrace an inclusive culture are 

not as attractive to talent, leading to challenges in recruitment and 

retention. All of these risks, entail costs for companies and loss in 

efficiency. It can also lead to legal ramifications and a negative 

impact on the company’s image.

Schneider Electric defines its strategy taking into consideration 

those risks and opportunities, internal and external trends, insights 

and feedback from leaders and employees, and it’s desire to 

become the most inclusive and caring company in the world. 

Schneider Electric believes this leads to greater engagement, 

performance, and innovation.

2.5.2.3 Group Policy

In its Trust Charter, Schneider Electric clearly expresses that its 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ambition aims to offer equal 

opportunities to everyone, everywhere. The Group wants its 

employees – no matter who they are, or where they live in the world 

– to feel uniquely valued and safe to contribute their best, free from

harassment, victimization and discrimination of any kind.

The Group’s DEI policy recognizes that diversity comes in many 

forms; visible and non-visible, including cognition, experience, 

education, gender and gender identity, age, nationality, race and 

ethnicity, color, sexual orientation, disability status, religious, 

cultural and socio-economic background, life experience, location, 

and more, depending on local adaptations.

  Read more about our DEI policy on the Diversity and  

Inclusion page on www.se.com

Since 2016, the company enriched its strategy beyond a gender 

focus to better address inclusion and psychological safety for all 

diversities. This included developing and implementing global 

polices that empowered our employees to manage their unique life 

and work as well as ensured our employees felt valued and safe 

(Global Family Policy Leave, Flexibility at Work, Hidden Bias 

Education and Global Anti-Harassment Policy). In addition, 

partnerships were expanded with organizations to address 

important topics related to other diversities, such as LGBT+ 

community and people with disabilities. 

Looking ahead with the UN SDGs as a compass, Schneider’s 

strategy has been extended to embrace diversity, equity and 

inclusion and well-being. The group brings its ambition to life by 

empowering all employees to develop inclusive practices and 

behaviors, ensure fairness and equity in core people processes and 

policies, and, advocate internally and externally for change with 

partners, like UN Women through the Generation Equality Forum, and 

the World Economic Forum. Schneider is committed to becoming 

among the most inclusive and caring companies in the world. 

2.5.2.4 Governance

The implementation of Schneider Electric’s DEI strategy involves 

several different bodies and stakeholders, working hand in hand 

with the global DEI team.

The Global DEI team, led by the Chief Diversity Officer, SVP of 

Talent and Diversity, defines the strategy and is accountable to 

deliver on Schneider Electric’s DEI transformation, working with the 

Group’s Executive Committee and the Group Global DEI Board. 

Progress and results of the DEI ambition are also reported to the 

Board of Schneider Electric (HR & CSR Committee) on an annual 

basis. The team works in close collaboration with the HR Center of 

Excellence (Talent Acquisition, Talent Management, Learning and 

Rewards), Sustainability, Compliance, Internal communications, 

and Marketing and Employer Branding teams, as well as with the 

broader HR and Communication ecosystem.

Schneider Electric’s Global DEI Board is a group of top leaders 

from all the Group’s markets, sponsored by the Executive 

Committee, which acts as a sounding board for the Global DEI and 

Well-being strategy, and as internal and external DEI champions. 

Board members are nominated by the Executive Committee to 

serve a two to three-year term. Schneider Electric entities develop 

local DEI and Well-being action plans based on the global strategy 

and employee feedback, while meeting local regulations and 

addressing country-specific situations. To support the local focus, 

leaders, ambassadors, and champions have been appointed in 

more than 100 countries/zones and entities to develop and lead 

local action plans. This global network convenes bi-monthly to 

share progress and best practices.

To continue raising the bar on Schneider Electric’s ambition to be 

one of the most inclusive and caring companies in the world, the 

Group is focused on hardwiring equity, inclusion and care into all 

processes and behaviors. The Group seeks to achieve Inclusion 

and Care by Design in everything it does.

2.5.2.6 Thriving individuals 

Built on a foundation of trust and respect, the Group’s inclusive 

practices seek out and embrace different perspectives, support 

flexible ways of working, and protect each individual’s well-being. 

Bulding a culture of inclusion and respect

Zero tolerance for harassment

Schneider Electric has zero tolerance for harassment, victimization, 

discrimination, and retaliation of any kind at all levels of the 

organization. In 2018, the Group formalized its zero-tolerance 

stance on harassment by launching a Global Anti-Harassment 

Policy. The policy explicitly prohibits any kind of harassment (sexual 

or non-sexual) in the workplace, and states that “no Schneider 

Electric employee shall be subjected to harassment, victimization 

or retaliation based on - including but not limited to - race, sex, 

national origin, religion, political opinion, age, medical status, 

disability, gender, marital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation or 

gender identity”. 

The policy sets clear and consistent expectations of workplace 

conduct, outlines the roles and responsibilities of employees, 

managers, and witnesses in creating a workplace free of 

harassment of any kind, and highlights the different reporting 

channels available to report concerns, while maintaining 

confidentiality and protection against retaliation. 

Lastly, the policy lays out the type of corrective or disciplinary 

actions that can be taken in case of discriminatory behavior or 

harassment, or failure to report such incidents. A revised and 

expanded policy will be launched for all employees globally in 

2023.

S T R A T E G I C  R E P O R TChapter 2 – Sustainable development

To support cultural awareness and understanding, as well as 

celebrate the uniqueness of the Group’s global teams, the Group 

hosts events, webinars, communications, and more for International 

Women’s Day, Pride Month, International Men’s Day, Global 

Accessibility Awareness Day, Global Mental Health Day, 

International Day of Persons with Disabilities. In 2022, these 

campaigns generated more than 30 million impressions through 

external social networks.

Inclusion and respect building programs: 

• “Overcoming Hidden bias” eLearning: Understand what 

hidden bias means, explore clear steps to keep decision-

making objective, and how to call out bias when seen. In 2022, 

82% of employees had completed this training.

• “Building a Culture of Respect” eLearning: Explore the 

importance of building a culture of respect, learn to recognize 

the different forms of harassment, and understand the actions to 

take (as employees and managers) when witnessing such 

conduct. In 2022, more than 93% of employees had completed 

this training. 

• Employee Resource Networks (ERNs): Employee volunteer 

led networks, globally and locally, made up of individuals with 

similar backgrounds, experiences, characteristics and/or who 

share a passion or interest, play a key role in building an 

inclusive and equitable culture. ERNs within the Group include, 

Women professionals, Emerging professionals, Black, Hispanic 

and Asian professionals, LGBT+, and People with Disabilities 

and Allies networks. 

Fair and equitable talent processes

Schneider Electric is committed to transparent and equitable 

access to career opportunities, growth and development to the 

fullest potential, and equal pay for equal work for all its employees 

worldwide. 

Talent decisions are based on skills, values, performance, and 

potential, and the Group counts on each leader to be fair and 

equitable when making a hiring or promotion decision to help 

advance its overall goal to create a skilled and diverse workforce 

for the future. To check and mitigate hidden bias in its main human 

resource programs, the Group has built in reminders and prompts 

for moments that matter, including performance and salary review 

processes.

Fair and equitable pay is a core component of the Group’s 

compensation philosophy, in line with the principle of equal pay for 

equal work. More details on SE’s compensation and benefits are 

provided in 216 of this report.

Supporting employees’ well-being, mental health 

and unique lives and work

Built on a foundation of trust and respect, Schneider Electric seeks 

to support the unique needs of a diverse workforce with flexible 

ways of working, global inclusive benefit standards, and programs 

that care for its employees’ well-being. It is the Group’s belief that 

this makes them stronger and more resilient in today’s world. The 

Group has implemented several policies to support employees and 

respect their unique lives and ways of working. 

The Group’s global benefits standard is reviewed annually by the 

rewards and benefits teams for compliance with its global benefit 

policies and principles. This review ensures that the Group’s 

inclusive global benefit standards are delivered for everyone, 

everywhere. More details on SE’s compensation and benefits are 

provided in p.218 of this report.

To ensure they are creating a supportive and healthy working 

environment where every individual thrives, the Group has a holistic 

view of well-being (physical, mental, emotional, and social) as key 

components of the current strategy, tackling three areas of impact: 

1. The ways of working and flexible work arrangements, 

2. Overall employee well-being, 

3. Mental health support.

Schneider Electric has implemented many services at its sites 

throughout the world (gym facilities, concierge, creativity rooms, 

cultural events, mindfulness activities, back-up dependent care, 

and more) to support all employee’s mental load, energy recovery 

and overall resilience.

As of 2020, 90% of employees worldwide have access to a 

comprehensive workplace wellness program, including medical 

coverage and dedicated programs to educate and support 

employees on new, smarter ways of working, mindfulness in the 

workplace and working in a hybrid world.

Flexibility at Work

Schneider Electric’s Global Flexibility@Work Policy creates a global 

standard to work from home (WFH) two days a week for all eligible 

employees, and one day for employees working in distribution 

centers and plants(1). This global standard was introduced in 

response to feedback in the Group’s 2020 global employee survey 

in which a large proportion of employees stated that they preferred 

a hybrid work model (mix of WFH and “work from office”). The 

policy addresses hybrid work holistically, providing employees with 

mental health resources and training on best practices. The policy 

reflects the broader shifts of a global, digital, and ever-changing 

environment, and contributes to a more agile, inclusive, 

empowered, and trusting Group culture. At the end of 2022, 99% of 

the countries have implemented the new Flexibility@Work policy.

As part of this new Flexibility@Work Policy, countries can explore 

additional measures such as flexible working hours, flexible 

holidays, part-time work, and volunteering. Some examples of 

Schneider Electric countries raising the global standards with no 

fixed limit on the number of WFH days are Estonia, Finland, Latvia, 

Lithuania, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Slovakia, Germany, 

the United Kingdom, and the United States, operating with a fully 

flexible, output driven philosophy.

Global Family Leave

Schneider Electric’s Global Family Leave Policy supports all 

employees globally with personal time at critical life stages and 

empowers them to manage their unique life and work so that they 

can be at their best. To find out more about our Global Family 

Leave Policy please refer to section 2.5.4 “Compensation and 

Benefit” on page 218.

2.5 Great people make Schneider Electric a great company

(1) Eligibility is based on employee’s role and requirements for on-site work and is determined by country/territory with additional input from managers. Some essential 

roles, e.g., Plant & Distribution Center blue-collar workers, Field services engineers due to role specifications are excluded from this 2-day work-from-home policy. 

Recognizing that many critical roles need to be on site, this policy was adjusted to 1 day for the eligible Plant & Distribution Center specific roles.

Mental Health Support

Schneider Electric integrated mental health into its global well-

being focus in 2019, and has provided all employees with a 

playbook, and series of trainings (available in multiple languages) 

on how to deal with mental health challenges. In addition, the 

Group actively participates in World Mental Health Day, and a 

volunteer-based global mindfulness team holds annual events to 

support employees and annually in October.

In 2022, 98% of employees completed “We All have Mental Health,” 

an eLearning module focused on what mental health means, and 

how to recognize the signs of mental health challenges and take 

action. Nearly 1,500 employees shared mental health tips and 

personal commitments on Schneider Electric’s internal social media 

platform reaching many through the #MentalHealthMatters. During 

the annual mental health campaign, beyond local actions 

organized by country, more than 3,000 employees attended live 

global webinars on dealing with emotions, managing the mental 

health of teams, and financial well-being. In addition, 18 

mindfulness practice sessions were organized, in English, Spanish, 

French, and Italian to promote this practice.

2.5.2.7 Diverse teams at Every level

Schneider Electric desires to be among the most inclusive and 

caring workplaces. This includes visible and non-visible dimensions 

of diversity, including cognition, experience, education, gender and 

gender identity, age, nationality, race and ethnicity, color, sexual 

orientation, disability status, religious, cultural and socio-economic 

background, life experience, location, and more, depending on local 

requirements. To achieve this ambition, the Group recognizes that it 

must continue to build an understanding of the demographic 

makeup and experiences of inclusion by its employees. As a global 

organization, the Group collects limited demographic information on 

its global workforce (gender, generation, and nationality) aligned with 

globally accepted definitions and legalities. In addition, the Group’s 

local operations collect additional demographic information based 

on local regulations (Race/Ethnicity in the US; Disability status in the 

US, France and India, etc).

2025 Gender Diversity Commitment 

Schneider Electric began its journey to becoming a gender-

balanced organization more than 15 years ago and has identified 

increasing the share of women in its workforce and leadership as a 

business imperative. To support this aim, the Group has stated 

ambitions on increasing female representation in the overall 

workforce, and seeks to engage all genders in the journey.

In 2021, Schneider Electric renewed its commitment to gender 

balance with the 2021 – 2025 SSI gender balance ambition, SSI #8, 

50/40/30 – with women representing 50% of all new hires, 40% of 

frontline managers, and 30% of senior leadership by 2025. This 

commitment is a testament to the progress the Group has made, 

and a clear signal that it intends to double-down on its efforts to 

achieve more gender balance across all levels of the organization.

At the leadership level, Schneider focuses on 30% representation 

because research has shown that 30% is the tipping point for 

diversity to have a real impact on teams. To support this ambition, 

the Group invests in development programs for female talent to 

grow within the organization, and access senior levels, while also 

recruiting great talent from the external market.

While significant progress has been made in the representation of 

women, especially on the Board and Executive Committee level 

(respectively, 41% and 45% female as of end of 2022), the Group 

recognizes that there is more work to do at all levels in the 

organization. 

One of the programs the Group created to support this is 

Schneider Women Leaders’ Program (SWLP), a global program 

focused on enabling mid-career women to build the skills and 

confidence to step up their leadership capability and impact. SWLP 

is delivered through coaching, group and individual learning, and a 

global summit. Since its launch in 2019, more than 320 women have 

benefited from this targeted leadership development program and 

thousands more through programs delivered at the local level.

Employee Resource Networks (ERNs) also play a significant role in 

empowering women locally and helping drive efforts to advance 

women in leadership. As of the end of 2022, local ERNs have 

contributed to the Group’s efforts towards gender equality and 

inclusion in more than 40 countries. 

Equal

SSI #8

Increase gender diversity in hiring 
(50%), front-line management (40%) 
and leadership teams (30%)

The group is advancing gender equity through innovative 

programs designed for experienced professionals who 

have spent two or more years out of the traditional 

workforce. Through a structured program, the “returnees” 

receive nurture-based coaching, hands-on work 

experience, and a built-in support system to aid their return 

to work. The program focuses on soft skill development and 

technical upskilling, with a specific focus on the Schneider 

Electric business. At the end of the program, they become 

eligible for full-time or extended contracting work in varied 

roles across the Group, including pricing, marketing, 

customer success, supply chain, and finance.

Generational diversity

For the five generations working at Schneider, the Group seeks to 

foster life-long career development and knowledge exchange for 

and across all generations to boost learning and innovation. The 

Group is committed to creating new opportunities for the next 

generation through apprenticeships, internships, and its annual 

global student competition for innovation, Schneider Go Green. 

With tailored career development opportunities including career 

week, coaching, development plans, and mutual mentoring the 

Group is harnessing the power of all generations. With this, 

Schneider Electric is committed to supporting talent in the later 

stages of their career to have meaningful and fulfilling 

development, and to recognize and leverage their unique expertise 

and experience to boost learning and innovation across 

generations. For more information, see 2.5.3 Talent attraction and 

development, page 211.

Origin, Race, Ethnicity and Nationality

Schneider Electric believes in a multi-local world with locally 

tailored solutions supported by diverse teams across the globe to 

best meet its customers’ needs with customization, quality, and 

speed. The Group’s multi-hub model is key to delivering on this 

ambition with teams that represent diverse origins, nationalities, 

ethnicities and races, locations and cultural backgrounds. The 

multi-hub model focuses on attracting and developing local talents 

for global and local roles, and ensuring leadership reflects the 

diversity of nationalities and ethnic backgrounds present in local 

markets. The opportunity for Schneider Electric to be the “most 

local of global companies” with a balanced multi-hub footprint to 

enable customer proximity, innovation, speed, collaboration, and 

diversity, is a key differentiator for long-term success.

Because these diversity of origin dimensions are addressed 

differently depending on the local context and culture, and their 

categories and definitions vary widely from country to country, 

there is no internationally accepted criteria and our local country 

teams drive local ambition and actions.

Race and ethnicity in the US 

Schneider Electric US is committed to evolving the racial and 

ethnic diversity of its employee population, with a specific focus on 

increasing ethnic representation. To support its ambition, in 2021, 

the Group became a member of the National Society of Black 

Engineers’ (NSBE) Board of Corporate Affiliates (BCA). A group of 

sponsored and volunteer employees formed SExNSBE, an internal 

NSBE community, to focus on increasing the attraction, recruitment, 

and retention of Black professionals at Schneider Electric through a 

company-funded multi-touch transformational partnership. The 

Group’s SExNSBE Community includes 240 employee members 

who spent more than 850 volunteer hours mentoring school-aged 

children in 2022 through the NSBE Jr program, and more than 600 

volunteer hours mentoring collegiate NSBE members.

Accessibility and inclusion for people with 

disabilities 

Since January 2021, Schneider Electric has been a member of the 

International Labour Organization (ILO) Global Business and 

Disability Network and is committed to promoting and including 

people with disabilities throughout its operations worldwide. As a 

follow up to this commitment, in March 2022 the Group announced 

the creation of the Global Accessibility Office, addressing the 

holistic needs of people with disabilities through a strategy of 

Inclusion and Care by Design, for people with disabilities. This is 

underpinned by global awareness and education about what is the 

largest minority group in the world, consisting of 1.3 billion people. 

The Group focuses on all dimensions of disability: visible, invisible, 

permanent, and temporary. These include Physical Motor or 

Physical Health, Sensory, Cognitive and Neuro diversities, and 

Psychological, Emotional or Behavioral. 

The Group’s approach of “accessibility by design” creates holistic 

disability inclusion through four pillars: 

1. Customer First design: Fully accessible product, software, and 

UI/UX design

2. People, processes, and tools: Accessibility by design in all 

processes (including recruitment), platforms and tools

3. Brand and Communication Accessibility: For all events and 

communication – internal and external, digital, physical, and virtual

4. Built environment: Accessible buildings and workplaces 

applying Universal Design principles, local legislation, and the 

International Accessibility Standards

In June 2022, Schneider Electric joined The Valuable 500 (V500)  

– a global business collective made up of 500 CEOs and their 

companies, innovating together for disability inclusion – with a 

commitment to: 

• Ensure that disability inclusion is on our senior leadership agenda.

• Make at least one firm commitment to action.

• Share our commitment with the business and the world.

With inclusion and care for all as a major focus of the Group’s DEI 

and Well-being ambition, building awareness and education about 

People with Disabilities and Accessibility was a major focus in 

2022. In December 2022, the Group then celebrated the UN 

International Day of Persons with Disabilities, with a focus on 

addressing “ableism” and “inclusive decision making” for people 

with disabilities, using the tagline “Don’t make decisions about me, 

without me”.

Focus on France

In France, an employee with disabilities is one who is recognized 

as such by the French commission for the rights and autonomy of 

people with disabilities.

Schneider Electric France (SEF) reports 6.4% of the direct 

workforce (as of end of 2021) are employees with disabilities. In 

December 2021, SEF entered an agreement with unions, to recruit 

at least 100 people with disabilities over the next three years. In 

addition, they agreed to more accessibility (physical and digital), 

and more collaborative actions to allow employees facing health 

issues to work with more involvement of Union representation. 

Schneider Electric France works closely with a diverse panel of 

partnerships and the Group remains committed to the recruitment 

of People with Disabilities.  In 2022, 24 new permanent workers, 23 

apprentices and 8 new interns were recruited. 

Annually, the Group hosts an internal competition for “The Handi 

Trophy”, to recognize and promote the involvement of teams with 

regards to the inclusion of people with disabilities. 

In addition, Schneider France works with a start up specializing in 

behavioural science analysis with a group of employees, including 

managers, people with disabilities, Human Resources Business 

Partners, individual contributors, and in-house medical staff. As a 

result of their analysis, Schneider France has greater 

understanding of the barriers preventing employees from talking 

about their disability. Resources have been created in collaboration 

with a group of employees to address recruiters, managers, and 

people with disabilities. 

Focus on India

In 2018, Schneider Electric India launched a program “SAKSHAM” 

(which means capable), focused on the inclusion of People with 

Disabilities through continuous education, enabling infrastructure 

and equitable processes and policies. The program focuses on 

employing, engaging, enabling and empowering those with 

disabilities. Two awareness and educational sessions of SAKSHAM 

were conducted in 2022, covering more than 700 employees. 

Within the SAKSHAM program, Schneider India has also launched 

a Digital Accessibility campaign which educates and empowers all 

employees on how to be digitally inclusive in both personal and 

professional interactions. 

LGBT+ inclusion 

We recognize and celebrate the Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans and 

Intersex People (LGBT+) community and its members for its 

diversity and uniqueness. The Group aims to build awareness and 

advocate for the community and wants its employees to be allies, 

playing a decisive role in creating an open and safe community 

where individuals are comfortable bringing their whole authentic 

self to work.

2.5 Great people make Schneider Electric a great company

Schneider Electric is committed to the United Nations Free and 

Equal Standards of Conduct for Business on Tackling 

Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans and Intersex People, 

standing up for equal rights and fair treatment for LGBT+ people 

everywhere. Across the globe, Schneider Electric has also made 

public statements of support to advance LGBT+ inclusion. By 

adopting these standards, the Group pledges to respect and stand 

up for the human rights of LGBT+ workers, customers, and 

members of the public; to support our LGBT+ employees, further 

build inclusion in the workplace, and to prevent discrimination, 

including workplace discrimination, against LGBT+ people. 

Schneider Electric partnered with l’Autre Cercle, a French LGBT+ 

association, and contributed to the “Odyssey for Equality” project. 

The project aims to bring concrete recommendations on LGBT+ 

inclusion for corporate members and partners for the next ten 

years. 

Building allyship

• LGBT+ and Allies Employee Resource Network (ERN): A 

volunteer, employee-led network of employees focused on 

co-creating internal and external awareness and education 

campaigns and feedback and design of the Group’s benefits 

and policies. In 2022, the ERN developed and launched a 

Transgender Playbook, piloted in South America. The playbook 

is designed to guide employees, managers, and HR teams in 

supporting those transitioning in the workplace with inclusion 

and care. 

• Focus on North America: In 2022, Schneider Electric North 

America launched a “Pronouns in the Workplace” program, 

providing stickers and pins with the pronouns, He/Him, She/Her 

and They/Them in selected US, Mexico and Canada sites. This 

initiative is intended to raise awareness around self-identification 

as well as fostering a safe and welcoming work environment and 

will serve as a catalyst for expansion into other countries and 

regions.

• Focus on France: In 2022, Schneider Electric France took part 

in the ‘StOpE initiative’, which defines eight actions to combat 

sexism and LGBT+ phobia. With senior leader sponsorship, the 

initiative deployed educational resources for managers on 

recognizing and responding to signs of sexism. In 2022, more 

than 100 managers completed the training. For all employees, 

an eLearning provides essential information on how to 

recognize and act against signs of sexism and LGBT+ phobia. 

The Group has also created a network of 60 harassment, 

sexism, and LGBT-phobia referents located all over France.

2.5.2.8 Driving change by impacting 
society and advocating for diversity, equity, 
and inclusion 

Schneider Electric is committed to driving change within its broader 

ecosystem and society at large, through advocacy and role-

modelling. The Group works closely with its strategic partners and 

suppliers and invests in local actions through the Schneider 

Electric Foundation, with the goal of addressing systemic inequities 

and becoming a leader in corporate citizenship. In addition, 

Schneider Electric US has committed to diversifying its supply 

chain through its Supplier Diversity program (see section 2.2.12.12 

“Supplier diversity program in the United States” page 144).

Inclusive Mindset for Children Program in India

JAGRITI was launched in 2016 to focus on impacting 

young minds to build an inclusive and equitable society. 

The program aims to educate and influence school 

children on equity, culture of respect, inclusion, gender 

stereotypes and biases. In 2022, this program was 

extended to schools in Mumbai, Chennai and 

Hyderabad, engaging more than 200 students from five 

schools. Since 2016, we have engaged 7,500+ students 

in over 45 schools across India.

A snapshot of some of our global recognitions are summarized here:

publication of the group’s Operational Recommendations on 

Ethnic Diversity & Inclusion. 

• WeQual - WeQual is on a mission to achieve 50/50 gender parity 

at the top of the world’s largest companies.

2.5.2.9 Recognitions and awards

Schneider Electric has been included in many global and local 

indices for multiple years due to the Group’s commitment, 

transparency and impact in the DEI and Well-being space.

2.5.3 Talent attraction and 
development

2.5.3.1 Context

Attracting, developing and retaining talent is crucial to the ongoing 

success of companies. Business growth in markets around the 

world, in conjunction with the rapidly evolving “next normal”, 

requires an acceleration of skill development to prepare for greater 

organizational agility and resilience, developing leaders who build 

strong and caring connections in a digital world, and shape the 

workforce of the future.

2.5.3.2 Risks and opportunities 

Schneider faces the risk of talent and skills attrition given the 

current talent scarcity in the market, the volatile, uncertain, complex 

and ambiguous (VUCA) world we live in, the demand for a more 

local world, and the unprecedented changes in the future of work. 

The risk of not attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in 

the market, especially for critical skills, would have an impact in 

terms of:

• Cost of recruiting and onboarding

• Gaps in critical skills to stay ahead of the competition

• Talent’s brand perception 

At the same time, with the right policies and programs in place, 

these risks become opportunities for the Group to strengthen its 

brand as talent developer for everyone, everywhere, leading to 

greater talent attraction. The policies and programs from the Group 

include:

• A new talent acquisition platform to simplify the overall 

candidate experience, migrate to more digital, borderless, and 

self-paced offers to attract talent, and create a more equal 

playing field for those interested in Schneider. 

• An annual performance and development approach with fair, 

transparent, and competitive rewards and development, 

supported by regular meaningful career conversations. 

• A digital ecosystem powered by AI to enable access to 

development opportunities (internal mobility, project, and 

mentoring) via Open Talent Market (OTM). 

• Programs for employees at different stages of their professional 

career and specific talent segments (e.g. Digital, AI, Software, 

R&D, Supply Chain, Sustainability), with a strong focus on digital 

skills, commercial excellence, leadership and functional 

expertise. 

• A Global Flexibility@Work policy and a balanced Multi-hub 

footprint to enable its employees to have more flexibility and 

manage their unique life and work in the way that works best for 

them 

These key policies and programs ensure the investment in the 

attraction and development of talent at all levels. They create 

equitable opportunities and the environment for employees to learn 

and grow, while empowering them to own their career by 

developing critical skills to support their personal and professional 

growth, supported by their manager and enabled by digital tools.

2.5.3.3 Group policy 

Schneider Electric believes that all their employees are talent and 

empowers people to grow to their fullest potential, developing new 

skills and building careers for today and tomorrow, enabled by the 

Group multi-hub organization. Establishing a strong brand as an 

employer is communicated in the EVP (Meaningful, Inclusive, 

Empowered); the promise to current and future employees, driven 

and anchored by a meaningful purpose. In addition, the Group 

invests in learning and development for the wider ecosystem, 

including universities and schools, partners, customers, and the 

wider community.

The Group has a two-pronged approach to talent development, in 

order to prepare the workforce of the future – for all employees and 

for specific target groups. Most activities are driven through an 

annual People Calendar, which is adopted globally to ensure that 

development is accessible to all employees. 

• For all employees, the Group ensures there are tools and 

processes in place to set individual performance and 

development goals, and access learning and development 

opportunities for their current role, as well as preparing 

themselves for diverse career paths around the world. 

#LearnEveryDay as one of the Core Values, sets the tone for 

employees to be open to new challenges and continue to upskill 

for themselves, their teams, and their communities. In the 

OneVoice employee survey, 76% of employees responded 

favorably to being able to renew their skills through learning and 

development opportunities. 

• For specific groups of talent, there are targeted programs for 

specific skills to support Schneider commercial, digital, and 

leadership transformations and equip our blue-collar workers for 

the supply chain of the future. There is a strong focus on high 

potentials, expert talent, and employees at different career 

stages, including early career talent and those who are in a later 

stage of their career. An annual talent review process operates 

across the Group to help ensure high potential talent, including 

technical and digital talent, is identified, recognized, and 

supported with an accelerated development path. 

In the “next normal”, the role of leaders to transform culture, build 

great teams, and deliver impact is more critical than ever. The 2021 

Culture & Leadership survey of around 2,000 Schneider leaders 

validated steady progress on the overall Group leadership and 

culture transformation started in 2017. Key strengths include strong 

ethics and integrity, sense of purpose, and customer focus, as well 

as a positive spirit and willingness to go above and beyond. The 

2022 OneVoice results amongst leaders also show progress in a 

shared meaningful purpose and innovative capabilities. The Group 

has identified a future leader profile that will be used as a 

framework moving forward. 

At Schneider Electric, feedback is key to building trust and care, 

and transforming its leadership and culture. In 2022, over 7,000 

leaders opted-in to participate in the Upward Feedback campaign. 

This is an anonymous questionnaire which gathers input from 

employees on how well they think their leaders demonstrate the 

Core Values and Leadership Expectations, as well as suggestions 

for behaviors to Start, Stop, and Continue. This questionnaire gives 

leaders additional insights about their behavioral strengths and 

development areas and helps them identify opportunities to 

continue to deliver greater impact as leaders, and together with 

their team.

2.5.3.4 Governance

The Executive Committee regularly discusses the overall health of 

the leadership pipeline and succession strength for top positions, 

including during the monthly Executive Committee people 

committee and the year-end global talent reviews with the CEO and 

CHRO. In addition, the Executive Committee meets regularly to 

make critical selection and succession decisions and review 

specific talent attraction and development strategies, for example 

expert talent, digital talent and global top potential talent. This is 

supported by integrated HR information systems and analytics 

platforms which provide data and analysis in the areas of workforce 

planning and talent management. In addition, Regional, Business, 

and Function People Committees also meet regularly to review 

talent in their perimeter.

2.5.3.5 Actions and impacts

The Group strives to provide a meaningful experience for their 

talent from talent attraction and onboarding, to performance and 

development.  Schneider empowers all employees to grow their 

fullest potential, deliver with impact based on the ‘what’ and the 

‘how’, build sustainable careers, refresh and learn new skills for 

today and tomorrow.

Attracting talent to shape the workforce of the 

future

Attracting talent at all levels is more crucial than ever before – not 

only in terms of enabling the delivery of the Group strategy, but also 

to continue to innovate for our customers and build a long-term 

pipeline of future talent that could join Schneider Electric.

Having improved the ability to manage a talent network through the 

introduction of new tools and systems in 2021, the focus through 

2022 has been on three key areas:

• Technology and Digital Experience: continuing to simplify and 

optimize the overall experience for both candidates and 

colleagues involved in the recruitment process, reducing our 

time to apply from thirty minutes to one minute.

• Strategic Sourcing: focusing on priority talent groups for skills 

and diversity with specialized campaigns and recruiter 

taskforces. 

• Employer Branding: increasing awareness of Schneider 

Electric as a company, especially among the next generation of 

talent, including Always On recruitment to help build a 

sustainable pipeline of talent.

Providing opportunities for the next generation is a key part of the 

strategy to harness the power of a multi-generational workforce, 

having five generations working side by side. As part of SSI #10, 

the five-year ambition is to achieve a doubling of growth in the 

early-career pipeline. This involves leveraging traditional 

approaches today but migrating to more digital, borderless, and 

self-paced offers, ensuring the Company can de-bias practices 

and create a more equal playing field for those interested in 

Schneider and sustainability. This will be achieved through flagship 

global programs and partnerships, supplemented by country-

specific initiatives:

• Schneider Global Virtual Student Experience: completely 

digital experience designed to provide students with a way to 

engage with Schneider Electric through eLearning modules and 

on project simulations.

• Schneider Go Green: an annual global competition for 

business and Science Technology Engineering Mathematics 

(STEM) students around the world to find innovative solutions for 

energy management and automation. In 2022, Schneider Go 

Green has had over 140,000 registrations and more than 

22,000+ students have submitted ideas from over 200 

countries.

• Development programs around the world that are structured to 

help support the acceleration of early career talent through a 

robust training and development path including graduate 

programs, internships, apprenticeships, and co-ops. 

• Sponsorship initiatives, virtual Careers Fairs, office/site tours, 

Innovation Summit tours, digital and face-to-face speaking 

engagements and networking opportunities, mentoring 

relationships.

Driving high performance 

Schneider Electric’s approach to performance and development is 

anchored by the Group’s Core Values and, for leaders, by the 

Leadership Expectations. This approach encourages learning and 

growth, enabling employees, teams, and the Company to reach 

their full potential. The Group’s robust process of setting individual 

performance and development goals annually with regular reviews 

during the year provides everyone with a clear roadmap to deliver 

with impact based on the “what” and the “how” to ultimately 

achieve collective success. Schneider Electric employees are 

encouraged to seek, give, and receive feedback, empowering 

them to take ownership for driving their individual performance, 

and managers are encouraged to support them with coaching and 

frequent conversations, driving the business forward. In 2022, 98% 

of eligible employees* completed a performance and development 

review.

Enabling sustainable careers

Developing employees in their current role and for future career 

growth is critical to enable growth of the Group’s businesses. In line 

with the conviction that all employees are talent and the aim to 

provide equitable development opportunities for all, Schneider 

Electric believes that all employees should take ownership of their 

own unique career development, supported by their managers and 

enabled by digital tools. To empower and engage employees with 

this approach, Schneider Electric held its second Career Week for 

all employees in 2022. Over 100 events took place with employees 

participating from over 99 countries, sharing career stories, 

unleashing the power of networking, having career check-in 

conversations with their manager, learning about different roles and 

skills, and being equipped with tools and resources to develop, 

grow, and shape their future. 94% of employees surveyed were 

positive about the event, especially appreciating the time to 

discuss and learn about career development.

Access to meaningful career

In 2022, DACH conducted career conversations for all their 

senior talent involved in the second wave of the program. 

Both their HR Business Partner and managers were 

equipped and briefed on how to manage those meaningful 

conversations and better support the employees. The 

conversations helped recognize their unique contribution, 

set expectations and provide clarity on future opportunities.

“I believe the Senior Talent Conversation was a good focus 

point to plan and become clear about the next years of my 

career and what it will mean to the company and my 

personal development. You get so engaged in your 

day-to-day work that you hardly think about what the 

remaining work life will look like and what motivates you. 

The discussion with HR and my Manager was very open 

and while there are lot of attention on the next generations, 

I felt valued in what I can still bring to Schneider Electric in 

the future.”

Boosting expertise and knowledge across the 

organization

Schneider Electric strongly believes that its position as a global 

technology and innovation company is driven by the innovative 

contributions of its creative employees. The Group has a renowned 

expert program called “Edison” to recognize individual employees 

who have demonstrated outstanding achievement, expertise, and 

leadership throughout the Company. The “Edison” expert program 

offers them a chance to continue to extend their contribution and 

increase their impact and exposure to the Group’s strategy. 

Employees in this program are identified as Level 1 – Expert, Level 

2 – Senior Expert, or Level 3 – Master Expert. A revamp of the 

Edison program is planned for early 2023.

The Group actively promotes a learning and teaching culture by 

developing its internal trainer capability. There has been a strong 

focus on equipping internal trainers to develop and facilitate virtual 

classroom training, including using tools, such as Klaxoon and 

BlendedX, for additional interaction and engagement. A Global 

Virtual Internal Trainer Conference was organized in October with 

the purpose of recognizing, developing, and connecting internal 

trainers. This year it was a 2-day conference, on the theme of 

“Engaging Learners in a Virtual World” with keynote speakers from 

MIT-Sloan & INSEAD sharing insights on the “Future of Learning”. 

There are currently over 5,000 identified internal trainers who 

collectively delivered over 18,000 sessions in 2022, accounting for 

63% of formal training. 

Additionally, Schneider Electric currently has 300 communities of 

practice as part of the Communities@Work (C@W) program 

encompassing more than 35,000 members. Each community has a 

leader and a robust animation plan, and each year, the 

communities’ activities are reviewed, with the most active 

communities being recognized for the value they bring to the 

organization. These communities are an effective way to enable 

learning, personal growth and productivity. 

• They promote knowledge sharing through conversations and 

other activities (such as webinar, training, and gamification), 

creating collective intelligence and enabling innovation.

• They offer opportunities for employees to grow - learning from 

their peers through best practices and experience sharing in 

the community. 

• They are a natural support system – providing immediate 

support, agility and speed to their members.

• They also contribute to increasing Employee Satisfaction, 

addressing the need of belonging in the next normal through 

social interactions (90% of the Active Community respondents 

feel enthusiastic about being part of a community).

Upskilling for today and tomorrow

The Group recognizes some skills need to be refreshed frequently, especially vital technical and digital skills required to accelerate our 

business growth. Roles requiring digital and human skills are growing due to the rise of AI, automation, and digitization. Purposeful renewal 

of skills is necessary to ensure sustainable careers and a resilient, future-ready business. To support this ambition, business and function 

academies are in place to partner with the business in identifying learning needs and spotting gaps in core and future skills for relevant 

employee populations. They develop and promote learning and development opportunities to build both depth and breadth of skills and 

experiences based on the 3E model (education, exposure, and experience).

Over 5,700 employees joined the 2022 Digital Learning 

week, gaining digital insights from internal and external 

experts on digital mindset, strategy, and customer 

solutions. 

For digital experts, some accelerated their growth through 

a 15-month Digital Master Program combining intensive 

education with 1:1 coaching and business projects, while 

others were supported with specific learning to prepare for 

Edison Digital domain certification resulting in three times 

more employees certified. 

Key digital roles supporting customer value chain were

A digital ecosystem to enable development 

opportunities for all 

Schneider Electric invests in the development of its people, 

creating equitable opportunities and environment for all employees 

to learn and grow their career.

In 2020, Schneider Electric launched a global career development 

platform, Open Talent Market (OTM), to empower employees to 

drive their own careers by discovering opportunities for mentoring, 

new positions, and part-time projects, as well as potential career 

paths. The platform is available to all connected employees 

globally and leverages AI (Artificial Intelligence) to match the 

supply and demand of internal talent with a transparent, digital, and 

borderless approach. The ambition for usage is to increase 4x the 

number of employee-driven development interactions in the OTM 

by 2025 (SSE #21). At the end of 2022, more than 80% of eligible 

employees were registered on the platform resulting in 26k digital 

development opportunities since registration. Through OTM in 

2022, ~1,500 employees were given visibility to over 16,000 open 

positions, 6,000 mentoring relationships were formed and 2,700 

project roles were assigned. An average of ~20,000 employees 

visit the platform each month. 

Schneider Electric also has an open learning ecosystem comprised 

of interconnected platforms at the center of which is My 

LearningLink (MLL). This platform provides digital and classroom 

learning opportunities and was made available to all employees on 

mobile since 2021. Schneider Electric also continues to invest in 

providing My LearningLink connectivity to shop floor employees 

either through the “Digital Learning Corner” (a computer or kiosk 

installed in their facilities) or, from their mobile phones. 

In 2022: 

• More than 300,000 training completions every month

• More than 30,600 modules of learning content were available in 

more than one language

• Digital learning consumption stood at 69%, which has remained 

stable since 2020

Schneider Electric also offers a broad catalogue of online courses 

and webinars to partners and customers, accessible via free 

registration at mySchneider Partner Portal (an extranet). The 

mySchneider Partner Portal is deployed in 140 countries and 

provides a customized learning experience with targeted training 

content that is most relevant to over one million Schneider Electric’s 

partners and customers who have completed around two million 

courses since its inception in 2015.

“Open Talent Market was a turning point in my 

professional career. After browsing through multiple 

opportunities, I got to understand different domains and 

teams that SE has better than ever.

OTM really identified my career dream job, to be 

honest, because I landed exactly in the role which I 

wanted and have the global exposure together within 

this position.

Without OTM I would never 

know about this opportunity.

It’s a great tool to use – 

like LinkedIn but internally. 

Being there is a MUST 

for all of us!”

In addition to career programs for early talent, pilot programs for 

talent in the later stages of their career started in four countries in 

2021, to support employees in the later stages of their career to 

enjoy meaningful and fulfilling development, and to recognize and 

leverage their unique expertise and experience to boost learning 

and innovation across generations.

4x the number of employee-driven 
development interactions on the 
Open Talent Market 

Schneider Electric has created an internal ‘gig’ economy 

through an Open Talent Market (OTM), and by 2025 will 

grow the skills in the workforce through digitally enabled 

engagements. These engagements include via projects 

(internal gigs), mentorships, and new positions. By 

leveraging AI the company empowers employees and 

creates more connections that support development 

across departments, countries, and functions. In 2022, 

Schneider Electric focused on increasing the number of 

employees registered in the Open Talent Market closing the 

year with 81% of their workforce on the Open Talent Market 

+16pts vs 2021.

x1.9

In 2022, Schneider Electric expanded the pilot program to 12 

countries/entities including France, India, Japan, China, Germany, 

Brazil, Australia, UK & Ireland and South Africa among others, and 

will continue to scale progressively in the upcoming years to reach 

its SSE #23 ambition by 2025. The program is anchored in career 

conversations resulting in a robust development plan linked to their 

unique career aspirations and supported by different offers 

including new contractual schemes, upskilling, knowledge transfer, 

pivoting, recognition, care, and personal planning among others. 

The launch of the program was received positively by this group 

of talent.

Schneider Electric also started to observe in 2022 the positive 

impact of the program through different initiatives deployed by the 

pilot countries. For example, India tapped into the wealth of 

experience of Senior Talent by engaging some retired employees 

as consultants. They possess not only the depth of knowledge and 

breadth of experiences but also a powerful network, allowing 

Schneider to continue benefiting from long-term customer 

relationships.

Similarly, in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Senior Talents are 

offered the opportunity to make an impact with their experience 

and network in the Talent Acquisition team. Senior Talent became 

great recruiters and brand ambassadors - they have a comparable 

network to headhunters, and they can best describe the job 

requirements authentically, speaking from their own experience. 

Other countries such as France and China focused on facilitating 

workshops with Senior Talents and their managers, to help them 

reflect and understand their personal and career aspirations, their 

opportunities and how to take ownership of their development. 

According to their feedback, participants felt valued, listened to 

and positive about the company supporting them in this stage of 

their career. At the same time, the structured methodology and 

tools to make a career discussion and build a strong development 

plan were highly appreciated both by them and their managers.

2.5.4 Compensation and benefits

2.5.4.1 Context

To ensure employees feel valued and respected in their workplace 

companies are increasingly expected to provide all employees with 

attractive compensation but also with benefits meant to facilitate 

aspects of their lives. As we are now in a post-pandemic era, 

people and specifically younger generations have higher 

expectations in terms of creating better work and life balance, and 

rely on their employer to ensure that this need is met.

2.5.4.2 Risks and opportunities

Having the best talent and attracting new talent is the main goal of 

inclusive compensation and benefits offerings.

Schneider Electric is committed to delivering best in class benefits 

and opportunities to its employees; and aware that unfit 

compensation and benefit could risk talent attraction.

2.5.4.3 Group policy

To support Schneider Electric’s mission to create a great place to 

work and to cater for the diverse needs of its global existing and 

future workforce, the Company is committed to providing a 

competitive, inclusive compensation and benefits offering, which 

attracts, motivates, and retains talent.

Schneider Electric takes its responsibility as a leading employer 

seriously and ensures its diverse global workforce is treated in a 

fair and ethical way. Its inclusive reward portfolio is designed to 

support employees to be at their best, and goes beyond pay and 

benefits. The portfolio is a meaningful mix of programs to engage 

employees, including recognition to celebrate great work, 

incentives to reward high performance, an award-winning 

employee share ownership plan, and benefits to suit employees 

and their dependents.

Schneider Electric ensures that all compensation and benefits 

decisions and policies are based on the principles outlined above 

and follow local statutory and collective agreements.

Schneider Electric believes in rewarding, recognizing, and 

differentiating fairly employees who contribute to the success and 

live the values of the Company. By putting recognition at the center 

of a high-performance ambition, employees feel engaged and 

motivated to do more. Delivering high performance is rewarded by 

competitive market pay, incentive programs, employee 

shareholding, and opportunities to grow careers within Schneider 

Electric.

The Group offers a portfolio of benefits to care for employees’ 

needs at each life stage. Its diverse and multi-generational 

workforce is provided with meaningful choices covering a holistic 

range of well-being, flexibility, and financial protections to provide 

peace of mind to employees and their dependents.

2.5.4.4 Governance

The implementation of group policies on compensation and 

benefits are overseen by the highly experienced global, regional 

and local reward organizations.

2.5.4.5 Actions and impacts

Compensation

Job architecture and compensation process

Schneider Electric has implemented a global job architecture to 

support HR processes and programs and to enable 

Schneider Electric to engage, develop, and move talent across 

different businesses and geographies. The job architecture 

provides alignment to market practice and organizational structure 

to ensure the reward package offered for a role is fair and 

competitive. This supports working towards creating greater 

transparency for career development and progression.

Pay competitively and pay-for-performance

Employees are empowered to receive ongoing feedback, 

recognition, and coaching from their managers, and their individual 

performance is assessed in a fair manner based on their goals and 

behaviors. In line with the Group’s pay-for-performance philosophy, 

the compensation structure typically includes fixed and variable 

(incentive) elements. Compensation programs and decisions are 

based on individual performance and behaviors, Company 

performance, and competitive market positioning.

Equal pay for equal work

The basic foundational principles of fairness, equity, ethics, and 

transparency are fully embedded in the company values. Through 

reward policies and processes, employees are compensated fairly 

and equitably for the skillset they possess and value contributions 

as a business imperative. Over the past eight years, Schneider 

Electric has successfully transformed the Pay Equity Framework 

covering all employees across all countries of operation. The 

company has created a fair and equitable ecosystem of HR 

processes and taken proactive actions to prevent new pay gaps 

from being created. Salary changes when hiring new recruits, 

promoting employees, and reviewing salaries internally are closely 

monitored. Managers and HR professionals are trained to be 

mindful of every pay decision they make, and to ensure that their 

decision process is bias-free. 

As part of the Schneider Sustainability Essentials for 2025, the 

company has committed to attain and maintain a pay gap below 

1% by 2025 for both females and males. At of the end of 2022, the 

pay gap was -1.6% for females and 1.02% for males. Note: this 

measurement will differ from country figures that may be required 

to be reported due to statutory requirements.

Living wage

Schneider Electric believes earning a living wage is a basic human 

right and a key element of decent work. Schneider Electric is 

committed to paying all employees at or above the living wage to 

meet their families’ basic needs. The Group considers basic needs 

to include food, housing, sanitation, education, healthcare, plus 

discretionary income for a given local standard of living. This is 

guided by our Human Rights Policy and Trust Charter. All 

permanent direct employees of Schneider Electric with open ended 

contracts or fixed term contracts that are above 1 year are in scope 

of the annual gap analysis. Third parties such as suppliers or 

contractors or interns are out of scope.

In 2018, Schneider Electric started working with an independent 

advisor – Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) – to implement 

its living wage commitment as part of its fair and equitable policies. 

Schneider Electric has initiated a global process to analyze wage 

levels and employment practices against local living wage 

standards set by BSR. Moving forward into 2020, the COVID-19 

crisis highlighted even more strongly the need for a safety net to 

guarantee a minimum income level for employees. Given the 

complexity of evaluating and mitigating the macroeconomic impact 

of the crisis, the Group did not run a gap analysis that year. In 2021, 

the new gap analysis covered 63 countries (representing over 99% 

of Schneider Electric footprint globally). As of 31 December 2022, 

100% of in scope employees, i.e. all Schneider employees treated 

as permanent workforce, were paid at least a living wage. Where 

living wage gaps were identified, corrective actions were taken to 

ensure that all employees are paid a living wage and no new gaps 

are created. In addition to guaranteeing that all in scope employees 

are paid at least a living wage, Schneider continues to comply with 

all applicable federal, state and local regulations regarding 

minimum wage requirements.

In 2021, the analysis covered 63 countries (representing over 99% 

of Schneider’s global footprint). As of December 31, 2022, 100% of 

relevant employees had received at least a living wage. Where 

living wage gaps were identified, corrective action was taken to 

ensure that all employees received a living wage and that no new 

gaps emerged. In addition to ensuring that all employees within the 

scope are paid at least a living wage, Schneider continues to 

comply with all applicable federal, state and local minimum wage 

regulations.

From 2021 onwards, the Group underlined its commitment to pay 

100% of employees at least a living wage as part of its SSE #20. 

This commitment will be audited annually with the support of an 

independent third party. Schneider Electric also continues to be 

part of leading corporate coalitions and notably became a Decent 

Work patron for the UN Global Compact. These global coalitions 

work together to implement living wage standards within their 

workforce and their entire ecosystem. In 2022 the Group started 

working with a new consultant, Fair Wage Network, with the aim of 

improving the geographical coverage, having a dynamic and 

web-based living wage benchmark and initiating an independent 

review and certification of the living wage gap analysis. As of 

December 2022, 100% of the employees were covered by the 

review, in 111 countries.

The UN Global Compact announced its new 2021-2023 

strategy, which aims to accelerate and scale up the global 

collective impact of business by upholding the Global 

Compact Ten Principles and the SDGs through 

accountable companies and enabling ecosystems. Given 

that the Company is a leader in providing and promoting a 

living wage, the UN Global Compact invited Schneider 

Electric to become a Patron of its Decent Work portfolio. 

The Group’s role will be to raise the bar by advancing 

decent work for its ecosystem and other companies.

Short-term incentive

For employees, the annual short-term incentive is linked with the 

overall Company performance and individual objectives. It is 

designed to encourage and motivate employees to deliver on 

collective ambitions through accountability and collaboration, 

driving better performance collectively and individually. With a 

strong sustainability component included, the annual short-term 

incentives for the Group’s executives and around 64,000 eligible 

employees helps focus on what matters to Schneider Electric. 

Since 2011, sustainability performance criteria have been 

embedded in the incentive goals for Group executives. They are 

directly linked to the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) targets. 

From 2019, the weight of the SSI criteria has increased from 6% to 

20% in the collective part of the annual short-term incentive, 

highlighting further the importance of sustainability on Schneider 

Electric’s business agenda. In France, since 2012 the SSI has also 

been included in the profit-sharing incentive plan for the French 

entities, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric 

France. The reduction in the occupational accidents severity rate is 

also considered in the profit-sharing incentive plans of 24 other 

French entities.

From 2022, Schneider have introduced a Customer First 

Performance Criteria in the incentive goals for Group executives. 

The Group is building Trust through Superior Customer Experience 

and Quality. It measures the Net Customer Satisfaction (NCS) 

through real-time digital customer surveys covering six critical 

touchpoints as part of the customer operational interactions. Every 

employee is part of this journey and is fully empowered to bring 

Customer Experience to the highest level. All the results on 

Customer Satisfaction are available in the Customer Feedback 

Management Platform where all employees are engaged and 

empowered to improve the Customer Experience.

To promote a superior sales culture where sales people go above 

and beyond to surprise and delight customers, Schneider Electric 

offers levels of differentiated reward for sales people to enhance 

motivation and results.

Long-term incentive 

Schneider Electric’s long-term incentive plan offers share 

ownership opportunities to the Group’s key talents and critical roles 

to align their rewards with the interests and experience of 

Schneider Electric shareholders. Similar to the short-term incentive, 

a portion of the award under the long-term incentive plan is subject 

to the achievement of sustainability objectives. From 2020, the 

long-term sustainability performance is measured through the 

Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI), a 

combination of external indices which cover a range of 

environmental, social, and governance indicators wider than and 

different from the SSI criteria included in the annual incentive plan. 

See more details on SSERI in Chapter 4.2 “Compensation Report”, 

page 376.

Recognition in the company DNA

Every day, Schneider Electric employees make important 

contributions to help the organization achieve its mission and key 

business objectives. The global recognition portal “Step Up” gives 

employees a way to formally recognize and celebrate people who 

consistently demonstrate the Company’s Core Values and go 

above and beyond. Schneider Electric creates a culture where 

employees receive regular feedback and coaching from their 

managers and colleagues and encourages the recognition of small 

and big achievements by simply saying “thank you”.

In 2022, Schneider Electric refreshed the global recognition 

program and launched a new platform for recognition with a new 

partner. With this program, Schneider brought recognition in the 

work ecosystem for employees and also introduced functionality to 

put emphasis on the importance of sharing and acknowledging 

gratitude in the workplace. Throughout 2022, the recognition 

culture remained strong, with many employees continuing to utilize 

the dedicated platform to appreciate and recognize colleagues. 

Benefits

Benefits provided by the Group represent a considerable business 

commitment by Schneider Electric everywhere in the world. The 

company ensures that all employee benefits are locally and 

globally compliant, as well as market relevant. Because employee 

benefit plans vary significantly between countries due to different 

levels of social, tax, and legal regulations, Schneider Electric’s 

benefits portfolio is primarily country-driven and aims at providing 

similar benefits within a country territory.

Global benefit standards

Schneider Electric regularly reviews compliance with its global 

benefit policies and principles to ensure that its inclusive global 

benefit standards are delivered for everyone, everywhere. These 

standards cover healthcare, family leave, and life cover.

One of Schneider Electric’s underlying benefit objectives is to 

ensure all its employees are equipped to manage their basic health 

and well-being and to provide adequate security to employees and 

their dependents. Health and well-being are embedded in the 

Schneider Electric strategic people priorities and contribute to its 

sustainability mission. The Group is committed to provide its 

employees access to a well-being at work program – translated into 

a dual standard of access to healthcare and well-being training 

programs (detailed further in subsection “Supporting employees’ 

well-being, mental health and unique lives and work”, page 206). It 

also provide access to an inclusive and comprehensive standard of 

healthcare coverage (outpatient, hospitalization, key health risks/

chronic conditions, maternity, children) defined by local regulations 

and employment agreements. Schneider also supports its 

employees with personal time off at critical life stages and this is 

fully deployed in 100% of countries as detailed below. In addition, 

the Group commits to provide financial security to employee 

dependents, in the event of an employee’s death, in the form of a 

minimum standard of life assurance coverage of at least a multiple 

equivalent to one year’s salary.

Global Family Leave Policy

As a caring and responsible employer, Schneider launched its 

Global Family Leave policy along with care leave in 2017. Through 

its policy, the Group supports employees with personal time at 

critical life stages and empowers everyone to manage their “unique 

life and work” so that they can be at their best. The group applies a 

continuous improvement approach to all employee benefits and 

policies and has made several notable improvements with 

employees’ inputs. While the countries have flexibility to define 

eligibility and policy details per statutory/market requirements, the 

policy sets global minimum standards for paid leave. In 2020, 

Schneider expanded its care leave from 1 to 2 weeks for 

employees to care for their dependents diagnosed with COVID-19. 

In 2022, the Group conducted extensive internal and external 

research and will be expanding its Global Family Leave policy from 

2023 for all employees globally. Parental leave for birth adoption or 

surrogacy will go from 12 weeks paid to 20 weeks paid for primary 

leave, and from 2 weeks to 4 weeks for secondary leave. Care 

leave will increase from 1 paid week to 2 paid weeks. Bereavement 

will remain the same 1 week. Ahead of that, beginning in July 2022, 

the Group’s North America operations were the first ones to benefit 

from these new expansions. All employees eligible for benefits 

have access to this global policy.

Employee share ownership 

The Worldwide Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP) is one of 

the Group’s recurring key annual reward programs, offering 

employees across the world an opportunity to become owners of 

the Company, at preferred conditions. 

WESOP is strongly ingrained in the Group’s culture, as a cultural 

and reward differentiator with a positive impact on engagement, 

attraction and retention. Schneider Electric has strongly developed 

and reinforced its offer over the years in order to build a sustainable 

group of employee shareholders reflecting the workforce diversity, 

to create a strong feeling of belonging, and to link employees to the 

performance of the Company, acting like owners of Schneider 

Electric. In that spirit, WESOP has become part of the Group 

sustainability commitments towards its 2025 roadmap (SSE #19). 

In 2022, the Group successfully offered WESOP in 42 countries, 

achieving 60.5% subscription rate, a higher rate than in 2021 which 

was already at 59%. As of December 31, 2022, the employee 

shareholding represented 3.8% of Schneider Electric SE’s capital 

and 6.6% of the voting rights. 78% of the Group employee 

shareholders were located outside of France, of which 13% are in 

China, 15% in India, and 9% in the US. This also includes employee 

shareholding resulting from the long-term incentives grants.

Worldwide Employee Share

Schneider Electric had committed to achieve a 60% 

subscription rate among eligible employees in the yearly 

WESOP by 2025, as a key program to support Schneider 

Sustainability Essentials. Scope covers 29 recurring 

participating countries, among the 42 participating 

countries representing 86% of the eligible headcount. 

From 53% subscription rate in the recurring countries in 

2019, WESOP has reached 62.2% passing the 2025 target 

three years ahead of the deadline. The Group aims to 

maintain at least 60% subscription rate in the coming years 

in the recurring countries. 

With more than 80% subscription rate, India and China 

outperformed and have become part of the major 

contributors of the 2022 capital increase, together 

representing around 30% of the 2022 total subscription.

2.5.5 Social dialogue and relations

2.5.5.1 Context 

The International Labor Organization (ILO) describes social 

dialogue as “all types of negotiation, consultation or simply 

exchange of information between, or among, representatives of 

governments, employers and workers, on issues of common 

interest relating to economic and social policy.” The objective for a 

company to ensure regular and safe social dialogue is to build 

consensus amongst all employees’ of the company. To do so, 

companies integrate a third unbiased party in discussions to help 

resolve issues and encourage change to adapt to global and local 

workforce expectations.

2.5.5.2 Risks and opportunities

Social dialogue and freedom of association must be seen within the 

wider context of Ethics & Responsibility. As a global company, 

Schneider Electric believes that its responsibility goes beyond 

compliance with local and international regulations and is therefore 

committed to conducting its business ethically, sustainably and 

responsibly.

The Group constantly interacts with all its stakeholders across the 

world: its borders are expanding, its environment is changing ever 

faster, its activities are becoming globalized, and its social 

responsibilities are growing.

The challenge is to gain and maintain the highest confidence of its 

stakeholders. To support each employee in this approach, the 

Group emphasizes the importance of placing responsibility at the 

heart of its corporate governance.

2.5.5.3 Group policy

Schneider Electric considers freedom of association and collective 

bargaining as fundamental rights that must be respected 

everywhere and therefore in its Trust Charter commits to complying 

with local laws in every country where it operates. 

In its Human Rights Policy, Schneider confirms that it considers 

freedom of association as the basis of a regular dialogue between 

a company and its employees. To that purpose, Schneider 

respects the individual right of its employees to freely join, 

participate in or quit labor organizations to assert and defend their 

interests. Subsequently, Schneider guarantees that any employee 

wishing to do so shall be protected against any internal measure 

limiting his or her freedom of association such as discrimination of 

any kind, pay loss or dismissal. Schneider also recognizes the 

importance of dialogue with freely appointed employee 

representatives, employee representative bodies (such as Works 

Councils or employee forums) or organizations (like trade unions) 

and supports collective bargaining.

In addition, Schneider joined the Global Deal initiative in 2017. The 

Group is promoting social dialogue as a means to foster decent 

work, quality jobs, increased productivity and, by extension, 

greater equality and inclusive growth.

2.5.5.4 Governance

Social dialogue is managed at country level by HR leaders with the 

employee representative bodies and unions, and at transnational 

level with the European Works Council (EWC) which covers most of 

geographical Europe. Social dialogue is also taken into 

consideration by the Group’s social reporting system, where local 

HR teams report on the presence of trade unions, works councils 

and Health and Safety Committees every year.

In 2014, while changing the corporate form of its parent company, 

Schneider Electric SA, into a European company (Société 

européenne), Schneider Electric negotiated an agreement with 

employee representatives of European countries about the 

involvement of these countries’ employees in the Company’s 

decision-making processes, thus reaffirming its commitment to 

promoting social dialogue at international level.

2.5.5.5 Actions and impacts

European Works Council (EWC) 

Since 2014, Schneider Electric has significantly enhanced the 

intensity and the impact of social dialogue at European level. This 

channel for dialogue aims to enable management to make more 

efficient decisions by giving employee representatives the 

opportunity to be informed of such decisions and to understand 

their reasoning, as well as to put forward proposals to supplement 

or improve them.

In this respect, new spaces for discussion were explored in order to 

strengthen the contributions of the members of the EWC on 

strategic issues. Several workshops for reflection and ideation were 

organized, namely during the implementation of the new alert 

system and the review of the approach to the duty of vigilance. The 

benefits of these workshops were several, starting with a better 

awareness of these topics by the members of the European Works 

Council, and an opportunity to contribute upstream on decisions 

impacting the company’s strategy.

Group Works Council, France

Schneider Electric is organized in France through more than 25 

legal entities. However, with 80% employee coverage, Schneider 

Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France SAS set the tone 

for social dialogue in France mainly through the Central Works 

Council and the Group Committee. During the first quarter of 2022, 

Schneider Electric negotiated a new “work from home” agreement 

for its employees in France with the following main objectives: an 

increase in the number of beneficiaries, more flexibility, and the 

introduction of financial compensation. Around 8,000 employees 

currently use telework, up from 6,000 at the beginning of the year.

In addition, the introduction of a new collective agreement for the 

Metallurgy branch, the largest Branch in France, effective from 

January 1, 2024, has led to the opening of various negotiations, 

including one on classification.

This is a major transformation for Schneider Electric in France. All 

the trade unions began participating in this deployment during the 

second half of 2022, and the project will continue throughout 2023. 

At the same time, all the members of the works council have 

received specific training regarding roles, Company organization, 

and its financial culture.

Social dialogue in the United States

In North America, and more specifically in the US, regular 

communication takes place with both union and non-union 

employees on key business topics and trends affecting their jobs. 

Company officials meet with key international union leaders and 

local union leadership on an ongoing basis, and formally on an 

annual basis, to advise and discuss competitive issues impacting 

the Company’s business, and to ensure alignment with the 

Company’s business strategies and challenges. In 2022, Company 

officials met with the local unions to discuss strategic investments 

intended to upgrade equipment, improve efficiency to support 

expected demand, enhance the smart factory profile, and reduce 

CO
2
 emissions in several factories. In addition, Company officials 

have continued to partner with union representatives to discuss 

COVID-19 and ensure safety protocols are in place for employees, 

customers, and vendors.

Social dialogue in Mexico

In addition to regular communications and in accordance with 

Mexican law reform, during 2022 the Group conducted the 

legitimization process with the Mexican unions at all Schneider 

Electric sites where employees had the opportunity to review their 

collective agreements and confirm their agreement and 

commitment to the unions and the company. All of these processes 

were supported by the Legal and Human Resources teams.

Social dialogue in China

Schneider Electric China has a strong culture of social dialogue 

with all employees in over 30 legal entities and at more than 100 

sites across the country. 

The HR department, in partnership with the union, facilitates active 

and open communications with employees and takes action on 

employee feedback to enrich their career experience as well as 

ensure sustainable talent development. Specific effort has been 

made on several key topics in line with employee suggestions, 

notably around Learning, Development and Well-being: 

• Upskilling programs are now more diversified for all employees 

and in targeted job roles, from customer-facing teams to 

support functions, with face-to-face and virtual options including 

mobile and AI-facilitated, based on 3E methodology (education, 

experience and exposure). Employee individual average 

learning time has increased to 21 hours. 

• There are also more opportunities for employees to develop and 

grow in an inclusive workplace that promotes agile organization, 

internal talent mobility, and specific development focus for 

different genders and generations. 91% of China employees are 

now users of the Open Talent Market platform which enables 

them to search for internal jobs, projects, and mentorship 

opportunities proactively and freely; 200+ project engagements 

and 300+ mentorship pairings have been achieved.

• Well-being remains a priority to support the continual 

enhancement of the employee experience. In collaboration with 

the union, a new Employee Assistance Program was launched 

in 2022 with 24/7 online counseling via phone, laptop or mobile 

to help employees address work and non-work issues such as 

stress management, interpersonal and family problems. 

Furthermore, a flexible benefit platform has been introduced 

which integrates all employee benefits from both company and 

union, allowing employees to make certain personalized 

choices based on their own situations.

Social dialogue in India

Schneider Electric India has a strong culture of social dialogue with 

all employees, both unionized and non-unionized. Schneider 

Electric India continues to engage in equitable industrial relations 

across its plants and associated establishments.

Industrial harmony has been achieved through a time-tested 

collective bargaining process involving unions or through worker 

representative committees. In some of the plants where there are 

no recognized unions, this bargaining process is conducted with 

elected employees on committees such as Welfare (Works 

Committee). The Company also has strong engagement with other 

committees such as Health & Safety, Canteen, Sports and 

Transport, including a special committee for women employees. In 

addition, a prevention of sexual harassment committee, which is 

fully compliant with the prevention of sexual harassment 

governance as per local laws, comprises employees and external 

women with specialist knowledge of the subject and with legal 

backgrounds. These committees provide a platform for employees 

to present their concerns, collective grievances and workplace-

related issues to the management. All employee engagement 

programs are run through these committees with the active 

participation of every employee.

The process of social dialogue also includes monthly employee 

communication at plant level, as well as through Quarterly Town 

Hall communications on company performance, strategy and 

challenges.

2.6 Delivering social impact for 
a just transition

 In this section

2.6.1 Improving lives through access to green electricity 226

2.6.2 Investing for high social impact 228

2.6.3 The Schneider Electric Foundation 233

2.6.4 Schneider Electric Sister Foundations 239

2.6.5 Social Impact in France 240

Context and goals
Schneider Electric has been building a sustainable development 

approach since the early 2000s thanks to the Schneider 

Sustainability Impact, which measures the Company’s objectives 

and progress every quarter. These objectives have always taken 

into account all dimensions of responsibility – environmental, social, 

territorial, and governance – encompassing all the Group’s 

stakeholders on a global scale.

In 2021, Schneider Electric was recognized by Corporate Knights 

as the World’s Most Sustainable Corporation out of 5,000 

companies surveyed. This accolade, together with the success of 

the Schneider Sustainability Impact, further inspired the Group to 

do even more and to think about the world of tomorrow by 

developing forecasted scenarios, both in the environmental and 

climate fields – without forgetting the social and territorial 

dimensions. If the transition is not inclusive and fair, it will not allow 

people in underserved communities to build their future and create 

their own businesses. The planet has to be saved, and that also 

means saving its inhabitants.

Four main action priorities have been defined within the Corporate 

Citizenship Department. The first is to ensure that the Group’s 

business partners respect all human rights for everyone, 

everywhere, at all times and in all situations, from decent work 

standards to the creation of a social label for the Group’s products. 

In 2022, a new version of the Human Rights Group Policy was 

published in order to embark on eight new challenges such as 

respect and dignity, Human Rights in cyberspace, conflict 

minerals, intergenerational solidarity, Human Rights activities within 

the Group’s value chain, migrant workers, civic space and Human 

Rights defenders, and access to healthy environment. 

The second priority is to ensure that everyone is supported in 

building their futures, regardless of their generation: young people 

as well as seniors. Schneider has always played an active role in 

the economic development of the communities in which it has a 

presence, in order to have an impact and to accelerate the just 

transition. In 2022, a new program called Future Ready defined the 

Group’s roadmap for the coming years.

Youth is also the focus of the third major priority. There have never 

been so many young people on the planet, but many have no 

access to education Yet it is young people who drive innovation.The 

Company has a role to play in supporting them.

The fourth priority is to make citizenship a collective commitment to 

co-construct the future in a dynamic way by learning and sharing 

across many different initiatives.

“2022 was another year of crisis 
leading to growing inequalities, but 
also a year of progress and 
stronger commitments to go 
further along the road to the just 
transition in favor of youth, human 
rights, respect and dignity. We 
strongly believe that we have an 
invaluable asset: young people. 
There has never been a generation 
this vast and receptive. They really 
are the main drivers and players.”

Gilles Vermot Desroches, Senior Vice President Corporate 

Citizenship & Institutional Affairs

2.6.1 Improving lives 
through access to green 
electricity

2.6.1.1 Context

Today(1), more than two billion people have little or no access to 

electricity.

In 2020(2), 733 million people had no electricity. Although notable 

progress has been made in recent years, in the words of SEforAll(3), 

“electricity access is growing, but not for everyone”.

In sub-Saharan Africa, colossal additional efforts are required to 

achieve universal access:

• Today, around 570 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not 

have access to electricity. That is close to one in two people in 

the region.

• The pace of electrification is not sufficient relative to population 

growth, and the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed progress even 

further.

• Therefore, in 2030, still close to 570 million people would remain 

without electricity in sub-Saharan Africa. That would be 85% of 

the unelectrified world population.

Asia-Pacific is approaching universal electrification, thanks to 

ambitious government programs. Nevertheless, the grid can be 

unreliable or insufficient for productive use in remote areas where it 

must be supplemented with renewable energy solutions.

Access to green electricity offers a chance to live a better life, 

because it can have a positive multiplier effect on all socio-

economic dimensions of the individual or community: livelihood, 

health, education, security, and empowerment of women, while 

fighting against climate change by replacing fossil solutions.

2.6.1.2 Group Policy

Access to Energy’s purpose is to bring green and reliable 

electricity to populations in emerging markets, both as a 

fundamental right and a means for social and economic 

development, by providing a safe, affordable, reliable, and 

sustainable energy offer. At Schneider, we call this Electricity for 

Life and Electricity for Livelihood. 

2.6.1.3 Action & Impact 

Schneider’s ambition is to bring green and reliable electricity to 50 

million people by 2025, and 100 million people by 2030, 

cumulatively since the start of the program in 2009.

Electricity for Life means providing access to green electricity to 

off-grid populations and refugees. These communities need 

energy as a fundamental right to meet essential needs in homes 

(such as lighting, communication and education).

Electricity for Livelihood means providing access to green 

electricity to people connected to an unreliable grid and in order to 

enable productive businesses. These communities need quality 

energy with solar backup equipment as a driver of economic 

development and poverty reduction. For example, electricity can 

make a real difference to the lives of farmers and ensure food 

security through irrigation, food storage, and processing, and by 

connecting farmers to markets to ensure better prices, while 

allowing people to be the agents of their own transformation.

The Access to Energy social business works in synergy with the 

Schneider Training & Entrepreneurship program and the Impact 

investment funds, in a virtuous circle of providing products and 

solutions, capacity building and support to startups.

2.6.2 Investing for high social impact

2.6.2.1 Context

Social Impact Invesment (SII) is a medium for organizations to 

address and finance social needs with the explicit objective of 

having a positive and measurable impact. 

All actors of society have a role to play to support social well-being 

and help people access development opportunities. The rising 

importance of SII forces companies to think of new ways to support 

social businesses. Hence many are building partnerships with local 

and international actors to drive and nurture innovative and 

responsible initiatives.

2.6.2.2 Group Impact Investing policy

The ambition of Schneider Electric’s Impact Investing practice is to 

contribute to a transition towards a fairer and more inclusive 

society. Supported by its strong and deep knowledge of the energy 

ecosystem, Schneider Electric focuses its Impact Investing mission 

on funding and supporting high social and environmental impact 

initiatives, which are contributing to a better future and positively 

impacting climate and resources.

The goal is to generate high social impact while protecting the 

assets under management. Accordingly, Schneider Electric has 

adopted strict management rules, such as:

• Always investing in partnerships with recognized players;

• Never taking a majority stake; 

• Always providing efficient company support (such as helping 

develop a business plan or provide technical advice) to deliver 

the optimum social impact while minimizing risk; 

• Ensuring alignment with the Schneider Electric ecosystem;

and 

• Ensuring that ethical business practices and rules are 

implemented and respected.

2.6.2.3 Governance

Each investment vehicle has its own governance structure 

generally composed of at least two bodies:

• The first one is a Board of Directors or a Supervisory Board 

which is in charge of ensuring compliance with all legal and 

ethical regulations. In most cases investors are represented on 

this board.

• The second one is a Management Investment Committee which 

can either be totally independent or composed of investors, 

according to the legal structure. All Management Investment 

Committee members bring specific competencies and 

knowledge to assess investment decisions. In some cases, they 

can also rely on external experts. They are responsible for 

ensuring compliance with investment policies and are regularly 

updated on investment performance, both in terms of impact 

and finance.

• In some cases, an investment vehicle can also rely on an 

Advisory Committee or Strategic Committee to help them setting 

up and managing their investment strategies and policies.

All investment vehicles are supervised by independent auditors.

2.6.2.4 Actions and Impacts

As early as 2009, Schneider Electric was a pioneer in the 

Corporate Impact Investments space and launched its first 

investment vehicle, Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA). 

Since then, the company has never stopped innovating. In total, it 

has initiated or participated in four vehicles targeted at:

1. Contributing to an inclusive economy with Schneider Electric 

Energy Access (SEEA)

2.  Bringing access to green energy and contributing to Net Zero in 

South and South-East Asia with Schneider Electric Energy 

Access Asia (SEEAA)

3.  Enabling green energy access in Africa with E3 Capital impact 

fund (formerly EAV)

4. Contributing to global decarbonization with the Livelihoods 

Carbon Funds

Regardless of geographies or the type of investment vehicle, all 

these Impact Investing activities aim to catalyze and facilitate 

multiple coalitions with different stakeholders (Schneider Electric 

Foundation, employees, DFIs, NGOs, social businesses, impact 

investors, asset management companies) to leverage Schneider 

Electric competencies towards a fair and inclusive transition.

1. Contributing to an inclusive economy with 

Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA) 

SEEA is an Impact Investing structure in the form of a variable-

capital SAS (simplified joint-stock company), certified as a social 

and solidarity investment company (ESUS certification) and open to 

French employee savings through the Group’s Employee Savings 

Plan (Schneider Energie Solidaire Fund). 

SEEA contributes to an inclusive economy for the benefit of the 

most vulnerable people and communities worldwide. SEEA brings 

together different stakeholders by inviting Schneider Electric’s 

employees and business partners around the world to play an 

active role in this commitment. At the end of August 2022, 6,487 

(past or present) Group employees in France had invested EUR 

43.2 million in the Schneider Energie SICAV Solidaire fund.

Since 2009, SEEA has invested in 25 companies and exited from 

ten. In 2022, SEEA invested in three new companies (Kajou, 

Enogrid, GoParity), re-invested in two companies (Dorémi and 

Okra Solar) and exited from two (SunFunder, Foncière Chênelet).

2. Bringing access to green energy in Asia with 

Schneider Electric Energy Access Asia (SEEAA)

In recent years, electrification rates in Asia have improved due to 

strong government policies supporting national electrification. As 

Asian countries are now approaching universal access to 

electricity, the focus is shifting to integrating renewable energy into 

the energy mix. However, at the micro level, there are still a 

considerable number of rural areas without access to electricity. 

Even when access is available, electricity is often not reliable as 

power grids struggle with load and connectivity issues.

Schneider Electric envisioned the SEEAA impact investing vehicle in 

2018 to help the region tackle these challenges and advance 

towards SDG 7 “Affordable and Clean Energy”. Three other investors 

joined forces with Schneider: the European Development Finance 

Institution Management Company (EDFI MC), Norwegian Investment 

Fund for Developing Countries (Norfund), and Amundi Finance et 

Solidarité (Amundi), committing a total of EUR 20.9 million.

SEEAA, through its dedicated Schneider management team based 

in Singapore, invests primarily in equity in start-ups that work 

toward increasing quality of life and boosting economic 

development in Asia, thanks to access to affordable, clean, and 

sustainable energy. As of December 2022, SEEAA had invested in 

seven start-up companies, Freyr Energy, Xurya, Frontier Markets, 

Oorja Development Solutions, ATEC, Carbon Masters and SMV, for 

a total of EUR 4.5million, contributing to both of the SEEAA’s goals:

Goal to increase access to affordable and reliable 
energy. 

This goal primarily targets unprivileged communities where last 

mile energy access is either not available or unreliable. SEEAA 

aims to create social impact for these rural communities. For 

example, this can be achieved through companies that provide 

access to energy for productive and income-generating purposes, 

like Oorja Development Solutions.

Oorja provides clean energy agri-services such as reliable irrigation, 

agro-processing and cold-storage, powered by solar, and is cheaper 

than the diesel options. The services are offered on a pay-per-use 

basis, which make them affordable to the small and marginal farmers 

targeted in remote weak-grid areas of Northern India.

As well as having a positive impact on CO
2
 emissions, Oorja helps 

farmers increase income and reduce food waste. The company 

also creates jobs by hiring operators to run the solar systems.

Some key impact figures for Oorja, as of September 2022 and 

cumulative since the company inception:

• 880 tons CO
2
 equivalent saved

• 12,750 direct and indirect users

• + 30 jobs created in last-mile rural communities

• 28.5 tons of food waste saved 

• 57% increase in user’s agricultural income in a year

Goal to accelerate transition towards renewable energy 
and net zero.

Enabling the transition of economies to clean renewable energy 

sources and supporting solutions that reduce CO
2
 emissions can 

be achieved by investing in companies like Xurya which are 

developing renewable energy assets such as solar or biogas. 

Xurya is a clean energy services company that provides solar 

installation services for clients via process management from 

installing and monitoring to maintenance and billing. It focuses on 

rooftop solar installation for Commercial & Industrial clients from 

sectors including FMCG manufacturing, cold chain logistics, 

industrial manufacturing, and shopping centers.

4. Contributing to global decarbonization with the 

Livelihoods Funds

Schneider Electric is a founding member of the Livelihoods Carbon 

Fund. The first sustainable carbon fund with high social impact, 

was created in 2011 and is managed by an independent team 

based in Paris. 

Schneider Electric invested EUR 35 million in Livelihoods Carbon 

Funds #1, #2 and #3.

A total of EUR 290 million, invested by private companies and 

financial investors, is dedicated to investing in high potential carbon 

offset projects to generate positive impact for people and the planet.

Projects supported by Livelihoods Carbon Fund #1 (2011) have 

already impacted 1 million people and avoided or sequestered 

over three million tons of CO
2
. Carbon Fund #2 (2017) aims to 

benefit 2 million people and to avoid or sequester 12 million tons of 

CO
2
 over 20 years while Carbon Fund #3 (2021) objectives are to 

benefit another 2 million people and to avoid or sequester 30 million 

tons of CO
2
 over 20 years.

The Livelihoods Funds support three types of projects: reforestation, 

agroforestry, and agricultural practices and rural energy.

The Livelihoods Carbon Funds #1 and #2 have contributed to three 

mangrove reforestation projects in Senegal, India, and Indonesia. 

These projects have enabled local communities to improve their 

living conditions by restoring the ecosystem and encouraging 

lifeforms such as fish and crabs. 

Livelihoods Agroforestry projects enable farming communities to 

increase their revenues thanks to improved conditions for cash 

crops such as coffee or cocoa and the planting of fruit trees such 

as mangoes. In addition, the Livelihoods Funds contribute to the 

creation of new downstream activities such as food processing and 

commercialization.

Rural energy projects play an important role in improving women’s 

lives and create jobs through the construction and distribution of 

cookstoves. 

All these projects are an integral part of Schneider Electric’s 

Carbon Pledge: the carbon credits generated are used to offset 

carbon emissions. For example, part of these carbon credits is 

used to offset all the carbon emissions generated by the Schneider 

Electric Paris Marathon; the race is carbon-neutral since 2019. 

As of December 2022, the total carbon credits accumulated since 

2011 was 426,548 tons, of which 100,546 tons have been used to 

offset Schneider Electric’s Paris Marathon carbon emissions.

2.6.3 The Schneider Electric Foundation 

2.6.3.1 Context and goals

Today’s younger generation is the first generation to feel the direct 

impact of climate change and certainly the last generation capable 

of doing anything about it.

Beyond simply being aware, younger generations are already 

heavily involved in climate and social transition initiatives led by civil 

society, for example through climate marches and citizen 

movements emerging all over the planet, but also through their 

career choices, volunteering, involvement in NGOs and more. 

Connected to each other like never before, young people today want 

to contribute to the resilience of their communities, by putting forward 

innovative solutions, stimulating social progress and inspiring new 

political movements. They are also agents of change, taking action to 

achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

and thereby improve people’s lives and the health of the planet.

2.6.3.2 Group policy

To successfully secure a sustainable future for humanity, younger 

generations express the same need for guidance, training and 

recognition. At the Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis 

of Fondation de France, our goal is to support these young people 

and empower them to get involved and innovate, so that they can 

take their rightful place in the world of tomorrow being built before 

our eyes today. We go about fulfilling this objective each and every 

day, all over the world, through concrete initiatives and programs.

The Group’s first philanthropy policy was published in 2022, with 

full implementation planned for 2023. Its objective is to define 

Schneider Electric’s position on philanthropy, its priorities and its 

principles of action, in line with the UN’s 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs). It will provide a coherent and 

consistent framework enabling Schneider Electric entities and 

employees to contribute and act. 

In 2022, more than 170 projects were active, supporting 69,393 

young people through 13,112 days of volunteering. With an annual 

budget of EUR 4 million, the Schneider Electric Foundation 

contributes to partnerships that are made possible by more than 

EUR 17.5 million support from Schneider Electric’s entities. Group 

employees are also involved in these partnerships. In total, more 

than EUR 23.5 million has been invested to help local communities 

worldwide.

2.6.3.3 Governance 

Fondation de France is a non-profit organization that, since its 

creation in 1969, has been the bridge between donors, founders, 

and field structures in order to support projects in a range of general 

interest areas. It supports other foundations (945 in 2022) whose 

operations are governed separately, but who are legally part of 

Fondation de France. It is responsible for ensuring that their actions 

comply with its by-laws and the legal framework of the sponsorship. 

The Schneider Electric Foundation’s Executive Committee 

determines the major focuses of its actions and the projects it 

supports. It then informs Fondation de France of its decisions, and 

the latter verifies the projects’ compliance and implements them.

Since 2019, the composition of the Schneider Electric Foundation’s 

Executive Committee is as follows:

• 10 Members: 5 from Schneider Electric (including The Chairman 

and 2 representatives of the employees) and 5 external experts.

• 1 observer from Fondation de France

Its missions are the following :

• Define the strategic directions of the Foundation;

• Validate the activity report and financial report;

• Decide on the allocation of budgets by program;

• Validate commitments exceeding EUR 200,000.

One to two Executive Committee meetings are organized each year.

The members of the operational team are:

• General Delegate; 

• Corporate Philanthropy Director; 

• Employee Engagement Leader; 

• Administrative and financial Assistant;

• Mentorship Leader; 

• Social impact assessment Leader. 

Lastly, the Foundation’s Selection Committee is composed of:

• General Delegate;

• Corporate Philanthropy Director; 

• Program Director, Training & Entrepreneurship.

2.6.3.4 Key actions driven by the Schneider 
Electric Foundation 

Schneider’s global presence allows it to have a greater reach and 

impact on underserved communities. The Group believes in 

contributing through different initiatives such as the Schneider 

Electric Foundation programs and initiatives. Through charity and 

donations, teaching and lending its time, the Company will support 

local organizations and stimulate communities.

In fact, Schneider focuses on two key elements:

1. Developing access to education and entrepreneurship for  

the youth with its Youth Education and Entrepreneurship 

Program deployed globally.

2. Acting as a corporate citizen by supporting international causes 

with its Tomorrow Rising Fund, in 2022, it was dedicated to 

employees in Ukraine and their families.

2.6.3.5 Youth Education and 
Entrepreneurship Program

Context and goals

Today’s young people are forward-thinking and creative. We need 

to empower them with the necessary skills and support to create a 

life aligned with their dreams and aspirations. Education, 

technological and social innovation and entrepreneurship are all 

essential ingredients to ensure that these initiatives are relevant 

and effective, that they have the biggest possible impact and are 

appropriate responses to the needs of beneficiaries.

Group Policy

The Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program aims to give all 

young people the means to build solutions for a better life, 

contribute to a fairer, low carbon society, and transform the world.

By funding projects, sharing its expertise, volunteering employees’ 

time and collaborating with its partners on the ground, Schneider 

Electric is empowering younger generations and the broader 

community to achieve a better future through sustainable 

development. 

The Schneider Electric Foundation promotes volunteering activities, 

through the VolunteerIn association, and mentorship as key 

contributions to the success of youth projects and initiatives 

through the mobilization of Schneider Electric employees. 

Schneider Electric’s ultimate goal is to skill and empower one 

million young people in energy management by 2025, and to train 

10,000 trainers and support 10,000 entrepreneurs. 

Governance 

The Program follows the rules and governance of the Schneider 

Electric Foundation and Fondation de France.

To increase the effectiveness of following up the partnerships and 

achieve the 2025 ambition, every six months the program is 

evaluated by the zone President, the Foundation representatives, 

and the Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program leaders. 

Each zone has a defined ambition up to 2025 and a pipeline of 

projects that is reviewed under regular review. Corrective actions 

are implemented if necessary.

The program is led by zone representatives and in-country leaders 

that share ideas on a daily basis. A global coordinator sets regular 

meetings to support the zone representatives and guarantee the 

progress of the program in each zone. 

The program is part of the Schneider Sustainability Impact. Every 

quarter, the zone representatives use a centralized tool to report on 

the impact of the program, and data is reviewed by an external 

auditor. With rare exceptions, all projects benefit from monitoring by 

employees of Schneider Electric entities operating in the countries 

concerned.

The Schneider Electric Foundation has broken new ground in the 

measurement of social impact and aims to enable its partners to 

better fulfill their missions by identifying areas for improvement. The 

Foundation is assisted in particular by KiMSO, a social impact 

assessment consulting firm. A first study was conducted in 2018, 

as part of the fight against energy poverty, to draw up an innovative 

methodology to assess the social impact of missions. This 

methodology is placed at the disposal of project sponsors. For 

example, CLER, the Energy Transition Network, has used this 

methodology. In 2020–2021, the Foundation conducted an impact 

assessment study of its involvement in the COVID pandemic.

More recently, the Foundation conducted a study of employees’ 

volunteering, working with the Goodwill company.

Actions

The program is divided into three main areas: 

1. Support access to qualitative jobs through vocational and 

entrepreneurship training in the energy field, key drivers of 

socio-economic and sustainable development across 

generations. 

2. Learn new skills for the future, technical and soft, giving 

younger generations the boost they need to succeed and build 

the world of tomorrow. 

3. Create the right ecosystem to spread entrepreneurial spirit 

and encourage innovation, enhancing younger generations to 

define their future and take part in social and environmental 

challenges.

1. Support access to qualitative jobs through vocational 
training and entrepreneurship in the energy sector 

Training in the energy field provides an inclusive answer to several 

challenges of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs). For more than 10 years the group has been supporting 

technical and vocational education and training (TVET). TVET plays 

two major roles regarding social and economic development. The 

first role is to provide training and career opportunities for people, 

in particular, those who are not in education, employment or 

training. Its second role is to build a generation of skilled 

manpower, which is required at all levels of the economies. 

Furthermore, TVET can also be a valuable tool for sustainable 

development, as it allows the development of environmentally 

sound skills, critical for shifting toward a more sustainable 

economic model. Schneider Electric’s strategy, backed by its 

Foundation for training people in the energy sector, includes three 

key priorities: 

• Basic training over a few months, which is free and accessible 

to many people and adapted as much as possible to the local 

situation. These training courses lead to the issuing of a 

certificate of competence by Schneider Electric; 

• Single or multi-year trainings leading to qualifications, in 

partnership with local Ministries of Education, or even under 

bilateral agreements; 

• The training of trainers to support the effective and quality 

roll-out of training down the line.

Schneider Electric and its Foundation are developing digital 

training to complement the training offered in energy and 

automation. Theoretical courses but also practical courses will be 

created to deliver comprehensive training curricula, that can be 

followed online only or through blended learning (a mix of in-class 

and online training).

The Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program has a specific 

focus on supporting youth, refugees, women in vulnerable 

situation, and marginalized groups of people. The actions are 

always implemented in partnership with local players and/or 

national or international non-profit organizations (NGOs, 

governments, etc.) and with Schneider Electric’s local subsidiary.

2. Learn new skills for the future

Since 2022, the Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program 

supports the spread of the skills to unlock current and future 

opportunities for the youth. 

Current uncertainty and a fast-changing environment require every 

individual to be able to adapt. The future of work will look more flexible 

and encourage every individual to reinvent themselves during their 

professional career. The programs help build digital skills, relational 

and collective intelligence, and encourage the youth to become 

change makers and create a future aligned with their aspirations. The 

value of technological competence cannot be underestimated but is 

not the only goal in equipping the youth with skills for life, employment, 

and entrepreneurship. We believe in integrating both formal and 

non-formal education to provide a flexible and personalized learning 

experience and ensure the youth can adapt to changing and diverse 

circumstances, identify opportunities for growth and innovation. 

The projects deliver support to young people over a period of 3 

months minimum.

Conserve My Planet program India

The objective of the Conserve My Planet program is to embed 

sustainability into communities where there are both energy and 

environmental challenges, by educating young people on energy 

conservation. Conserve My Planet (CMP) is a participative educational 

green initiative created by Schneider Electric India Foundation for 

students of class 5th Standard-7th standard (10–14 years). The whole 

program follows the activity-based learning model. We teach them 

about Energy Efficiency, Recycling Concepts, Reduction in E- waste, 

Water conservation, Plantation etc. They are taught the preliminary 

concepts of Energy Audits etc. It is also a fun program where children 

are given the role of Green Cops and Green Detectives and by the 

end of the program are termed as “Green Ambassadors”. In 2022, 

CMP program was introduced into 50 schools across 5 metro cities 

(Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai) of India in 

collaboration with SHARP NGO, impacting 6,000 students.

Testimony of a trainee in South Africa

The Centre of Excellence at the Vaal University of Technology 

(F’SASEC) was developed through a partnership between the 

French Ministry of Education, Schneider Electric South Africa, the 

Schneider Electric Foundation and the Vaal University of 

Technology, to train underprivileged students who are unable to 

afford to study at a TVET college  

or university in the fields of electricity, energy and automated 

systems control.

“Landing at the center of excellence (French South 

African Schneider Electric Training Center) was the 

perfect stepping-stone for me to launch my career. I 

came in as a student, having no background in 

electrical engineering or the essential requirements 

to be in that field of study. It became a little 

challenging for me, but I managed to work my way 

up with the help of the brilliant facilitators we had. I 

worked really hard till I was offered a job. If you wish 

to become an Engineer, but don’t know where to 

start because of funds or low pass rates on your 

matric certificates, F’SASEC is the stepping-stone 

for your dream to come true.”

Khomotso Monyai, who secured N1 and N2 Electrical 

qualifications from F’SASEC and N3 Electrical 

Engineering from Sedibeng College. 

3. Create the right ecosystem to spread entrepreneurial 
spirit and encourage innovation

The Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program, with a wide 

range of partners is designed to engender a sense of creativity, 

innovation and risk taking among young people. Innovation and 

creativity can help young people become resources in co-creating 

solutions for the social and energy transition. They can inspire 

policy making and help solve problems adapted to the local 

context. 

Programs are specifically designed to inspire young people, 

delivering soft and technical skills, mentoring young people and 

supporting their network development, to help them create their 

own project from conception to completion. This builds creative 

and innovative thinking and the ability to turn challenges into 

opportunities. They can choose to become effective entrepreneurs 

or to continue with another activity. We encourage them to work in 

groups and participate in collective thinking. 

The projects deliver support to young people over a period of 3 

months minimum. 

The Schneider Electric Foundation also supports emblematic and 

international programs by making available its knowledge of energy 

systems management, through donations in resources and/or 

knowledge, to encourage innovation for the energy transition. It has 

made a four-year commitment to the Solar Impulse Foundation, 

which selects 1,000 solutions that contribute to the achievement of 

at least five SDGs: 

• Clean, Accessible Water for All (SDG 6); 

• Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7); 

• Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9); 

• Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11); and 

• Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12). 

The selected solutions must meet the following criteria: technical 

feasibility, environmental benefits, and economic viability. 

Schneider Electric employees are mobilizing their skills to analyze 

the various solutions within their field of expertise. 

The Solar Sound System project by Atelier 21, a Foundation partner, 

has been granted two Solar Impulse Efficient labels: 

• Solar sound systems for events powered by renewable energies 

(solar or bike-powered). With seven systems in place in France 

and Switzerland, Solar Sound System has set up solidarity 

projects in Haiti, Brazil, India, Taiwan, and Cameroon and has 

projects in Reunion, the United States, and South Africa. 

• Regenbox, the first do-it-yourself “non-rechargeable” alkaline 

battery charger. Regenbox aims to be ecological and anti-

planned obsolescence. This project is also an educational tool 

and a means of raising awareness about a different use of 

batteries in order to reduce the amount of electronic waste so 

present in our daily lives. 

• Bertrand Piccard, Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, is 

promoting this portfolio of solutions to corporate and political 

leaders worldwide. At the end of 2021, 1,000+ solutions had 

already been granted the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label. 

These included insulating blocks made from hempcrete, wind 

turbine floats, and a web-based pallet exchange platform. 

In 2022, with the support of the Schneider Electric Foundation an 

exhibition of the solutions was organized in the Schneider Electric 

premises in Grenoble, known as Intencity, this exhibition was 

attended by more than 2,000 visitors. 

Impacts of the Youth Education & 

Entrepreneurship program

The involvement of women in the energy sector

Since the beginning of the Youth Education & Entrepreneurship 

program, female participation in energy training has remained low. 

Indeed, the energy sector is still a male dominated environment, 

and young women are sometimes discouraged by social norms 

and even by their family to venture down this path. For Schneider 

Electric and its Foundation, it is essential to include women in all 

stages of the energy value chain. Most programs today only 

include women in non-technical and non-essential activities, such 

as selling solar products.

Schneider Electric Foundation’s Youth Education & 

Entrepreneurship Program supports local organizations 

specializing in skills development and female empowerment, which 

are two critical factors in achieving a sustainable change. These 

organizations create inclusive ecosystems offering training, 

mentoring, and funding to enable women to work in the energy 

sector and become entrepreneurs. Schneider Electric and its 

partners also raise awareness among local communities, 

promoting best practices and encouraging a bottom-up approach 

to gender equality. Through these initiatives, the Training & 

Entrepreneurship Program seeks to play a dual role, championing 

economic inclusion and gender equality. 

“An innovative experience! It was something  

new in my life, but I always say it was one of the  

best experiences I’ve ever had – I fell in love  

with electric!”

Vitoria Eliziario – 17 years old – former student at AFESU

Since 2021, Schneider Electric Brazil, the Schneider Electric 

Foundation and the Non-Governmental Organisation, associacao 

feminina de estudos sociais e universitarios (AFESU), come together 

to improve the equipment required for technical training in industrial 

automation and spread the know-how in AFESU training centre. 

Promoting self-employment initiatives in the energy 
sector 

Employment markets in emerging economies are characterized by 

high proportions of informal sectors, underemployment and people 

holding multiple jobs to make ends meet. In addition to specific skills 

training, entrepreneurs need business startup support and access to 

funding, both being key factors in the creation of long-lasting 

businesses. The Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program is 

providing informal entrepreneurs and those trained in the electricity 

sector with support in setting up their own businesses. 

Since 2017, 52 technical laboratories in electricity and energy 

management have been upgraded in Pakistan’s Punjab province, 

7,129 youths have been trained and 2,331 have become 

entrepreneurs. 

This project was financed by Schneider Electric and implemented 

in Pakistan by Muslim Hands Pakistan (as the lead agency) in 

partnership with the Technical Education and Vocational Training 

Authority (TEVTA) Punjab, and Punjab Vocational Training Council 

(PVTC), to improve and expand vocational training in Pakistan’s 

dynamic energy sector. Due to the floods in 2022, Muslim Hands, 

Schneider Electric Pakistan and the Schneider Electric Foundation 

have decided to join forces and provide 1,000 tool kits to the young 

qualifying graduates in the flood affected areas to ease their 

access to the employment by promoting self-employment 

initiatives.

Supporting trainers’ skills development in the energy 
sector 

The international community has pledged to provide quality 

education for all by 2030. School leaders and trainers play a key role 

in delivering quality education. The key challenge for trainers in the 

energy sector is to provide young people with the knowledge and 

skills to be able to carry out a trade in a safe and responsible way, 

providing them and their families with economic self-sufficiency.

The Youth Education & Entrepreneurship program provides 

valuable support to trainers involved in projects at its partners’ 

training centers. The aim is to help trainers thoroughly grasp the 

training approach and materials, enabling them to efficiently 

convey full and relevant knowledge to the students in short and 

long-term courses. The program also supports the trainers in 

upgrading training curricula and adding new modules relevant to 

the market needs. We actively work to develop our trainer 

instruction program by opening more and more centers dedicated 

to this type of training. Training of trainers ensures effective 

long-term transmission of quality, up-to-date knowledge. Training of 

trainers is supported by the VolunteerIn association via missions at 

the partners training centers: IEEM, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India 

(Institute of Electricity and Energy Management) was established in 

collaboration with the Karnataka Government, Schneider Electric 

Foundation, Schneider Electric India and the French Ministry of 

Education in January 2014.

At IEEM, trainers and teachers from Industrial Training Institutes and 

Schneider Electric India Foundation’s partnered training centers, get 

trained in an intensive and comprehensive 24 days training program. 

They are trained in the latest technologies and practices in a field of 

electricity such as safety and security, domestic distribution and 

installations, industrial distribution and installations, energy quality, 

renewable energies and energy management. More than 1,480 

trainers have been trained since the beginning.

Develop volunteering and mentorship as a key 
contribution to the success of youth projects  
and initiatives

In December 2022, a new mentoring partnership was launched 

allowing employees to take extended volunteer leave to become 

youth mentors through the Raise Foundation. These employees will 

be able to take more than double their usual volunteer leave 

allocation of 21 hours per year to meet the requirements of the 

program and best support their young mentees.

The Schneider Electric Foundation strongly focuses on the 

involvement of Group employees in all its activities. Whether they are 

Foundation delegates or employee volunteers, these individuals are 

the link between the Company, the Foundation, and the supported 

organizations. In 2012, the Schneider Electric VolunteerIn NGO was 

created to organize volunteer missions benefiting the Foundation’s 

partners. Wherever the Company is based, Schneider Electric 

VolunteerIn empowers people to be actors and ambassadors of 

societal commitments in the fields of education, access to energy, 

and the fight against energy poverty. In particular: 

• Employees volunteer their time and make their skills available; 

• Partners look for skills to support their activities, specify their 

needs, and support volunteers in carrying out their mission; 

• The Schneider VolunteerIn association as well as the Foundation 

delegates co-ordinate, connect, and organize the process and 

cover costs related to carrying out missions, especially abroad; 

• The Schneider Electric entities host the volunteers when the 

mission takes place outside their country of habitual residence.

The Schneider Electric VolunteerIn Executive Board is composed of 

Schneider Electric leaders: 

• Chairman, Chief Human Resources Officer; 

• Vice-President, 

• Secretary, in charge of the Training & Entrepreneurship program; 

• Treasurer, in charge of the SEEA solidarity investment fund; 

• Member, Vice President, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Well-Being; 

• Member, volunteer representative;

One to two Executive Board meetings are organized each year. 

The Schneider Electric Foundation draws on a network of around 

85 delegates, covering 80 countries. Their role is to select local 

partners in the fields of vocational training in the energy sector, and 

to support entrepreneurship, sustainability awareness and 

volunteering initiatives, particularly mentorship. The delegates 

inform employees about their entity’s activities, and also about the 

Foundation. Each proposed project is subject to a review process 

based on administrative and financial data by the Schneider 

Electric Foundation and by Fondation de France before funds are 

released. Following a project’s launch, progress and reporting is 

monitored by the delegates.

The delegates manage a digital platform known as VolunteerIn, that 

brings together all the missions proposed by the Foundation locally 

and internationally. Available in 34 languages, the platform can be 

accessed from anywhere in the world and enables employees to 

apply for volunteer assignments for the benefit of the Foundation’s 

partners and their beneficiaries. 

Finally, the delegates co-ordinate the organization of the Schneider 

Electric Foundation’s campaigns for international mobilization. 

During 2022, these included the Tomorrow Rising fund and the 

Giving Tuesday dedicated for Mentoring scheme as well as the 

International Volunteer Day which focused on mentoring and will 

continue for the next two years. These campaigns showcase local 

initiatives to a global audience. Delegates also participate in 

campaigns following natural or other disasters. For example, in 

2022 employees responded enthusiastically to the launch of the 

Tomorrow Rising Ukraine campaign. In 2023, an assignment 

campaign will be conducted to renew the Foundation delegates’ 

mandates.

2.6.3.5 Tomorrow Rising Ukraine: 
an incredible spirit of solidarity 

Context and Goals

The war in Ukraine has had profound humanitarian, geopolitical and 

economic ramifications for Europe and the world. In addition to 

disrupting global food and energy supplies, the conflict has claimed 

tens of thousands of lives. It has devastated critical civilian 

infrastructure and has displaced more than 13 million people.

Actions and Impacts 

Schneider Electric employees have always demonstrated an 

incredible spirit of solidarity in the face of crisis. Through the 

Tomorrow Rising Campaign Schneider Electric employees have 

donated over EUR 500,000 matched by Schneider Electric which 

decided to add EUR 1 million to the fund. Schneider Electric 

Foundation also donated EUR 400,000.

A special steering committee is being established to take charge of 

organizing the appropriate release of funds to support Ukrainian 

colleagues and families, based on their needs. The actions of our 

employees from around the world are already contributing by 

providing material donations, hosting families and children, or 

supporting refugees and NGOs’ missions.

The budget has been leveraged to provide more than 500 

individuals (Schneider Electric Ukraine employees, agency workers 

and their families) with hardship allowance, settlement allowance, 

housing support, psychological support, foreign language lessons, 

and legal support over more than six months.

The project supported the following NGO initiatives:

• SOS Children village

− Providing complex and long-term care for over 150 Ukrainian 

children and caregivers who were welcomed in SOS 

Children’s Villages in Poland, Romania and Lithuania, and 

also revamping electrical installations

• SOS Attitude

− Providing support to set up a refugee camp in Moldavia with 

tents and electrical equipment, and distributing food and 

water

• Global Compact Ukraine

− Providing on-line psychological support 

2.6.4 Schneider Electric

dollars in cash and product donations to over 1,700 charitable 

organizations. 

2.6.4.2 India

During 2022, Schneider Electric India Foundation (SEIF), which is 

the CSR arm of all Schneider Electric business entities in India, 

focused on:

Training in energy management project

26,814 unemployed youth were trained, including 1,460 females, 

with 291 trainers also being trained. In addition, 140 entrepreneurs 

started their journeys in the energy profession through SEIF’s skill 

development program, which is spread across 27 states in India.

Clean to sustainable livelihood project

2,400 indigenous farmer families were supported to ease access to 

reliable irrigation through solar powered pumps and grow two or 

three crops in a year under the ‘Clean Energy for Sustainable 

Livelihood’ project. This took place in the very remote villages of 

Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. The project impacted the community 

by doubling the annual income of women smallholders and 

farmers, and ensured food and nutrition security. 

Conserve my planet project

To build responsible communities which are sensitive towards 

conserving energy and environment, we are training 6,045 school 

children, the future leaders of tomorrow, across five metro cities 

under the Conserve My Planet Program. Additionally, SEIF will 

provide scholarships to 55 meritorious engineering and diploma 

graduates from underprivileged backgrounds by the end of the 

year. 

Planting trees project

More than 150,000 trees have been planted in order to help save 

the environment and increase Carbon Sequestration.

SEIF encourages in-house employees to participate in all the above 

initiatives, and during 2022 more than 450 volunteers contributed to 

500 volunteering days. Approximately 300 Schneider Employees 

shared their knowledge with underprivileged young people training 

to be electricians by taking part in guest lectures delivered under 

the Teacher’s Mission Initiative. 

2.6.4.3 Australia 

In 2022, Schneider Electric Pacific Fund contributed AU$385,000 

to major Australian charity partners – Live and Learn, Australian 

Wildlife Conservancy, Kokoda Track Foundation, Brotherhood of St 

Laurence and the Centre for Appropriate Technology. In New 

Zealand, NZ$40,000 has supported Sustainable Coastlines and Te 

Pai Roa Tika. Through our Giving@SE program, a total of more than 

AU$100,000 was donated to charities thanks to individual 

employees and matched donations from Schneider Electric (up to 

AU$5,000/employee/year)

2.6.5 Social Impact in 
France
2.6.5.1 Empowering All generations through 
the Future Ready Program

Context and goals

Schneider Electric has been actively engaged in social corporate 

responsibility for many years with activities ranging from local 

economic development to youth empowerment. Thanks to this 

strong foundation and with the goal of addressing new challenges, 

the Corporate Citizenship team created the Future Ready Program 

in 2022, to expand the Group’s positive impact globally and 

accelerate a just transition. 

There is a growing gap between the skills and competencies 

needed to drive the energy transition and those that our ecosystem 

(e.g., workforce, partners, suppliers, NGOs, customers, etc.) 

currently has. These skills, including knowledge in electricity and 

digital, are becoming increasingly essential for the transformation 

needed and can be hard to acquire. Part of this gap is due to many 

groups (particularly young adults) in situations of unemployment 

and/or with no access to education (for diverse reasons of social 

inequality). Investments are required to close this gap and give 

everyone the opportunity to take control of their professional future. 

The group’s workforce, as well as our external communities must 

be supported, trained, and knowledgeable. 

The Future Ready Program is dedicated to empowering all, 

regardless of their generation, to build their desirable future based 

on their individual aspirations by providing opportunities for 

everyone, everywhere. 

Youth Empowerment in France 

Today’s youth is the future, however, many of them are in situations 

of low education or unemployment and therefore have lower access 

to resources to build their skills. To support our conviction of 

empowering young adults especially those from disadvantaged 

backgrounds, Schneider Electric is significantly involved in three 

major National French programs dedicated to young people facing 

concerns related to education, apprenticeship, network, or 

unemployment.

The “paQte” and “La France une chance, les Entreprises 

s’engagent” both sponsored by the French Government, and  

“Le Collectif pour une Économie plus Inclusive,” gathering 39 major 

French companies engaged. These companies are deploying 

collective actions concerning youth employment (particularly in 10 

French areas), inclusive offers and procurement. The actions on 

youth employment are being led by Schneider Electric and Engie. 

15 years after having created it, Schneider Electric still strongly 

supports the NGO “100 Chances 100 Emplois (100 Opportunities 

100 Jobs). This initiative (focused on coaching, mentoring, and 

networking) has already helped more than 9,000 young people 

make progress towards employment when they were previously 

facing difficulties and roadblocks, such as discrimination or/and a 

lack of network. “100 Chances 100 Emplois” is now engaged in an 

ambitious scale-up plan (launched in early 2022) aiming to provide 

its benefits to 6,500 young people (1,000 in 2022) in 100 areas (44 

in 2022) to cover all French regions by 2026. 

Schneider Electric is also focusing on this mission of empowering 

young adults by offering more opportunities for professional 

integration to apprentices, interns, and doctoral students. 

Senior Talent Program 

Within this journey to further develop our talent and enable all to 

take control of their career path, the Senior Talent Program was 

launched in 2021 connecting the people and sustainability 

together. Throughout all stages in an employee’s career, there is 

the potential and opportunity to continue growing one’s skill set, so 

Schneider Electric wants to offer all employees the chance to learn 

and design their professional journey. Accompanying employees in 

the later stages of their career can accelerate the transfer of 

knowledge and skills across all generations, which is a great 

enabler to a just transition. To learn more about this program go to 

section 2.5.3 “Talent attraction and development” pages 211 to 217.

Contribution to local communities in France

To accompany employees in creating a future based on their 

individual aspirations, Schneider Initiatives Impact (which regroups 

Creation Pass, Solidarity Pass, and Competencies Pass) was 

created in France to offer three innovative pathways to support 

employees in designing their professional future. The Creation Pass 

(Schneider Initiatives Entrepreneurs) is an internal support system to 

help employees start their own business. Since 2010, 1,042 projects 

have been supported and 577 of them have resulted in the creation 

or takeover of a business. These businesses have created more than 

699 jobs in France and range in sectors including electricians, 

organic trades, restaurants, consultants, asset managers, and tech 

start-ups. The second option is the Solidarity Pass which allows 

employees to experience a skill sponsorship for a certain period 

where they offer their skills, energy, and dedication to an NGO. There 

are approximately 38 assignments each year. Finally, there is the 

Competencies Pass where employees offer start-ups/SMEs their 

knowledge and skills to enable local economic development. There 

have been 11 assignments in the past 5 years. These final two 

options allow for a mutually enriching experience where employees 

share their competencies to the wider community and gain 

knowledge in a new area/working structure. 

Schneider Initiatives Impact’s structure in France is totally 

connected and represented in local business networks such as 

Chambre de commerce et d’industrie, Réseaux Entreprendre, 

DIESE association made up of other major groups, local public 

stakeholders (Direction du Travail et de la Solidarité, Préfecture…) 

and local NGOs such as Emmaus Connect or La Cravate Solidaire. 

In the next few years, the ambition is to continue offering these 

meaningful career opportunities to as many employees as 

possible, so the team is focused on expanding Schneider Initiatives 

Impact to other countries. In the first quarter of 2023, these 

programs will be deployed in Belgium and Germany. 

2.6.5.2 The Schneider Electric School 

In 1929, Schneider Electric founded its own school – Paul-Louis 

Merlin – in Grenoble, to address the difficulty of recruiting skilled 

labor in the energy industry and help young people in precarious 

situations to access promising jobs. Today, it continues to focus on 

vocational training in Schneider Electric areas of expertise, with 

innovative training approaches and close alignment with actual 

industry practices. 

Students leave with qualifications enabling them to continue in 

higher education or take employment in innovation-rich energy-

sector fields such as renewable energies, home automation, and 

smart buildings, as well as energy management.

In 2019, to reinforce the link with the Group, the school changed its 

name to École Schneider Electric and new vocational training was 

added to support the creation of its CFA (Centre de Formation 

d’Apprentis).

In July 2021, to meet the ever-increasing need for skills in the 

energy and electrical sectors, and against the backdrop of 

increasing concern about the professional future of young people, 

the CFA took a new step forward and expanded its range of training 

courses both geographically and in terms of content by forging new 

partnerships. In addition to the current BTS “Fluids Energies Home 

Automation” and the Licence professionnelle “Connected Buildings 

and Intelligent Energy Management” courses, which are currently 

offered by the CFA, there are now: 

• The BTS CRSA (Design and Production of Automatic Systems) 

with the Vaucanson High School in Grenoble (France);

• The vocational baccalaureate MELEC (Electrical Trades and 

Connected Environments) with the Lycée Pablo Neruda in 

Saint-Martin-d’Hères (France);

• The BTS FED Home Automation and Communicating Buildings, 

extended to a new geographical area, with the Lycée 

Maximilien-Perret in Alfortville (France). 

In 2022, the CFA has signed a new partnerhip to increase its 

footprint.in France. 

2022 was a successful year with 101 internships. Of these students, 

92% graduated, 48% continued studies and 52% gained 

employment.

Auditors on the Identified Sustainability Information  
of Schneider Electric’s non financial performance 
statement as for the year ended December 31st, 2022 272

2.7.1 Methodology elements on the published indicators

In conformity with regulations in place and in a spirit of 

transparency with its stakeholders, Schneider Electric regularly 

publishes Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) data, which 

includes notably:

• Indicators of the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), 

published quarterly and externally assured annually

• Indicators of the Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE), 

published and externally assured annually

• Other standard Human resources (HR), safety and 

environmental indicators published and externally assured 

annually for the most material ones.

Reporting Year

Annual CSR data is reported for the calendar year (CY) preceding 

the publication year, ie 2022 in this report, in line with the financial 

reporting calendar.

Reporting Perimeter

As a general rule and subject to any particular exception described 

below:

(i)   Schneider Electric reports CSR data at Group level for all 

financially consolidated entities over which it has operational 

control 

(ii)   New acquisitions are included in the reporting scope within 2 

years, meaning that data is consolidated into Group at the 

latest from the third year post acquisition. 

(iii)   Companies accounted for by the equity method are not 

included in the reporting.

(iv)   Within the above scope, small entities may exceptionally be 

excluded if their collective exclusion does not exceed 5% of 

consolidated revenues or total number of employees. 

Reporting coverage is provided together with indicators’ 

tables.

Timing for inclusion may differ between indicators. Typically 

financial or HR data are deployed more rapidly as acquired 

companies usually have existing systems and teams in place, 

which is not necessarily the case for environmental systems.

Progressive consolidation of new acquisitions into 

the Group CSR reporting

All majority-owned, financially consolidated, entities shall 

participate in all relevant Schneider Electric’s SSI, SSE and other 

environmental, social and ethical programs and adopt the required 

policies and reporting practices as per each respective Trust 

Standard. Unless otherwise agreed with Schneider Electric’s 

Sustainability team for practical or cost-effectiveness reasons, the 

following calendar shall be respected:

• Year +1: strategic alignment and material KPIs selection

• Year +2: data cleaning and baseline and target setting 

• Year +3: start of consolidated reporting into Group public 

reporting

When an entity is not fully integrated into Schneider’s IT systems, 

the consolidation of CSR data is done manually and may take 

longer than the standard calendar above. For those entities, if the 

cost of reporting is deemed unreasonable compared to the size of 

the company, the entity may ask to opt-out from CSR reporting. 

This may be granted on a case-by-case basis. However these 

entities still need to follow applicable Trust Standards.

The scope of environmental reporting is that of ISO 14001-certified 

sites, and certain non-certified sites on a voluntary basis and 

without interruption in time. All production and logistics sites with 

50 or more FTE employees must obtain ISO 14001 certification 

before the end of the third full calendar year of operation or 

membership of the Group. Administrative, R&D and sales sites with 

500 FTE employees or more also have to obtain ISO 14001 

certification. Other sites may seek certification and/or report on a 

voluntary basis. A difference can be thus recorded with respect to 

the scope of financial consolidation.

Notable exclusions in 2022 (apart from SSI #1 Schneider Impact 

revenues which is calculated on the same scope as the financial 

perimeter due to data availability) are presented in the table below. 

Details for data coverage are specified in tables page 274 for each 

topic and are generally well above 85%.

extra-financial statements on a regular basis. It acquired OSIsoft in March 

2021. Aveva was delisted on January 19th 2023. AVEVA has aligned its 

sustainability strategy with Schneider’s and obtained an A rating from MSCI 

and Bronze medal from Ecovadis in 2021.

RIB Software is excluded from all KPI calculations except SSI #1.

Other exclusions - 4.1% 2.7% Other exclusions concern either non-integrated entities or recently acquired 

entities grouped here for readibility.

Total maximum 

exclusions - 13.7% 10.0%

Total exclusion figures presented in this table represent the maximum 

exclusions for given KPIs. More precise reporting perimeter estimates are 

provided in each data table. 

Note that exclusions of software companies have limited impact on 

environmental KPIs, and no impact on product-related KPIs at Group level 

given the nature of their activities.

The Group has set a plan to increase its reporting coverage 

progressively to at least 95%, as described in the previous page. 

Internal control

Schneider Electric has drawn up a frame of reference with 

dedicated reporting protocols for Schneider Sustainability Impact 

(SSI), Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) indicators and for 

other Human Resources, safety and environmental data. This frame 

of reference includes the scope, collection and consolidation 

procedures and definitions for these indicators. 

The Human Resources (HR), safety and environmental data come 

from our HR Analytics for the HR data, Resource Advisor for 

Environmental data and GlobES (Global Environment and Safety) 

for the safety data. Its consolidation is placed respectively under 

the Global Human Resources, the Global Environment and the 

Global Supply Chain functions. Data reliability checks are 

conducted at the time of consolidation (review of variations, 

inter-site comparison, etc.). 

External Assurance

Once a year, an external auditor reviews the procedures in place 

and data accuracy in order to provide limited assurance on 

extra-financial information as required by Article R225-105-2 of 

French Commercial Code, notably the indicators of the Schneider 

Sustainability Impact, Schneider Sustainability Essentials and other 

Human Resources, Safety and Environmental indicators, (see 

independent verifier’s report on page 270). This external assurance 

practice is in place at Schneider Electric since 2006. 

In keeping with its commitment to continuous improvement, 

Schneider Electric asked the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit to 

conduct an additional review in order to obtain a “reasonable” level 

of assurance for strategic indicators (Energy consumption, Scope 1 

and 2 CO
2
 emissions, Safety, Gender diversity – SSI #8).

2.7.1.1 Indicators from the Schneider 
Sustainability Impact

SSI #1: Grow Schneider Impact revenues to 80%

Schneider Impact revenues are defined as offers that bring energy, 

climate, or resource efficiency to our customers, while not 

generating any significant harmful impact to the environment. 

Schneider Impact revenues are split into four categories described 

thereafter. Activities included are: 

1. Energy efficiency architectures bringing energy and/or

resource efficiency to customers. Offers include building

management systems, power management systems, lighting

and room control, thermal control, variable speed drives,

Sustainability Business (SB), and industry automation. Neutral

technologies such as signaling, racks and enclosures, access

control, or emergency lighting are excluded.

2. Grid reinforcement and smart grid architectures

contributing to electrification and decarbonization. This

includes all technologies and architectures contributing to a

New Electric World, helping grid and electrification come to life:

smart grid and microgrid technologies, EV charging

infrastructures, medium voltage systems to upgrade electricity

distribution networks, low voltage connectable offers enabling

smart grid management and energy efficiency, secure power

and switches that enable security, and security of supply;

2.7 Methodology and audit of indicators

3. Products with differentiating green performance, flagged 

thanks to our Green Premium program. Green Premium 

products offer environmental transparency (with digital life cycle 

analysis and circular end-of-life instructions), superior 

compliance to stringent environmental regulations, and 

differentiating environmental performance through specific 

environmental attributes (note: double-accounting with 

categories 1 or 2 is removed); 

4. Services that bring benefits for circularity (prolonged asset 

lifetime and uptime, optimized maintenance operations, 

repair, and refurbish) and energy efficiency (maintenance to 

maintain the operational performance of equipment and avoid a 

decrease of energy efficiency over time). 

Additionally, revenues derived from activities with fossil sectors and 

others are systematically excluded, including Oil & Gas, coal 

mining, and fossil-power generation, in line with prevailing 

corporate responsibility reporting and sustainable finance 

practices, even though Schneider Electric’s technologies deliver 

resource and carbon efficiency in such sectors as well. In line with 

Schneider Electric’s strategy to phase out SF
6
 from offers by 2025, 

SF
6
-containing switchgear for medium voltage applications are also 

excluded. In addition, neutral technologies such as signaling, racks 

and enclosures, access control, or emergency lighting are 

excluded.

All revenues consolidated in financial accounts are taken into 

account. Calculation is based on revenues per line of business. 

Exclusion of fossil revenues is based on orders per customers’ 

end-segment, with extrapolation to estimate destination of 

transactional sales.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #2: Deliver 800 million tonnes of  

saved and avoided CO
2
 emissions to  

our customers

This indicator measures CO
2
 savings and avoidances delivered by 

Schneider Electric offers to customers.

CO
2
 savings and avoidances are calculated for global sales of the 

reporting year and cumulated over the offers’ lifetime. Net 

emissions are calculated as the difference between emissions with 

Schneider Electric’s offer and emissions in the reference situation. 

The ambition for this indicator has been increased in 2021 with the 

definition of the new sustainability strategy: Schneider is committed 

to save and avoid 800 million metric tons of CO
2
 thanks to 

EcoStruxure™ for its customers.

The difference between “saved” and “avoided” emissions is key: 

saved CO
2
 emissions correspond to brownfield sales that enable 

reduction of global CO
2
 emissions compared to previous years, 

and avoided CO
2
 emissions correspond to greenfield sales that 

enable a limitation of the increase of global emissions.

• Brownfield sales correspond to the situation where the offer 

sold replaces or upgrades an existing system, leading to a 

change of GHG emissions of installed infrastructure versus the 

previous year. For “saved” emissions, the “brownfield reference 

situation” is defined as the situation before the new solution is 

sold and installed at the customer’s site.

• Greenfield sales correspond to the situation where the solution 

is installed into a new system, allowing a better performance 

with respect to the market alternative.

The calculation of CO
2
 impact of offers over their lifetime is based 

on sales data per product range. The electricity emission factors 

are forward looking, integrating the decarbonization of the global 

energy mix as per scenario of the IEA. Market data and expert 

assumptions are used to determine the use-case scenario of offers 

and the associated CO
2
 impact. This methodology is associated to 

typical uncertainties of CO
2
 corporate accounting methodologies, 

and conservative assumptions are preferred.

More methodological details can be found in our website that has 

been made public in 2019.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #3: Reduce CO
2
 emissions from  

top 1,000 suppliers’ operations by 50% 

Under this program, also called Zero Carbon Project, the Group 

partners with 1,000 of its suppliers, who commit to reduce their 

company’s CO
2
 emissions (mandatory Scope 1 & 2; Scope 3 is 

optional) and not just on the proportion of sales to Schneider 

Electric. The active participation of upstream supply chain is critical 

because it represents multiple times GHG emission compared to 

Schneider Electric’s own operations. The top 1,000 suppliers come 

from 64 categories across direct material, indirect material and 

project procurement and have been nominated by the respective 

procurement teams.

To ensure suppliers get adequate handholding during the 

implementation, several capacity building and engagement 

modules have been deployed. These initiatives sensitize the 

suppliers on various approaches and technical levers for 

decarbonization, including training on basic requirements and 

calculations. Moreover, Schneider attempts to support and drive 

collaborations with suppliers through services and EcoStruxure™ 

solutions.

As a first step in the long-term journey to decarbonize, top 1,000 

suppliers are required to quantify their carbon emissions and take 

ambitious reduction targets and deploy roadmap to achieve them. 

Suppliers are required to share the carbon emission performance 

via the dedicated Schneider Supplier Portal-Supplier Relationship 

Management (SSPSRM). To measure the carbon emission 

reduction achieved, we calculate the average carbon intensity 

reduction achieved by responding suppliers, multiplied by the 

percentage of suppliers reporting carbon emission data. Carbon 

intensity is calculated as Scope 1 & 2 CO
2
 emission divided by 

financial turnover.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #4: Increase green material content in our 

products to 50% 

A Green Material is defined as either of the following: 

• a material with a lower environment footprint; 

• a material that is the output of an industrial technology which is 

a key enabler for a 1.5°C climate scenario and/or a more circular 

economy. 

For 2021, the scope of this KPI covers commodities identified as 

relevant in terms of volume (circa 29% of total products volume in 

2019), environmental impact (carbon footprint and biodiversity 

assessment) and industry readiness, meaning: 

• Steel and aluminum direct purchases; 

• Thermoplastic direct and indirect purchases. 

Overall, the materials in scope represent approximatively 400,000 

metric tons.

Cross-functional experts at Schneider Electric (Procurement, R&D, 

Environment) have worked in close relationship with suppliers to 

define the Green attributes for each commodity in scope, based on 

existing international schemes and standards. 

Thermoplastics are qualified as “Green” when the supplier is 

bringing evidence of a minimum recycled content, biobased 

content (minimum threshold depends on whether the compound is 

halogenated or not) or is using a green flame retardant. 

Steel is qualified as “Green” when the supplier is bringing evidence 

that the mill of origin is an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or has a Green 

certificate such as the ones delivered by Responsible Steel. 

Aluminum is qualified as “Green” when the supplier is bringing 

evidence that the product carbon footprint is below 8 tons of CO
2
 

per ton of Aluminum, is using a minimum of 90% of recycled 

content in its product or that the mill of origin has a Green 

certificate such as the ones delivered by the Aluminium 

Stewardship Initiative.

The scope will be yearly reassessed as the program maturity and 

the transparency of supply chains improve.

To consolidate the KPI, several sources of data are used. The 

volumes of green materials are identified using Prism extract for 

metals and Puma extract for thermoplastic, both tools are providing 

budgeted volumes. The total volume in scope (the denominator of 

the KPI) is determined using RMI extracts for thermoplastic, steel 

and aluminum providing purchased volumes in metric tons. For 

silicon steel there is no consolidation in RMI since silicon steel is not 

a market index, thus the volume is estimated based on a 

negotiation file RCM. Schneider Electric decided to identify 

reported and tracked Green Materials using ‘budgeted’ volume 

since the precision of the reporting tool is better compared to RMI 

extract. Actually, Prism and Puma allowed to track suppliers and 

material grade that make the two levers mentioned above possible 

to activate.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #5: 100% of our primary and secondary 

packaging is free from single-use plastic and uses 

recycled cardboard 

This program has been designed to: 

• Ensure legal compliance through the selection of our packaging 

materials and the availability of adequate take-back, collection 

and sustainable options for our customers.

• Support the achievement of our 2025 Green packaging 

commitment:

 − 100% of our primary and secondary packaging uses 

recycled cardboard. 

 − 100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free from 

single-use plastic. 

 − Define the best practices to offer differentiating green 

packaging solutions to our customers.

The scope includes tier-one strategic suppliers with a direct 

purchase of cardboard and plastics in the Schneider Electric 

procurement system. Geographically, all regions under the global 

supply chain will be covered, as well as Equipment & Transformers.

Cardboard is considered as recycled when it includes at least 70% 

of recycled fiber by weight. Temporary exemption is made for NAM, 

where an average of 50% of recycled fiber by weight is required to 

be considered recycled.

Every reporting period, the spend on cardboard and plastics is 

extracted from the system and each element is classified as 

sustainable or none based on criteria mentioned above. Verification is 

done for sustainable declarations on the definitions already provided 

as well as certificates and other documentary evidence from 

suppliers. The list of eligible certificates/documents is continually 

updated to make it exhaustive and to cover countries specificities.

A global campaign is being run in all global supply chain regions to 

progressively move the spend to sustainable sources and remove 

single use plastic usage with sponsorship from top management.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #6: 100% of our strategic suppliers provide 

decent work to their employees

Schneider Electric has deployed a series of engagement on the 

topic of working conditions to correct mal practices, but also 

proactively work to implement measures which will prevent such 

violations in future. This philosophy is the foundation of the Decent 

Work program. 

Taking inspiration from the pioneering work of ILO, Schneider has 

defined 10 pillars of Decent Work:

1. Employment opportunities; 

2. Adequate earnings and productive work; 

3. Decent working hours; 

4. Stability and security of work; 

5. Social dialogue and workplace relations;  

6. Fair treatment in employment;  

7. Safe work;  

8. Social protection; 

9. Purchasing practices; and 

10. Balancing work and family life.

2.7 Methodology and audit of indicators

The program requires strategic suppliers to develop a pro-active 

policy and provide a safe, attractive, inclusive workplace to their 

employees, and treat all workers as we treat our own workforce. 

Criteria defined for each Decent Work pillar may overlap with 

ISO26000 standard and are validated by Global Procurement, 

Human Resources, Supply Chain and Sustainability teams. 

The suppliers will be assessed through remote questionnaires 

supported by relevant documentation as well as onsite visits, spot 

audits and their performance will be monitored by experts. All 

questions have a minimum acceptable answer defined. Suppliers 

responses will be evaluated against the minimum acceptable 

criteria to qualify as Decent Work compliant. Program deployment 

is ensured by Global Procurement Services to onboard, train and 

assess suppliers. 

Through Decent Work standard setting and compliance, Schneider 

employment aims to enhance social integration, equity, security, 

dignity, satisfaction and overall improvement in the quality of life for 

the workers, and their family. For each Decent Work issue 

identified, the Global Procurement team will ask for corrective 

actions to be undertaken and supported by documentation. If the 

supplier effectively deploys corrective actions, it can be counted in 

the KPI calculation. Otherwise, it is still counted as non-compliant 

regarding the requirements of the program. 

A pilot for this indicator will be launched early 2022. As such, this 

KPI is excluded from the 2021 SSI score computation, and will be 

integrated in 2022.

The methodology for this indicator was reviewed by 

PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #7: Measure the level of confidence of our 

employees to report behaviors against our 

principles of Trust 

Speak-Up helps to maintain high standards, a strong reputation, 

and a healthy and productive working environment, and protects 

Schneider Electric and its employees from multiple risks. 

Misconduct situations will be less likely to occur if people, 

employees and stakeholders feel safe to speak up about concerns, 

dilemmas or issues in good faith, respectfully and without fear of 

retaliation.

Our Trust Charter and Ethics & Compliance program participate to 

transform this belief into practical actions, notably offering multiple 

fair, neutral and confidential reporting channels to our employees to 

make them feel confident to report an unethical conduct. 

In order to assess this KPI, the question “I can report an instance of 

unethical conduct without fear” is annually asked to all Schneider 

Electric employees included in the OneVoice survey scope. The 

percentage of “Agree” and “Strongly Agree” amongst the answers 

determines the level of confidence of Schneider Employees to 

report unethical conduct. Responses are anonymized and 

aggregated for compliance purposes.

This indicator was calculated for the first time in 2021 and reached 

an 81/100 performance. As such, this KPI is excluded from the 

2021 SSI score computation, and will be integrated in 2022.

The methodology for this indicator was reviewed by 

PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #8: Increase gender diversity, from hiring 

(50%) to front-line managers (40%) and leadership 

teams (30%) 

Schneider Electric is strongly committed to building a diverse 

organization at every level, with a workforce that reflects the 

diverse markets in which we operate. This indicator measures 

female representation within Schneider, at the hiring, frontline 

manager, and leadership level. 

It covers all new hires within the company, including both non direct 

variable costs (NDVC i.e. white-collar) and direct variable costs 

(DVC i.e. blue-collar) positions; managers who are in NDVC 

positions, at the junior and mid-management level and whose 

direct reports are individual contributors only; and all leaders in 

Senior Vice Presidents & Vice Presidents positions.

This is a composite indicator: the progress of each metric (new 

hires, frontline managers, leaders) is being evenly weighted (1/3) to 

calculate the achievement of this commitment. 

At the end of each quarter: 

• Percentage of female new hires: Count number of new hires 

that are women divided by total new hires in the current year *100.

• Percentage of female frontline managers: Count number of 

frontline managers that are women divided by total frontline 

manager population *100

• Percentage of female leaders: Count of women leaders 

divided by count total leaders *100

• Blended achievement percentage: Weighted 1/3, based on 

annual % progression from Base Year to total 5-year 

achievement. 

 − 50% new hires progression: Subtract current period % of 

women who are new hires from 2020 base line and divide by 

targeted 5-year progression target (9%).

 − 40% frontline managers progression: Subtract current period 

% of women who are frontline managers from 2020 base line 

and divide by targeted 5-year progression target (15%).

 − 30% leaders progression: Subtract current period % of 

women who are leaders from 2020 base line and divide by 

targeted 5-year progression target (6%).

 − Calculate blended progression achievement %: 1/3 of each 

KPI current period progression 

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #9: Provide access to green electricity to 50 

million people 

Schneider aims to provide access to electricity from renewable 

sources to 50 million people, thanks to the products and solutions 

that are developed and/or commercialized under the Access to 

Energy (A2E) program, from 2009 to end-2025. 

Geographical scope are countries where the A2E program is 

operating, in APAC, Africa, Middle East, and South America. Within 

these A2E countries, the impact is calculated based on:

• Individual and domestic electrification: the number of units 

sold is counted out of the defined list of references providing 

access to green electricity, and a coefficient is applied to 

translate into an estimated number of people impacted.

• Collective electrification: the total power sold is counted out of 

the defined list of references giving access to green electricity; 

it is translated into a number of people impacted from an 

average energy consumption of a household in the targeted 

areas, estimated from external databases and studies.

• Large A2E projects or electrification of public services: as 

an alternative to the above method, actual or statistical number 

of people connected can be taken into account. In this case, the 

technologies sold by Schneider can go beyond the strict A2E 

references, but their value must be at least equal to the 

estimated price of the project’s inverters.

• Impact funds (SEEA, SEEA Asia and EAV): 100% of the impact 

of companies that contribute directly to the Schneider A2E 

mission of providing green and reliable electricity in Africa and 

in Asia are taken into account, as well as 50% of the impact of 

companies that contribute indirectly. To this result, we apply the 

percentage of participation of SE in the fund.

An exhaustive list of products and solutions considered with 

reference codes is available and maintained. Considered products 

and solutions are those already available at the end of 2020, and the 

forthcoming products and solutions providing access to electricity. 

Products and solutions that are out of scope: A2E products and 

solutions that are sold out of A2E countries; other A2E products and 

solutions, not directly providing access to electricity (e.g. MPPT, 

EcoStruxure™ for Energy Access, batteries, etc.).

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The 

methodology and 2021 performance was audited, not values 

cumulated before 2021.

SSI #10: Create 2x opportunities for the next 

generation 

The purpose of this initiative is to ensure Schneider Electric has a 

sustainable talent strategy to develop a Next Generation (Next 

Gen) pipeline of talent through full-time, temporary, and self-paced 

opportunities. Our goal is to provide access to professional 

opportunities for young adults, educating them about sustainability 

and how Schneider Electric plays a part in this endeavor. 

To achieve this ambition to double opportunities, the Group 

accounts for the various ways it interacts with talent considered to 

be part of the next generation pipeline, including Student 

Opportunities and Recent Graduate Hires: 

• Student opportunities are defined as the workforce on the 

cusp of entering the job market, engaged in a temporary 

relationship with Schneider Electric with a defined start and end 

date at the onset (i.e.: Intern, learning event about Schneider 

and sustainability). 

• Recent Graduate Hires are recent graduates or early career 

professionals hires from a formal education program whose 

relationship with Schneider has a defined start date but 

open-ended end date (i.e.: Contract type: open ended contract, 

fixed term contract). 

Calculations are based on actual external requisition positions filled 

in the Global Applicant Tracking System and opportunities tracked 

via connect Candidate Relationship Management. 

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #11: Train 1 million people in energy 

management 

The deployment of professional training programs in energy 

management enable people to acquire skills to pursue a career that 

offers them, as well as their families, the means for a decent 

standard of living. These courses must benefit to disadvantaged 

people. They are defined according to a local reference and 

justifiable by the partner who must be able to justify the BoP nature 

of the people trained, related to the defined local benchmark.

In partnership with local and international NGOs and local 

authorities, the Schneider Electric Foundation and the Company’s 

local entities provide direct and indirect contributions to 

professional training centers. The objective is to help them improve 

the level of vocational training courses with diploma or certification 

in energy management. As a technical partner, Schneider Electric 

does not pay operating expenses. 

The minimum duration of these courses is three months (or totaling 

100 hours). Schneider’s Contributions may be (cumulative 

possible): 

• funding of electrical and didactic equipment, donation of 

request equipment, first generation, for practical work; 

• knowledge transfer through trainer training, and support for 

future entrepreneur training. 

The KPI score is calculated with the number of students enrolled in 

trainings courses, supported by Schneider Electric through 

partnership agreement (supporting documents (list of young 

people) required).”

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSI #+1: 100% of Country and Zone Presidents 

define 3 local commitments that impact their 

communities in line with our sustainability 

transformation 

Since its creation in 2005, the former Planet & Society barometer 

(now Schneider Sustainability Impact), has focused on measuring 

progress against key sustainability performance indicators at 

worldwide level.

In SSI 2021–2025 Schneider Electric introduces a new component 

to measure local impact because:

• There is a high internal demand for local communication on 

progress, as well as to locally empower collaborators to 

contribute to our meaningful purpose;

• Sustainability priorities are highly dependent on local context 

therefore it makes sense to not only deploy worldwide 

programs, but also local actions close to local context and 

needs.

In order to boost local impact towards communities close to 

Schneider Electric, Countries with at least 100 employees have set 

3 commitments aligned with the Group’s sustainability strategy, on 

different pillars: Climate, Resources, Trust, Equal, Generations and 

Local.

2.7 Methodology and audit of indicators

Progress against these commitments is measured by precise Key 

Performance Indicators (KPI). The assessment of this objective 

goes as follow: KPIs are validated by zone/ country presidents, and 

a local SSI lead is designated and communicated to the 

Sustainability Team. This local Lead is in charge of consolidating 

KPI performance on an annual basis.

This indicator was not audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers and is 

not included in the SSI score.

2.7.1.2 Indicators from the Schneider 
Sustainability Essentials

SSE #1: 150 Zero-CO
2
 sites

A site achieves Zero CO
2
 site status if it emits zero greenhouse gas 

emissions related to energy consumption and has in place Digital 

Energy Monitoring. Additionally, the site must have no SF
6
 leaks. 

Exclusions for energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are 

considered for small sources (<3%) of a site’s total energy where no 

feasible fossil-free solution exists today. Digital Energy Monitoring 

is defined as having energy data connected to a Schneider Electric 

solution (such as Power Monitoring Expert, EcoStruxure™ Building 

Operation, Resource Advisor, etc.). For larger sites, this requires a 

significant proportion of the site’s energy to be measured and 

monitored through real-time connected meters. For smaller sites, 

this requires energy invoices to be available in Schneider Electric’s 

Resource Advisor solution. This indicator relates to all sites within 

the Group’s full real estate footprint.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #2: 100% substitution with SF
6
-Free medium 

voltage technologies 

This indicator measures the ability of Schneider Electric to offer to 

the market (i.e. SELL gate of our Offer Creation Process) 

industrialized SF
6
-Free solutions for all geographies. 

The range considered for the calculation of this KPI are Primary & 

Secondary switchgears up to 40.5 kV, Indoor only:

A SF
6
 free ranges ready in 2020: Vaccuum components, Premset, 

primary AIS with vaccum CB, HVL, Masterclad…

B SF
6
 ranges in 2020: RM6, FBX, Ringmaster, DVCAS, Flusarc, 

SM6, RN2C, GMA, GMAe GHA, WS, WSG, CGBS-0, CGBS-1, 

HVL-CC, Mcset, F400

C SF
6
 free offers to be launched from 2021–2025: SM AirSeT, Air 

PacT, RM AirSeT, RingmasterX, GM AirSeT, HVLCCX, …

Products above 40.5kV (WI, CBGS-2, Kite), Outdoor Equipment 

such as Pole mounted, Reclosers, Sectionalizers, Instrument 

transformers, as well as ranges manufactured by JVs and local 

offers adaptation are excluded.

The performance is measured as the percentage of the quantity of 

SF
6
 free offer range available for order (A+C above) compared to 

the total quantity of the current ranges sold in the 2019 reference 

base (for both MV switchgears and components). The current 

range for 2019 reference base is defined as the sum of the current 

SF
6
 and non-SF

6
 (Air, Vaccum) ranges sold in quantities (A+B 

above).

For the calculation, as an example, 1 RMairSet =1 RM6.

Calculation: KPI % = (A + C) / (A + B). Reference Base: total 

quantities by range sold in 2019. 

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #3: 90% of electricity sourced from 

renewables

This program measures the share of renewable electricity in 

Schneider Electric electricity supply, on the scope of environmental 

reporting (industrial sites >50 employees and tertiary sites >500 

employees certified ISO 14001). 

Four different types of renewable sourcing are taken into account: 

• Renewable electricity produced onsite and consumed onsite;

• Renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs);

• Green tariffs; and 

• Renewable certificates (depending on the country: REC, iREC, 

GO, EAC, etc.). 

Electricity purchased with no specific renewable electricity claim is 

not taken into account, even if the electricity mix of the supplier 

includes a share of renewable power. 

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #4: 15% CO
2
 efficiency in transportation

Transport within Schneider Electric is a significant generator of CO
2
 

due to dependence on fossil-fuels. To achieve its net-zero target, 

the Group must engage with its transport providers on both 

efficiency opportunities as well as technical advancements in 

transport assets. 

This KPI measures the Group progress against an annual 3% CO
2
 

emissions for its paid transportation footprint for each of the next 5 

years, or 15% total reduction from 2020 to 2025. The scope of the 

program covers all shipments globally with all transportation 

providers and modes where the freight is paid by the Group. This 

equates to approximately two-thirds of the total freight CO
2
 impact 

to the Group. The base calculation for CO
2
 efficiency uses an 

activity-based method of weight multiplied by distance and by 

mode/equipment CO
2
 factors. Progress is measured using CO

2
 

emissions per tonne shipped as unit.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #5: 15% energy efficiency in our sites 

This program measures the normalized energy reduction of the 

Group’s largest energy-consuming sites against a baseline. The 

objective is to reduce energy consumption by ~3% each year, for a 

total reduction of 15% over the whole duration of the company 

program (2021–2025) using Schneider Electric solutions and 

services. The program focuses on Schneider sites within the scope 

of environmental reporting that consume >3 GWh of total energy, 

along with other sites the Group considers strategic (213 sites in 

2021).

Energy savings are calculated versus a baseline year (2019) for the 

whole duration of the company program. In order to ensure a fair 

calculation of the savings, the actual consumption of a site is 

normalized versus the baseline year. This normalization is based 

upon a site-specific linear regression model enabling climate and 

changes in production levels to be taken into account. All energy 

consumption that can be modelled is taken into account and 

converted into MWh. 

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #6: 80% of product revenues covered by 

Green Premium™

Schneider Electric provides environmentally conscious products to 

customers that support their sustainability goals and ambitions. The 

2025 target is a transformation of the existing program, for products 

focused on green materials, low CO
2
, circularity and digitization of 

data.

Green Premium products provide detailed information on their 

regulatory compliance, material content, environmental impact and 

circularity attributes. They deliver market driven value propositions 

through third-party labels, such a Green Building and product 

certifications, that support our customers’ sustainability ambitions. 

All globally sold products are within the scope of Green Premium. 

The product must be identifiable by an individual commercial 

reference number sold under a recognized brand of Schneider 

Electric. The Group provides resources efficient products (energy 

at usage, low CO
2
, material efficiency) whose footprints are fully 

available through the ‘Product Environmental Profile’ relying on Life 

Cycle Assessment; Green Premium offers also come with 

‘Circularity profiles’, providing information on a product’s Circularity 

through product end-of-life instructions and take-back services. 

Green Premium offers are regulatory compliant. Schneider is going 

beyond regulatory compliance with step-by-step substitution of 

certain materials and substances from our products. All this 

information is provided digitally to our customers.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #7: One-third of corporate vehicle fleet 

comprised of electric vehicles 

Schneider Electric has joined the EV100 initiative of Climate Group 

to reduce its carbon emissions by committing to electrify 100% of 

its fleet by 2030. The fleet reporting structures the fleet carbon 

emissions calculations, the calculation of EVs share in the fleet and 

allows to support countries in the transition. As a mid-term 

objective, by 2025, Schneider commits to switch a third (1/3) of its 

fleet to electric vehicles (EV).

Schneider Electric uses the definition by the Climate Group for 

electric vehicles, including:

• Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV),

• Plug-in hybrids (PHEV): Extended Range vehicle (EREV) and 

Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) - with at least 50km of electrical 

autonomy

Vehicles’ count is a picture at 31/12. The share of electric vehicle in 

fleet is calculated by dividing EV count by total vehicle count.

Fleet leasers are the source of information; global leasers operate 

the largest share of Schneider Electric’s fleet and provide data on 

multiple countries by region. A detailed reporting is asked to all 

countries to eventually correct, complete or complement the 

information (considering for instance vehicles under local leasers).

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #8: 100% of sites with local biodiversity 

conservation and restoration programs 

This program measures, for each site in scope, the percentage 

completion of a set of biodiversity-related actions. The scope is 

Schneider Electric sites within full real estate footprint that have >50 

people. 

Initiatives are defined as “eliminate single-use plastic”, and “local 

biodiversity action” (2 required for large ISO14001 sites, 1 for small 

sites).

Each site reports initiatives at completion. At Group level, 

performance is calculated by dividing completed initiatives by total 

required initiatives.

This indicator is audited annually by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #9: 200 ‘Waste-to-Resource’ sites 

A site achieves ‘Waste-to-Resource’ status if it recovers more than 

99% (by weight) of its non-hazardous waste while leveraging 

waste-to-energy solutions for less than 10% of its non-hazardous 

waste. Additionally, if a site generates hazardous waste, it must 

ensure 100% proper handling and treatment of that waste. Proper 

handling and treatment of hazardous waste means that hazardous 

waste shall be handled as per Schneider Electric’s requirements 

and local regulations, whichever is the most restrictive. Waste is 

considered as recovered if it is reduced, reused, or sent to a waste 

provider for recycling or disposal in any manner except landfill and 

incineration without energy recovery. Waste composting and 

energy recovery systems qualify as recovered. This indicator 

relates to all sites within the Group’s full real estate footprint.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #10: 420,000 metric tons of avoided primary 

resource consumption through ‘take-back at 

end-of-use’ since 2017

The aim of this KPI is to measure Schneider Electric’s Circular 

Economy efforts, meaning all the industrial activities that contribute 

to the Circular Economy model, such as repair, reuse, refurbish and 

recycling, thus avoiding waste, material & energy consumption, 

CO
2
 emissions and/or water depletion. 

Activities in this KPI will enrich on the basis of SE increasing focus 

on circularity business models, and are currently constituted of:

• Batteries take back and recycling;

• Volume of devices refurbished and repaired in our repair 

centers (eg UPS, Drives);

• Volume of MV, LV and Transformers refurbished or recycled in 

our Ecofit Centers.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

2.7 Methodology and audit of indicators

SSE #11: 100% of sites in water-stressed areas 

have a water conservation strategy and related 

action plan

This program measures the percentage completion of a set of 

water conservation actions that sites in water-stressed areas must 

complete. The scope is Schneider Electric sites within the scope of 

environmental reporting that are classified as ‘high’ or ‘extremely 

high’ baseline water stress, as defined by World Resources Institute 

(WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Actions are defined based on the 

amount of water that a site consumes along with the application(s) 

that the site uses water for. At the Group level, performance is 

calculated by totaling all completed site actions and dividing by the 

total required actions.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #12: Deploy a ‘Social Excellence’ program 

through multiple tiers of suppliers 

This indicator has not yet been deployed by Schneider Electric. 

SSE #13: 100% of employees trained every year on 

Cybersecurity and Ethics

As per to our Ethics & Compliance and Cybersecurity programs, 

training of employees on ethics, corruption risks (for eligible employees) 

and cybersecurity is mandatory. To do so, Schneider Electric launched 

3 new trainings as part of the Global Schneider Essentials training 

campaign reconducted every year with new content:

• Since 2018: Training on the Principles of Responsibility (PoR 

document replaced in September 2021 by Trust Charter 

Schneider’s Electric Code of Conduct) and Anticorruption.

• Since 2020: Training on Cybersecurity.

The scope of this KPI is all employees registered in TalentLink 

(legal entities integrated in Talent Link, Core HR data system) as of 

November 15:

• Principle of Responsibility and Cybersecurity e-learnings: 

all active employees with Open Ended Contracts (OEC) 

(exception: Chinese and Bulgarian Fix Term Contracts – FTC – 

are included), present in the Group on December 31st and hired 

before December 1st 

• Anticorruption e-learning: exposed employees identified 

based on the job description (Schneider Electric System of 

Reference – description of functions), active, with connectivity 

type online-corporate credentials, with OEC (exception: Chinese 

and Bulgarian FTC) present in the Group on December 31st and 

hired before December 1st 

This KPI is calculated as followed: the number of employees who 

completed all required e-learnings assigned based on defined 

criteria (2 or 3) divided by the number of employees x 100.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #14: 0.38 or below Medical Incident rate

Safety is one of the 5 pillars of Schneider Trust Charter, which 

emphasizes the importance Schneider Electric is placing on its 

employees, customers, and contractors. Schneider works with 

many VIP global customers, and they demand the highest 

standards of Health & Safety management and performance before 

they engage and continue to do business with Schneider Electric.

Moreover, at Schneider Electric our mission is to protect 

Occupational Health and Safety of employees, customers, 

contractors, and visitors to our locations. The Group also strives to 

provide employees safe, pleasant, and efficient workplaces for 

enhanced wellbeing and effectiveness. As such, we aim to reduce 

the Medical Incident Rate (MIR) to 0.38 by 2025.

The MIR is the number of work incidents requiring medical 

treatment per million hours worked (i.e. average hours of 500 

employees working for one calendar year). Work related injuries 

and occupational illnesses requiring medical treatment are 

included. Work incidents may or may not have resulted in time off 

work.

All work-related incidents reported on Schneider Electric sites are 

counted (including therefore incidents affecting Schneider 

employees and other employees working under the supervision of 

Schneider, i.e. temporary workers). All Schneider sites within scope 

are considered. Medical incidents do not include: visits to a 

physician or other licensed healthcare professional solely for 

observation or counselling; the conduct of diagnostic procedures, 

such as x-rays and blood tests, including the administration of 

prescription medications used solely for diagnostic purposes (e.g. 

eye drops to dilate pupils); or first aid.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #15: Reduce total number of safety recalls 

issued to 0

When sustainability supports Customer Satisfaction, it translates 

into new processes and policies to allow returns of adapted 

products for reuse, remanufacture and refurbishment. The benefits 

can be seen at customer satisfaction level: by producing and 

delivering back order impacted by components in shortages, by 

serving new customers orders and on Sustainability level with 

anticipation of upcoming regulation compliance (Anti-Waste law), 

reducing carbon footprint of our supply chain and reducing cost of 

poor quality due to product recall. 

Schneider Electric has an Offer Safety Alert (OSA) process to alert 

the relevant Line of Business and other interested parties as soon 

as it is suspected that customers’ health or property safety may be 

put at risk by Schneider products, solutions, or projects. 

The Offer Safety Alert Committee (OSAC) is a permanent corporate 

committee that oversees and regulates the management of OSA. 

Its mission is to ensure all OSA are managed with the due diligence 

and urgency to minimize safety risks to customers. Its independent, 

multi-discipline nature allows the OSAC to make decisions in our 

customers’ best interest. As part of the Trust pillar of SSE 2021-

2025, Schneider is committed to reduce total number of safety 

recalls issued to 0.

This KPI covers customer notification and containment actions from 

any suspected condition in Schneider’s Offer that may cause 

customer bodily injury or property damage with Offer Safety Alert 

Committee (OSAC) Go decision.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Cybersecurity performance

Schneider Electric is continuously and consistently monitoring the 

security of its digital footprint with the support of cyber scoring 

agencies and this discipline is applied across the extended 

ecosystem* (e.g. integrated and non-integrated entities). 

Our primary scoring agency is BitSight which rates company 

security maturity between 300 to 820. This rating is calculated in 

real time with a proprietary algorithm that examines two classes of 

externally observable data: 

• configuration information, which represents how diligent a 

company is in implementing best practices to mitigate risk.

• observed security events, which are evidences of cyber events 

like system compromises or data breaches etc. 

Security incidents or identified vulnerabilities can negatively impact 

the company’s rating. They are addressed in a timely manner and 

the Group strives to maintain the score above 800.

* Bitsight scores for non-integrated entities (e.g. Aveva) are not included and 

are monitored separately.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #17: 4,000 suppliers assessed under our 

‘Vigilance Program’

Schneider Electric seeks to be a role model in its interactions with 

customers, partners, suppliers, and communities, when it comes to 

ethics and the respect and promotion of human rights. The Group’s 

vigilance plan reflects this ambition. It also complies with the 

provisions of 2017 French law on Corporate duty of vigilance: Duty 

of Vigilance introduced a new legal framework by which French 

authorities could hold corporations accountable.

Risks within our Supply Chain are multiple: potential violations of 

human rights and fundamental freedoms, serious bodily injury, 

Environmental damage, Health and Safety risks, etc. Impact are 

therefore quite various: reputation impacts, legal impacts, people 

health & safety, environmental pollution…

To mitigate these risks with suppliers, the 2021–2025 plan is to 

deploy on site and remote audits for 4,000 suppliers: 

• 1,000 identified in “high risk” level (by a 3rd party methodology, 

RBA or other) with one site audits; and 

• 3,000 others through remote self-declarative assessment. 

Suppliers answering are counted, removing, if any, suppliers 

that have been audited in the current year or in past.

The KPI adds the total number of audits performed. The baseline 

takes into account on site audits performed between 2018 and 

2020 (i.e. 374 audits); this value has been audited and validated by 

PricewaterhouseCoopers in the previous years.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #18: <1% pay gap for both females and males

Over the last five years, Schneider Electric has proactively worked 

to identify and address female pay gaps with appropriate 

corrective actions through a country driven approach. Given the 

progress made on Pay Equity and to support its inclusion 

philosophy, starting in 2021, Schneider Electric has engaged in 

best practices to maintain a pay gap below 1% by 2025 for both 

females and males. 

Measurement of the individual pay gap is achieved by comparing 

each employee to a universal median total target salary “TTC” 

(base salary + target short term incentive) for all genders. In other 

words, an individual’s TTC is assessed against the median TTC of 

their comparator group (individual TTC/median of comparator 

group TTC – 1). The comparator group is defined by the drivers of 

job level (grade) and salary structure within a country. 

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #19: 60% subscription in our yearly 

Worldwide Employee Share Ownership Plan 

(WESOP)

The World Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP) is one of the 

Group’s recurring key annual reward programs, offering employees 

across the world an opportunity to become owners of the 

Company, at preferred conditions. Schneider Electric commits to 

achieve a 60% subscription rate among eligible employees in the 

yearly WESOP by 2025. 

The scope concerns 29 recurring participating countries, 

representing 91% of the eligible headcount, which are all long-term 

employees of countries participating in WESOP with seniority of 3 

month in the company. The KPI is calculated by collecting the 

number of subscribers from the subscription tool, divided by the 

number of eligible employees in the 29 countries as per data from 

our global HRIS system. 

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #20: 100% of employees paid at least a living 

wage

In line with its Human Rights Policy and Trust Charter, Schneider 

Electric believes earning a living wage is a basic human right. 

Schneider Electric is committed to paying 100% of employees at or 

above the living wage to meet their families’ basic needs. By basic 

needs, the Group considers basic household expenditures (food, 

housing, clothing, sanitation, education, healthcare, transport), plus 

discretionary income for a given local standard of living. 

There is no universal benchmark or methodology on how to 

calculate a living wage, which is why Schneider Electric has been 

working with an external consultant since 2018 to calculate living 

wages for all its locations worldwide. To calculate a living wage, the 

external consultant estimates the basic household expenditures of 

employees, as well as the number of persons earning a wage in a 

“typical” household based on various sources of cost of living and 

macroeconomic data (national statistics, OECD, United Nations 

agencies, etc.).

2.7 Methodology and audit of indicators

To measure compliance with the living wage, a gap analysis is 

conducted every year post salary review for all our Schneider 

Electric employees treated as permanent workforce. The Reward 

team centrally compiles and analyses total employee remuneration 

data (base salary, bonus, and allowances) to compare it with 

agreed living wage. Employees are benchmarked to their work 

location living wage. To calculate employee remuneration, the 

Reward team uses data available in its global HRIS system, as well 

as local payroll. For final reporting of the year end results, 

Schneider Electric can disclose a final score that considers living 

wage gaps closed by countries until the end of the year after they 

have been identified. 

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #21: 4x the number of employee-driven 

development interactions on the Open Talent 

Market

The purpose of this initiative is to create an integrated and digital 

Open Talent Market (OTM) that enables employees to drive their 

own career development. The platform is borderless, neutral, and 

uses AI to help achieve best matches. The ambition is to multiply 

the number of employee-driven interactions within OTM by 4 in the 

next 5 years.

Interactions are tracked in the tool for each feature of OTM. At the 

start of 2021, current features available to employees are:

• Positions; 

• Projects; and 

• Mentorships. 

These 3 features work best when employee profiles are robust and 

rate a 3/4 for completeness. The scope of this initiative extends to 

the connected population of Schneider Electric as defined in 

January 2021, thus excluding non-connected workers (ie: plant), as 

well as contractors, and interns/apprentices.

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #22: >90% of employees undergo digital 

upskilling 

The Group is committed to growing employee digital citizenship 

and aims to achieve digital upskilling for >90% employees by 2025. 

The progress combines white collars and workers populations 

KPIs. 

• For white collars, the Group aims to achieve >90% eligible 

employees reaching Intermediate, Advanced or Expert Digital 

Citizenship level by 2025. The Digital Citizenship level of all 

employees will be assessed by their managers each year. 

Eligible employees in 2021 are active employees hired before 

January 31 2021, Open-ended and fixed-term contracts, and 

excludes employees in non-integrated entities & further 

exclusion defined by country.

• For workers, the Group aims to achieve >90% workers 

complete 2 hours of training per year offered by the GSC 

Academy on digital transformation, such as Smart factory 

program, Cybersecurity, Digital knowledge. The scope covers 

active workers populations and plant team leaders defined by 

specific job codes and hired before January 31 2021, Open-

ended and fixed-term contracts (China only) in relevant 

operating units, and excludes workers on extended leave of 

more than 6 months during the year and factories which 

planned to be closed before Q2 of the following year.

The scope and exclusions of this indicator will be reviewed at the 

beginning of each year. 

The KPI is an aggregated % based on the % of employees meeting 

the target defined for white collars and workers to the total 

employee population in scope (white collars & workers).

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #23: 90% of employees have access to a 

program that supports meaningful development in 

the later stages of their professional career 

This indicator aims to support and recognize talent who are near or 

at the later stages of their professional career through a robust 

career plan and development options, in order to strengthen key 

skills, leverage expertise and ensure knowledge exchange. 

In 2021, the strategy and approach were defined. Pilot programs 

will start fully in 2022. As such, this indicator was not measured in 

2021.

From 2022, the indicator will be calculated as total headcount in the 

countries which meet the global minimum standard for a program, 

compared with overall Schneider Electric headcount. All countries 

with >250 employees are in scope. The minimum standard for a 

program include:

• Training, coaching or one to one support available for 

employees (and their managers) in the later stages of their 

professional career enabling them to have a career check-in/

next-step conversation that results in a meaningful career 

development plan.

• A selection of support options available in the employees’ 

country that may include flexible work, upskilling and career 

growth options, career pivot options, personal planning options 

or workplace adjustments. 

The methodology for this indicator was reviewed by 

PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #24: 75% employee engagement score 

A high Employee Engagement index is linked to higher sales 

growth, higher operating income and ultimately higher customer 

satisfaction and loyalty toward the company. This index is 

calculated once a year through a survey called OneVoice, sent to 

100% of Group employees, and serves a starting point to adapt the 

Group’s people strategy, and action plans.

The computation of this KPI includes all Schneider employees 

treated as permanent workforce (i.e. open ended and fixed term 

contracts over 3 months), thus excluding interns or third party 

contractors. 

The Kincentric employee engagement model is used, composed of 

6 questions, 2 per item (SAY, STAY, STRIVE), scored on a 6 points 

scale by employees:

• Employee Engagement Index: is the percentage of people for 

which the average of the 6 questions is equal or higher than 4.5

• Employee Disengagement: percentage of people for which the 

average of the 6 questions is equal or lower than 3.5

• Neutral: is the percentage of people for which the average of the 

6 questions is scored between 3.5 and 4.5

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SSE #25: 50,000 volunteering days since 2017 

Schneider Electric employees’ volunteering activities mainly take 

place in vocational or educational NGOs (vocational and technical 

training, schools, universities, etc.), and companies supported by 

the Schneider Electric Access to Energy Fund and more globally in 

all organizations referenced by the Schneider Electric Foundation 

delegates in their countries. They principally fall into actions 

benefiting young people, underprivileged families, the environment 

and are organized depending on the personal or professional skills 

of the volunteers as well as the needs identified by the supported 

organizations (specialized or non-specialized needs). Missions are 

posted on a dedicated digital and multilingual platform called 

VolunteerIn enabling Group employees to apply for volunteer 

missions among the Foundation’s partners. Local and spontaneous 

initiatives organized by the Schneider Electric Foundation 

delegates and their partners in which employees engage are also 

taken into account.

In 2021, the Schneider Electric Foundation and partner NGOs 

increased the number of digital missions offered to employees, 

enabling employees to continue on engaging even under 

restrictions due to the pandemic. One day of volunteering is 

counted when a staff member dedicates five hours of his or her 

time to one of these partner organizations. The indicator also 

includes the training missions organized abroad for a period of five 

days minimum. However, due to the pandemic this type of mission 

has not been organized in 2021 for safety reasons. Only missions 

lasting a minimum of 0.5 days are considered. 

This indicator was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

2.7.2 Methodology 
elements on EU taxonomy 
indicators
Regarding the calculation of the proportion of activities considered 

eligible and aligned in accordance with the Disclosure Delegated 

Act in turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating 

expenditures (OpEx), Schneider Electric provides the following 

additional details:

Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned 

turnover 

This calculation is using two combined approaches, including an 

offer-based approach (i.e. by nature of technology), whereby each 

line of business’ products are reviewed against the definition of 

economic activities as defined in the EU Climate Delegated Acts, 

and an end-segment approach, whereby the amount of revenues 

generated from offers fitting with the economic activities 

description sold to Taxonomy-eligible end-segments (Green 

Transport and Renewables mainly) is reviewed. Double-counting 

between offer-based approach and end-segment-based 

approaches are then removed before consolidation.

As detailed in Annex 1 of the Delegated Act on Article 8, the 

denominator of Taxonomy eligible turnover is equal to the net 

turnover recognized pursuant to IAS 1.82(a) after removal of 

intra-group transactions. At Schneider Electric, this represents EUR 

34,176 million, as disclosed in the first line of the consolidated 

statement of income in this Universal Registration Document (URD, 

page 344).

For 87% of revenues (excluding entities having their own reporting 

framework), eligibility calculation combines two approaches:

• For 86% of revenues, eligibility and alignment calculation is 

using an offer-based (by nature of technology) approach, 

whereby workshops are conducted with offer management 

teams for each line of business to define whether products are 

in line with the definition of economic activities included in the 

EU Climate Delegated Act. The analysis is performed at the 

level of each product category, which enables a granular 

segmentation between Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-non-

eligible revenues. Compliance with the technical screening 

criteria is assessed along with the eligibility by the offer 

technical experts at product category level. For example, 

Building Management Systems (BMS) generally include energy 

efficiency systems, which are Taxonomy-eligible, and fire safety 

and access control systems, which are not. In this example, the 

analysis enables to account only for energy efficiency systems 

installed as part of a BMS. An eligibility ratio is then 

consolidated for each product line (which includes multiple 

product categories).

• For 1% of revenues eligibility and alignment calculation is using 

an end-segment-based approach, whereby commercial teams 

indicate for each product line if it matches with the economic 

activity’s as described in the Annex 1 of the EU Climate 

Delegated Act and provide with the related amount of revenues 

generated from Taxonomy-eligible end-segments (Green 

Transport and Renewables mainly). Potential double-counting 

between the two approaches is avoided in applying the end 

segment-based approach to only 1% of revenues issued from 

eligible businesses sold to end segments supporting climate 

change mitigation and the offer-based approach to the 

remaining 86% of revenues.

2.7 Methodology and audit of indicators

For the remaining 13% of revenues (related to entities having their 

own reporting frameworks), an offer-based analysis is conducted 

separately following a review of each entity’s product line reporting.

In order to determine the amount of eligible and aligned revenue 

(numerator), the following assumptions are made:

• At the granularity level of product categories, data is based on 

net sales before rebate instead of net sales after rebate. 

Therefore, the eligibility and alignment ratios are calculated by 

dividing respectively the amount of eligible net sales before 

rebate by the total amount of net sales before rebate, and then 

applied to the net sales after rebate.

• At the granularity level of product categories, a non-significant 

share of revenues (<5%) is not allocated per product category. 

These are not considered in the calculation of Taxonomy 

eligibility and alignment per product line (the product line’s 

average eligibility and alignment ratios are applied to those 

revenues).

• End-segment sales data is based on net sales before rebate. A 

correction factor is applied to assess the value of net sales after 

rebate per end-segment.

A rigorous assessment of the compliance with the technical 

screening criteria is performed for each activity. Under activity 3.6 

(Manufacture of low carbon technologies), GHG emission savings 

are calculated using Schneider’s saved and avoided emission 

methodology. This calculation method was audited by an 

independent third-party in accordance with ISO14067:2018 

standard. Under activity 4.9, taxonomy-eligible revenues made in 

countries where the carbon intensity is above the threshold 

stipulated in the technical screening criteria (TSC), or contributing 

to connect to the grid a power generation source with carbon 

intensity above the threshold stipulated in the TSC are considered 

as not aligned. 

Proportion of turnover from Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned 

activities in the template required by EU Taxonomy Delegated Act 

on Article 8 available page 258.

Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned 

Capital Expenditure (CapEx) 

As per specification of CapEx as detailed in Annex 1 of the 

Delegated Act on Article 8, the denominator of Taxonomy-eligible 

CapEx KPI is equal to additions to tangible and intangible assets of 

the financial year 2022 (including IFRS 16 rights of use), considered 

before depreciation, amortization and any re-measurement, 

including those resulting from revaluations and impairments for the 

financial year 2022 and excluding fair value changes. The 

denominator also covers additions to tangible and intangible assets 

resulting from business combinations that occurred during the 

financial year 2022.

At Schneider Electric, total tangible assets resulting from the above 

definition represents EUR 727 million over 2022, including EUR 721 

million from additions, as disclosed in the note 11 of the Group 

financial statements in this URD, and EUR 6 million from business 

combinations.

The total covered IFRS 16 rights of use over 2022 represents EUR 

356 million, as disclosed in the note 11 of the Group financial 

statements (page 452).

The total intangible assets resulting from the above definition 

represents EUR 490 million over 2022. This amount is split as 

follows: EUR 386 million from additions, as disclosed in the note 10 

of the Group financial statements (page 449) – this includes EUR 

357 million of capitalized Research and Development (R&D) 

projects, as disclosed in the note 10 of the Group financial 

statements, and EUR 104 million from business combinations.

As per specification of CapEx as detailed in Annex 1 of the 

Delegated Act on Article 8, all capital expenditures based on IFRS 

16 related to long-term leasing of buildings are considered eligible. 

None of these are aligned since the Group rental real estate 

portfolio does not meet all Taxonomy-alignment criteria described 

in EU Taxonomy activity 7.7. CapEx related to assets, processes 

and business combinations associated with Taxonomy-eligible and 

aligned activities were calculated using allocation keys of eligible, 

and respectively aligned, turnover per business and operations, 

except for Research and Development (R&D) and IFRS 16 CapEx. 

As described more exhaustively in section 2.3.4 Investing to 

achieve the Group’s climate strategy and vision page 158, R&D 

projects of the Group aim at and demonstrate substantial life cycle 

GHG emission savings and substantial carbon footprint saving. 

Thus, all 2022 R&D capitalized expenditures directly linked to 

capitalized R&D projects are considered both eligible and aligned 

according to EU Taxonomy activity 3.6.

The Group launched in December 2022 a reporting process to 

track additional EU Taxonomy -eligible and -aligned individual 

CapEx from 2023. Taxonomy analysis is now required for each 

non-financial capital expenditure, through a Group tool dedicated 

to investments validation and follow-up.

To not only simplify the reporting exercise but also to support the 

divisions in their sustainable transformation, providing them with 

more visibility on the proportion of their activities qualified as 

sustainable under the European Taxonomy regulation, Schneider 

Electric is automating the reporting of the turnover KPI.

See detailed proportion of CapEx and OpEx from Taxonomy-

eligible and -aligned activities on pages 260 and 262.

Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible and aligned 

Operating Expenditure (OpEx) 

To determine the Group’s European Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned 

operating expenditure, only non-capitalized costs related to 

Research and Development (R&D) are analyzed for the 

establishment of the numerator of the OpEx KPIs.

The denominator of Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned OpEx KPI 

represents EUR 1,716 million over 2022, corresponding mainly to 

non-capitalized Research and Development costs of the Group for 

EUR 1,488 million presented before offsetting with the R&D Tax 

Credit for EUR 51 million, as disclosed in the note 4 of the 

consolidated financial statements in this URD (page 445). This 

includes non-capitalized costs relative to R&D projects but also, 

among others, costs incurred in relation with support and 

platforming, costs of IT global applications dedicated to R&D, costs 

relative to continuous engineering costs for quality, productivity and 

obsolescence.

The rest of the denominator corresponds to OpEx related to 

building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and 

repair and other expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing 

of assets. The total of these categories represents less than EUR 

178 million and is therefore considered as non-material for 

Schneider Electric business, so excluded from the OpEx analysis 

and OpEx KPIs numerators.

As described more exhaustively in section 2.3.4 Investing to 

achieve the Group’s climate strategy and vision page 158, R&D 

projects of the Group aiming at and demonstrating substantial life 

cycle GHG emission savings and substantial carbon footprint 

saving, Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned OpEx KPIs numerator 

corresponds to operating expenditure directly associated to 

Group’s R&D projects: these OpEx are both Taxonomy-eligible and 

-aligned under the European Taxonomy activity 3.6.

Detailed templates required by EU Taxonomy Delegated Act on 

Article 8 are available page 258.

Does Not Significantly Harm (DNSH) 

As defined in Article 3 of the Taxonomy regulation, an activity shall 

qualify as environmentally sustainable only if it does not 

significantly harm any of the other Taxonomy objectives. For 

activities specified in Annex 1 of the EU Climate Delegated Act, this 

means that they must not do significant harm to:

Climate change adaptation: Schneider has assessed physical 

climate risks that are material to its activity. The Group has put 

dependencies analysis at the heart of its risk management and 

performed a forward-looking climate risk and vulnerability 

assessment to identify and price the materiality of physical climate 

risks that may affect Schneider Electric sites, extended supply 

chain and economic activities under different IPCC scenarios and 

different timelines (short-, medium- and long-terms). In line with 

these assessments, the Group has implemented adaptation 

solutions consisting of several resilience initiatives as detailed in 

previous sections. 

Read more about the Group climate risk management and 

adaptation measures in the chapters 2.3.1.1 Risks and 

opportunities | Climate-driven risks and 2.3.1.2. Adapting to climate 

change on page 150.

The sustainable use and protection of water and marine 

resources: Schneider Electric regularly assesses water-related 

risks. In 2022, the Group conducted a water footprint analysis 

along the value chain, covering water consumption, scarcity, 

eutrophication, ecotoxicity, and acidification. Due to the nature of 

most of its industrial processes (manual and automatic assembly), 

water withdrawal of the Group’s operations is considered limited. 

The Group has implemented initiatives to preserve water quality 

and avoid water stress – read more about the Group’s water 

management in the section 2.4.4.3 Water withdrawal, discharge 

and stress on page 191.

Transition to a circular economy: Schneider Electric assesses 

the availability of and, where feasible, adopts techniques that 

maximize the value of its resources, considering waste as a 

resource and ensuring its waste stays within a circular system. 

Beyond avoiding landfill and looking at traditional recycling 

solutions, Schneider strives to move up the waste hierarchy and 

find “reduce and reuse” solutions for its resources. 

Requirements related to construction and demolition waste 

management in low carbon mobility infrastructures are not 

applicable to Schneider as the Group only operates as an electrical 

and automation solution provider in those projects.

Read more about the Group’s transition to a circular economy in 

section 2.4.5.2, page 196.

Pollution prevention and control: On the manufacture, placing on 

the market or use of chemicals, Schneider Electric provides the 

following precisions:

• Regarding regulation (EU) 2017/852 of the European Parliament 

and of the Council of 17 May 2017 on mercury and repealing is 

not applicable to Schneider Electric as we do not use mercury in 

our products nor in our manufacturing activities.

• Regarding the directive on the restriction of the use of certain 

hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 

(RoHS), Schneider reports only 1% of its eligible revenues not 

aligned with this requirement. The Group has deployed 

significant efforts to measure and further comply, even outside 

of the European Union (i.e. beyond the scope of the regulation). 

• Regarding substances laid down in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) 

1907/2009 and identified in accordance with Article 59(1) of that 

Regulation, as the concept of essential use has not yet been 

defined by the EU Commission, Schneider has considered the 

worst-case scenario, and declared as non-aligned all revenues 

coming from products using substances meeting those criteria. 

3% of Schneider Electric’s eligible revenues are generated by 

products including substances part of the candidate list for 

eventual inclusion in Annex XIV. 

• Regarding substances laid down in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) 

1907/2006, the Group notes that obtaining material declarations 

and data from suppliers beyond tier 1 is particularly challenging 

and is not in a position to quantify the impact of excluding 

products using substances that may be included in the list of 

substances subject to authorization but not currently identified 

in the candidate list. The Group plans to improve the traceability 

of the components of each products beyond tier 1 year over 

year, and to make this information digitally available to its 

customers.

Other requirements are met and included in Schneider Electric 

Global Environmental Directives and all restrictions are applied 

globally.

Requirements related to pollution prevention and control on 

overground high voltage lines and noise, vibration, dust and 

pollutant emissions reduction during construction and maintenance 

of low carbon mobility infrastructures are not applicable to 

Schneider as the Group only operates as an electrical and 

automation solution provider in those projects.

The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems: 

As Schneider Electric is not a project developer as defined in the 

Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (2011/92/EU) but only 

operates as a contractor of projects listed in Annex 1 and 2 of this 

directive, the Group is not subject to completing an Environmental 

Impact Assessment or screening. For the same reason the 

requirements related to the biodiversity risk mitigation on low 

carbon mobility infrastructures are not applicable to Schneider. 

Schneider’s assessments and actions on biodiversity are detailed 

in section 2.4.1 «Minimize the Group’s impacts and dependencies 

on nature” page 176.

Minimum safeguards 

As defined in Article 3 of the Taxonomy regulation, an activity shall qualify as environmentally sustainable only if it is carried out in 

compliance with the specific minimum safeguards detailed in the regulation. Schneider Electric takes reference from the Final Report on 

Minimum Safeguards by the Platform on Sustainable Finance as a guidance to report against minimum safeguards, which looks at 4 key 

areas: Human Rights, Corruption, Taxation, and Fair Competition.

Human rights

The company has established an adequate human rights due diligence process as outlined in the UNGPs and OECD Guidelines  

for MNEs. For details, please see our Vigilance Plan as well as section 2.2.10 “Vigilance Plan” page 130.

Corruption

The company has anti-corruption processes in place. For details, see section 2.2.3 “Zero Tolerance for Corruption” page 116.

Taxation

The company treat tax governance and compliance as important elements of oversight, and there are adequate tax risk management 

strategies and processes in place. For more details, see section 2.2.5 “Compliance with tax regulations” on page 119.

Fair competition

The company promote employee awareness of the importance of compliance with all applicable competition laws and regulations.  

For details, see section 2.2.1 “Trust Charter, Schneider Electric’s Code of Conduct” on page 110.

The Group provides below a mapping of Schneider activities eligible under the current EU Taxonomy in order to provide a better  

understanding for its stakeholders. In 2022, two activities have been added (6.14 and 6.17) compared to 2021 and one removed  

(4.15 – District heating/cooling distribution).

24 product recalls have been issued in 2022. Schneider Electric has an Offer Safety Alert (OSA) process to alert the 

relevant Line of Business and other interested parties as soon as it is suspected that customers’ health or property safety 

may be put at risk by Schneider products, solutions, or projects. The Offer Safety Alert Committee (OSAC) is a permanent 

corporate committee that oversees and regulates the management of OSA. Its mission is to ensure all OSA are managed 

with the due diligence and urgency to minimize safety risks to customers. Its independent, multi-discipline nature allows 

the OSAC to make decisions in our customers’ best interest.

Product Safety

No material loss at the Group level.

Around 70 to 80% of our products (by turnover) contain IEC 62474 substances (which covers 37 worldwide regulations 

and about 160 substance families). With the current information collected from our supply chain, we manage to cover 

nearly all substances and regulations. Information disclosed for our Green Premium products covers these substances.

This metric is not relevant at global level as it is only applicable in US and Canada. Revenues derived from ENERGY STAR 

UPS are included in our Impact Revenues measure (see below).

Schneider Electric measures “Impact revenues”, ie revenues coming from offers that bring energy, climate, or resource 

efficiency to our customers, while not generating any significant harmful impact to the environment. In 2022, 72% of Group 

revenues qualify as Impact revenues. The Group aims to grow its Impact revenues to 80% by 2025 (SSI #1).

Details regarding our sustainable procurement practices are provided in section 2.2.11 “Relationships with project 

execution contractors” page 135 of the URD, in particular our Conflict Minerals and Extended Minerals programs. 

Schneider Electric is actively working with its suppliers and closely monitors its supply chain to comply with the Conflict 

Minerals regulations and meet the Customers’ expectations as much as possible. Based on our current knowledge, the 

Group has no reason to believe that any conflict minerals the Group sourced, have directly or indirectly financed or 

benefitted armed conflict in the covered countries, nor supported illegally operating or sanctioned entities.

Rare earth material supply risk related to potential scarcity in the market has been fully assessed and is acknowledged in 

our design roadmap. Top strategic partnerships with key suppliers have been reinforced through long-term agreements 

and C-Level connections, with a particular focus on electronic semiconductor players. A procurement and planning hub 

will be implemented in next two years to establish a direct connection to critical material sources and manage strategic 

stocks, demand, and supply.

2.7.4 Task-Force on Climate Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) correspondence table
Climate Change has been clearly identified as crucial to both Schneider Electric’s internal and external stakeholders during the various 

materiality assessments that took place in 2014, 2017 and 2020. It is also one of the pillars of the Group’s Code of Conduct (Trust Charter). 

Overall, transformations linked to climate change are a source of opportunities for Schneider Electric, the main risk being to fail leading by 

example and thereby lose traction with customers, investors, new talents and collaborators in the company. Concrete climate-related 

programs to either grab opportunities, or mitigate risks are deployed every 3 to 5 years in our Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and 

complement the Group’s Climate Pledge – our short-term (2025), mid-term (2030) and long-term (2040, 2050) objectives, aligned with a 

1.5°C trajectory. We present below our main climate-related disclosures in line with TCFD recommendations.

1. a) Describe the board’s 

oversight of climate-

related risks and 

opportunities.

CDP – C1.1b

DEU – chapter 2 (2.1.7; 

2.3.1); chapter 3 (3.3.4)

The process for designing a new Schneider Sustainability Impact program (SSI) 

includes a sustainability risks and opportunities assessment (including climate), 

which leads to the design of concrete transformation initiatives to align the company 

on the challenges identified. The risks and opportunities are then monitored and 

managed on a continuous basis. Several governance bodies are involved in this 

process:

• The Board of Directors has oversight of climate-related issues notably through 

its Human Resources & CSR Committee. This Committee has 6 Director 

members who report to the Board of Directors, and reviews Schneider’s CSR 

strategy, SSI performance and the Group’s positioning vs. its peers.

• The Executive Committee has a dedicated Function Committee, which meets 

two to three times a year and decides on the sustainability strategy and validates 

the SSI and carbon pledge.

• The SSI Steering Committee was formed in 2020 to propose precise and 

measurable transformation programs for the 2021 – 2025 SSI, which were then 

submitted to the Group Sustainability Committee for approval.

• The Sustainability Department coordinates the overall sustainability strategy of 

the Group and rollout of action plans.

• Three Committees involving Group Executive Vice-Presidents and Senior 

Vice-Presidents are dedicated to oversee the implementation of the Group’s 

decarbonization roadmap, respectively focusing on the supply chain, low-carbon 

product design, and the decarbonization of Schneider’s operational emissions.

Additionally, environmental transformations are driven by a network of leading 

experts in various environmental fields such as eco-design, energy efficiency, 

circular economy, or CO
2
. Environment leaders coordinate a network of more than 

600 managers responsible for the environmental management of sites, countries, 

product design and marketing.

organization has identified 

over the short, medium, 

and long term. 

CDP – C2.1a, C2.2a, C2.3, 

C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a  

URD – chapter 2 (2.1.6, 

2.3.1) 

The growing demand for greener, low-carbon products and services creates a 

strong business opportunity for Schneider Electric. The Group is uniquely positioned 

to grab these opportunities because it acts on both sides of the equation: 

• The solutions Schneider Electric brings to the market are directly linked to 

activities to mitigate, adapt, and improve humanity’s resilience to climate change;

• At the same time, Schneider Electric acts to reduce its end-to-end CO
2
 footprint, 

aiming for a net-zero CO
2
 supply chain by 2050, with precise steps for 2025, 

2030 and 2040.

In 2022, 72% of the Group revenues qualify as Impact revenues, following Schneider 

Electric’s definition, meaning revenues from offers that bring energy, climate, or 

resource efficiency to customers, while not generating any significant harmful 

impacts to the environment. The Group aims to grow its Impact revenues to 80% by 

2025. Additionally, maintaining the best offers on the market for greener, more 

efficient products and services that support the transition to a low-carbon economy 

needs adapted investments in Research and Development in the short term. 

Schneider Electric invest about 5% of its annual revenues in R&D each year. It is 

estimated that more than 90% of its innovation projects contribute to solutions 

contributing to climate change mitigation.

2. b) Describe the impact 

of climate-related risks 

and opportunities on the 

organization’s business, 

strategy, and financial 

planning.

Brief description (please refer to CDP Climate Change response and other sections of this  
Universal Registration Document for further details)

2. a) and 2. b) (continued) Schneider Electric has defined short and medium-term financial investments 

priorities in order to set the course towards its SBTi validated Net-Zero Commitment, 

and more broadly to meet its long-term commitments for climate, and to preserve 

natural resources. Read more in section 2.3.4 Investing to achieve the Group’s 

climate strategy and vision on page 156.

Two main climate-related risks are identified:

• Reputational risk: as Schneider Electric has been working to reduce its own GHG 

emissions for over 15 years and has a proven track record of success with its 

past commitments related to reducing its own emissions, the Group does not 

anticipate significant reputational risk related to emissions from its own 

operations. Yet, the risk that the Group’s actual or perceived failure to achieve its 

environmental sustainability targets, or commitments could negatively impact its 

reputation or otherwise materially harm its business. This risk is also tied to 

growing and moving environmental regulations. 

• Supply chain disruption: Schneider Electric has over 200 industrial and logistics 

sites globally and is exposed to the physical effects of climate change in the form 

of more frequent and severe acute weather events. This could result in damage 

to assets, disruption to business operations, and human consequences. Extreme 

weather events do not only threaten Schneider’s assets and properties but also 

the overall supply chain. Shortages or logistic bottlenecks in the upstream and 

downstream supply chain can translate directly into revenue losses, higher costs, 

and increased working capital requirements. Delays in production and delivery 

can impact customer experiences. 

To further tie climate-related issues to financial planning, Schneider Electric 

successfully launched the first-ever sustainability-linked convertible bonds, linked to 

3 SSI targets including the objective to save and avoid 800 million tons CO
2
 on 

customers’ end by 2025, since 2018.

2. c) Describe the 

resilience of the 

organization’s strategy, 

taking into consideration 

different climate-related 

scenarios, including a 2°C 

or lower scenario.

CDP – C3.2, C3.2a 

URD – chapter 2 (2.3)

Schneider Electric has a dedicated Strategy Prospective & External Affairs SVP 

attached to the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, in charge of climate and 

environment scenario analysis. Several scenarios to 2050 were developed in 2019, 

which included critical reviews of the geopolitical landscape, commodity and 

resources availability, economic and financial evolutions, climate sensitivity and 

evolving policies, energy transition pathways and technology developments, among 

others, with consequences quantified, looking at ten regions and a number of 

sectors individually, framing the business landscape in which Schneider operates.

In 2022, Schneider Electric published a set of scenarios exploring the feasibility of a 

1.5°C trajectory in a report called “Back to 2050”, demonstrating that a net-zero 

carbon future, aligned with IPCC’s 1.5°C scenarios, is still possible, and the Group is 

uniquely positioned to embark its ecosystem onto an inclusive, zero-carbon 

transition. 

Key findings are regularly cross-checked with new publications, particularly the 

ones from the International Energy Agency, BNEF, the IRENA, among others. 

Governance is well in place, under the leadership of the Chief Strategy & 

Sustainability Officer, and both short- and long-term analysis are shared internally 

and used to inform strategic priorities across business and operations. 

As part of the analysis, the Group identified that a growing demand for greener, 

low-carbon products and services creates a strong business opportunity for 

Schneider Electric. Key takeaways from the analysis is the dominant role of:

 

• Electrification: the world is becoming more electric, with demand growing 

potentially up to 3x by 2050; 

• Digitization: with the increase in connectivity, complemented by real-time 

information and competitive computing capabilities, digital technologies play a 

major role in reaching decarbonization targets while augmenting economic 

productivity, notably around efficiency in energy and resource use and 

circularity, as well as increased resiliency and security.

All these findings, and their potential financial impact on its business have helped 

the Group to fine-tune key development areas that will allow its active contribution to 

the low-carbon transition, enabling notably the development of its sustainability 

portfolio of offers.

3. Risk Management Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.

3. a) Describe the 

organization’s  

processes for identifying 

and assessing climate-

related risks.

CDP – C2.1, C2.1a, C2.1b, 

C2.2, C2.2a 

URD – chapter 2 (2.1, 2.3)

Environment and climate-related risks are included in Schneider’s Enterprise Risk 

Management framework and risk taxonomy (more details in section 2.3.1.2 Risk 

Monitoring and Management p.151). Risks are identified and assessed at Group 

level through interviews with experts and leaders, run by the Internal Audit 

Department and the Group Risk Management Department each year. In 2022, 

around 40 of the Group’s top managers were interviewed in addition to board 

members. In addition, a materiality analysis is conducted by the Sustainability 

department every 3 years to identify and prioritize material ESG issues through 

engagement with various stakeholders. 

Schneider places dependency analysis at the heart of its risk management and 

performs a forward-looking climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify and 

price the materiality of physical and transition climate risks that may affect its own 

operations and sites, its extended value chain (upstream and downstream), and 

overall economic activities in the short-term, medium-term and long-term, using 

scenario analysis. The Group has developed a scenario-based analysis of climate 

physical and transition risks, applying climate-related risk scenarios entailing 

different emission pathways between 1.5°C and >4°C temperature rise by 2100, with 

a digital-twin of the company including financial projection, market breakdown, 

supply chain, and carbon footprint to quantify financially the physical and transition 

risks for the Group. 

The different governance bodies involved in the definition and monitoring of 

Schneider’s Sustainability roadmap and programs (SSI), and in particular the 

Carbon committee, are in charge of defining strategic mitigation programs in 

response to the risks and opportunities identified. Strategic programs defined at 

Group level are then cascaded into business divisions down to the sites for 

implementation and are monitored through our digital platform EcoStruxure™ 

Resource Advisor. Performance against those programs is tracked and published 

quarterly in the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), and annually in the Schneider 

Sustainability Essentials (SSE) and URD. Each program of the SSI has a dedicated 

pilot in charge of driving the transformation and is sponsored at the Senior Vice 

President and Executive Committee level to ensure management control and 

oversight.

Climate adaptation risks are also studied and mitigated at site level for our industrial 

sites. Our Property Damage and Business Interruption program, inspired from ISO 

22301 standard, maps substantive risks of financial impact on the business, 

including asset destruction (buildings, equipment, inventories) and profit loss due to 

business interruption. An example of a risk analyzed at site level is flooding risks. 

Typically, all critical industrial sites are externally audited onsite at least every two 

years.

In addition, an Integrated Management System (IMS) covers the Group’s main 

plants, distribution centers, and large offices, and hosts ISO 14001, ISO 50001, ISO 

9001, and OSHAS 18000/ISO 45001 – management systems. Each site is audited 

periodically, either externally by Bureau Veritas (every three years), or internally.

With suppliers, sustainability risks (including natural and climate-related hazards), 

are embedded into Supplier Risk Assessment. This process enables to define risk 

mitigation action plans with suppliers, as well as prioritize double sourcing 

strategies. Leveraging external data providers, the Group monitors events across 

10,000 nodes (such as ports and critical supplier locations) to shorten reaction time 

when events occur and minimize business impact.

At present, the impact of climate-related matters is not material to the Group’s 

financial statements.

URD – chapter 2 (2.1, 2.3, 

2.6, 2.7, 2.8)

Each year, Schneider Electric measures and discloses transparently its end-to-end 

carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2 and 3) and obtained in 2022 a “reasonable” assurance 

from an independent third- party verifier on Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, and a 

“limited” assurance on scope 3. The carbon footprint of the Group helps to pinpoint 

and understand the magnitude of climate-related risks and opportunities, and is also 

used to monitor progress. Scope 3 emissions represent more than 99% of the 

Group’s carbon footprint, of which 85% are due to the use phase and the products’ 

end of life, and around 12% come from the purchase of raw materials, equipment, 

and services. Emissions induced, saved, and avoided by Schneider’s products and 

services during their use phase and end-of-life are also quantified. Key metrics over 

the last four years (from publication year) on GHG emissions are published page 

278 of this document. 

 

Emissions calculations are done with GHG Protocol methodology. The carbon 

footprint methodology is compliant with ISO 14069 principles. The results are 

calculated in tons of CO
2
 equivalent, taking into account all greenhouse gases 

included in the Kyoto Protocol.

The Group has launched several concrete programs aiming at either directly or 

indirectly reducing GHG emissions, under the Climate and Resources pillars of its 

2025 strategy. These programs are presented under Schneider Sustainability Impact 

(SSI) and Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) 2021–2025 programs in pages 

80 and 81 of this document. These programs cover the performance of the Group’s 

operations (such as energy efficiency, renewable electricity procurement, fleet 

electrification), suppliers (such as The Zero Carbon Project, green materials or 

sustainable packaging) and customers (Green Premium offers, SF
6
-free alternative 

offers, CO
2
 savings and avoidance quantification on customer’s end thanks to 

EcoStruxure™).

The overall performance of the SSI represents 20% in the short-term incentives for 

64,000+ employees worldwide (collective share). The Schneider Sustainability 

External and Relative Index (SSERI), which measures Schneider’s performance in 4 

major ESG external ratings (CDP Climate Change, Vigeo Eiris, DJSI and EcoVadis), 

also impacts 25% of the long-term incentives (LTI) for 2,300+ top leaders.

In addition, Schneider is committed to embed a carbon pricing of EUR 50-130 /

metric ton (depending on time horizons) in strategic supply chain and R&D 

decisions, to assess the performance and resiliency of operations as well as to 

assess whether the investment and reduction efforts are in line with the cost of CO
2
 

externality.

Schneider Electric is a signatory of the Business Ambition for 1.5°C initiative aimed 

at setting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets in line with the global 

effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. 

In August 2022, Schneider Electric was one of the first companies to see its 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction targets validated by the Science Based Target 

initiative (SBTi), aligned with its “Corporate Net-Zero Standard” published in October 

2021. As part of its Net-Zero Commitment, the Group has defined mid- and 

long-term targets. Ultimately, the Group is committed to be Net-Zero across its entire 

value chain by 2050, which means that the Group aims to reduce its 2021 footprint 

by an absolute 90% by 2050 and neutralize residual emissions with high quality and 

durability carbon removal credits.

The Group aims to:

• By 2030, reduce value chain emissions by 25% and be “Net-Zero ready” in 

operations; 

• By 2050, reach Net-Zero CO
2
 emissions across the entire value chain; 

• Reach carbon-neutral operations and a carbon-neutral value chain in 2025 and 

2040 respectively

In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of the company Schneider 

Electric (hereinafter the “Entity”), appointed as independent third 

party (“third party”) and accredited by the French Accreditation 

Committee (Cofrac), (Cofrac Inspection Accreditation, n°3-1862, 

scope available at www.cofrac.fr), we have undertaken a 

limited assurance engagement on the historical information 

(observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial 

statement, prepared in accordance with the Entity’s procedures 

(hereinafter the “Guidelines”), for the year ended December 31, 

2022 (hereinafter the “Information” and the “Statement”, 

respectively), presented in the group management report pursuant 

to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225-102-1, R. 

225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (code 

de commerce).

Conclusion

Based on the procedures we have performed as described under 

the “Nature and scope of procedures” and the evidence we have 

obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe 

that the consolidated non-financial statement is not prepared in 

accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the 

Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance 

with the Guidelines.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to section 2.7.1 – “Methodology elements on the 

published indicators”, where it is stated that the scope of published 

indicators excludes certain Schneider Electric’s entities. Our 

opinion is not qualified in respect of excluded entities.

Preparation of the non-financial performance statement

The absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting 

framework or a significant body of established practice on which to 

draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, 

but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect 

comparability between entities and over time.

Consequently, the Information needs to be read and understood 

together with the Guidelines, summarised in the Statement.

Inherent Limitations in preparing the Information 

As stated in the Statement, the Information may be subject to 

uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic 

knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information 

is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or 

estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.

Responsibility of the Entity

Management is responsible for:

• selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 

Information;

• preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory 

provisions, including a presentation of the business model,  

a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of 

the policies implemented considering those risks and the 

outcomes of said policies, including key performance indicators 

and the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 

2020/852 (Green taxonomy);

• preparing the Statement by applying the Entity’s “Guidelines”  

as referred above; and 

• implementing internal control over information relevant to the 

preparation of the Information that is free from material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Statement has been prepared by the Board of directors.

Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor appointed as 

independent third party

Based on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited 

assurance conclusion on:

• the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of Article 

R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;

• the fairness of the information provided pursuant to part 3 of 

sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial 

Code, i.e. the outcomes of policies, including key performance 

indicators, and measures relating to the main risks, hereinafter 

the “Information.”

As we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the 

Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to 

be involved in the preparation of the Information as doing so may 

compromise our independence.

It is not our responsibility to report on:

• the Entity’s compliance with other applicable legal and 

regulatory provisions (particularly with regard to the information 

set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green 

taxonomy), the French duty of care law and against corruption 

and tax evasion);

• the fairness of information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 

2020/852 (Green taxonomy)

• the compliance of products and services with the applicable 

regulations.

Applicable regulatory provisions and professional guidance

We performed the work described below in accordance with 

Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the 

professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory 

Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) 

applicable to such engagement, in particular the professional 

guidance issued by the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires 

aux Comptes, Intervention du commissaire aux comptes – 

Intervention de l’OTI – déclaration de performance extra-financière, 

and acting as the verification programme and with the international 

standard ISAE 3000 (revised) - Assurance engagements other than 

audits or reviews of historical financial information.

Independence and quality control 

Our independence is defined by the provisions of Article L. 822-11 

of the French Commercial Code and French Code of Ethics for 

Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie) of our profession. In 

addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including 

documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring 

compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, 

ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the 

French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des 

Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this engagement.

Means and resources

Our work engaged the skills of 13 people between septembre 2022 

and March 2023 and took a total of 23 weeks.

We were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable 

development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted 15 

interviews with people responsible for preparing the Statement, 

representing in particular the following Directions: Sustainable 

development, Sustainability performance, Risk management, 

Environment and climate, Human resources, Safety, Responsible 

supply chain

Nature and scope of procedures

We are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas 

where we have identified that a material misstatement of the 

Information is likely to arise. 

The procedures we performed were based on our professional 

judgment. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the 

Information, we: 

• obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities’ 

activities and the description of the main risks associated; 

• assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with 

respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality 

and understandability, taking into account, where appropriate, 

best practices within the sector;

• verified that the Statement includes each category of social and 

environmental information set out in article L. 225 102 1 III as 

well as information regarding compliance with human rights and 

anti corruption and tax avoidance legislation;

• verified that the Statement provides the information required 

under Article R.225-105 II of the French Commercial Code 

where relevant with respect to the main risks, and includes, 

where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the 

information required under Article L.225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 

of the French Commercial Code;

• verified that the Statement presents the business model and a 

description of the main risks associated with of all the 

consolidated entities’ activities, including where relevant and 

proportionate, the risks associated with its business 

relationships, its products or services, as well as its policies, 

measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance 

indicators associated to the main risks;

• referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:

 − assess the process used to identify and confirm the main 

risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including 

the key performance indicators used, with respect to the 

main risks and the policies presented, and

 − corroborate the qualitative information (measures and 

outcomes) that we considered to be the most important 

presented in Appendix; concerning certain risks 

(competition and corruption risks, cybersecurity and 

personal data, product quality, well-being in the workplace, 

human rights, value chain resilience and governance), our 

work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for others 

social and environment risks, our work was carried out on the 

consolidating entity and on a selection of sites and countries1; 

• verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e. 

all the entities within the consolidation scope in accordance with 

Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code within the 

limitations set out in the Statement;

• obtained an understanding of internal control and risk 

management procedures the Entity has implemented and 

assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the 

completeness and fairness of the Information;

• for the key performance indicators and other quantitative 

outcomes that we considered to be the most important 

presented in Appendix, implemented:

 − analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of 

the data collected and the consistency of any changes in 

those data;

 − tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify 

the proper application of definitions and procedures and 

reconcile the data with supporting documents. This work 

was carried out on a selection of contributing sites and 

covers between 16% and 38% of the consolidated data 

relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes 

selected for these tests;

• assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to 

our knowledge of all the consolidated entities; 

The procedures performed in a limited assurance review are less in 

extent than for a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with 

the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of 

Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux 

Comptes); a higher level of assurance would have required us to 

carry out more extensive procedures.

2.7.6 Reasonable assurance report from one of the 
Statutory Auditors on the Identified Sustainability 
Information of Schneider Electric’s non financial 
performance statement as for the year ended 
December 31st, 2022
To the Board of Directors of Schneider Electric,

In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Schneider Electric 

(hereinafter the “Company”) and in accordance with your request, 

we have undertaken a reasonable assurance engagement on the 

selected key sustainability performance indicators as for the year 

ended December 31st, 2022 (the “Identified Sustainability 

Information”) presented below and included in the document URD 

presented in pages 73 to 259 of Universal Registration Document 

(hereinafter “URD 2022”)(1):

• KPI 1 : SSE #14 - Decrease the Medical Incident rate

• KPI 2 : Lost-Time Injury Rate (LTIR)

• KPI 3 : Lost-Time Day Rate (LTDR)

• KPI 4 : Occupational Illness Frequency Rate

• KPI 5 : SSI #8 – A Increase gender diversity in hiring (50%), 

front-line management (40%) and leadership teams (30%)

• KPI 6 : Measured energy consumption by source

• KPI 7 : SSI #3 - Source electricity from renewables

• KPI 8 : Estimated Total Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions 

(market-based)

Our assurance does not extend to information in respect of earlier 

periods or to any other information included in the URD 2022. 

Our Reasonable Assurance Opinion 

In our opinion, the Identified Sustainability Information set out in the 

URD 2022 presented in pages 73 to 285 of URD 2022 for the year 

ended December 31st, 2022 is prepared, in all material respects, in 

accordance with (KPI 1 to 4 : GHSD017 ; KPI 5 : SSI 8 - SSI-SSE 

KPI Reporting Protocol SS8v2 ; KPI 6 to 8 : GED 001 and 1. Carbon 

footprint SE - Reporting Protocol) and the basis of preparation set 

out in the section 2.7.1 of the URD 2022 as for the year ended 

December 31st, 2022.

We do not express an assurance opinion on information in  

respect of earlier periods or on any other information included in 

the URD 2022.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to section 2.7.1 – “Methodology elements on the 

published indicators”, where it is stated that the scope of published 

indicators excludes certain Schneider Electric’s entities. Our 

opinion is not qualified in respect of excluded entities.

Understanding how Schneider Electric has Prepared the 

Identified Sustainability Information 

The absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting 

framework or a significant body of established practice on which to 

draw to evaluate and measure Identified Sustainability Information 

allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that 

can affect comparability between entities and over time. 

Consequently, the Identified Sustainability Information needs to be 

read and understood together with the reporting framework defined 

by the Company in internal methodological guidelines specific to 

each family of indicators (available at the Company’s headquarter 

on request) and the basis of preparation set out in the section 2.7.1 

- “Methodology of published indicators” of URD 2022 as for the 

year ended Decembrer 31st, 2022 (together “the Reporting 

Criteria”), which Schneider Electric has used to prepare the 

Identified Sustainability Information.

Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Identified Sustainability 

Information 

As indicated in the section 2.7.1 of URD 2022, the Identified 

Sustainability Information may be subject to inherent uncertainty 

because of incomplete scientific and economic knowledge and the 

quality of external data used. Moreover, some information is 

sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions and/or 

estimates used for its preparation and presented in Schneider 

Electric’s URD 2022.

In addition, greenhouse gas quantification is subject to inherent 

uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to 

determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine 

emissions of different gases.

Schneider Electric’s Responsibilities 

Management of the Company is responsible for:

• selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 

Identified Sustainability Information, taking into account 

applicable law and regulations related to reporting the Identified 

Sustainability Information; 

• the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information in 

accordance with the Reporting Criteria; 

• designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over 

information relevant to the preparation of the Identified 

Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error.

Our Responsibilities

We are responsible for: 

• planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable 

assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability 

Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to 

fraud or error; 

• forming an independent opinion, based on the evidence we 

have obtained; and 

• reporting our opinion to the Directors of the Company.

As we are engaged to form an independent opinion on the 

Identified Sustainability Information as prepared by management, 

we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the 

Identified Sustainability Information as doing so may compromise 

our independence.

Professional Standards Applied

We performed our reasonable assurance engagement in 

accordance with the professional guidance issued by the French 

Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des 

Commissaires aux Comptes) applicable to such engagement and 

the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 

(Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 

Historical Financial Information, and, in accordance with the 

International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410, 

Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued 

by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.

Our Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical 

requirements of the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors 

(Code de Déontologie) as well as the provisions set forth in Article 

L.822-11 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) 

and the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 

(including International Independence Standards) issued by the 

International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) 

which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 

professional competence and due care, confidentiality and 

professional behavior.

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, 

which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system 

of quality management including policies or procedures regarding 

compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and 

applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Our work was carried out by an independent and multidisciplinary 

team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance. 

Summary of the Work we Performed as the Basis for our 

Assurance Opinion

A reasonable assurance engagement involves performing 

procedures to obtain evidence about the Identified Sustainability 

Information. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected 

depend on professional judgment, including the assessment of 

risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in the 

Identified Sustainability Information. In making those risk 

assessments, we considered internal control relevant to the 

Company’s preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information. 

A reasonable assurance engagement also includes:

• evaluating the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s 

use of the Reporting Criteria;

• evaluating the appropriateness of measurement and evaluation 

methods, reporting policies used and the reasonableness of 

estimates made by the Company; and

• evaluating the disclosures in, and overall presentation of, the 

Identified Sustainability Information. 

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

The indicators below concern all entities where Schneider Electric has operational control, and integrated in the Group for more than 2 

years.

Within the Group perimeter, given the complexity to obtain robust and meaningful data, in particular for small leased offices, estimated 

coverage indicators are provided for each reporting table. All Group industrial and logistics sites, in addition to certain major tertiary sites 

are covered. As per the Group’ s Environmental Policy, all industrial and logistics sites with more than 50 people and tertiary sites with more 

than 500 people must be ISO 14001 certified within 2 years after their acquisition or creation. A difference can, therefore, be noted with 

respect to the scope of financial consolidation.

2.8.1.2 Perimeter and Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001)

Indicators Units 2022 2021 2020 2019

ISO 14001 certified sites(1) # 243 244 232 241

Industrial and logistics sites # 204 211 212 220

Tertiary sites # 39 33 20 21

% of sites certified ISO 14001(2) % 86% 87% 90% 89%

(1) ISO 14001 certification is systematic for all large industrial, logistics and tertiary sites within two years of acquisition. A reduction in the number of ISO 14001 certified 

sites usually results from sites closing during the year.

(2) the percentage of sites certified ISO 14001 is calculated based on waste generation from certified sites vs total sites, as the majority of sites - in number - are small 

leased offices where certification is not relevant.

(1) Waste reduction measures specific, targeted projects which reduce/avoid waste. Examples of waste reduction projects include creating a closed-loop system for 

pallets between the site and the supplier, or reducing packaging waste from incoming shipments. Normal operational decreases of waste due to reduced activity do 

not count as waste reduction.

(2) Non-hazardous waste recovered or reduced is calculated as the ratio between waste reused/recycled, incinerated with energy recovery and reduced, divided by the 

total non-hazardous waste generated and waste reduced. The Group’s waste recovery percentage without waste reduction is: 95.9%, 95.5% 96.3%, and 95.2% for 

2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

(3) ‘Schneider Electric expectations’ for hazardous waste means: 1) Waste meets/exceeds all local legal requirements for handling/treatment, and either 2a) waste is 

neutralized of its hazardous nature, or b) waste is handled/treated using the feasibly best available technique which provides the most environmentally beneficial 

impact.

(4) 2017 hazardous waste intensity was 0.42 metric tons per million euros of revenues.

(1) Out of scope energy consumption concerns mainly AVEVA, RIB Software and Larsen & Toubro and to a limited extent other small non-integrated entities.

(2) For sites below size thresholds for mandatory environmental reporting, energy consumption by source is estimated by multiplying site surface (m2) with energy 

intensity ratios (kWh/m2) measured in larger sites. For sites located in countries with country-level renewable electricity contracts, 100% of the estimated electricity 

consumption of the site is counted as renewable, as such supply contracts cover all sites within a country. 2022 includes 44,286 MWh of Energy Attribute Certificates 

(EACs) applied to sites in the estimated energy scope.

(3) 2005 estimated energy productivity is 12,408 € per MWh

(4) Renewable electricity reported here includes renewable electricity purchased through Power Purchasing Agreements (PPA) or green tariffs, and electricity covered 

by Energy Attributes Certificates (EAC). The 2022 EAC account for 35.9% of total measured purchased renewable electricity reported.

 Note than Schneider Electric carbon footprint has been updated in 2021 to reflect changes in Global Warming Potential (GWP) values for SF
6
 gas published by the 

IPCC in its 6th Assessment Report. Previous GWP value of 23,500 (AR5) has been updated to 25,200 (AR6) for 2021 and historical emissions and impacts Scope 1 

and scope 3 CO
2
 equivalent emissions.

(1) The CO
2
 emissions linked to energy consumption are considered estimates for two reasons: on the one hand, energy consumption and corresponding CO

2
 emissions 

are estimated for sites not included in the energy reporting perimeter; on the other hand, the indirect emissions are calculated on the conversion factors per country 

and not with supplier-specific data. Scope 1 and 2 CO
2
 emissions from energy consumption are quantified using energy reporting data, in MWh of energy per energy 

source. Scope 2 emissions are quantified with the market-based methodology and the location-based methodology, following GHG Protocol scope 2 guidance. 

Location-based Scope 2 electricity emissions on energy reporting perimeter are equal to 298,461 TCO
2
e (audited value), and 385,574 TCO

2
e on total estimated 

perimeter. Total scope 1 and 2 (location-based) CO
2
 emissions (energy, vehicles, and SF

6
 emissions in TCO

2
e) on full perimeter are equal to 514,648 TCO

2
e (audited 

value). Electricity emissions calculated with market-based and location-based methodologies should not be added. Market-based electricity emissions are calculated 

using residual electricity emissions factors (source AIB, 2020) for European countries, and average country emission factors for other countries (IEA, 2020)

(2)  In 2017, direct (Scope 1) emissions, energy indirect (scope 2) emissions and other relevant indirect (scope 3) emissions amounted to 187,477 TCO
2
e, 511,602 TCO

2
e 

and 67,683,080 TCO
2
e respectively. CO

2
 reductions in 2022 compared to 2017 are 67% for Scopes 1 and 2, and 10% for Scope 3.

(3) SF
6
 emissions are generated in a limited number of manufacturing sites that are the ones which are handling SF

6
 for the relevant products: it corresponds to 13 sites in 

2022 and in 2021, and 14 sites in 2020 and 2019

(4) CO
2
 emissions for sites not included in the energy reporting perimeter are estimated based on site surface and average CO

2
 intensity of sites per region from our 

energy reporting

(5) Greenhouse gas emissions from renewable electricity are due to CH4 and N2O emissions of renewable electricity from biomass. In addition, biogenic CO
2
 emissions 

are due to the consumption of renewable electricity from biomass and are not reported in scope 2 emissions following GHG protocol guidance. These emissions are of 

17,294 tCO
2
b in 2022

(6) These emissions correspond to products sold by Schneider Electric during the year of reporting and cumulated over their lifetime. These emissions are attributable to 

electricity consumption of products, either due to internal consumption or due to heat dissipation (Joule effect). The GHG emissions from electricity considered are 

forward-looking during the lifetime of products, based on a scenario from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that factors in the future decarbonization of the grids. 

Previously these emissions were based on the Reference Technology Scenario of the “Energy Technology Perspectives 2017” (IEA, 2017) which provided a baseline 

scenario based on existing (at the time of publication) energy- and climate-related commitments by countries, including Nationally Determined Contributions pledged 

under the Paris Agreement. For 2022 carbon footprint, the GHG emissions from electricity have been updated with the most recent scenario, to better reflect the 

current commitments of countries. The scenario is now the Stated Policies Scenario from the “World Energy Outlook 2022” (IEA, 2022), which is based on current 

policies, as well as policies announced by governments at the time of publication. This update in terms of energy scenario is the main driver for the reduction of the 

emissions by 14% year-on-year on this category. Using the same energy scenario for the emissions with sales of 2021 would lead to emissions of 48,479,617 TCO
2
e 

i.e., a decrease of 2.5% year-on-year;

(7) Avoided CO
2
 emissions are calculated for sales of the reporting year and cumulated over the offers’ lifetime. Emissions are calculated as the difference between 

emissions with Schneider Electric’s offer and emissions in the reference situation. The methodology distinguishes “saved” and “avoided” emissions: saved CO
2
 

emissions correspond to brownfield sales that enable reduction of global CO
2
 emissions compared to previous years, while avoided CO

2
 emissions correspond to 

greenfield sales that enable a limitation of the increase of global emission. Since new methodologies are developed every year, CO
2
 saved and avoided from those 

offers is quantified for sales that occurred since 2018 and counted fully in the performance of the reporting year. In addition, methodologies are continuously 

improved, leading potentialy to some adjustments with retroactive impact. In 2022, out of the 93.4 MTCO
2
e saved and avoided, 0.92 MT (1.0%) came from 2018-2021 

backdated performance.

(1) The baseline year for each indicator is provided together with its baseline performance.

(2) Each year, Schneider Electric obtains a “limited” level of assurance on methodology and progress from an independent third party verifier for all the SSI and SSE 

indicators (except SSI #+1 and SSE #12 in 2022), in accordance with ISAE 3000 assurance standard (see Independent verifier’s report on page 270). In addition,  

SSI #8 obtained a “reasonable” level of assurance in 2022. Please refer to page 242 for the methodological presentation of each indicator. The 2022 performance is 

also discussed in more details in each section of this report.

(3) Calculation methodology for SSI #8 has been expanded in Q2 2022 to include blue collar managers in the scope of front line managers. Due to this methodological 

change, the 2020 baseline for front line managers has been recalculated to 23% instead of 25%.

(4) SSE #12 ‘Social Excellence’ program currently under development.

Indicators below have a Group scope as described in section 2.7, page 242.

HR statistics presented below cover about 90% of the 149,812 employees from consolidated companies where HR IT systems have been 

deployed. About 14,400 employees are excluded, including 6,500 AVEVA and OSIsoft employees and 2,900 RIB Software employees.  

SSI #8 is calculated on constant scope and also excludes employees from L&T and Proleit, as they were acquired during 2020, which is the 

baseline year for this program. SSI #8 coverage is about 87% of Group employees in 2022. Total Group workforce, ie employees and 

non-employee interim workers is 164,183 people in 2022.

The calculation methodology of the absenteeism rate varying from one country to another, in this domain Schneider Electric communicates 

at Group level the number of lost days and the number of hours worked (Safety data). The precisions on the variations of scope are 

contributed at the end of the tables below and indicated by footnotes.

Occupational Illness Frequency Rate (OIFR) is based on 1 million hours worked (The number of Occupational illness X 1,000,000 Hours/Total Hours Worked).  

Note that the Medical Incident Rate (MIR) consists of both medical incidents + Occupational Illnesses and is based on 1 million hours worked.

S T R A T E G I C  R E P O R TChapter 3 – How we manage risk at Schneider Electric

Dear Stakeholders

We operate in an unpredictable world, where risks reside at every 

corner. It’s becoming increasingly difficult for companies to 

anticipate, understand and prepare for the extensive range of risks 

that can impact their operations. Novel risks arise every day, fueled 

by the rapid pace of technology developments and social and 

political movements. Even with the best risk management systems 

in place, setbacks are bound to occur. The manner in which a 

company prepares for and responds to the ever-increasing risk 

environment stands as a true testament of its resilience. 

Building a strong risk management culture and mechanisms takes 

a great deal of work and effective collaboration. In 2021, the Group 

started strengthening its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 

framework, aiming to increase its overall level of resilience. This 

framework offers a holistic approach to managing risk, bringing the 

right forces together in a common effort with a few focus areas: 

protecting the Group’s value, assets, and reputation; identifying 

and measuring the major risks to which the Group is exposed; 

anticipating and foreseeing changes in these risks; implementing 

risk prevention, mitigation, and transfer measures, and building 

crisis response capabilities.

More precisely, the Group’s ERM framework looks at trust from 

three vantage points. The first is integrity; this entails creating a 

hospitable context for principled behaviors. The second is 

transparency, which involves fostering objective, transparent and 

data-backed decision-making processes to earn and sustain trust. 

The third is resilience, which is focused on ensuring thoughtful, 

considered risk taking throughout the organization.

As one key element of this framework, internal control procedures 

are designed to drive compliance with laws and regulations, 

application of policies and guidelines, effectiveness of the internal 

processes and timely remediation of deficiencies and reliability of 

financial reporting.

Ultimately, what guides us every day is the desire to cultivate and 

maintain trust in our ecosystem, with our customers, partners and 

employees. And we can only do so by acting with integrity, 

fostering transparency, and demonstrating resilience.

Thank you for your support and your trust,

Hervé Coureil

Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General

Officer & Secretary General, Hervé Coureil

3.1 Risk management scope

The Enterprise Risk Management framework is designed to cover 

the Group, defined as the Schneider Electric SE parent company 

and the subsidiaries over which it exercises exclusive control. 

Acquired companies are integrated progressively into the 

Group internal control and risk management systems.

3.2 Organization and management

3.2.1 Group values

Resilience as a top value

Schneider Electric has placed significant importance on resilience 

within the values and principles which guide and inspire its actions 

and, in particular, its business practice. Indeed, resilience is one of 

the fundamental elements of sustainable growth and belongs 

directly to the Group’s Sustainability value. All Group entities, along 

the three lines of defense described hereafter, are encouraged to:

• Develop a culture promoting resilience for the Group;

• Raise resilience awareness and best practices, within their 

scope of work; and

• Implement initiatives aimed at increasing the Group resilience, 

by decreasing the risk exposure and/or increasing its level of 

preparedness.

Hybrid risk management model

Schneider Electric uses a hybrid risk management model. It means 

that while there is a Group Risk Management function and experts 

in charge of setting risk management mechanisms, establishing 

policies, and other activities, ownership of the risks belongs to the 

Business Units, Operating Divisions, or Global Functions who 

are responsible for deploying the central framework to manage 

their risks. 

These are organized in three lines of defense: 

• 1st line of defense: Business and Risk Owners 

Operating Divisions and Business Units take ownership of how 

the risks specific to their local market or function are managed 

on the ground, following the procedures set by the second line 

of defense. 

• 2nd line of defense: Group Risk Management, Internal Control, 

Risk Overseers 

Set risk management mechanisms, advise and monitor the first 

line of defense, helps them build action plans to improve 

identification, mitigation, and control of risks. 

• 3rd line of defense: Internal Audit 

Independent body, not dedicated to a specific risk area or 

region. Assesses if the first line of defense is managing risks 

properly and if the second line of defense is setting mechanisms 

and supporting the first line adequately. 

The section hereafter (3.2.2) goes over the three lines of defense 

and gives more detail about the hybrid risk management model 

and the governing bodies.

Figure 1: The three lines model

3.2.2 Internal control and risk management roles and 
responsibilities

The Group’s corporate governance bodies supervise the 

development of internal control and risk management systems. The 

Audit & Risks Committee has particular responsibility for following 

up on the efficiency of internal control and risk management 

systems and reports to the Board of Directors.

Senior Management

Senior Management is responsible for designing and leading the 

overall internal control system, with support from all key 

participants, in particular the Group Internal Audit and Internal 

Control departments. 

It also monitors the Group’s performance during business reviews 

with the Operating Divisions and Global Functions. These reviews 

cover business trends, action plans, current results, and forecasts 

for the quarters ahead.

Similar reviews are carried out at different levels of the Group prior 

to Senior Management’s review.

Audit & Risks Committee 

The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the 

Group’s internal controls and risk management systems. 

The Committee is presented with the conclusions and key actions 

from a selected number of audit missions throughout the year and 

works with management and external auditors to ensure that risks 

are identified and addressed in a timely and effective manner. 

The Head of Internal Audit has direct access to the Chairperson of 

the Audit & Risks Committee and meets with her on a regular basis 

throughout the year.

1st line of defense: Business and risk 
owners 

Among other responsibilities, Operating Divisions and Business 

Units have a duty to preserve good faith and trust. As business and 

risk owners, they must:

• Embed risk management into first line processes;

• Execute risk strategy in line with risk appetite and standards;

• Complete risk assessments and provide supporting data;

• Identify and control risks relating to their own environment, in 

compliance with the rules and procedures implemented and 

communicated by the Group functional department; and

• Design and implement remediation actions.

More specifically, Operating Division and Business Unit 

management supplement and adapt the Enterprise Risk 

Management framework drafted by Group management, by 

drawing up detailed policies and internal control procedures which 

comply with the relevant laws, regulations, and customer practices 

in the country they operate, to exercise control more effectively 

over risk specific to their local market and culture.

2nd line of defense: Group Risk 
Management, Internal Control, Risk 
Overseers 

Group Risk Management 

In the current context of an acceleration towards a more complex 

and fragmented world, the Group has engaged in a restructuring of 

its Enterprise Risk Management team, with the help of experts. It 

started in 2021, with most of the deployment having taken place in 

2022 and continuing in 2023. The objective is to strengthen the 

overall risk management at Schneider Electric, with a more robust 

Enterprise Risk Management team to implement and deploy 

advanced mechanisms, support the first and second lines of 

defense, and consolidate and report to Senior Management and 

Audit & Risk Committee. It will ensure that the maturity level and 

effectiveness of the governance and organization, management 

systems, processes and controls, and communication and training 

will all increase. 

Engaging in this journey until 2024, the Group expect to reach 

optimized maturity level in the way it develops and maintains a 

Group risk appetite framework. 2022 has been a year of 

deployment with standardized risk reviews engaged for most of the 

Group’s risk categories and geographical zones. It has resulted in 

an increased risk management maturity, and a consolidation of the 

risk exposure at the corporate level. The deployment will continue 

in 2023, with risk reviews done in a more robust and systematic 

way, while also taking care of subsidiaries.

The Enterprise Risk Management framework is deployed by the 

Group Risk Management department, which reports to Senior 

Management and sits within the Governance function. The Group 

Risk Management department is responsible for:

• The creation, deployment, and maintenance of the Enterprise 

Risk Management framework;

• The planning and execution of risk reviews across various 

Group entities; and

• The consolidation, in comprehensive reports, of the risks 

identified and assessed, of the Group’s level of mitigation, and 

of the roadmaps in place to reduce the risk exposure and 

increase preparedness.

This framework relies on a network of Risk Overseers (in charge of 

supervising a specific risk category) and risk owners (in charge of 

managing risks efficiently with the support of all assets provided). 

The Group Risk Management team engages with these 

stakeholders and supports them to increase their risk management 

maturity by driving several types of assessments and by evolving 

standardized methodologies.

The Group Risk Management department strives to not only 

manage event triggered risks, but rather to maximize value through 

more informed and calculated risk taking. With this mandate, it 

studies strategic issues and long-term strategy and continuously 

monitors emerging trends, risks, and opportunities, sometimes with 

the support of risk intelligence companies.

Internal Control 

In close collaboration with Risk Overseers and the Group Risk 

Management team, the Internal Control function uses a risk-based 

approach to define the key controls to be embedded in the 

processes and to monitor the effectiveness of the controls.

The Internal Control department reports to the Group Chief 

Accounting Officer. It had an average of 40 internal controllers in 

2022, with a central team leading and co-ordinating the Group 

Internal Control activities and a network of Internal Controllers for 

day-to-day operations. The main objectives of Internal Control 

department is to:

• Define key controls to be embedded in end-to-end processes 

following a risk-based approach in close collaboration with Risk 

Overseers and subject matter experts – in line with the 

recommendations of the French Financial Market Authority 

(Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF)) reference framework;

• Ensure internal control is anchored in the managerial practices 

for a better control environment. Drive self-assessment 

campaign, accuracy of controls, self-assessment, and 

compliance to minimize risks and protect assets;

• Monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls and 

support timely remediation of deficiencies in a sustainable 

manner;

• Partner with operations to increase standardization of key 

controls across the Group for effective and efficient operations; 

and

• Support design and implementation of anti-corruption and 

bribery controls.

Risk Overseers 

The various Group functional departments and Risk Overseers 

assist the Enterprise Risk Management team with the identification 

and evaluation of risks. Each department defines and rolls out risk 

management systems in its activity sector and ensures the 

consistency of actions undertaken in the Business Units and 

Operating Divisions. Risk Overseers and Global Functions assist all 

Group entities by facilitating the sharing of risk management and 

internal control best practice.

Risk Overseers are global leaders and experts overseeing risks 

within their scope.

Depending on the risk category, Risk Overseers must:

• Identify and manage the adoption of regulatory and legal 

standards;

• Initiate first risk identification as a base for risk-specific 

programs design;

• Own risk-specific policies and ensure proper deployment; 

specifically ensuring they have adequate representation in the 

Trust Charter, the Group’s Code of Conduct; 

• Define risk-specific processes and controls;

• Engage in the annual risk assessments run by the Group Risk 

Management team;

• Perform risk maturity self-assessments on a regular basis; and

• Define risk thresholds and review them regularly.

Global Finance department

The Global Finance department is actively involved in organizing 

control and ensuring compliance with financial procedures.

Within the department, the Reporting and Consolidation unit plays 

a key role in the internal control system by:

• Drafting and updating instructions designed to ensure that 

statutory and management accounting practices are consistent 

throughout the Group and compliant with applicable regulations;

• Organizing period-end closing procedures; and

• Analyzing performance and tracking the achievement of targets 

assigned to the Operating Divisions and Business Units.

The Reporting and Consolidation unit is responsible for:

• The proper application of Group accounting principles and 

policies;

• The integrity of the consolidation system database;

• The quality of accounting and financial processes and data;

• Training for finance staff by developing and leading specific 

seminars on the function; and

• Drafting, updating, and distributing the necessary documents 

for producing quality information.

The Reporting and Consolidation unit drafts and updates:

• A glossary of terms used by the Reporting and Consolidation 

unit, including a definition of each term;

• The chart of accounts for reporting;

• A Group statutory and management accounting standards 

manual, which includes details of debit/credit pairings;

• A Group reporting procedures manual and a system users 

guide;

• A manual describing the procedures to be followed to integrate 

newly acquired businesses in the Group reporting process;

• An intercompany reconciliation procedures manual; and

• Account closing schedules and instructions.

The Reporting and Consolidation unit monitors the reliability of data 

from subsidiaries and conducts monthly reviews of the various 

Business Units’ primary operations and performance.

Within the Global Finance department, the Tax team oversees tax 

affairs to provide comprehensive management of these risks.

The Financing and Treasury department is responsible for:

• Centralized management of cash and long-term Group 

financing;

• Centralized management of currency risk and non-ferrous 

metals risk;

• Monitoring of Group trade accounts receivable risk and the 

definition of the credit policy to be implemented;

• The distribution of rules for financial risk management and the 

security of payments:

 − define guidelines and contribute to the definition of Key 

Internal Control indicators relating to treasury and credit 

management,

 − review the related risks of complex projects as a subject 

matter expert,

 − select Group tools for credit, trade, and cash management; 

and

• The annual financial review meetings with the Group companies 

to assess the financial structures, financial risk management, as 

well as capital allocation.

Procedures for managing financial risk are described in “Key risks 

and opportunities” on page 314

Other Global Functions 

In addition to specific processes or bodies such as the Group 

Acquisitions Committee for making and implementing strategic 

decisions within the Global Finance department (see above), 

Schneider Electric centralizes certain matters through dedicated 

Global Functions, thus combining decision making and risk 

management at the corporate level.

A technology community, namely the Chief Technology Officers 

(CTO) community, grouping all Divisional and Business Unit Chief 

Technology Officers as well as key Corporate Technology functions 

involved in Offer Creation & Research, meets on a regular basis to 

ensure cross-divisional co-ordination in setting the strategic 

direction for innovation and driving end-to-end architectures, and 

defining next generation platforms and systems. Additionally, this 

community partners closely with the senior business leaders. This 

has been done to ensure a simple structure so that technology can 

be close to business and to maintain consistency across all 

Divisions of Schneider Electric.

The Human Resources department is responsible for deploying 

and ensuring the application of procedures and compliance with 

HR regulations concerning employee development, promoting 

diversity, and well-being. The department is also responsible for 

establishing guidelines on rewards and compensation, hiring, on 

and off boarding, and learning, amongst other human resources-

related duties.

The Procurement department within the Supply Chain function is 

responsible for establishing guidelines concerning the Procurement 

department’s structuring and procedures, relationships between 

buyers and vendors, and procedures governing product quality, 

level of service, and compliance with environmental and safety 

standards. 

Global Functions also issue, adapt, and distribute policies, target 

procedures, and instructions to Business Units and individuals 

assigned to handle their specific duties. Global Functions have 

correspondents who work with the Internal Control department to 

establish and update the Key Internal Controls deployed across the 

Group.

3rd line of defense: Internal Audit

In accordance with professional standards governing this activity, 

Internal Audit independently assesses the effectiveness of internal 

control and risk management procedures given that, irrespective of 

how well they are implemented and how strictly they are deployed, 

these procedures can only provide reasonable assurance – and 

not an absolute guarantee – against all risks.

The Internal Audit department reports to Senior Management. It 

had an average headcount of 20 global auditors and 26 regional 

auditors in 2022. The internal auditors are responsible for ensuring 

that, at the level of each Business Unit, Global Function, or 

Operational Entity in the countries where the Group is operating:

• The identification and control of risks is performed and relevant 

remediation is put in place;

• Significant financial, management, and operating information is 

accurate and reliable;

• Compliance with laws and regulations and with the Group’s 

policies, standards, and procedures is ensured;

• Compliance with the instructions of the Chairman & CEO is 

ensured;

• Acquisition of resources is carried out at a competitive cost, and 

their protection is ensured;

• Expenses are properly engaged and monitored; and

• Correct integration and control of acquisitions are ensured.

An annual internal audit plan is drawn up based on a combination 

of a risk-based and audit universe coverage-based approach. The 

risk-based dimension is embedding risk and control concerns 

identified by Senior Management, taking into account the results of 

the Group Enterprise Risk Management system, the outcome of 

past audits, the results of Key Internal Control self-assessments 

returned by the Business Units, and other indicators such as the 

evolution of a set of financial metrics, the Corruption Perception 

Index, and the recent replacement of holders of key managerial 

roles as the case may be. When necessary, the audit plan is 

adjusted during the year to include special requests from Senior 

Management.

After each internal audit, a report is issued setting out the auditors’ 

findings and recommendations for the Business Unit, Global 

Function, or Operational Entity audited. The management of 

audited entities or audited domains is requested to define for each 

recommendation an action plan aiming at implementing corrective 

actions. Measures are taken to monitor implementation of the 

recommendations and specific follow up audits are conducted if 

necessary.

3.3 Risk management mechanisms

3.3.1 One unique risk taxonomy is established to have  
a common risk language
One of the core assets of the Group risk management practice is a unique risk taxonomy, used by the different domains within the 

organization (Sales Regions, Business Units, Global Functions). It is key to ensure all Group entities speak the same risk language and 

collaborate efficiently on decreasing the risk exposure. This document is updated once a year based on the relevance and characteristics 

of identified risks in a business context. The taxonomy contains several risk classification levels, described in the illustration below.

Each risk is mapped to the pieces of the risk flywheel (see section 3.3.3, page 301) to ensure there are no gaps in the Group monitoring and 

mitigation of the risk universe.

3.3.2 Different mechanisms to identify, assess, and 
mitigate risks
The Group recognizes that each risk nature is unique, and therefore requires a unique approach in the way risks within each nature are 

identified, assessed, monitored, and mitigated. The figure below brings a few definitions and examples for each risk nature and shows the 

parameters that allow to differentiate them: expected reward for risk, and controllability.

Figure 3: Three risk nature and their unique approaches

Expected reward for risk

(Value for the organization. to take on risk)

Controllability

(Ability of organization. 

to reduce the 

uncertainties creating 

risks)

Trend driven risk

Risk resulting from organizational  
strategic and operational choices  

intended to generate value
Or

Risk resulting from long term business,  
market, political and economic disruptions

(e.g. sustainability as a business,  

economic cycles)Event triggered risk

Risk originating from uncontrollable  
and unavoidable external factors

(e.g. Cyber attacks,  

workplace disruptions, frauds)

Management  
practice risk

Risk resulting from day-to-day  
operations, behaviours and decisions  

from constituents

(e.g. P&L management,  

Rewards & benefits, IT systems)

Rewarded risk

Unrewarded risk

3.3 Risk management mechanisms

For the trend-driven risks, the objective  

is to reduce the business impact cost-

effectively and prepare to turn a disrupted 

environment into opportunities. We identify, 

assess, and monitor the risks through 

frequent organization leaders’ and external 

stakeholders’ interviews. This is 

complemented with specific strategy 

cadences.

For the event triggered risks, the 

objective is to reduce the risk exposure 

and increase the level of preparedness. 

Examples of the assets used to achieve 

this goal include: crisis management and 

business continuity planning, strong 

policies and procedures adoption, and 

continuous risk and incidents monitoring.

For management practice risks,  

the objective is to avoid or eliminate 

occurrences cost-effectively with a risk 

culture and compliance model embedded 

in Operating Divisions, strong policies and 

procedures adoption, and an effective set 

of internal controls.

3.3.3 Each Risk Overseer 
is in charge of moving the 
risk flywheel for his/her 
respective domain

Risk taxonomy

The Group established a unique risk taxonomy to have a common 

language with all stakeholders. All risk categories included in the 

risk taxonomy are mapped to a Risk Overseer who is responsible 

for all assets and processes around the risk flywheel (see figure 

below). The risk taxonomy is reviewed once per year, with inputs 

from the three lines of defense.

Trust Charter

The Trust Charter is the Group’s Code of Conduct. Each section is 

mapped to the risk taxonomy and has the goal, among others, to 

bring a level of awareness to employees that will contribute to 

decreasing the Group risk exposure. See more details about the 

Trust Charter in Chapter 2, section 2.2.1.

Policies

A policy is an official statement and process description produced 

and supported by the leadership team and states where the 

organization stands on important topics or issues. They create the 

backbone of an organization and are important for all stakeholders 

to enable and reinforce trust. Each Risk Overseer is responsible for 

ensuring needed policies are written and published, then, that they 

are implemented, communicated, and their implementation is being 

monitored. See more details about policies in Chapter 2, section 

2.1.7.

Mandatory PMI1 tasks

The Enterprise Risk Management framework applies not only to the 

Group’s core and legacy activities, but also to recently acquired 

companies as part of the post-acquisition integration process. Trust 

Standards are defined to ensure the integration process is 

addressing risks and compliance matters, meeting legal 

obligations, creating a more standardized back-end, and providing 

clarity regarding integration requirements across the portfolio of 

companies.

Key Internal Controls

The Group uses a set of internal controls that is reviewed and 

updated annually, with the feedback of the Risk Overseers and 

subject matter experts (among others). One of the goals of internal 

controls is to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation put in place 

to address a risk. For the controls that are risk specific, the 

outcome of the yearly self-assessment campaign is twofold: 

provide a high-level view of the situation to the top management 

and Risk Overseers, and provide action plans to the risk owners to 

improve their mitigation, if relevant.

Key risk metrics

Risk metrics are defined to measure the Group risk exposure for 

each risk category and type. They are defined by the Risk 

Overseers and reviewed on a regular basis. Defining risk 

thresholds helps to foster a risk centric culture and take business 

decisions based on risk appetite.

Risk reviews and yearly risk assessments 

The Group’s entities perform frequent risk assessments. 

There are three types of assessments:

• Zone or country risk reviews, where the leadership team and 

risk owners review the top risks affecting their territory and legal 

entities, as well as the mitigation in place.

• Function or risk category reviews, where the leadership team 

and Risk Overseers review the risks affecting their domain of 

expertise, as well as the mitigation they put in place.

• Leadership risk assessment, also called risk matrix, where the 

leadership team is interviewed about the full Group risk 

universe, to gain an understanding of the perception of the risk 

exposure and level of mitigation.

Additionally, the Internal Audit and Internal Control departments 

perform consolidated reviews and audits aiming, in particular, to 

assess the internal control framework and risk management system 

effectiveness.

Risk maturity assessments

In a spirit of continuous improvement, Risk Overseers perform risk 

maturity self-assessments on a regular basis. It helps drive 

constant improvements to the ways in which the risk is managed 

within the Group. Among other things, it ensures the Group takes 

the right steps towards an optimized risk maturity level including:

• Governance and organization with dynamic resource allocation;

• Management systems are aligned and optimized across all 

three lines of defense;

• Processes and controls rely on digital and advanced analytics 

to optimize effectiveness and efficiency; and

• Communication and training are adapted to specific needs, with 

a measured impact.

3.3.4 Risk identification 
and management 

General risks at the Group level

The Group Risk Management department conduct interviews to 

update the list of general risks at Group level each year. In 2022, 

around 40 of the Group’s top leaders were interviewed in addition 

to external analysts and Board members.

The risks identified through these interviews are ranked by a risk 

score (comprising impact and likelihood of occurrence) and level of 

mitigation.

In complement of the risks identified through interviews, the Group 

Risk Management function also consolidates all the risks identified 

and assessed through the category risk reviews and zone risk 

reviews. A consensus is then reached on the Group’s major risks 

for which control, monitoring, and mitigation will be prioritized.

Risk factors related to the Group’s business, as well as procedures 

for managing and reducing those risks, are described in “Key risks 

and opportunities” in section 3.4 on page 304. 

The results of the yearly risk assessments mentioned in section 

3.3.3 (risk matrix, risk reviews) and the analysis of changes from 

one year to the next contribute to the development of an internal 

audit plan for the following year. Around two-thirds of the risk 

categories identified in the Group’s risk matrix are audited by the 

Internal Audit department over a period of five to six years to 

assess action plans for managing and reducing these risks.

Local risks at the Business Unit or 
Operating Division level 

Local risks related to the Company’s business are managed first 

and foremost by the Business Units in conjuction with the 

Operating Divisions, based on Group guidelines (particularly via 

the Key Internal Controls). Each subsidiary is responsible for 

implementing procedures that provide an adequate level of internal 

control.

The Operating Divisions implement cross-functional action plans 

for key risks related to the Company’s business identified as being 

recurrent in the Business Units or as having a material impact at the 

Group level, as appropriate. The internal control system is adjusted 

to account for these risks.

Specific risks related to Projects 

The Projects Risk Management stakeholders define and implement 

principles and tools designed to manage contractual (such as 

limitation of liabilities), technical (such as technical discrepancy 

versus customer specifications), and financial risks (such as factors 

that may impact margin at solution execution phase).

The network of Project Risk Managers assesses the risks and 

mitigations related to major projects in conjunction with the subject 

matter experts and Tender Managers during the preparation of 

offers. Project Risk Managers then provide a comprehensive, 

360-degree view on project risk and mitigations to support the 

opportunity approval process.

Management of risks by the Legal 
department

The Legal department oversees the legal affairs and manages the 

risks relating to legal matters.

The Financial Risk Insurance team contributes to the internal 

control system by defining and deploying a Group-wide insurance 

strategy, as defined in “Insurance”, section 3.5 on page 319. The 

insurance strategy includes the identification and quantification of 

the main insurable risks, the determination of levels of retention, 

and the cost benefit analysis of the transfer options. The Risk and 

Insurance department also defines, proposes, and implements 

action plans to prevent these risks and protect assets.

Management of risks by the Global Security 
department 

The Group’s Global Security department defines corporate 

governance regarding loss prevention in the area of willful acts 

against property and people. 

The Global Security Group Committee was created in 2017, uniting 

the Zone Security Leaders. Some of these leaders report directly to 

the Global Security department and some to local management 

with functional reporting to Global Security. In close co-operation 

with the Compliance department and the Risk and Insurance 

department, Global Security is involved in assessing the nature of 

risk to our people, as well as defining adequate prevention and 

protection measures. 

Global Security provides support to local teams for any security 

issues (site audit, expatriates or local employee security, security 

on assignments, etc.). The team also: 

• Publishes internally, a table of “Country Risks” for use in security 

procedures that are mandatory for people traveling, expatriates, 

and local employees; 

• Provides daily co-ordination with the Group’s worldwide partner 

in the field of medical and security assistance (International SOS 

& Control Risks – start of contract in January 2011); 

• Organize, as needed, psychological support in some crisis 

context (Eutelmed – start of contract in April 2015). 

It brings its methodology to develop emergency plans (evacuation 

plans, crisis management plans, etc.) and co-ordinates the 

corporate crisis team (SEECC – Schneider Electric Emergency 

Coordination Center, created in 2009) each time that it is activated. 

Global Security also participates in crisis management, in 

managing the corporate crisis cell, and in supporting local entities 

(to limit the consequences of the occurrence of certain risks such 

as civil war, weather events, pandemics, attacks on people, 

terrorism, etc.). In addition, it regularly organizes Security Audits 

(R&D centers, head offices, sensitive plants, etc.). 

Global Security sits on the Group Operations Compliance 

Committee (previously named Fraud Committee) alongside the 

Compliance, Internal Audit, and Legal departments. Global 

Security supports internal investigators as well as contributing to 

the Group’s methodology and procedures to conduct investigations 

properly and in accordance with the law.

Management of cyber and product security 
and associated risks across Schneider 
Electric

The Cybersecurity and Product Security departments inside the 

Governance function define the Company’s cyber and product 

security strategies and approaches. The departments are 

accountable for protecting Schneider Electric’s business 

operations; securing the digital assets and offers for Schneider 

Electric and subsidiaries; managing the Cyber Risk Register; 

driving cybersecurity awareness across the Company; owning the 

creation, maintenance, and enforcement mechanisms of cyber and 

product security policies; ensuring the execution of cyber and 

product security initiatives across Schneider Digital functions and 

entities; and managing the Cybersecurity Incident Prevention, 

Detection, and Response process.

3.4 Key risks and opportunities

Principal risks

The Group risk inventory is organized in three categories and includes 18 key risks identified.

The key risks selected and presented below are the risks considered by the Group as specific to its business and identified as having the 

potential to affect its activity, its image, its financial situation, its results, or the achievement of its objectives.

However, the Group may be exposed to other non-specific risks, or risks of which it may not be aware, or risks of which it may be 

underestimating the potential consequences, or other risks that may not have been considered by the Group as being likely to have a 

material adverse impact on the Group, its business, financial condition, reputation, or outlook.

In each category, risks are assessed in terms of potential impact for the Group according to 3 levels (red, orange, green), the first one being 

the most likely to affect the Group. The assessment is the result of the process performed as part of the overall risk management 

mechanism described in “Risk identification and management”, section 3.3.4 on page 302. The impact considered for the assessment is 

the potential net impact which corresponds to the potential gross impact (financial/ human/ legal/ reputation), after having taken in 

consideration the current mitigation measures, as well as the probability of occurrence of this risk. The assessment by Schneider Electric of 

this level of materiality may be changed at any time, in particular should new facts, whether external or specific to the Group, come to light.

The identification and mitigation of the Groups’ key risks can reveal opportunities for growth, enabling strategic decision making and 

flexibility to move ahead with speed.

1. Event triggered risks

1.1 Risk of cybersecurity on Schneider Electric infrastructure and its digital 
ecosystem (including connected products used as a gateway to attack Group’s 
customers and partners) 

Risk description

Schneider Electric, like other organizations with a similar global 

footprint and presence, is exposed to the risk of cyberattacks and 

data privacy breaches. The Energy Management and Industrial 

Automation sectors, in particular, are becoming more digital with 

pervasive Internet of Things (IoT) usage and augmented data being 

major accelerators for mobility, the cloud, pervasive sensing, big 

data, and analytics.

As an industrial and technology company, the Group has IT and 

Operational Technology (OT) activities spread over dozens of R&D 

sites, and more than 200 production and logistic units. On those 

sites, OT systems have been converging more and more with IT 

systems, especially through the use of IoT, expanding the overall 

attack surface. 

The digitalization of products, including native connectivity, is 

increasing the exposure to cybersecurity risk, where connected 

products and digital offers (e.g., remotely managed services like 

“Advisor”) at Schneider Electric or customers’ sites could be used 

as a gateway for malicious cyberattacks. Additionally, the move 

from a product-centered business model to a service-oriented 

business model with software and augmented data naturally 

increases cybersecurity risks, such as data breaches and 

intellectual property theft.

Schneider Electric Exchange is an ecosystem collaboration 

platform with over 50,000 users, approximately 300 leverageable 

applications, more than 150 service providers, and around 100 

communities. These types of digital offers and platforms, if 

compromised, could negatively impact a customer’s business and 

consequently affect the service quality, profitability, and reputation 

of Schneider Electric.

Risk monitoring and management

To mitigate the risk of Schneider Electric’s connected products 

being used as a gateway to attack Group’s customers and 

partners, the Product & Systems Security Office (PSO) is reinforced 

with a strong mandate of developing products and securing the 

ecosystem in conformity with cybersecurity standards (such as the 

ISO 27000 suite and IEC 62443). As an illustration, the IoT Cloud 

Platform (EcoStruxure™ Technology Platform) has implemented 

controls that are mappable against the ISO 27001 standard.

Schneider Electric follows a Secure Development Lifecycle process 

to build cybersecurity into its products, even before the design 

stage. In 2019, security and privacy design were enhanced with a 

new Secure Development Lifecycle and certified to IEC 62443-4-1. 

Since 2020, all digital offers (mainly “Advisor” software suites) were 

assessed in the framework of digital security and privacy 

conformance.

Schneider Electric enforces digital security and privacy 

conformance for products, systems, software, platforms, 

applications, and digital offers through security reviews and, when 

applicable, the Digital Certification process.

Schneider Electric addresses cybersecurity vulnerabilities 

affecting products, software, and systems to support the security 

and safety of our customers. Schneider Electric works 

collaboratively with researchers, Cyber Emergency Response 

Teams (CERTs), and asset owners to ensure that accurate 

information is provided in a timely fashion to adequately protect 

customer installations. In case of a cyber incident, a process of 

response, connecting, and debriefing is organized with partners 

and customers.

In line with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework(1) with its five 

concurrent and continuous functions, Schneider Electric has five 

stages of risk management as follows: 

• Identify: Schneider Electric has identified cyber risks stemming

from main business scenarios(2) with its Cyber Risk Register,

including assets categories to be protected known as High-

Value Assets.

• Protect: Cyber threats are mitigated by implementing cyber

practices and capabilities, policy-driven controls, and enforcing

mechanisms. For example, the Group implemented a Data

Protection program, Source Code Management framework, and

System & Solution security program. Moreover, 99% of

employees were trained on cybersecurity in 2022. In addition,

specific employee categories (e.g., IT administrators, customer

facing employees) received mandatory trainings for risks linked

to their activity.

• Detect:

− Independent “reality checks” were performed: three

crosscutting internal audits and external assessments.

− Multiple cyber risk assessments were completed in 2022 by

the Group’s cybersecurity consulting partners.

• Respond: Global cyber incident management and response

process is in place. Events and incidents are monitored through

a Security Operations Center, driven jointly with the Group’s

partners.

• Recover: Schneider Electric’s posture is continuously revisited

and adapted through reality checks including emergency,

business, and IT recovery and improvement plans across the

Company. Furthermore, the Group is conducting regular crisis

simulation exercises on different scenarios.

1. Event triggered risks

1.2 Export controls

Risk description

International, foreign, and national export control laws and 

regulations govern the transfer of goods, services, and 

technologies within a country or between countries and/or their 

nationals. Elements that may trigger restrictions and licensing 

requirements may include, but are not limited to, countries, parties, 

product, and end-uses.

Schneider Electric being a multi-national corporation (MNC) with 

international operations spanning across more than 100 different 

countries worldwide, must constantly ensure full compliance to 

such laws and regulations by implementing a robust corporate 

export control compliance program. Any implications may result in 

a significant impact on the Group’s businesses, results, reputation, 

and financial position.

Albeit that Schneider Electric’s product portfolio only has a limited 

product range that may have dual-use goods features as well as 

non-dual-use goods (e.g., breakers) that may be used in sensitive 

applications; restriction or licensing requirements may apply to 

these products, especially if associated with politically sensitive 

countries and destinations.

Risk monitoring and management

Schneider Electric has comprehensive policies and processes to 

ensure compliance with applicable export control laws and 

regulations (Schneider Electric Export Control program) and to 

mitigate the above described risks. The Global Export Control 

Center of Excellence, as part of the Global Legal and Risk 

Management function, oversees the monitoring and enforcement of 

the Schneider Electric Export Control program. 

The Schneider Electric Export Control program may include, but is 

not limited to: embargo and restricted country, denied party, 

dual-use goods, and sensitive end-user screenings; incorporation 

of export control provision in the main sales and procurement 

contractual template; and conducting of regular awareness and 

online and classroom training sessions for all relevant Schneider 

Electric employees.

The Schneider Electric Export Control program will continue its 

enhancement and updates to ensure compliance with applicable 

export control laws and regulations.

1.3 Product quality

Risk description

Schneider Electric has more than 290,000 references produced in 

162 factories, spread across 40 countries around the world. 

Operating in essential industries, product quality and safety is a 

critical topic for the Group as product malfunctions or failures could 

result in Schneider Electric incurring liabilities for tangible or 

intangible damages, or personal injuries. The failure of a product, 

system, or solution may involve costs related to the product recall, 

result in new development expenditure, and consume technical 

and economic resources.

Schneider Electric’s products are also subject to multiple quality 

and safety controls and regulations and are governed by both 

national and supranational standards. New or more stringent 

standards or regulations could result in capital investment or costs 

of specific measures for compliance.

The above-mentioned costs could have a significant impact on the 

profitability and cash equivalent of the Group. The business 

reputation of Schneider Electric could also be negatively impacted. 

Indeed, the Group has been impacted by several recalls recently, 

more or less ranging from €10 million to €40 million, depending on 

the case.

Risk monitoring and management

In 2022, the Group launched a specific program called Quality 

Reinvention to continue to strengthen quality for design, 

manufacturing, supplier, and field tools and processes, and to 

settle “quality” inside of the Company culture. This is extended to 

all the value chain and leverages processes digitization across all 

entities that have an impact to quality. 

This program includes: 

• Launch of the new Quality Fundamentals for Design domain, to 

increase both robustness and reliability of new offers; CS&Q 

function puts a strong focus on stopping any launches that do 

not comply to quality standards. In addition, roles and 

responsibilities got better defined and the number of resources 

focused on design quality has greatly increased. 

• Unification of all manufacturing quality initiatives, fundamentals 

and principles into the Schneider Performance System; CS&Q 

function puts strong focus on the reduction of high-risk activities 

through fully automated and interlocked systems.

• Significant strengthening of supplier quality processes by 

adopting high maturity industry standards (i.e., APQP and IATF); 

CS&Q function strives to secure an ever more robust supplier, 

parts and supplies qualification process, and improved 

performance management.

• Expansion of the quality system into Field and Project Execution, 

to secure the right standards in this area.

To ensure that the culture of quality supports efforts being made, 

three main changes have been introduced: 1) Quality became part 

of our Trust Charter to make sure that everyone understands that a 

quality deviation could become a compliance issue; 2) Quality 

became an “essential” as part of the values that anchor our culture 

3) “Quality academy” is being created to allow learning of both, 

what is quality and non-quality, and to increase the technical 

knowledge of our teams.

1.4 Competition laws 

Risk description

Schneider Electric’s products are sold in markets worldwide and 

are subject to national and supranational competition laws and 

antitrust regulations.

Both currently or in the past, Group entities including, but not 

limited to, entities in Brazil, Pakistan, Belgium, France, and Spain 

have been directly or indirectly cited in antitrust proceedings or 

investigated.

In Pakistan and Belgium, the Group inherited, and subsequently 

discontinued, local operations from AREVA. These operations were 

investigated and sanctioned by the World Bank and the Belgium 

Competition Authority respectively.

In France, further to on-site investigations conducted in 2018 

concerning electrical distribution activities in France, Schneider 

Electric SE, received on July 4, 2022, a statement of objections 

(notification de griefs) from the French Competition Authority (FCA) 

alleging that the pricing autonomy of some distributors in the 

French market would have been limited, in breach of competition 

rules.

Schneider Electric strongly disagrees with the allegations of the 

statement of objections and submitted its response to the FCA on 

October 4, 2022.

This statement of objections is the first step of an adversarial 

procedure and is without prejudice to the final assessment that will 

be made independently by the board (College) of the FCA. 

In Spain, the local subsidiary was indicted for anti-competitive 

behavior related to a previously owned subsidiary. The 

investigation was concluded in February 2020 without any 

significant consequence for the Group.

Risk monitoring and management

The whistleblowing system of Trust Line for employees and external 

stakeholders such as suppliers is managed to identify any 

inappropriate practice or behavior with competitors or business 

partners that may be reported.

Furthermore, internal controls and internal audit missions have 

been reinforced on compliance risks, including in respect of 

competition and antitrust risks.

A revised Compliance Due Diligence program for mergers and 

acquisitions was issued to strengthen upfront identification of 

compliance issues with potential acquisition targets.

The Group launched the Trust Charter in September 2021, with 

reinforced guidance regarding competition and antitrust rules, and 

issued various other policies and directives related to competition 

and anti-corruption.

1.5 Corruption linked to B2B and project business

Risk description

The exposure of the Group to corruption risk has been increasing 

for several years, due to the expansion of the Group’s activities in 

new economies, especially in Asia and Africa, through organic 

growth, and mergers and acquisitions.

The business model of the Group relies on a large ecosystem of 

partners, including more than 53,000 suppliers throughout the 

world representing a procurement volume in excess of €16 billion, 

and also, resellers and distributors. This ecosystem may represent 

a risk for the Group, being accountable for activities performed on 

its behalf, and in regards to potential conflicts of interest or 

unethical solicitations.

In addition, the Group is participating in complex projects involving 

a large range of partners in sectors at risk, such as oil and gas, and 

with end-users from the public sector in countries at risk.

Over the past years, the increase of law enforcement by public 

authorities, higher press coverage of fines imposed on companies, 

and new regulations requiring a strong compliance program have 

significantly changed the potential impact of corruption risks.

Risk monitoring and management

Schneider Electric has created an Ethics & Compliance 

department, chaired by a dedicated Chief Compliance Officer, 

notably in charge of defining an anti-corruption program based on 

three inseparable pillars.

First, Senior Management sets Schneider Electric’s zero tolerance 

for corruption and promotes a culture of integrity throughout the 

Group and its operations. In addition, middle management walks 

the talk by complying with rules, spreading the right message in 

their teams, and supporting the reporting of misconducts.

Second, a Group-wide Ethics & Compliance risk assessment was 

carried-out in the second half of 2021, which led to regional and 

Group level risk maps on corruption matters. Related action plans 

were deployed in 2021 and 2022. 

Third, the identified risks are managed by means of effective 

measures and procedures:

• Code of Conduct and policies – As stated in our Trust Charter, 

Schneider Electric’s Code of Conduct, and Anti-Corruption 

Policy, Schneider Electric is committed to comply with all 

applicable laws and regulations, and applies a zero-tolerance 

policy towards corruption. Two operational policies complete 

the set: Gifts & Hospitality Policy and Conflict of Interest Policy.

• Training and awareness – 97% of employees exposed to 

corruption risks have been trained thanks to the yearly 

mandatory Anti-corruption e-learning. The content of this 

e-learning is updated each year.

1. Event triggered risks

1.5 Corruption linked to B2B and project business (continued)

• Third parties’ integrity – Schneider Electric has put in place a 

Business Agent Policy and related procedures for assessing its 

intermediaries. In 2022, 100% of direct customers have been 

screened. A pilot was also launched to have an automatic 

real-time screening of all direct customers. Moreover, the Group 

is working to screen its vendors and started an initial screening 

of its strategic direct vendors in 2022. Moreover, all compliance-

related aspects are part of the due diligence undertaken for 

mergers and acquisitions, in line with the specific M&A 

Compliance framework put in place in February 2020.

• Specific accounting controls – Schneider Electric has 

developed accounting control procedures to ensure that books, 

records, and accounts are not used to hide fraud. Since June 

2021, work has been initiated to strengthen specific anti-

corruption controls for a defined set of sensitive-judged 

accounts and transactions.

• Whistleblowing – A global whistleblowing system, available to 

employees and external stakeholders, is also managed to 

combat this risk. In 2022, 645 employee and 74 external 

stakeholder alerts have been received and managed through 

follow-up inquiries.

• Corrective actions – Deficiencies associated with the 

implementation of procedures are analyzed to identify their 

cause and correct them.

• Monitoring and audit – Second-level controls and internal audit 

missions were reinforced on compliance risks with several 

audits performed.

1.6 Human rights and safety issues through the value chain

Risk description

The exposure of the Group to human rights and health and safety 

risks has been increasing for several years, due to the expansion of 

the Group’s activities in countries with lesser regulatory framework 

regarding human rights. Some specific topics are emerging quite 

rapidly, for example, as the context (global warming, famine, war, 

geopolitics etc.) is pushing people to cross borders and to work 

elsewhere, migrant workers protection is becoming a key topic for 

companies.

Schneider Electric’s procurement volume represents more than €16 

billion with more than 53,000 suppliers. As part of the Duty of 

Vigilance program in the supply chain, Schneider Electric has 

performed a risk analysis through its network of suppliers and 

identified potential risks on several topics including human rights 

and health and safety.

The occurrence of these risks with third parties may result in the 

following impacts on Schneider Electric:

Reputation

Schneider Electric’s image may be negatively impacted by third 

parties who:

• Do not respect human rights or safety rules for their workers; 

and/or

• Are conducting business in a non-compliant or illegal manner.

Disruption of supply chain

It may occur due to:

• Short-term termination of relations with a supplier; and/or

• Events resulting from a lack of safety or insufficient protective 

measures (e.g., fire prevention) that may affect the supply of 

components.

Legal

Over the past two years, laws regarding human rights protection, 

such as modern slavery matters in Australia, the European Union’s 

new framework on restrictive measures against serious human 

rights violations and abuses, or the German Supply Chain Act, 

have increased. Higher coverage of fines imposed on companies, 

and new regulations requiring a strong compliance program have 

significantly changed the impact of human rights and health and 

safety violations risks.

Schneider Electric expects that the exposure will continue to grow, 

in reference to the current drafting of a Duty of Vigilance directive 

at European level, as well as the European Action Plan on Human 

Rights and Democracy 2020-2024, which sets out ambitions and 

priorities for the next five years in this field.

In addition, the current discussions on human rights due diligence 

framework at United Nations level, supported by the Global 

Compact that Schneider Electric is part of, will certainly increase 

the pressure on the private sector to tackle human rights 

challenges in the supply chain.

2022 specific events

The competent court regarding Duty of Vigilance (DoV) cases was 

confirmed on December 22, 2021, by the French High Court. The 

Paris judicial court will have jurisdiction over such cases, which is 

composed of dedicated professional lawyers. Regarding the cases 

related to non-compliance with the DoV, there has been no update 

on the substance of the cases.

In 2022, four new cases have been opened regarding non-

compliance to the French DoV. These cases concerned freedom of 

association, social and environmental rights, or human rights 

violations. At the end of 2022, seven litigations and six formal 

notices were pending regarding the French DoV.

The European Commission published a draft proposal for the 

European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive on 

February 23, 2022. This directive should be adopted in 2023 and 

enter into force in 2024. The text of this European Directive is very 

close to the French DoV law and will concern Schneider Electric’s 

operations and supply chain (potentially Tier 2 suppliers and 

above). Regarding the actual draft of this Directive, approximately 

50,000 companies based in Europe should be concerned; in 

comparison, approximatively 260 companies are concerned by the 

French DoV.

Risk monitoring and management

Human rights are part of the Ethics & Compliance program which is 

managed by the Ethics & Compliance Committee and the Legal 

and Corporate Citizenship departments. More specifically, human 

rights are managed by the Corporate Citizenship department with 

the support of the Ethics & Compliance Committee in regards to 

risk identification through risk assessment as well as risk detection, 

with the whistleblowing system available for employees and for 

external stakeholders.

Regarding training, e-learning on the Trust Charter is mandatory for 

all employees and, in 2022, focused on human rights and health 

and safety amongst other ethics and compliance topics. 93% of 

employees completed the training by the end of 2022.

Suppliers are selected according to the “Schneider Electric Supplier 

Quality Management” system, which includes sustainable 

development criteria weighing 15% of the total evaluation of a supplier. 

These criteria include human rights and health and safety topics.

In 2019, Schneider Electric organized the Global Suppliers Day. 

During this day, the Trust Charter was introduced to suppliers.

As part of the Group’s five-year objective for 2021 – 2025, strategic 

suppliers are requested to submit themselves to an ISO 26000 

evaluation. Consistent with a continuous improvement effort, these 

suppliers have achieved on average a +6.3 points increase 

between 2018 and 2020 and a +1.2 points increase in 2022 to 

reach an average score of 58.6.

Schneider Electric has built a supplier vigilance plan in which risky 

suppliers are identified using criteria that take into account the 

geographical location of the supplier, the technologies, and the 

processes used. An audit plan is then built to perform either on-site 

supplier audits or remote self-assessments. When non-

conformances are identified, corrective actions are deployed.

The suppliers are then re-audited to verify that the actions have 

remediated the non-conformances. In 2022, in the scope of 2021 

– 2025 Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) objective #17 

“4,000 suppliers assessed under our ‘Vigilance Program’”, the 

Group conducted 223 on-site audits and 657 remote self-

assessments. At the end of 2022, 94% of non-conformances from 

2021 have been closed. The supplier vigilance plan also includes 

an internal training program for Schneider Electric Procurement 

teams and workshops with suppliers. The Group has also defined, 

in 2022, a specific program with the objective to ensure that 100% 

of Schneider Electric’s strategic suppliers provide decent work to 

their employees, in the scope of Schneider Sustainability Impact 

(SSI) indicator #6. The program launched in 2022. Schneider 

Electric is also currently developing a program to ensure “social 

excellence” for the Group’s suppliers.

1.7 Counterparty risk

Risk description

The Group has a particularly wide international presence (more 

than 115 countries), with revenue almost equally spread across the 

four regions (Asia Pacific, Western Europe, North America, Rest of 

the World), and 41% of the revenue generated in new economies.

The Group is therefore facing multiple counterparty risks, as any 

economic downturn could lead to local liquidity issues with 

consequences in terms of cash collection and delay of payments 

from the customers, affecting adversely the Group’s cash 

conversion rate.

The Group is also exposed to counterparty risks coming from 

financial operation with financial institutions. It includes activities 

such as deposits and asset management and transactions implying 

flows in future value dates.

As of December 31, 2022, 13% of trade receivables were overdue, 

of which 3.5% by more than three months (refer to Note 16 in “Notes 

to the consolidated financial statements”, section 5 of Chapter 5, 

page 456).

Risk monitoring and management

Financial transactions are entered into with carefully selected 

counterparties and adapted terms and conditions are included in 

contracts with customers. Banking counterparties are chosen 

according to the customary criteria, including the credit rating 

issued by an independent rating agency. Group policy consists of 

diversifying counterparty risks and periodic controls are performed 

to check compliance with the related rules.

In addition, the Group takes out substantial credit insurance and 

uses other types of guarantees (letters of credit and bank 

guarantees) to limit the risk of losses on trade accounts receivable.

As of December 31, 2022, the amount of the provision for 

receivables impairment is EUR 489 million (as described in Note 16 

in “Notes to the consolidated financial statements”, section 5 of 

Chapter 5, page 456).

1. Event triggered risks

1.8 Currency exchange risk

Description of risk of fluctuation of 
exchange rates

The Group’s international operations and the particularly wide 

international presence expose it to the risk of fluctuation of 

exchange rates.

Fluctuations in exchange rates between the reporting currencies of 

the Group entities and the currencies of transactions can have an 

impact on the Group’s results and distort year-on-year performance 

comparisons. The same applies to the fluctuations between euro 

and the reporting currencies, in a more significant proportion.

The main exposure of the Group in terms of currency exchange 

risks is related to the US dollar, Chinese yuan, and currencies 

linked to the US dollar.

In 2022, revenue in foreign currencies amounted EUR 27.29 billion, 

including around EUR 9.9 billion in US dollars and EUR 4.8 billion in 

Chinese yuan.

The Group estimates that in the current structure of its operations, a 

10% appreciation of the euro compared to the US dollar would 

have a translation effect of around minus EUR 147 million on 

adjusted EBITA.

The result of exchange gains and losses of 2022 amounts to EUR 

-27 million (as described in Note 7 in “Notes to the consolidated 

financial statements”, section 5 of Chapter 5, page 446).

Monitoring and management of the risk of 
fluctuations in exchange rates

The Group manages its exposure to transactional currency risk to 

reduce the sensitivity of earnings to changes in exchange rates. 

Receivables and payables of the Group’s subsidiaries 

denominated in currency other than their functional currency are 

hedged primarily by means of rebalancing assets and liabilities per 

currency (natural hedge).

More than 20 currencies are involved, with the US dollar, the 

Chinese yuan, the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, 

Australian dollar and Swedish krona representing the most 

significant sources of those risk.

Depending on market conditions, risks in the main currencies may 

be hedged based on cash flow forecasting using contracts that 

expire in 12 months or less.

The financial instruments used to hedge exposure to fluctuations  

in exchange rates are described in Note 23 in “Notes to the 

consolidated financial statements”, section 5 of Chapter 5,  

page 468.

Description of risk of deliverability of 
currencies

The Group has a particularly wide international presence (more 

than 115 countries), which consists in purchasing and selling, 

intragroup and outside group, goods and services in various 

currencies.

The Group is therefore facing the risk that the currencies of 

purchasing and selling are the subject of interdictions or 

restrictions linked to geopolitical contexts, access to foreign 

currencies, currency control, or other reasons. The Group 

estimates that in the current structure of its operations, such 

limitations and interdictions might arise from some countries with 

emerging economies. 

Monitoring and management of the risk of 
deliverability in currencies

The Group policy consists in the diversification enabled by the 

widespread geographical presence and follow up of such risk to 

reduce it, when needed through repatriation of cash exposed.

2. Trend driven risks

2.1 Operational disruption due to global political and economic disruptions

Risk description

Stable trade is beneficial for economic growth. Trends of increased 

mercantilism is leading towards possibly long-term regionalization 

of trade around the United States, China, Russia, Europe, and India 

poles. Regionalized, rather than globally balanced government 

regulations and policies on digitization, circularity, carbon, supply 

chain management, and others could handicap Schneider’s offer 

development efficiency. This may force the Group to significantly 

adapt operations, for example through redundant efforts, and result 

in negative impacts on the Group’s profitability. In addition to the 

trade regionalization trend, technology decoupling, specifically 

between the United States and China, has been observed through 

increased regulations.

In addition to the global trends above, the Group acknowledges 

upcoming potential challenges caused by a lingering energy crisis 

and monetary tightening, negatively impacting economic activities 

across the world. It will result, to a degree to be determined, in 

heightened social, political, and economic risks.

As a global company operating in more than 115 countries, 

Schneider is increasingly impacted by this acceleration of regional 

(versus global) trade and new technology policies are putting 

pressure on supply chains in the forms of both tariff and non-tariff 

barriers.

The armed conflict in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions is another 

example of challenges the Group is facing and could face in the 

future in other contexts. This is covered in “Specific events 2022”, 

on page 318.

As such, trade wars and sanctions compliance could disrupt 

Schneider Electric’s operations and global supply chain. The 

above-mentioned combination of both nationally orientated tariff 

and non-tariff burden could increase the cost to market and 

potentially adversely impact Group profitability. It also increases 

quality risks as the Group could be forced to work with new 

suppliers.

Risk monitoring and management

To mitigate the risk on supply chain efficiencies, tariff impacts, and 

sanctions compliance, Schneider Electric has implemented a 

multi-hub organization. The Group has R&D and supply chain 

activities, suppliers, and commercial networks in the main 

international hubs, which are North America, Europe, India and 

Asia. In this multi-local context, Schneider Electric can rebalance 

its activities across geographies. A strong focus is given to 

duplicating active R&D, factories, and suppliers in different hubs 

through a global orchestration, in order to be resilient and flexible 

when needed. 

This setup has proved pertinent as the Group has demonstrated a 

solid resilience over the past years’ crises, from the COVID-19 

pandemic in 2020 to the armed conflict in Ukraine in 2022, and the 

increased decoupling between the United States and China over 

the last years. 

Schneider Electric uses prospective scenarios planning, focusing 

on geopolitics and trade. While the pace of external changes 

continues at a historically unprecedented scale regionally, global 

teams are working across stakeholders from Business Units, 

Regional Operations, and Transversal Functions (i.e., Finance, 

Supply Chain, Legal, Marketing, R&D, HR).

2.2 New competitive landscape on energy, technologies, and business models

Risk description

Schneider Electric operates to make the most of our energy and 

resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all, which 

attracts new players and creates a new competitive landscape. 

Indeed, the energy industry is undergoing major transformations 

and disruptions driven by the following main trends:

• A net-zero world: Pressure on climate change and sustainability 

call for a change in business practices;

• Resource scarcity and resource security: Increased demand for 

energy efficiency solutions with necessary acceleration for 

agility, resilience, transformation, circular and shared economy, 

and the creation of new business models; 

• An All Digital world: ISncreasing influence of digital giants and 

software players; and

• An All Electric world: Oil majors urged to reduce their impacts 

on carbon emissions.

In this context, Schneider Electric’s competition landscape is 

evolving, and the Group can now see:

• On one hand, some digital giants, software players, or large 

companies such as energy majors positioning themselves – 

directly or indirectly – as providers of energy efficiency, which 

may compete with the digital services Value Propositions 

currently developed by the Group. 

• On the other hand, more local experts adopted by local markets 

eager to interact with agnostic solutions and interconnect 

seamlessly with other players.

It is also noted that the competitive landscape is being shaken by 

increased challenges for global companies, resulting in:

• Some global companies actively descaling by withdrawing from 

markets they have been present in for decades;

• Many battles for innovation being won by new and small players 

backed by venture capitalist money against established large, 

global firms; and

• Local scale disadvantaged consumer companies gaining share 

from global scale advantaged players.

Risk monitoring and management

The Group is driving competition performance analysis and 

follow-up of organizational changes and M&A news and reviewing 

its competitors peer group and all key players in its environment.

To anticipate these changes in the competitive landscape, the 

Group is communicating more widely its values and positioning on 

climate change and sustainability.

Schneider Electric also reinforces its offer portfolio with acquisitions 

or investments in software companies, such as RIB Software in 

2020, and OSIsoft with AVEVA in 2021.

Schneider Electric provides a full portfolio of solutions for 

customers (hardware and software) – as EcoStruxure™ solutions 

– and energy and automation digital solutions for efficiency and 

sustainability.

It is also developing the Group’s network of partners and 

reinforcing its Strategic Technology Alliances.

The Group is keen to integrate the best experts or local players in 

an open architecture with agnostic solutions, to offer a flexible and 

scalable solution and ensure the best value for users.

2. Trend driven risks

2.3 Supply chain resilience

Risk description

The Group is exposed to supply chain dependency and business 

continuity risk.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, constrained labor 

availability, global shortages of raw materials, and unreliable 

transportation have challenged suppliers and put pressure on 

global and regional supply chains across industries. Due to market 

dynamics, these constraints are still taking time to abate, 

particularly in electronic components such as semiconductors.

Schneider Electric has over 200 industrial and logistics sites 

globally and is exposed to the physical effects of climate change in 

the form of more frequent and severe acute weather events. This 

can result in damage to assets, disruption to business operations, 

and human consequences. Extreme weather events do not only 

threaten Schneider Electric’s assets and properties but also the 

overall supply chain. Shortages or logistic bottlenecks in the 

upstream and downstream supply chain can translate directly into 

revenue losses, increased costs, and increased working capital 

requirements. Delays in production and delivery can impact 

customer experience.

Risk monitoring and management

The Group’s supply chain strategy team is responding to the global 

supply chain crisis to ensure supply chain flexibility and resilience 

is continually improved.

The Group is working closely with its suppliers and research and 

development teams to qualify alternate components to support 

increased demand and improve continuity of supply. Components 

have been mapped according to risk and business impact. As of 

end 2022, 75% of electronic ranges related risks are covered by 

strategic safety stocks, and 8% have been fully contained through 

a multi-source design. 85% of Electromechanic ranges related 

risks are covered by strategic safety stocks, and 26% have been 

fully contained through a multi-source design. Our resilience 

three-year plan targeting building a redundant network, launched 

in 2021 and named Power of Two, is progressing as planned and 

was even enriched with new plans; we have roughly implemented 

half of our Power of Two resilience plans for logistics and 

manufacturing and should reach 80% completion in 2023, targeting 

to have all implemented in 2024.

Rare earth material supply risk related to potential scarcity in the 

market has been fully assessed and is acknowledged in our design 

roadmap. Top strategic partnerships with key suppliers have been 

reinforced through long-term agreements and C-Level 

connections, with a particular focus on electronic semiconductor 

players. A procurement and planning hub will be implemented in 

next two years to establish a direct connection to critical material 

sources and manage strategic stocks, demand, and supply.

Energy supply risks in Europe have been assessed and business 

continuity plans have been anticipated on critical factories and 

suppliers, while we accelerate move towards net-zero carbon sites 

and suppliers.

China dependency is continuously reducing through our plans to 

produce and source 90% of what we sell in the same region. This 

ratio reached 80% in 2022 and is planned to progress 1 to 2 points 

per year over the coming five years. While Taiwan dependency 

remains high on electronics rank 3 supplies, China–Taiwan tensions 

triggered more focus and acceleration on reducing dependency 

although this will be a multi-year roadmap.

Leveraging its network of more than 162 factories and 84 logistic 

centers globally, and network of seven control towers (in each 

region), the Group is able to monitor global transport reliability, 

labor availability, and overall market dynamics in real time, 

adjusting lead times as necessary, while enacting mitigating 

actions to ensure lead times are as short as possible. All strategic 

distribution centers will have a ready-to-deliver backup logistic 

center; as of today business coverage is 50% and will rise to 80% 

in 2023. Sites prevention plans including cybersecurity practices 

are fully deployed and monitored centrally.

Teams are empowered to proactively communicate with customers 

to continue to support them and their operations.

To address the risk of supply chain disruptions caused by extreme 

weather events, Schneider Electric performed a forward-looking 

climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify and price the 

materiality of physical climate risks that may affect its sites, its 

extended supply chain, and overall economic activities in different 

scenarios. This assessment combines a qualitative screening of the 

acute and chronic climate-related perils to calculate the exposure of 

the Group’s economic activities in the short-, medium- (2030) and 

long-term (2050) under different scenarios from the Intergovernmental 

Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), from 1.5°C to >4°C temperature rise 

by 2100. The Group monitors events across 10,000 nodes (such as 

ports and critical supplier locations) to shorten reaction time when 

events occur and minimize business impact.

In addition, an analysis of criticality of industrial sites is performed by 

independent experts from Global Risk Consulting (GRC), covering 

areas including interdependency analyses, alternative supply, and 

time to recover in case of damage. To date, the magnitude of impact 

is considered “medium to low”, and likelihood “as likely as not”, 

however the Group is proactively monitoring this risk.

2.4 Evolution of software and digital services offers

Risk description

Schneider Electric has a strong installed base of IoT devices and 

connected products. Over the past years, the Group has been 

increasingly focused on building and selling software and digital 

offerings that help drive a prescription of offers, and help end-

users best utilize offers. In doing both, the Group helps users 

decarbonize, reduce energy consumption, increase resiliency, and 

optimize occupancy effort. The whole range of software offering is 

contained in multiple Divisions. It includes, but is not limited to, a 

range of advisors and edge control products. The Group is also 

establishing a range of digital services that are designed to 

support its end-users and partners with added value such as data 

as a service, analytics, and cybersecurity. 

Major transformation in several areas is impacting the markets in 

which Schneider Electric operates, including the digitization of the 

energy industry. In the age of IoT, customers expect ever smarter 

products with open interfaces enabling them to be tightly 

integrated into more and more complex software-based solutions 

and benefit from new services leveraging artificial intelligence and 

advanced algorithms.

The Group is investing in its digital transformation journey and as 

such is increasing the share of its digital offers. In 2022, software 

and digital services had a strong growth. As such, Schneider 

Electric is focusing on offering more digital services, generating 

more recurring revenues, and increasing customer retention.

For the Group and its competitors, the market is still fairly new and 

poses a risk of being partially misunderstood. The needs of the 

market are still being defined and are rapidly evolving. As a result, 

while the end goals are fairly clear (e.g., decarbonization), more 

precise end-user needs are less well-defined; in many cases 

because the end-users themselves are still maturing their needs. 

Consequently, the risk for the Group is double:

• Long-term potential misalignment with end-users needs; and

• Integration of already existing offers, solutions, and roadmaps 

owned by various Divisions into a comprehensive and customer-

relevant portfolio.

Besides the digital offer readiness risks, and as a direct extention, 

the Group must also pay attention to:

• Challenges in commercialization and selling (cross-selling, 

simplified offer for effective selling, etc.); and

• Churn prevention.

Risk monitoring and management

Schneider Electric is continuously performing strategic efforts and 

analysis across its multiple Divisions to better understand the 

near-term and long-term end-users’ needs. Additionally, the 

transversal communication and collaboration has been 

dramatically improved. The Group has been focusing on how it 

leverages existing efforts and platforms to create common 

approaches and prevent overlaps in offers and solutions. It will 

focus on this path of continuous improvement, always striving to 

have a more focused set of offers with less overlap in functionality 

and more clear value propositions that are therefore easier to 

differentiate, understand, and sell.

Also, the Group has launched several initiatives including, but not 

limited to:

• Creation of a new organization dedicated to the growth of digital 

services with a clear ambition to leverage a robust strategy, a 

structured offer portfolio, and a segment market approach;

• Monetizing critical connected assets with advanced Advisor 

offer through installed base, using Artificial Intelligence and 

algorithms;

• Definition of a consistent connectivity path for partners and 

direct go-to-market;

• Acceleration of the attachment of digital services from CapEx to 

OpEx business;

• Animating a business platform (Exchange) to guide expert and 

local players; and 

• Proposing an agnostic solution within a large software portfolio 

and integrating open standards.

2. Trend driven risks

2.5 Attracting and developing talent with a focus on critical skills

Risk description

The growth of the Group’s businesses in markets around the world, 

the digital transformation, and the rapidly evolving context of the 

“next normal” requires an increased focus on talent. Shaping the 

workforce of the future depends on the Group’s ability to attract, 

hire, onboard, develop, and retain the best talent. Critical skills, 

especially in the areas of technologies, software, services, 

sustainability, supply chain, quality, and electronics must be 

prioritized. In addition to critical skills, workforce diversity, equity, 

and inclusion – especially gender, generation, and nationality/

ethnicity – also needs to be a priority to ensure equal opportunities 

for everyone, everywhere.

Competition for attracting and recruiting talent in a tight labor 

market is intense, in particular for critical digital and technical skill 

sets in key markets. Accelerating skill development (upskilling and 

reskilling) of employees and the development of leaders who can 

lead transformation and build human connections in a digital world 

is also necessary to reduce the risk of skill gaps and bring greater 

organizational agility.

Beyond core programs and initiatives, there is a big focus on the 

overall sense of purpose, culture, and way of working for 

employees.

Risk monitoring and management

The Group has a number of initiatives and programs in place to 

mitigate these risks, anchored in the Group’s people strategy, at the 

heart of which is the Employee Value Proposition, Core Values, and 

Leadership Expectations. Schneider’s approach focuses on the 

end-to-end talent pipeline from hiring to rewarding to developing 

for all employees as well as critical talent segments from a 

workforce size, quality, diversity, and velocity perspective. This 

systematic approach allows for data-driven monitoring of key gaps 

and risks. Supporting initiatives and programs include:

• Annual performance and development goal setting and reviews, 

as well as talent reviews – culminating in year-end reviews of 

pipeline, succession, diversity, and skills by each entity with the 

Chairman & CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer. On an 

ongoing basis, a global pool of high-potential and expert talents 

at all levels in the organization, is reviewed and managed in 

context of development and succession. Overall health of the 

talent attraction and development strategy, leadership pipeline, 

as well as succession of key people and positions is reviewed 

monthly with the Executive Committee.

• There is an enterprise focus on accelerating the early-career 

pipeline by twofold including internships, trainees, 

apprenticeships, and fresh graduates. Countries (top 10) all 

have next generation campus partnerships and recruitment 

programs. Additionally, the Schneider Global Student  

Experience and the Schneider Go Green annual competition 

each year attracts thousands of university talents who become 

part of the Schneider talent community on an ongoing basis.

Additional programmatic initiatives to attract, develop, and engage 

our key talents include:

• Investing in a new talent acquisition and candidate relationship 

management platform to manage prospective talents and the 

hiring processes, providing a seamless digital experience and 

enabling the Group to compete in the market for top talent. To 

date, 40 countries are using the system with the remaining 

countries joining in 2023;

• A 50/40/30 ambition towards gender: 50% of women in hiring, 

40% in frontline management, and 30% in leadership (Vice 

President and above); 

• Policies for family leave, pay equity, and flexible “new ways of 

working”, supplemented with a strong program of activities to 

accelerate the diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda and focus 

on employee well-being, especially mental health; 

• Competitive reward and benefits practices to meet local market 

needs and attract and retain key talents. This includes 

Schneider’s Worldwide Employee Share Ownership Plan 

(WESOP) allowing ~80% of all employees to share collectively in 

the Company’s success, and building a stable and sustainable 

share owner group in the long-run;

• An operating model with ~30 hubs enabling customer proximity, 

innovation, speed, collaboration, and diversity of talent 

opportunities;

• Career development focus for all employees, leveraging Open 

Talent Market for internal mobility and anchored in an annual 

performance and development review; 

• A revamped “Edison” expert program in areas of R&D, digital, 

supply chain, etc., to support levels of expertise certification 

and market recognition;

• A global program in support of “all generations” talent 

development with a particular focus on senior talents and their 

development and impact on the Company, including knowledge 

sharing, mentoring, and coaching;

• Upskilling for today and tomorrow with a strong focus on digital 

skills, technical skills, commercial excellence, and functional 

expertise, led by global learning academies of experts; 

• A collective focus for leaders to disrupt, coach, and collaborate 

in order to transform culture and build great teams; includes 

clear criteria for leadership impact and selection/promotion 

based on skills, experiences, and behaviors; and

• Continuous listening strategy to seek feedback from employees 

throughout their employment lifecycle.

2.6 Risk related to the environmental performance of the Group

Risk description

Schneider Electric has set ambitious sustainability commitments 

translated into concrete targets in the Schneider Sustainability 

Impacts and Schneider Sustainability Essentials programs. The 

Group is already tackling the reduction of GHG emissions across 

all three scopes, working on its operations and bringing the value 

chain along, in line with its ambition to contribute to limiting global 

temperature rise to 1.5°C. 

However, the risk of not meeting the ambition to decarbonize its 

operations and supply chain exists and could trigger significant 

financial losses if it materializes. Schneider committed to becoming 

Net-Zero across its entire value chain, which implies a strong 

engagement of suppliers to decarbonize Scope 3 upstream 

emissions and provide to its customers enhanced energy efficient 

products to reduce its Scope 3 downstream.

As an Impact company with sustainability at its core, failing short 

on its Net-Zero Commitment, or conveying misleading 

environmental claims on its sustainability progress and products 

would expose the Group to greenwashing accusations with 

potential reputational impacts.

As regulations tackling climate change develop, the Group could 

see market disruptions in geographies where it operates as well as 

where its supply chain is located. Schneider considers the possible 

financial impacts of future carbon pricing on its extended value 

chain.

Risk monitoring and management

Regarding Schneider’s offers, 100% of new products are eco-

designed, meaning that they are optimized to deliver environmental 

performance throughout their lifecycle. In addition, the Group has 

developed the Green Premium™ label, a unique sign of its 

commitment to compliance, transparency, and sustainability 

performance. Today, more than 80% of Schneider’s product sales 

come from Green Premium products. Finally, notification systems 

are set in place to understand external sustainability perceptions 

and guidelines are defined to ensure alignment between product 

characteristics and marketing communications.

2.7 Natural resource crises: Shortage of resources used in Schneider Electric’s 
products or in manufacturing 

Risk description

Schneider Electric is dependent on natural resources in both its 

operations and product offerings. 

As a discrete manufacturing company, the Group is subject to 

business disruption risk due to energy security of supply. 

Electrification megatrends are increasing competition to access 

some raw materials critical for those new businesses. For example, 

renewable power generation is shifting dependency of the energy 

sector from fossil fuels to mineral resources. The Electric Vehicles 

industry is expected to increase the demand for lithium 50-fold by 

2040 and the demand for Cobalt and Graphite 30-fold, according 

to IEA. 

While water consumption is not generally a critical resource for the 

Group due to its activities, Schneider fully realizes the importance 

of water in local communities, especially those that are located in 

water-stressed areas.

Changing economic trends, lack of access and overexploitation 

can result in shortages of natural resources within the Group’s 

operations and its value chain. This subjects the Group to business 

disruptions and rising costs in both the short- and long-term and 

additional challenges to secure supply for sustainable 

transformation programs (Green Materials, substances substitution, 

Sustainable Packaging).

Risk monitoring and management

Business disruption due to energy supply is taken into account in 

the Global Supply Chain STRIVE initiative and covered by the 

Group’s Property Damage and Business Interruption program at 

site level. 

In addition, Schneider leverages the power of its EcoStruxure™ 

architectures to deliver energy savings in factories, distribution 

centers, and offices. These smart solutions enable offices to 

actively develop occupancy and facility management strategies to 

keep energy consumption to a minimum, while improving employee 

experience and comfort. 

The Group is also accelerating the installation of on-site solar 

panels which, coupled with EcoStruxure™ metering and power 

architectures, are further reducing Schneider Electric’s risk of 

business disruption due to energy supply. 

Water risks are assessed as a standalone issue, and the global 

water-risk assessment covers all industrial sites above 50 Full-Time 

Equivalent (FTE) employees and all service sites above 500 FTE 

employees. All these sites are certified ISO 14001, and water-risk is 

also considered in their environmental risk analysis. The Group’s 

latest water-risk global study was performed in June 2022, covering 

271 sites globally. This assessment is carried out every year as 

Schneider monitors its sites that are in water-stressed regions. The 

Group has set the ambition that 100% of its sites in water-stressed 

areas have a water conservation strategy and related action plan 

by 2025 (SSE #11).

2. Trend driven risks

2.7 Natural resource crises: Shortage of resources used in Schneider Electric’s 
products or in manufacturing (continued)

The Group approaches the access to resources at different time 

horizons, to ensure supply resilience both now and in the future. 

The Group is:

• Building short term resilience in securing supply and protecting 

operations against price volatility with real time alerts to notify 

and activate action plans;

• De-risking its portfolio with technological solutions and circular 

business models;

• Shaping the future with long-term material resilience and 

sustainability with disruptive actions.

To address uncertainty in long-term resource disruption, Schneider 

has added resource parameters in product EcoDesign and defined 

substitution strategies for critical resources. R&D actions are in 

place, focusing on materials with main strategic functions 

accompanied by communication channels to escalate and alert.

3. Management practice risks

3.1 Data residency

Risk description

The last decades have seen a sharp increase in globalization 

trends coupled with an acceleration of digital transformation. The 

advent of cloud-based infrastructure and SaaS offers have 

decreased time to market and increased global reach. However, 

while the importance of the data economy as an enabler for wealth 

and progress has been acknowledged by many governments who 

realize the benefits of the new trend, they have been observing with 

some apprehension the concentration of their citizens’ and 

enterprises’ data in just a handful of infrastructure players. 

The clash of the technological trends with the geopolitical 

dynamics have therefore spawned a new breed of regulations 

aiming at extending the physical borders to the digital world. Such 

regulations are aiming at restricting either the flow of certain 

categories of data and/or their localization, and while referred to 

with different nomenclature such as Data Sovereignty, Data 

Localization, and Data Residency, they are for all intents and 

purposes data protectionist laws. 

Schneider Electric, being a global player that has been pursuing a 

strategy of shareholder value through efficiency of its global 

processes and availability of global offers, is exposed to such 

regulations across the globe, with a risk of increased cost due to 

possible redundant infrastructure, reduced management oversight, 

and degradation of its global customer service experience. The risk 

is exacerbated by a lack of technology players that would be able 

to respond globally to such challenges and by the unavoidable 

inconsistency of regulations across different jurisdictions, however, 

the latter is not specific to just data residency regulations.

Risk monitoring and management

Schneider Electric has established an “early warning system” that 

monitors emerging digital policies bearing a potential impact to the 

Company; each regulation (policy) is qualified with a flashcard 

highlighting its type (e.g., data, digital, electronic), characteristics 

(e.g., jurisdiction, scope, type of controls), and high-level impact. 

All the policies are followed in their approval trajectory and close to 

the enforcement date the necessary small and medium-sized 

enterprises (SMEs) are called upon to start to translate the 

legislation requirements into internal policy, procedures, and 

internal controls (KICs) to be implemented and operated in the 

relevant geographies and functions. 

Specific to the data residency laws, attention is dedicated to the 

analysis of the internal and external data flows that are crossing the 

borders of the in-scope countries in terms of their payload, their 

purposes, and their security (commonly known as Transfer Impact 

Analysis), which informs a technological decision on whether to 

localize processing application and/or data storage facilities. 

Frequently, a description of the flows is also required by the 

regulator as part of a formal approval process to export data, along 

with an obligation to monitor the changes that could potentially 

affect the flows and their integrity (e.g., data breach). Schneider 

has capitalized on the experience built in responding to substantial 

regulations such as GDPR in the European Union, and has 

successfully leveraged set capabilities, like process registry, in 

recent instances of data residency such as PIPL in China.

3.2 IT systems management

Risk description

The Group operates either directly or through service providers, a 

wide range of highly complex information systems, including 

servers, networks, data repositories, applications (to include 

software as a service (SaaS)), and databases with three targeted 

landing zones (on premise, colocation third parties, and in the 

cloud), that are essential for the efficiency of its sales and 

manufacturing processes, as well as platforms to enable digital 

offers such as EcoStruxure™. The Group is deploying various 

solutions aimed at enhancing commercial experience, employee 

experience, and supply chain efficiency as well as enabling digital 

commercial offers. 

Significant failure in fulfilment by a service provider or a major 

network outage, hardware, and/or system failure could adversely 

affect the quality of service offered by Schneider Electric. In 

addition, the provision of safe and secure foundational information 

systems is critical to the ongoing expansion of digital offers and 

customer interactions. As the Group moves towards more digital 

offers, services, and software, the variety of legacy systems makes 

it harder and more complex to evolve and scale. 

Despite the Group’s policy of establishing governance structures 

and contingency plans, there can be no assurance that information 

systems projects will not be subject to technical problems, 

execution delays, or a third-party outage. While it is difficult to 

accurately quantify the impact of any such problems, data loss, or 

delays, they could have an adverse effect on inventory levels, 

service quality, and, consequently, on the Group’s financial results.

Risk monitoring and management

The Group regularly examines alternative solutions to protect 

against those risks, performs regular compliance checks on 

service provider and service level agreements, performs system 

monitoring, and has developed contingency plans and incident 

response capabilities to mitigate the effects of any information 

system failure. 

The Group undergoes constant evolution and planning pertaining 

to its information systems, which encompasses, but is not limited to: 

• Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) transformation and the 

evolution of the Group’s financial systems to prepare for digital 

offers; 

• Elimination of legacy IT applications and associated hardware to 

simplify the landscape and mitigate risks linked to 

obsolescence; and

• Build and operate regional colocation (third parties) for high 

availability in an effort to ensure the sustainability of the IT 

landscape with ongoing focus on business continuity and 

disaster recovery planning for hardware and software.

All new applications are subject to certification testing, attempting 

to remove system vulnerabilities. These systems are housed either 

in data centers (either managed by the Group internally or by 

service providers), in colocations, or are cloud-based applications. 

In 2022, the Group continued to reduce legacy IT applications 

through a dedicated “Technical Debt Reduction” program as well 

as a new program to ensure hardware resiliency for future years 

(hardware as a service).

3.3 Pricing strategy

Risk description

In 2022, raw material and foreign exchange rate fluctuation 

continued to impact the Group’s cost base, as well as contributing 

to an increase in freight rates and a shortage of components 

worldwide. Such fluctuations, if not offset by tactical pricing 

decisions in compliance with national and international laws, can 

negatively impact the Group’s profitability. The Group followed suit 

in overcoming these cost impacts by reacting adequately over the 

cycle. In addition, our strategic Pricing program contributed to a 

substantial amount. 

Pricing risk is expected to persist in 2023 as the Raw Material 

Inflation (RMI) trend has slowed down and it may be harder to set 

prices in proportion to energy and labor inflation. Adding to that, 

accumulated backlog could pose a risk in the prospect of 

cancellations, which would lead to a substantial threat on price 

achievement. The ability to improve supply capacity faster than 

competitors will play an important role for the Group’s pricing 

power.

Risk monitoring and management

To anticipate negative impact on profitability, the Group has 

reinforced its comprehensive global Pricing program with robust 

compliance, commercial policy, pricing, and quotation tools.

2022 Specific events – Russia – Ukraine

As a consequence of the hostilities, which commenced at the end of February, 2022, between Russia and Ukraine, and the unstable 

geopolitical situation, the Group has seen several direct and indirect impacts on its employees, stakeholders, and business. 

Continuous risk identification, assessment, and mitigation is being performed. It focuses, first, on the humanitarian aspects including 

the support provided by the Group to the Group employees and their families. Further, it encompasses, in no particular order: the 

financial and operational impacts resulting from sanctions and counter-sanctions, the cybersecurity increased threats on both the 

Group assets and its customers’ safety and products, and the potential unavailability or loss of critical suppliers. 

The Group has been winding down its presence in Russia, in particular via the divestments of Schneider Electric Russia.

The Group resilience strategy in place allows Schneider Electric to absorb the interruption of Ukraine and Russia factories and the 

supply chain due to a regional or global need. The systems and processes in place make it possible to reallocate customer orders to 

other active geographies. In addition, the duplication of suppliers and the analysis and anticipation systems limit the impact of the crisis 

on our orders.

3.5 Insurance

Schneider Electric transfers high severity, low 
frequency risks to leading insurance companies.  
The Risk and Insurance department reviews the 
current pricing and coverage conditions of the 
external insurance market in implementing the  
most efficient insurance program. 

These policies are arranged on a global basis for all Group 

subsidiaries over which Schneider Electric has operational control. 

These policies are in all countries where the Group operates and 

are compliant with local regulations. All insurance companies used 

by Schneider Electric must meet certain credit and security 

requirements. 

All insurance policies have aggregate limits determined based 

upon loss scenarios and available capacities on the market. 

However, there is the risk that an extreme claim could exceed the 

amount of insurance purchased. 

The insurance policies that are purchased cover varying exposures 

including, but not limited to: 

• General liability risks arising from events where the Group is 

liable for damages to a third party as a result of the activities of 

its people or its products; 

• Property damage and business interruption resulting from an 

insured risk such as fire, flood, or earthquake at a Group site or, 

to a lesser extent, a customer or supplier location; 

• Risks associated with the transportation of assets by land, sea, 

or air; 

• Damage to equipment being installed at customer locations or 

construction sites; 

• Risks arising from data breaches and attacks on IT systems; 

• Local compulsory policies for employee safety and automobiles; 

• Liabilities of Executive Directors and Corporate Officers; 

• Environmental risks; and

• Emergency assistance and repatriation for employees travelling. 

Insurable risk mitigations 

The Group identifies and measures the impact of the main 

insurable risks with a view to reducing or eliminating their impact. 

• In order to minimize the risks of damage and protect our 

production capacity, protection standards (including for the 

sites managed by third parties) are defined, and main industrial 

sites are audited by an independent loss prevention company 

with a process to action any recommendations from these 

audits. 

• Business continuity plans are implemented, reviewed, and 

tested, in particular for the Group’s main sites and critical 

suppliers. These plans are developed to identify internal 

alternative manufacturing and storage solutions to reduce the 

disruption to the business. 

• Crisis management tools are implemented in conjunction with 

the Group’s Global Security department. These are tested on a 

systematic basis. Regular exercises are performed to identify 

areas for improvement. 

• Hazard and vulnerability studies are carried out to protect our 

people and our equipment. 

• For transportation risks, the lessons learned from losses are 

communicated across the Group to improve the risk 

management of shipments and the Insurance department liaise 

closely with Logistic and Planning teams to minimize incident 

impact. 

• Employee safety and a safe work environment are priority topics 

at all site management meetings. Safety training for new 

employees combined with regular reviews ensure continuous 

learning and improvement in the recognition and elimination of 

hazards. 

Self-insurance 

As part of the overall insurance strategy the Group self-insures 

certain risks through two captive insurance and reinsurance 

companies located in Europe and North America. 

Examples of the policies reinsured by the Group, include property 

damage and business interruption, general liability, and 

transportation. 

The total amount retained for these risks is capped at €20 million 

(except for USA and Canada). 

The cost of the self-insured risks is not considered material at the 

Group level. 

The Group assumes a deductible at a site/entity level – though this 

is not regarded as self-insurance. 

Cost of insurance programs 

The cost (including tax) of the Group’s main global insurance 

programs, excluding premiums paid to captives, totaled around 

€28 million in 2022.

Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent 
Director’s introduction
Dear Shareholders,

2022 was a strong year with record revenues, profitability, and net 
income despite the many challenges confronting businesses around the 
world. This led the Board to propose a dividend of €3.15 per share; 
making 2023 the 13th consecutive year of dividend growth. The Board is 
also proud of the progress made in the second year of the ambitious 
2021–2025 Schneider Sustainability Impact program as the Company 
scored 4.91 against a target of 4.70, in accordance with the Board’s 
commitment toward sustainability and our wish to be an Impact 
company. These strong results, achieved amidst ongoing headwinds, 
are testament to the success and robustness of the strategy 
implemented for the last 20 years under the leadership of Jean-Pascal 
Tricoire, Chairman & CEO.

After two decades where Jean-Pascal Tricoire has led the strategic 
transformation of the Group and further to his wish to step down as CEO 
as of May 3, 2023, the time has come for a change of governance at the 
head of the Company. In accordance with the intention disclosed in 
2021, the Board of Directors has decided to separate the functions of 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Peter Herweck who was the CEO of AVEVA, will succeed Jean-Pascal 
Tricoire as CEO on May 4, 2023, becoming responsible for the general 
management of Schneider as the sole executive corporate officer. Over 
the last four years, the Governance & Remunerations Committee, under 
the guidance of the Board of Directors, has conducted a comprehensive 
and robust succession planning process to propose a successor for the 
role of CEO. Several high-quality candidates were considered. Peter 
Herweck’s level of global operational experience, technology and 
software acumen, skills and personal qualities were assessed by the 
Board as being particularly in line with the Group’s strategy. His 
appointment was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors with 
Jean-Pascal Tricoire’s full support.

At the unanimous request of the Board of Directors, who want to retain 
the benefit of his extensive experience, Jean-Pascal Tricoire will remain 
as Chairman. On behalf of the Board, I express our deepest thanks to 
Jean-Pascal Tricoire for the transformation of the Group in scale, 
performance, purpose and capability. His many achievements include 
the repositioning of Schneider Electric as a leader in the fields of 
digitization, electrification and sustainability, as well as building a 
distinctive culture and management system based on a meaningful and 

inclusive mission and the empowerment of people. This 
robust foundation has made Schneider Electric 

future-ready and the Board of Directors is 
confident in the continued success of the 
Group in the coming years, which will 
continue to be supported by Jean-Pascal 

Tricoire in his role as Chairman.

This change of governance will go 
alongside a new set up of the 

Committees and a reorganization of the 
powers of each corporate body. A 

Governance, Nominations & Sustainability 
Committee will be created and will focus on 

matters considered to be central to the 
work of the Board, including 

governance, succession 
planning of Board 

members, 
Corporate 

Officers and 
Executive 
Committee 
members, 

and Sustainability. A separate Human Capital & Remunerations 
Committee will oversee all topics related to the compensation of the 
employees, Executive Committee members, as well as Corporate 
officers and Board members. The Chairman of the Board will be 
entrusted with extended powers and missions beyond those provided 
for by law to put his experience at the Company’s service. Further to this, 
my own powers, as Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, will 
now include the ability to request that the Chairman of the Board of 
Directors call a meeting of the Board of Directors to discuss a given 
agenda.

During the year, the Board continued to improve and reinforce its 
composition, and invites you to support, at the Shareholders’ Meeting, 
the appointment of two new Independent Directors. Abhay Parasnis, a 
US citizen, is Adobe’s former Chief Technology Officer and Chief 
Product Officer and serves on the Board of Directors at Dropbox. He will 
bring to the Board his remarkable technology and digital skills, 
especially his experience in cloud transition and in SaaS transformation, 
as well as his spirit of innovation and reinvention. Giulia Chierchia, an 
Italian and Belgian dual citizen, is currently Executive Vice-President of 
Strategy, Sustainability and Ventures at BP. She will bring to the Board 
her expertise in Sustainability and the energy sector, in particular, her 
experience in energy transition strategy in large companies with a global 
approach including strategy, sustainability, capital allocation and 
ventures. I also invite you to renew the terms of office of Léo Apotheker, 
Gregory Spierkel, and Lip-Bu Tan, all of whom bring many 
complementary skills to the Board.

Throughout 2022, I had the opportunity to discuss our compensation 
policy and practices by engaging with many of Schneider Electric’s 
shareholders, as well as investor representative bodies. For 2023, the 
compensation policies proposed by the Board reflect the Group’s 
governance change. Considering that Jean-Pascal Tricoire is stepping 
down as CEO on May 3, 2023, the Board decided not to increase his 
fixed remuneration for the period from January 1, 2023 until May 3, 2023 
and to maintain his compensation policy broadly in line with that applied 
in 2022. When positioning the fixed compensation of Jean-Pascal 
Tricoire as Chairman for the period beginning on May 4, 2023, the Board 
used an in-depth study of industry practices for compensation and also 
took into account the specific missions assigned to him by the Board. In 
designing the remuneration policy applicable to the new CEO, the Board 
wished to maintain an overall stability in the existing compensation 
structure which has evidently driven positive behavior. It appears 
balanced, provides market competitive pay, and ensures a strong link 
between pay and performance. The policy also provides strong 
alignment with both employees and shareholders, as well as a focus on 
the long-term. The Board also took into account shareholders’ feedback 
and proposed some adjustments, such as (i) the review of the targeted 
amounts for the different components of the compensation which will 
lead to a decrease of the on-target global remuneration opportunity by 
23% compared to the previous Chairman & CEO remuneration policy,  
(ii) the strengthening of the performance targets linked to the involuntary 
severance indemnity, and (iii) the inclusion of a clawback provision. We 
hope that these proposals which appear balanced and fair will receive 
your support.

Further to this letter, I invite you to read the governance and 
compensation report and notice of meeting which provide more details 
on the resolutions you are asked to approve at the 2023 Shareholders’ 
Meeting. We look forward to a successful AGM and sincerely hope that 
many of you will take part in the Company’s decisions by voting on the 
resolutions, attending physically, and expressing your views during the 
Q&A session.

Thank you for your support and your trust,

Fred Kindle
Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director

4.1.1.1 Reference to the AFEP-MEDEF Code

The Company refers to the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance 

Code, the latest version of which was updated on December 20, 

2022. The Company complies with all the recommendations 

contained in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code which 

may be consulted online at http://www.medef.com/.

In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-37, paragraph 6 

of the French Commercial Code, this chapter constitutes the

4.1.1.2 Governance structure 

Schneider Electric is being governed through a model considered 

by the Board of Directors to be best suited to the Company’s 

culture, and specificities, with the ambition to constantly improve its 

effectiveness. The structure responsible for the General 

Management of Schneider Electric has always been selected in the 

best interest of the Company and its stakeholders, with the 

objective that the corporate governance model will support the 

optimization of the Group’s financial and sustainability 

performance, create the most favorable conditions for the 

Company’s long-term development, respect the rights of 

Shareholders, and maintain the necessary balance of powers 

between the different governance bodies.

In 2013, after a period of 7 years (2006 to 2013) in which the duties 

of Chairman of the Supervisory Board and those of Chairman of the 

Management Board were separated to ensure a smooth transition 

from Mr. Henri Lachmann to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, the Board of 

Directors decided to change the governance structure and appoint 

Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chairman of the Board of Directors and 

Chief Executive Officer.

The Board regularly reviewed its structure and its functioning 

throughout since then. In accordance with the wishes of 

M. Jean-Pascal Tricoire to step down as Chief Executive Officer 
during his current term of office, alongside the intention of the 
Board of Directors to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer, the Board decided on February 15, 2023 to 
implement a new governance structure that splits the office of 
Chairman from that of the Chief Executive Officer.

4.1.1.2.1 Governance structure as of 

May 4, 2023

Succession planning process

As publicly stated in 2021, when Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire’s office 

as Director was coming to an end, the Board decided to renew 

Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire’s board mandate for a further four-year 

term. The Board of Directors considered his performance as both 

Chairman & CEO to be outstanding and the combination of roles to 

be appropriate when considering his profile, excellent track record 

within the Company, and his openness to both Board Member 

recommendation as well as the governance mechanisms in place 

to safeguard the balance of power between the Board and the 

management. The Board also confirmed that it understood and 

acknowledged the general preference of investors for a clear 

distinction between the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive 

Officer, and, therefore, announced its intention to separate the  

roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer before the end of 

M. Jean-Pascal Tricoire’s upcoming 4 years term.

Over the last four years, the Governance & Remunerations 

Committee, under the guidance of the Board of Directors, has 

conducted a comprehensive process to propose the most 

appropriate governance structure for the Company, and 

succession plan for the role of Chief Executive Officer. The work of 

the Governance & Remunerations Committee intensified in 2021 and 

2022, driven by the ambition to preserve Schneider Electric’s 

fundamental values, the Group and its Shareholders’ interests, as 

well as the continuity of the strategy.

The Governance & Remunerations Committee met 27 times between 

2020 and early 2023, following an in-depth succession plan 

process:
• identification of the required skills and qualities most suited to

the Group’s future challenges;

• initiation of an external assessment of the Executive Committee

members;

• selection of top potential candidates of both genders, based on

their respective careers and achievements in their managerial

responsibilities;

• evaluation of potential candidates internal and external;

• resolution to favor internal candidates and further examine their

suitability for the role;

• further evaluation with closer exposure to the Board and its

strategic priorities;

• final selection of the new Chief Executive Officer.

The Committee led each of these steps which were then presented 

to the whole Board for discussion and validation.

When identifying the key skills required to take over the Chief 

Executive Officer function, the Board, on top of global managerial 

skill in complex environment, global knowledge of the industry 

Schneider Electric operates in, considered essential:

• understanding of technology, in particular digital and software;

• engagement on Sustainability and climate change;

• commitment to keep building the Schneider’s advantage in

terms of globality (multi-Hub differentiated model) and diversity

(strong commitment to diversity and inclusion);

• ability to imagine, initiate and drive radical transformations to

accelerate the implementation of the strategy;

• resilience and courage to face complex situations.

Pursuant to this process, the Board has unanimously decided that 

Mr. Peter Herweck who was Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA, will 

succeed Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chief Executive Officer of 

Schneider Electric on May 4, 2023 at the date of the Annual 

General Meeting. Mr. Peter Herweck joined Schneider Electric in 

2016, where he successfully led the global Industrial Automation 

Business, before being appointed as Chief Executive Officer of 

AVEVA in 2021. He started his career as software development 

engineer with Mitsubishi in Japan, later joining Siemens, where he 

held several executive positions in Automation, Power Distribution 

and Building Technologies, before becoming Chief Strategy 

Officer. Mr. Peter Herweck has a diverse, cross-cultural mindset, 

derived from leading teams in both mature and emerging markets. 

His level of global operational experience, technology and software 

acumen, skills and personal qualities as well as his passion for 

technology driving positive progress for the world, were assessed 

by the Board as being particularly in line with the Group’s strategy 

making him the best candidate for the role of Chief Executive 

Officer of Schneider Electric. Mr. Peter Herweck will become 

responsible for the general management of the Company, as the 

sole executive corporate officer.

Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire will remain as Chairman of the Board, at 

the unanimous request of the Board members who want to retain 

the benefits of his experience at the Company’s helm in 

significantly and successfully transforming Schneider Electric over 

the past 20 years. The Board believes his commitment to promoting 

the Group’s culture and values, his governance expertise founded 

on transparency, and the close ties built with all Company’s 

Stakeholders will be highly valuable for the Company. His many 

achievements include the repositioning of Schneider Electric as a 

leader in the fields of digitization, electrification and sustainability, 

and building a distinctive culture and management system based 

on a meaningful and inclusive mission and the empowerment of 

people.

As a consequence of this change of governance, the internal 

regulations of the Board were amended on February 15, 2023 to be 

effective as of May 4, 2023 with several key changes:

auditors, notably by examining the external audit plan and results of controls made by 

statutory auditors;

• to suggest reappointing the existing statutory auditors or appointing new statutory auditors, 

after a consultation process;

• to check the independence of statutory auditors, especially at the time of examining fees paid 

by the Group to their firm or their network, and by giving prior approval to any missions that 

are not strictly included in the scope of the statutory audit;

• to monitor the efficiency of internal control and risk management systems and therefore, more 

particularly:

(i) to examine the organization and resources used for internal audit, as well as its annual 

work program (the Committee shall receive summaries of reports produced on audits on 

a quarterly basis and the Chairperson of the Committee shall receive these reports in 

full);

(ii) to review Enterprise Risk Management reports including operational risk-mapping and to 

make sure that measures exist for preventing or minimizing risks;

(iii) to examine how to optimize risk coverage on the basis of reports requested from internal 

audit or risk management functions;

(iv) to examine Group internal control measures and look into the results of entities’ self-

assessments with respect to internal control; to ensure that a relevant process exists for 

identifying and processing incidents and anomalies;

(v) to ascertain the existence of Group compliance policies notably concerning competition, 

anti-bribery, ethics and data protection and the measures implemented to ensure that 

these policies are circulated and applied;

(vi) to assess Cyber Risks and the Group’s Cyber Security posture (jointly with the Digital 

Committee).

4.1.1.2.2 Governance structure in 2022 and until 

May 3, 2023

In 2022, the functions of the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer 

were carried out by Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, who was appointed 

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer on April 25, 2013, and renewed 

on April 25, 2017, and lastly on April 28, 2021. Mr. Jean-Pascal 

Tricoire will pursue his functions of Chairman & Chief Executive 

Officer until May 3, 2023.

The Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

In 2022, the performance by Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire of the duties 

of Chairman & Chief Executive Officer seemed particularly 

appropriate to the Board of Directors for the following reasons:

• The results of the internal Board assessments that continuously 

confirmed that (i) all Board members individually support the 

current leadership structure and (ii) the level of transparency 

between the management team and the Board of Directors is 

considered to be excellent;

• Jean-Pascal Tricoire’s profile, his excellent track record within 

the Company, his leadership, and his openness to the Board 

members’ recommendations;

• The governance mechanisms in place to safeguard the balance 

of power between the Board and the management (appointment 

of a Lead Independent Director with specific powers, high rate 

of independent Directors within the Board (82%), independence 

of the committees mainly chaired by independent Directors, 

executive session proposed systematically at the end of each 

Board meeting); and

• The requirement for the Board to deliberate each year on the 

unification of the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive 

Officer in pursuance of its internal regulations.

The Chairman & CEO represents the Company in its dealings with 

third parties. He is vested with the broadest authority to act in any 

and all circumstances in the name and on behalf of the Company. 

He exercises this authority within the limits of the corporate 

purpose, except for those matters that are reserved by law 

expressly to the Annual Shareholders’ Meetings or the Board of 

Directors. In addition, the internal regulations of the Board of 

Directors provide that the Chairman & CEO must submit for 

approval to the Board any acquisition transactions or disposal of 

assets amounting to more than €250 million as well as any strategic 

partnership agreements.

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director

On February 19, 2020, the Board of Directors designated 

Mr. Fred Kindle, whose biography is provided in section 4.1.2.2 of 

Chapter 4 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document to become 

Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director of Schneider Electric 

SE. Article 1 of the internal regulations of the Board of Directors 

defines the duties and missions of the Vice-Chairman & Lead 

Independent Director who is mandatorily appointed when the 

Board decides to unify the functions of Chairman and Chief 

Executive Officer.

* Independent Directors as prescribed by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code.

** Excluding the Director representing the employee shareholders and the Directors representing the employees.

*** Subject to his appointement as a Director by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on May 4, 2023.

4.1.2.3 Changes to the Board composition 
submitted to the Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting

As part of the Board’s continuous review of its composition, 

the Board of Directors asked the Governance & Remunerations 

Committee to make a recommendation on the renewal of 

Mr. Léo Apotheker, Mr. Gregory Spierkel, and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan, 

as well as search for complementary candidates in line with the 

skillset highlighted by its Board skills matrix and the challenges 

of the Company.

In that respect, the Committee has analyzed Mr. Léo Apotheker’s, 

Mr. Gregory Spierkel’s and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan’s situation with regards 

to their relevance and performance, as well as their time 

commitment, and availability to fulfill their duties as well as the 

value added by each of them to the work of the Board.

• Mr. Léo Apotheker holds only one other position in a listed

company (Director of NICE-Systems Ltd), and his attendance

rate at Board meetings in 2022 is 100%, while his attendance

rate at meetings of the Committees in which he participates

is 90%. The Committee recommended to the Board that

Mr. Léo Apotheker continues to participate in the work of the

Board, particularly in the areas of software and M&A, where his

expertise as former Chief Executive Officer of SAP and

Hewlett-Packard is essential, as well as his excellent knowledge

of the Group and the balance of the composition of the Board of

Directors in terms of seniority. However, in view of his age and

his non-independence under the AFEP-MEDEF Code, since he

has been a member of the Board since 2008, the Committee

has proposed limiting his term of office to two years.

• Mr. Gregory Spierkel holds two other mandates in listed

companies (Director of MGM Resorts International and PACCAR

Inc.), his attendance rate at the meetings of the Board and the

committees in which he participates in 2022 is 100%.

Mr. Gregory Spierkel brings to the Board the benefit of his

experience as former Chief Executive Officer of Ingram Micro,

Inc. and a solid profile in digital and technology matters, which 

leads the Board to propose the renewal of his mandate for a 

four-year term.
• Mr. Lip-Bu Tan holds three offices in listed companies in addition to 

his office at Schneider Electric: Chairman of Cadence Design 
Systems, Inc., from which he retired as Chief Executive Officer in 
2021 and will retire as Chairman on May 4, 2023 as he announced 
he will not seek re-election to the Board at the 2023 Annual Meeting 
(https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000813672/

cd2ef8b8-abb5-4620-a08d-c5c49565fc6c.pdf), Chairman of the 
Board of Directors of Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. and 
Director of Intel Corporation. After the 2023 Cadence’s Annual 
Meeting planned on May 4, Mr. Lip-Bu Tan will therefore hold two 
offices in listed companies in addition to his office at Schneider 
Electric. In view of his commitments, the Governance and 
Remunerations Committee has carefully examined his situation. In 
particular, it has ascertained from him his willingness and 
commitment to devote sufficient and necessary time to the Board 
of Schneider Electric, as Mr. Lip-Bu Tan has always done in the 
past, as evidenced by his level of attendance at Board meetings in 
2022 (100%) and at the meetings of the committees in which he 
participates (90%), as well as his physical participation in several 
meetings, including the Strategy Session in August 2022. His 
average attendance rate at Board and committee meetings over his 
term of office (2019-2022) was 94% and 97.5% respectively, 
reflecting his commitment and availability. The Committee also took 

into consideration the assessment of Mr. Lip-Bu Tan’s effective 
contribution to the work of the Board that was conducted among the 

Directors in October 2022 during the Board’s self-assessment, 
which concluded that Mr. Lip-Bu Tan brings to the Board unique 
expertise in the areas of software and technology, particularly in the 
energy sector, venture capital, and in-depth knowledge of the Asian 

and US markets. For all of these reasons, the Board has determined 

that his continued service as a Director is in the best interests of the 
Company, its shareholders, and is consistent with the composition 

objectives identified by the Board, and therefore invites to reappoint 

Mr. Lip Bu-Tan for a four-year term.

The Governance & Remunerations Committee also identified the 

skills that would be useful to diversify and strengthen the Board 

composition and hired an external recruitment firm (Heidrick & 

Struggles) to search for suitable candidates. Among these 

candidates, the Governance & Remunerations Committee 

preselected a shortlist and the members of the Committee 

interviewed the short-listed candidates. Following these interviews, 

the Committee recommended two candidates to the Board of 

Directors, Mr. Abhay Parasnis and Mrs. Giulia Chierchia, who were 

appointed as Observers respectively on July 27, 2022, and 

February 15, 2023, with the aim to propose their appointment to the 

2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

Mr. Abhay Parasnis, a US citizen based in San Francisco and an 

entrepreneur, is Adobe’s former Chief Technology Officer and Chief 

Product Officer and serves on the Board of Directors at Dropbox. 

He will bring to the Board his remarkable technology and digital 

skills, especially his experience in shifting to the cloud and in SaaS 

transformation, as well as his spirit on innovation and reinvention. 

He will qualify as an independent Director with regard to all the 

criteria set by Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate 

Governance Code and, if appointed, will join the Digital Committee.

Mrs. Giulia Chierchia, an Italian and Belgian dual citizen based in 

the United Kingdom, is currently Executive Vice-President of 

Strategy, Sustainability and Ventures at BP. She will bring to the 

Board her expertise in ESG and energy sector, in particular, her 

experience in energy transition strategy in large companies with a 

global approach including strategy, sustainability, capital allocation 

and ventures. She will qualify as an independent Director with 

regard to all the criteria set by Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF 

Corporate Governance Code and, if appointed, will join the 

Investment Committee.

4.1.2.4 Skills and diversity

Diversity policy within the Board of Directors and 

within the management of the Company

The Board of Directors pays due attention to its composition and 

that of its committees. It relies on the works of the Governance & 

Remunerations Committee which reviews regularly and proposes 

as often as required, the relevant changes to the composition of the 

Board of Directors and its committees depending on the Group’s 

strategy.

In that respect, in conformity with its internal regulations, the Board 

of Directors ensures through its proposals and its decisions that:

• Its composition reflects the international nature of the Group’s 

activities and of its shareholders by having a significant number 

of members of non-French nationality;

• It protects the independence of the Board through the 

competence, availability, and courage of its members;

• It ensures open and unrestricted speech;

• It pursues its objective of diversifying the Board of Directors in 

compliance with the legal principle of attaining balanced 

representation between men and women on the Board;

• It appoints persons with the expertise required for developing 

and implementing the Group strategy while considering the 

objectives of diversity based on criteria such as age, 

professional skills, nationality, and background;

• Employee shareholders and employees shall continue to be 

represented on the Board in compliance with the provisions set 

forth in Articles 11.3 and 11.4 of the Articles of Association; and

• It preserves the continuity of the Board by changing some of its 

members at regular intervals, if necessary, by anticipating the 

expiry of members’ terms of office.

As prescribed by Article L. 225-18-1 and L. 22-10-3 of the French 

Commercial Code, the proportion of Directors of each gender must 

be at least 40%, it being specified that the Directors representing 

the employees and the Director representing the employee 

shareholders are not counted to assess said proportion of 40% 

(Articles L. 225-27 and. L. 225-23 of the French Commercial Code).

The gender diversity ratio of the Board of Directors, should the 

appointments of Mrs. Giulia Chierchia and Mr. Abhay Parasnis be 

confirmed at the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, will reach 

46% (excluding the employee Directors and the representative 

employee shareholders’ Director).

Schneider Electric is deeply committed towards diversity in general 

and gender diversity in particular. Schneider Electric focuses on 

taking proactive measures to encourage a balanced representation 

of men and women at the leadership level: the portion of women at 

the Executive Committee level was 46% in 2022 (vs. 44% in 2021. 

For the leadership pool, comprising of the top leaders (around 

1,000 employees), the female representation is 28% (an increase of 

+2 points vs. 2021).

At its meeting on December 14, 2022, the Board of Directors 

reviewed Senior Management’s ambitions regarding the balanced 

representation of men and women at the leadership level and noted 

that the objectives are set to:

• At least 40% of women at the Executive Committee; and

• At least 30% of women among the leadership (Vice-President 

and above; around 1,016 employees).

To achieve these objectives and further improve gender diversity, 

the Group aims at attracting female talents by offering a training 

leadership program and dedicated mentoring, an equal treatment 

policy, and a tailored family leave policy.

Skills within the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors frequently assesses the skills to include in 

its skills matrix in order to meet the Company’s strategic needs, and 

a review of some peer comparisons. It reviews its composition and 

expertise to identify skills, relevant to Schneider Electric’s current 

and future activities, that could be strengthened in the future or 

would deserve a stronger disclosure/narrative.

Schneider Electric’s Board, assessed against these skills, appears 

strong and balanced, and globally well positioned. The Board 

comprises individuals from diverse and complementary 

professional and cultural backgrounds, true to the Group’s history 

and values. This enables it to perform its duties collectively and 

constructively.

The experience and expertise brought to the Board by each 

Director at the date of this Universal Registration Document can be 

summarized as follows.

4.1.2.5 Independence and conflict of interests

Independent Directors

Each year, as provided under the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors, on the report of the Governance & 

Remunerations Committee, dedicates one of the points on its agenda to the qualification of its members as independent with regard to the 

criteria for independence set out in Article 10.5 of this Code as presented in the table below.

Criterion 1: Employee or Corporate Officer within the previous five years

Not to be and not to have been within the previous five years:

• an employee or executive Corporate Officer of the Company;

• an employee, executive Corporate Officer, or Director of a company consolidated with the Company;

• an employee, executive Corporate Officer, or Director of the Company’s parent company or a company consolidated with this 

parent company.

Criterion 2: Cross-directorships

Not to be an executive Corporate Officer of a company in which the Company holds a directorship, directly or indirectly, or in which an 

employee appointed as such or an executive Corporate Officer of the Company (currently in office or having held such office within 

the last five years) holds a directorship.

Criterion 3: Significant business relationships

Not to be a customer, supplier, commercial banker, investment banker, or consultant:

• that is significant to the Company or its group;

• or for which the Company or its group represents a significant portion of its activity.

The assessment of the significance or otherwise of the relationship with the Company or its group must be debated by the Board and 

the quantitative and qualitative criteria that led to this evaluation (continuity, economic dependence, exclusivity, etc.) must be explicitly 

stated in the annual report.

Criterion 4: Family ties

Not to be related by close family ties to a Corporate Officer.

Criterion 5: Auditor

Not to have been an auditor of the Company within the previous five years.

Criterion 6: Period of office exceeding 12 years

Not to have been a Director of the Company for more than 12 years. Loss of the status of independent Director occurs on the date of 

the 12th anniversary.

Criterion 7: Status of non-executive Corporate Officer

A non-executive Corporate Officer cannot be considered independent if he or she receives variable compensation in cash or in the 

form of securities or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or Group.

Criterion 8: Status of the major shareholder

Directors representing major shareholders of the Company or its parent company may be considered independent, provided these 

shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company. Nevertheless, beyond a 10% threshold in capital or voting rights, the 

Board, upon a report from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, should systematically review the qualification as independent 

in light of the Company’s shareholding structure and the existence of a potential conflict of interest.

Upon recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations 

Committee, the Board of Directors, during its meeting of February 

15, 2023, reviewed the independence of each Board member in 

regard of the criteria reminded above.

• With regard specifically to independence in terms of business 

relations, the Board of Directors noted that, due to:

(i) The absence of business relations between the Directors and 

Schneider Electric;

(ii) The nature of Schneider Electric activities and those of the 

companies in which members of the Board of Directors are 

employed or serve as Directors; and

(iii) The amounts, either unitary or global, of operations 

performed or that may be performed between Schneider 

Electric and these companies that are agreed at arm’s length 

and that are by no means likely to be referred to the Board of 

Directors;

 the existing business relations between Schneider Electric and 

these companies in which the members of the Board of Directors 

are employed or serve as officers are not likely to prejudice their 

independence, indeed, when such operations exist, they are 

agreed at arm’s length and their amounts, representing less 

than 0.1% of the consolidated turnover of each group, are 

without a doubt insignificant for each party, in particular with 

regard to respective size of the groups concerned.

 Among fourteen Directors, nine are independent according to 

the definition prescribed by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate 

Governance Code: Mrs. Nive Bhagat, Mrs. Cécile Cabanis, 

Mr. Fred Kindle, Mrs. Linda Knoll, Mrs. Jill Lee, Mrs. Anna 

Ohlsson-Leijon, Mr. Anders Runevad, Mr. Gregory Spierkel,  

and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan.

• Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, as Chief Executive Officer, 

Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, as the employee shareholders representative, 

Mrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Bruno Turchet as employee Directors, 

and Mr. Léo Apotheker, who has served on the Board for over  

12 years, are not considered to be independent Directors under 

the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code.

• The AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code recommends 

that, in non-controlled companies, the Board comprises at least 

50% independent Directors (Directors representing employee 

shareholders and employees are not computed in calculating 

this percentage). The proportion of independent Directors of the 

Company, excluding Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, Mrs. Rita Felix, and 

Mr. Bruno Turchet, is therefore 82%. The proportion would rise 

to 85% should the renewal of Mr. Léo Apotheker, Mr. Gregory 

Spierkel, and M. Lip-Bu Tan, and the appointments of 

Mrs. Giulia Chierchia and Mr. Abhay Parasnis, who will qualify 

as independent Directors with regard to all the criteria set by 

Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, 

be voted in by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting as per, 

respectively, the 12th, 13th, 14th,15th, and 16th resolutions.

2022 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting

The Board approved the agenda and draft resolutions of the 2022 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, and its report to the shareholders at the 

meeting. It was informed of the positions expressed by the shareholders met during the preparation of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting 

and took note of the proxy-advisors’ reports. It approved the responses to the written questions.

The 2022 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting met physically. It approved all resolutions supported by management, including those relating to 

the composition of the Board of Directors, the compensation of the Corporate Officers, and the renewal of financial authorizations.

In application of the provisions of Article 1.C.3 of the internal 

regulations, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director 

convenes executive sessions of the Board of Directors (without the 

Corporate Officers) at the end of each Board meeting. In 2022, the 

Board of Directors held seven “executive sessions”, vs. five in 2021.

In addition, when the Board debated and determined the 

compensation of the Chairman & CEO, the interested party was not 

present, as prescribed by Article 10.2 of the internal regulations, 

unless solicited to provide information on specific issues.

4.1.3.2 Succession planning

Board members

The Board of Directors shall have at least three and up to 18 

members, all of whom must be natural persons elected by the 

shareholders at the Shareholders’ Meeting. However, in case of 

death or resignation of a member, the Board may co-opt a new 

member. This appointment is then subject to ratification at the next 

Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

Directors are appointed for four-year terms (renewable). However, 

from the age of 70, Directors are re-elected or appointed for a period 

of two years. No more than one-third of the Directors may be 70 

years old or over.

Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma represents the employee shareholders in 

accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-23 and L. 22-10-5 

of the French Commercial Code. She was elected at the Annual 

Shareholders’ Meeting upon the recommendation of the supervisory 

boards of the FCPEs.

Mrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Bruno Turchet represent the employees in 

accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-27-1 of the French 

Commercial Code. They were appointed respectively by the 

European Works Council and by the most representative trade union 

organization in France in pursuance of Article 11.4 of the Articles of 

Association.

Director selection process

The independent Director selection process is led by the Vice-

Chairman & Lead Independent Director and Chairman of the 

Governance & Remunerations Committee. When one or more 

directorships become vacant, or more broadly when the Board of 

Directors wishes to expand or modify its composition, the 

Governance & Remunerations Committee documents and ranks the 

selection criteria for potential candidates, taking into account the 

desired balance and diversity in the Board’s composition. The 

Committee takes into account the diversity policy and the objectives 

defined by the Board of Directors in term of skillset.

Based on these criteria, the Committee steers the search for and 

selection of new Directors, where appropriate with the assistance of 

an external consultant, and conducts the necessary verifications. 

The members of the Governance & Remunerations Committee then 

interview the candidates and issue a recommendation to the Board 

of Directors.

In preparation of the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the 

Governance & Remunerations Committee focused on furthering the 

international diversification of the Board of Directors and maintaining 

the number of women Directors, as well as adding digital and 

sustainability expertise. A specific selection process exists for 

Directors representing employees and Directors representing 

employee shareholders, in accordance with prevailing regulations.

Succession planning for Corporate Officers

Succession plans at Schneider Electric correspond to a systematic, 

structured process for identifying and preparing employees with 

potential to fill key organizational positions, should the position 

become vacant. This process applies to all key positions including 

the Chairman & CEO position. Succession plans aim at ensuring a 

continued effective performance of the organization by providing for 

the availability of experienced and capable employees who are 

prepared to assume these roles as they become available. 

Succession plans are necessary processes to reduce risk of vacant 

positions or skill gap transitions, create a pipeline of future leaders, 

ensure full business continuity, and improve employee motivation 

and engagement.

The mission of the Governance & Remunerations Committee 

includes preparing for the future of the Company’s executive bodies, 

in particular through the establishment of a succession plan for 

executive officers. The plan, which is reviewed at meetings of the 

Governance & Remunerations Committee, addresses various 

scenarios:

• Unplanned vacancy due to prohibition, resignation, or death; and

• Planned vacancy due to retirement or expiration of term of office.

Through its work and discussions, the Committee seeks to devise a 

succession plan that is adaptable to situations arising in the short, 

medium or long term. The Governance & Remunerations Committee:

• Provides the Board with progress reports, in particular at 

executive sessions;

• Works closely with the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer to  

(i) ensure the plan is consistent with the Company’s own 

practices and market practices, (ii) ensure high-potential internal 

prospects receive appropriate support and training, and  

(iii) check there is adequate monitoring of key posts likely  

to fall vacant;

• Meets with key executives.

The succession plan announced on February 15, 2023 is described 

in section 4.1.1.2.1 of the Universal Registration Document.

4.1 Governance Report

4.1.3.3 Self-assessment of the Board of Directors

Pursuant to its internal regulations, Schneider Electric SE’s Board of Directors annually reviews its composition, organization, and 

operations, as well as those of its committees. This yearly assessment is carried out through a written questionnaire sent to Board members 

or interviews with Board members. The evaluation is conducted under the leadership of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director by 

the Secretary of the Board of Directors. In addition, as per the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors shall 

undertake at least once every three years, a formal self-assessment, which may be conducted with the assistance of an external consultant.

Internal self-assessment conducted in September and October 2022

An internal assessment was conducted by the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, who guaranteed the confidentiality of opinions 

expressed, based on a questionnaire answered anonymously by Board members.

The report was presented and discussed in detail at the Governance & Remunerations Committee meeting on October 25, 2022, and a 

summary report was presented to the Board of Directors on October 26, 2022. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director provided 

individual feedback on the assessments of the effective contribution of each Director.

Themes

(i) Membership and dynamics of the Board; (ii) Mission, organization, and operation of the Board; (iii) Works of the Committees; (iv) 

On-boarding program of the new members; (v) Deep dive on the Strategy Session; (vi) 2022/2023 top Board priorities; and (vii) Effective 

contribution of each Director.

Key findings

• Involvement and contribution of Board members is perceived as very high;

• Excellent leadership and contribution of the Chairman & CEO who is described as best in class, strong, open, inclusive, engaged, 

charismatic, and strategic thinking;

• Perfect fit between the Chairman & CEO and the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director who have developed a balanced and 

complementary relationship;

• Quality of relations between the Board and management is unanimously seen as trustful and supportive (everyone feel free to express 

his opinion);

• Board members are satisfied with the agendas, which are well designed and balanced between business, financial, and governance 

topics;

• Social and environmental dimensions are systematically taken into account in all discussions with the Board;

• Board size is considered adequate;

• All committees operate properly, and their work are satisfactory and useful to the Board decision making process;

• Overall, the on-boarding program is considered as very valuable by all the new Board members; and

• High quality Strategy session which is very useful, well organized, and tailored to discuss the key strategic topics for Schneider Electric.

Areas for improvement

• Large majority of Board members consider that the span of skills brought to the Board is adequate but could be reinforced in energy markets, 

Robotics/Automation/AI, and ESG;

• Information provided in advance of Board meetings could be more selective and synthetic;

• Allocation of committee assignments between members is adequate but there should be a periodic rotation of assignments; and

• Reports to the Board by business/region function leaders could be provided with a regular cadence.

4.1.3.4 Information and training of the 
Board of Directors and its members

Information given to Directors

To ensure that the Board of Directors is well informed at all times, 

Schneider Electric SE applies the following rules: members of the 

Board have access, via a secure dedicated platform, in principle, 

ten days before every Board meeting, to the agenda for the 

meeting and to the draft minutes of the last meeting and, four to five 

days before, to the Board’s file.

Executive Committee members are invited, depending on the 

subject, to present the major issues within their areas of 

responsibility. Statutory auditors attend the portion of the Board’s 

meetings at which the full year and half year financial statements 

are reviewed.

In addition, each year a Board meeting called “Strategy Session” is 

held in the form of a seminar and invites key executives of the 

Group to contribute to Board discussions. These seminars also 

enable Directors to constantly refine their understanding of the 

challenges facing the Group through themed-based presentations 

and site visits.

Furthermore, the Board organizes a range of specific training 

sessions throughout the year to help Directors increase their 

knowledge of the Group (through presentations of its ecosystem, 

challenges, businesses, and some of its regions) and its 

competitive environment, as well as recent market disruption trends 

and technological developments. 

Between each meeting of the Board of Directors, aside from 

meetings that they may have with the Chairman & CEO, Directors 

receive information through relevant financial analysts’ reports and 

other documents. Board members also have the opportunity to 

meet informally with key members of Senior Management.

Board of Director dinners are organized in order to offer more 

opportunities to interact with investors, customers, experts, etc. 

These dinners are meant to provide Board members with external 

views on the Group, to increase their understanding of the changes 

in its business environment, and to gain more insight on the needs 

and motivations of all stakeholders. In 2022, six dinners were 

organized.

On-boarding program of new Directors

A complete on-boarding program is provided to any new Director 

in order to help him/her to get a deep understanding of the 

business, the challenges, and priorities of Schneider Electric as 

well as its governance and values. As such, new Directors are 

offered a training and information program on the Group’s strategy 

and businesses, designed around a common core which 

comprises of:

• A set of documents including, in particular, the last Universal 

Registration Document and integrated report, the Company’s 

Articles of Association, the internal regulations of the Board of 

Directors, the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the 

Compliance Code governing stock-market transactions (see 

below), the minutes of the Board’s and committees’ meetings for 

the period starting from the appointment back to the full year 

before, and the Directors’ and officers’ liability master policy;

• A summary relating to the Group organization;

• Working meetings with the Chief Financial Officer and Executive 

Vice-Presidents of Strategy, Energy Management, Industrial 

Automation, and other EVPs as the case may be;

• A work session with the secretary of the committee(s) he/she will 

join;

• Concerning governance and values: a work session with the 

Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, the Chief 

Governance Officer, as well as with the persons in charge of 

compliance, ethics and sustainable development;

• To know more about Schneider Electric’s shareholding structure 

and shareholders’ expectations, an interview with the Senior 

Vice-President Investors Relations;

• Training on the use of the secure dedicated platform on which 

all the Board’s files are filed and kept;

• The designation of a mentor for any new Director to facilitate his/

her integration;

• As the case may be, visits to sites which are particularly 

illustrative of Schneider Electric’s activities.

In addition, the Directors representing employees, Mrs. Rita Felix 

and Mr. Bruno Turchet, benefit from a training program compliant 

with legal requirements and approved by the Board of Directors. In 

pursuance of new French regulations coming from law nº 2019-486 

of May 22, 2019, relating to companies’ growth and transformation, 

known as PACTE law, the Director representing the employee 

shareholders, Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, was offered a tailored training 

session to address her needs.

Compliance Code governing stock-market 

transactions

Schneider Electric has adopted a Compliance Code governing 

stock-market transactions for members of the Board of Directors 

and Group employees, designed to prevent insider trading. Under 

these provisions, both Directors and relevant employees are barred 

from trading in the Company shares and shares in companies for 

which they have inside information that has not yet been made 

public. In addition, they may not trade in Schneider Electric SE 

shares during the 31 days preceding the day following publication 

of the annual and interim financial statements, nor during the 16 

days preceding the day following publication of a quarterly update, 

nor may they engage in any type of speculative trading involving 

Schneider Electric SE shares (including margin trading, 

purchasing, and selling shares in a period of less than four months). 

In addition, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate 

Governance Code, Corporate Officers also undertake not to enter 

into hedges of shares resulting from exercise of options and of 

Performance Shares they are required to hold (see section 4.1.2.6 

of Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document). These 

restrictions supplement the prohibition against hedging unvested 

stock options and Performance Shares during their vesting period.

The Compliance Code governing stock-market transactions was 

revised when the European “Market Abuse Regulation” nº 2014/596 

of April 16, 2014, entered into force, and subsequently updated in 

December 2018. The regulation obliges companies to draw up 

insider lists, and market operators to put in place mechanisms 

aimed at preventing and detecting suspicious transactions, 

enabling them to report to the Autorité des Marchés Financiers 

those that seem to them to constitute insider dealing.

The Compliance Code provides for:

• The existence of an ethics officer, who is the Secretary of the 

Board of Directors, advising on whether information is inside or 

not; and

• Rules for establishing, updating, and keeping in the prescribed 

electronic format a list of insiders whenever necessary, lists of 

persons subject to black-out periods, and possible 

confidentiality and abstention lists identifying the persons, 

whether from Schneider Electric or external to the Group, who 

have access to a piece of sensitive information that does not yet 

qualify as inside information according to the legal definition. 

Schneider Electric has deployed a digital tool to manage these 

lists which automates their processing and ensures better 

traceability.

4.1 Governance Report

4.1.5 Report of the  
Vice-Chairman & Lead 
Independent Director of 
the Board of Directors
Mr. Fred Kindle hereby reports on the work he carried out in 2022 

as part of his responsibilities as Vice-Chairman & Lead 

Independent Director. He was appointed as Vice-Chairman on 

April 23, 2020, in replacement of Mr. Léo Apotheker.

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is appointed by 

the Board of Directors in pursuance of Article 12 of the Articles of 

Association, which provide for the appointment of a Vice-Chairman 

with the function of a Lead Independent Director if the roles of 

Chairman & CEO are combined. In compliance with Article 12 of 

the Articles of Association, the duties of the Vice-Chairman & Lead 

Independent Director are defined by the internal regulations of the 

Board of Directors. Those internal regulations can be found in 

section 4.1.6 of Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document.

Information on the Vice-Chairman  

& Lead Independent Director

To be able to carry out his duties, the Vice-Chairman & Lead 

Independent Director must have excellent knowledge of the Group 

and be particularly well informed about its business performance.

As such, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is 

apprised of current events and the performance of the Group 

through weekly exchanges with the Chairman & CEO. He meets 

regularly with members of the Group Executive Committee and 

pursues regular interactions with managers and other employees of 

the Group in various sites of Schneider Electric.

In addition, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director 

interacts regularly with the other members of the Board of 

Directors. Twice a year, in June and in December, he meets 

individually with each of the other Directors to obtain their feedback 

on the current situation of the Company, their possible concerns, 

and their wishes.

He is continuously kept informed of the evolution of the competitive 

environment, technological breakthroughs, and business 

opportunities. Additionally, he is the Chairperson of the 

Governance & Remunerations Committee and a member of the 

Human Resources & CSR Committee.

Participation in the preparation of the meetings of 

the Board

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director participated in 

the preparation for meetings of the Board of Directors. As a result, 

he has participated in all the “pre-Board” meetings. Each meeting 

of the Board of Directors is preceded by one or two pre-Board 

meetings, in which the Chairman & CEO, the Vice-Chairman & 

Lead Independent Director, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief 

Governance Officer, and the Secretary of the Board of Directors 

review the topics and issues addressed by the committees, and 

establish the agenda set by the Chairman & CEO and the content 

of the meeting file.

Executive sessions

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director chairs the 

executive sessions (i.e., the meetings where Board members meet 

without the presence of the Corporate Officer), convened at the 

end of each Board meeting. The employee Directors are invited to 

attend all executive sessions following meetings of the Board at 

which they are present.

The Board of Directors held seven executive sessions in 2022 

during which its members expressed their views and observations 

on, among others, the Group’s strategic options and the 

succession planning of the Corporate Officer. The Vice-Chairman 

& Lead Independent Director reported the conclusions thereof to 

the Chairman & CEO.

Interaction with shareholders

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is the designated 

contact for the shareholders on matters pertaining to corporate 

governance. He carried out two shareholder engagement 

campaigns in 2022: one before the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting 

to present to those who so wished, the resolutions submitted for the 

shareholders’ approval; the other one, in the fall semester, to freely 

exchange views on topical themes of corporate governance that do 

not necessarily materialize in resolutions submitted for the 

shareholders’ approval. On this occasion, the Vice-Chairman & 

Lead Independent Director discussed investors’ representatives 

the growing importance of social and environmental topics at the 

Board of Directors and their reflection in the Corporate Officers’ 

compensation. Overall, these two campaigns comprised 24 

face-to-face or phone meetings with governance analysts of major 

shareholders from a wide range of corporate governance cultures 

and covered around 39% of the share capital. The conclusions of 

these discussions have been reported in detail to the Governance 

& Remunerations Committee and contributed to its on-going 

thought process on governance matters. A report thereon was 

subsequently made to the Board.

Other duties

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director conducted the 

annual deliberation of the Board on its composition, organization, 

and operations as well as those of its committees. In 2022, this 

self-assessment was carried out internally. The conclusions of this 

assessment, which highlighted the quest for continuous 

improvement, are presented in section 4.1.3.3 of Chapter 4 of this 

Universal Registration Document.

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director has also had 

frequent contacts with each of the Directors. He ensured that there 

was no conflict of interest within the Board of Directors, which he 

would have been responsible for bringing to the attention of the 

Chairman.

4.1.7 Regulated agreements and commitments

4.1.7.1 Review of the Regulated Agreements and Commitments entered into by Schneider 
Electric SE

No agreements were concluded during the year that would have required approval by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with 

article L. 225-38 of the French Commercial Code.

4.1.7.2 Procedure for assessing agreements relating to ordinary business operations 
concluded under normal conditions

The Board of Directors, at its meeting of December 11, 2019, established a procedure for regularly assessing whether agreements relating 

to ordinary business operations concluded under normal conditions meet these conditions. Any persons directly or indirectly concerned by 

any of these agreements shall not participate in its assessment.

The procedure is comprised of two phases:

• The assessment of the application of Schneider Electric SE’s internal charter for regulated agreements approved by the Board of 

Directors on February 19, 2020, which results in an annual business report drawn up jointly by the legal department and the Secretary of 

the Board of Directors. This report is made available to the Audit & Risks Committee for preparing the evaluation report it draws up for 

the Board of Directors; and

• The assessment by the Board of Directors of criteria for qualifying agreements relating to ordinary business operations concluded under 

normal conditions which deliberates on the basis of the above-mentioned assessment report drawn up by the Audit & Risks Committee.

According to this procedure, the Governance & Remunerations Committee reviewed at its meeting of December 12, 2022, the relevance of 

criteria for qualifying agreements relating to ordinary business operations concluded under normal conditions as defined by the procedure 

and decided not to amend it.

C O R P O R A T E  G O V E R N A N C E  R E P O R TChapter 4 – Corporate governance report

4.2 Compensation Report

The compensation report presented below reflects the Group’s 

governance change announced on February 16, 2023. The Board 

of Directors nominated Mr. Peter Herweck to succeed to Mr. 

Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chief Executive Officer at the date of the 

Annual General Meeting scheduled for May 4, 2023. Mr. Jean-

Pascal Tricoire will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of 

Directors from that date, while Mr. Peter Herweck will assume the 

role of Chief Executive Officer as the sole executive corporate 

officer.

In line with this new governance structure, the Group will have:

• a governance structure with a Chairman & CEO (Mr. Jean-

Pascal Tricoire) from January 1, 2023 until May 3, 2023;

• a governance structure with a Chairman of the Board of 

Directors (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire) and a Chief Executive 

Officer (Mr. Peter Herweck) from May 4, 2023.

This section includes a complete description of the components of 

remuneration for the corporate officers, including the following 

components on which the Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2023, 

is invited to vote:

• with regard to 2022:

 − for the Chairman & CEO (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire): the 

components which make up the total remuneration and the 

benefits of all kinds paid during 2022 or awarded in respect 

of 2022 (subject of the 6th resolution proposed to the Annual 

General Meeting);

 − for the Board members of Schneider Electric: the 

components of remuneration presented in the Report on 

Corporate Governance pursuant to Article L. 22-10-9 I of the 

French Commercial Code (subject of the 5th resolution 

proposed to the Annual General Meeting);

• with regard to 2023, the remuneration policies which will be 

applicable:

 − to the Chairman & CEO (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire) for the 

period running from January 1, 2023 to May 3, 2023 (subject 

of the 7th resolution proposed to the Annual General 

Meeting);

 − to the Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Peter Herweck) for the 

period running from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023 

(subject of the 8th resolution proposed to the Annual General 

Meeting);

 − to the Chairman of the Board of Directors (Mr. Jean-Pascal 

Tricoire) for the period running from May 4, 2023 to 

December 31, 2023 (subject of the 9th resolution proposed to 

the Annual General Meeting);

 − to the Board members for the full year 2023 (subject of the 

11th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting).

The information included in this section also takes into account the 

provisions of the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance for 

listed companies, as interpreted by the Haut Comité de 

Gouvernement d’Entreprise (French High Committee on Corporate 

Governance) and the AMF’s recommendations.

4.2.1 Overview
The compensation paid or granted to the Corporate Officer in 2021 

was approved by more than 84% of our shareholders at the 2022 

Annual General Meeting and the 2022 compensation policy was 

supported by more than 89% of the shareholders at the 2022 

Annual Shareholders’ meeting.

As in previous years, in 2022, key remuneration topics were 

discussed with Schneider Electric’s largest shareholders. 

Schneider Electric representatives notably met with 24 investors 

during the year, representing more than 39% of the issued share 

capital, over 2 rounds of governance roadshow; in April, ahead of 

the Annual General Meeting to discuss matters submitted to the 

shareholders’ vote and in the fall to discuss broader ESG topics. 

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director took part into 

discussions with 19 of these investors. Feedback was reported to 

the Governance & Remunerations Committee and to the Board of 

Directors. This dialogue will be pursued in 2023 to ensure that the 

Board takes the feedback into account to determine the 

compensation policy of the Corporate Officers.

The Board values the comments received during these 

engagements with shareholders. Although there were no 

unanimous or major concerns being raised, the Board took the 

opportunity of the change of governance to incorporate some of 

the sensitivities mentioned by shareholders into its decisions.

Considering Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is stepping down as Chief 

Executive Officer on May 3, 2023, the Board decided not to increase 

his fixed remuneration for the period from January 1, 2023 until 

May 3, 2023 and almost not to change his compensation policy from 

the one applied in 2022. When positioning the fixed compensation of 

Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chairman of the Board for the period 

starting on May 4, 2023, the Board used notably an in-depth study of 

industry practices in term of compensation and also took into 

account the specific missions assigned to him by the Board.

In designing the remuneration policy applicable to the new Chief 

Executive Officer, the Board wished to maintain an overall stability 

in the compensation structure, which demonstravely drives the 

right behaviors, appears balanced, provides market competitive 

pay, and ensures a strong link between pay and performance, a 

strong alignment with both employees and shareholders, as well as 

a focus on the long-term. The Board also took into account 

shareholders’ feedback and considered Peter Herweck’s expertise 

and past experience, and proposed some adjustments (see 

section 4.2.3 of this Universal Registration Document presenting 

the remuneration policy).

C O R P O R A T E  G O V E R N A N C E  R E P O R TChapter 4 – Corporate governance report

4.2.2 Report on the compensation granted or paid 
during the 2022 fiscal year (say on pay ex-post)
4.2.2.1 Pillars and principles

The principles and criteria determining the 2022 compensation described in this section were supported by the shareholders at the 

Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 5, 2022. They are deemed to constitute the last policy approved by the shareholders in the 

meaning of Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code and govern the entirety of the compensation granted by the Group to the 

Corporate Officers until the next policy is approved by the shareholders.

Pillar How it is reflected in the Group 2022 compensation policy

Pay-for-performance Principle 1: Prevalence of variable components: circa 80% for CEO (at target).

A prevalent part of the Corporate Officer target package shall be variable; the 2022 target 

package thus consists of approximately 80% variable pay component (excluding pension 

payments).

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer:  

On target pay mix

Fixed 

17%

Annual 

incentive 23%

Performance shares 

60%

17% 83%

Principle 2: Performance evaluated via economic and measurable criteria.

Performance is evaluated via criteria that are mainly economic (80% of variable cash 

compensation and 75% of multi-year Performance Shares) and measurable, which are selected 

based on KPIs used in the market communication and drivers of the Group’s strategy. All criteria 

have measurable targets approved by the Board at the beginning of the performance period, 

ensuring targets are achievable but demanding.

Principle 3: Financial and Sustainability objectives are fairly balanced and 
distributed between short-term (annual incentive) and medium-term (long-term 
incentive) components.

2022 Annual incentive (80% financial/ 

20% sustainability):

• 40% Group organic sales growth

• 30% Adjusted EBITA margin (organic) 

improvement

• 10% Group cash conversion rate

• 20% Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI)

2022 Long-term incentive (75% 

financial/ 25% sustainability):

• 40% Adjusted Earning per Share (EPS) 

• 35% Relative Total Shareholder Return

• 25% Schneider Sustainability External & 

Relative Index (SSERI)

Alignment with 

shareholders’ interests

Principle 4: Significant proportion of the total compensation delivered in shares.

The Corporate Officer’s target package consists of approximately 60% long-term share-based 

compensation, meaning their compensation is subject to the same share price volatility that 

shareholders experience.

Principle 5: Performance conditions aligned to shareholders’ expectations and 
Schneider Electric’s strategic priorities.

Performance criteria were selected from financial indicators that are most representative of Group 

performance and that are closely linked to shareholder value creation. Performance levels required 

to reach targets were set at the beginning of the performance period in line with the objectives 

disclosed to the market at the same time as the results of the previous fiscal year and were 

supplemented by factors that enable the Group to offer a long-term and satisfactory development 

outlook for all stakeholders in the Company’s success.

Competitiveness Principle 6: To benchmark the Corporate Officer’s compensation package “at 
target” in the median range of the Company’s peer group.

Schneider Electric competes for talent in a global marketplace. Most of the Group’s key 

competitors are headquartered outside France. To reflect this, the international peer group 

consists of 24 French, European, and US companies that are comparable to Schneider Electric in 

size or industry sector, or that represent a potential source of recruitment or attrition. Compensation 

levels for the Corporate Officer are reviewed annually and benchmarked by reference to the 

median of this peer group to ensure they remain reasonable and appropriately competitive. This 

benchmarking is primarily used to establish a frame of reference for what competitors are paying 

to comparable roles, rather than as the main factor for making compensation decisions.

The 2022 peer group comprises European and US-based companies:

• Business competitors (in particular, those identified in the Long-term incentive plan as 

performance peers for TSR comparison purposes);

• Talent competitors for operational and functional roles; and

• “Acceptance” peers (i.e. similar groups in terms of size, business, or structure).

position within these panels.

(1) The annual incentive for the fiscal year 2021 was paid in 2022 after approval by the shareholders at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of May 5, 2022 of the 8th 

resolution relating to the compensation paid, due, or awarded to Jean-Pascal Tricoire in respect of the 2021 fiscal year. Hence, the total compensation in cash 

actually paid in the fiscal year 2022 to Jean-Pascal Tricoire amounts to €3,563,241 (2022 fixed compensation + 2021 annual incentive + fixed portion of pension 

benefit for 2022 + variable portion of pension benefit for 2021). Likewise, in accordance with Article L.22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code, the variable 

elements in cash awarded to Jean-Pascal Tricoire for the financial year 2022 will only be paid in 2023, subject to their prior approval by the shareholders at the Annual 

Shareholders’ Meeting of May 4, 2023 under the 6th resolution.

(2) Value of Performance Shares granted during fiscal year – As per AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code methodology, compensation is presented on a 

reported basis. Long-term incentives for the fiscal year include Performance Shares granted during the fiscal year, the performance period of which has not elapsed. 

The value of Performance Shares corresponds to the number of shares granted, before reduction on account of performance, multiplied by the share price 

determined in line with IFRS accounting standards.

(3) Value of Performance Shares deemed vested during the fiscal year – In order to facilitate the analysis, the Long-term incentives are also presented on realized 

value basis, where the value of Performance Shares corresponds to the actual number of shares (granted in previous years) deemed vested at the end of the fiscal 

year, after reduction for performance conditions, multiplied by the share price on December 31, 2021 or 2022, as the case may be.

(4) Other benefits include company car, employer matching contributions to capital increase for employees or contributions to Employee Saving Plan and to collective 

Pension Saving Plan (PERECO) as well as benefits from French profit-sharing plan.

Say on pay table relating to the compensation paid or granted to the Chairman & CEO in 2022

The fixed, variable, and exceptional components of the total compensation and benefits paid or awarded for the fiscal year 2022 to the 

Corporate Officer, as detailed below, will be submitted to the shareholders for approval at the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of May 4, 

2023 under the 6th resolution.

The tables below summarize the compensation paid during the past fiscal year and compensation awarded for the past fiscal year, along 

with a description of how each component was calculated in compliance with the compensation policy in force.

Reminder of the 2022 compensation policy
For the fiscal year 2022, his theoretical gross annual fixed compensation was set by the Board 

of Directors at €1,000,000 upon recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations 

Committee.

Application of the 2022 compensation policy
Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire received in 2022 a fixed compensation of €1,000,000.

Annual 

variable 

compensation

€1,493,700 

(amount 

due for

paid in 

2023)

Reminder: 

€1,990,300 

(amount due 

for 2021 paid 

in 2022)

Reminder of the 2022 compensation policy
The annual variable compensation rewards achievement of the short-term financial, and 

sustainability (corporate and social responsibility) objectives of the Group.

The pay-out opportunity is as follows:

• at threshold performance: 0% of the fixed compensation;

• at target: 130% of the fixed compensation;

• at maximum over-performance: 260% of the fixed compensation.

The payment of the variable annual cash compensation is conditional upon approval by 

shareholders of the compensation granted to the concerned Corporate Officer.

The structure of the 2022 annual variable compensation focuses on what matters to Schneider 

Electric in delivering value to shareholders. 100% of the variable compensation depends on 

measurable objectives:

• 80% depends on financial criteria which closely align pay outcomes for the Corporate 

Officer to Schneider Electric’s financial performance:

 − organic sales growth (40%);

 − adjusted EBITA margin improvement (30%); and 

 − cash conversion rate (10%);

• 20% depends on Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) highlighting the importance of 

sustainability on Schneider Electric’s business agenda.

The Board also ensured that stringent targets were set for the annual variable compensation 

with maximum award only payable if a strong performance is delivered on each performance 

metric.

Application of the 2022 compensation policy
The annual incentive due for 2022 was determined by the Board at the meeting of February 15, 

2023, based on the attainment rate of the objectives set for fiscal year 2022 as follows:

Schneider 

Sustainability Impact 

(score) 20% 4.2 4.7 5.2 4.91 142.0% 28.4%

Total 100% 114.9%

Overall, 2022 annual variable compensation resulted in a total achievement rate of 114.9%, 

above target, reflecting record levels in revenues and adjusted EBITA, and good level of free 

cash-flow delivered by Schneider Electric in 2022.

Indeed, after having set the compensation targets on February 16, 2022, aligned with the 

targets disclosed to the market at that time, the Board decided on July 27, 2022 to use the 

discretion clause provided in the 2022 compensation policy approved by shareholders at the 

2022 Annual General Meeting.

The targets set at the beginning of 2022 did not appear adequate anymore considering the 

price inflation which was much higher than expected. Therefore, the Board resolved to 

increase the targets linked to revenue growth in order to align them with the new guidance 

announced to the market at that time:

• Revenue growth of +9% to +11% organic (previously +7% to +9% organic in February 

2022);

• Adjusted EBITA margin up +30bps to +60bps organic (unchanged vs. February 2022).

This decision has been made to ensure a better alignment with the shareholders’ experience 

and to make sure that the Chairman & CEO was compensated only for the Company’s intrinsic 

performance. Without this adjustment, the indicator linked to revenue growth would have been 

overachieved by 200% delivering 80% of target variable compensation for this criteria instead 

of the 69.3% which was delivered after taking into consideration the targets adjustment 

resolved by the Board.

The final 2022 results for revenue growth (12.2%) having exceeded the targets disclosed to the 

market in July 2022, total achievement rate of the annual variable compensation of the 

Corporate Officer was set by the Board at 114.9% of the targeted variable compensation, 

reflecting strong performance of Schneider Electric in 2022.

(continued)

Detailed achievement of each criterion:

• Organic Sales growth: The Group delivered an organic sales growth of +12.2%, which 

was above both guidance communicated to the market in February of +7% to +9% and the 

one reviewed in July of +9% to +11%. Therefore, this good performance resulted in an 

achievement rate of this criterion of 69.3% on the range between 0% to 80%.

• Adjusted EBITA margin improvement: In 2022, Adjusted EBITA margin rate improved by 

+0.4 bps organically to reach 17.6%, as a consequence of strong pricing, good cost control 

and improving SFC/Sales ratio. As a result, the achievement rate on this criterion was set at 

10% on a scale from 0% to 60%.

• Cash conversion: Free cash-flow was €3.33 billion. Therefore, cash conversion was 95.8% 

in 2022 which represented an achievement rate of 7.2% on this criterion, on a scale from 

0% to 20%.

• Schneider Sustainability Impact: the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), is the 

translation of our six long-term commitments into a selection of 11 highly transformative and 

innovative sustainability programs. It’s the Group’s five-year (2021–2025) plan with 

progress tracked and published quarterly, as well as audited annually. In 2022 the SSI 

achieved a score of 4.91/10 exceeding its target for the year, representing an achievement 

rate of 28.4% on a scale from 0% to 40%.

As a result, the 2022 annual variable compensation pay-out for the Corporate Officer was 

calculated on the base of his fixed compensation as follows:

At Target pay-out Achievement rate 2022 Actual pay-out

as a % of salary Amount (€) as a % of target as a % of base salary Amount (€)

130% €1,300,000 114.9% 149.4% €1,493,700

In compliance with Article L.22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code, the payment of this 

annual variable compensation is subject to approval by the shareholders of the compensation 

granted to the Corporate Officer for the fiscal year 2022 (see 6th resolution to be submitted to 

the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of May 4, 2023).

As a reminder, an amount of €1,990,300 was paid in 2022 to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire for the 

annual variable compensation due for the fiscal year 2021 after the approval of the 8th 

resolution by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 5, 2022 (see page 316 of the 2021 

Universal Registration Document).

Long-term 

incentive 

(Performance 

shares) 

(continued)

Application of the 2022 compensation policy
The volume of the maximum annual award was set in consideration of:

• The market practice and competitive positioning of the Chairman & CEO’s compensation 

package;

• The Group’s good performance;

• The structure of performance measurement governing the final acquisition of LTIP awards;

• The culture of ownership deeply rooted in Schneider Electric’s DNA.

As in 2021, upon hearing the report from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the 

Board took into consideration the increase in the Company’s stock price and in the spirit of 

maintaining a culture of moderation in an uncertain economic environment and decided to 

allocate to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire a number of shares markedly below the maximum allowed 

by the compensation policy.

According to the authorization given by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 25, 2019 in 

its 21st resolution, the Board of Directors, during its meeting of March 24, 2022 decided to 

grant Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire a total of 31,105 Performance Shares (representing 0.005% of 

Schneider Electric’s share capital) subject to the performance criteria described above and 

measured over a period of three years:

• 9,332 Performance Shares under Plan nº 40 in his capacity as Chairman & CEO of 

Schneider Electric SE;

• 21,773 Performance Shares under Plan nº 41 in his capacity as Regional Asia President 

and Chairman of Schneider Electric Asia Pacific.

Reminder of the 2022 compensation policy
Complementary payments are intended to take account of the fact that, following the decision 

of the Board of Directors on February 18, 2015 to remove the benefit of the defined-benefit 

pension scheme (Article 39) for Corporate Officers, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is personally 

responsible for building up his pension. He undertook to redirect these complementary 

payments, net of taxes, to investment vehicles devoted to financing his additional pension. To 

determine this authorized complementary compensation, the Board of Directors sought the 

recommendation of an independent expert, namely the firm WTW, and ensured that the 

mechanism implemented therefore, was in line with shareholders’ interests.

Accordingly, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is entitled to receive annually a complementary 

component, split into a fixed and variable portion as follows:

Variable portion

Fixed portion Target (% of Fixed) Minimum At target Maximum Total at Target

€191,600 130% €0 €249,080 €498,160 €440,680

The variable part is dependent on performance criteria aligned with the variable annual 

compensation (see above).

Application of the 2022 compensation policy
At the meeting held on February 15, 2023, the annual complementary variable portion for 

pension for 2022 to be paid after the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting if the latter approves it, 

was set by the Board of Directors at 149.4% of the annual complementary fixed portion, i.e. an 

achievement rate of 114.9%.

For 2022, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is entitled to receive:

Fixed amount 
due for 2022

Variable amount 
due for 2022(1) 

Total due  
for 2022

€191,600 €286,193 €477,793

(1) Calculated by applying to the variable portion at target of the pension above (€249,080) the percentage of 

target achievement determined for the calculation of the 2022 annual variable compensation, i.e. 114.9%.

In compliance with applicable law, the payment of the variable amount will be subject to 

shareholders’ approval (see 6th resolution submitted to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of 

May 4, 2023).

Reminder: an amount of €381,341 was paid in 2022 to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire for the variable 

portion of his pension due for the fiscal year 2021 after its approval by the Annual 

Shareholders’ Meeting on May 5, 2022 (see page 319 of the 2021 Universal Registration 

Document).

capped at twice the arithmetical average of his annual fixed and variable compensation paid 

over the last three years (see Chapter 4, section 4.2.3.1 of the 2021 Universal Registration 

Document).

Non-compete compensation
The Chairman & CEO is entitled to non-compete compensation for a period of one year 

capped at 60% of annual fixed and target variable parts (excluding complementary payments) 

(see Chapter 4, section 4.2.3.1 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document).

For 2022, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire was not awarded nor benefited 

from multi-annual variable compensation, exceptional 

compensation, stock options, welcome bonus, or Directors’ fees.

Employer social contributions paid by the Group’s companies in 

respect of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire’s compensation amounted to 

€353,738.12 in 2022.

Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is granted 30% of his cash compensation 

described above (fixed compensation, annual variable 

compensation and pension complementary payments) in 

consideration for his duties as a Corporate Officer (Chairman & 

CEO) of Schneider Electric SE exclusively. The remainder is 

granted to him for the discharge of his operational duties as 

Regional Asia President, Chairman of Schneider Electric Asia 

Pacific and executive Director of Schneider Electric USA Inc.

Details relating to the 2020 Long-term Incentive Plan 
realized in 2022 (LTIP 2020)

The performance period for shares granted in 2020 finished on 

December 31, 2022 and shares under the Plans nº 36 and 37 are 

therefore deemed vested. Their final acquisition is, however, still 

subject to the satisfaction of the presence condition at the delivery 

date.

At its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board assessed the 

achievement rate of the performance criteria based on the Group’s 

performance over the three-year period 2020 – 2022 and set the 

final rate of achievement at 96.71%, i.e. a reduction of 3.29% in 

relation to the number of shares originally granted.

The Chairman & CEO was conditionally granted 18,000 shares 

under Plan nº 36 and 42,000 shares under Plan nº 37. After 

applying the reduction for performance not achieved, the resulting 

outcomes were as follows:

(1) The over-performance of the relative TSR conditions off-set the under-performance of the adjusted EPS condition (for 11.08%).

2022 was the final year of performance measurement for the LTIP 2020. Schneider Electric ranked 6th on relative TSR among the CAC 40 

companies and 3rd among the panel of competitors, delivering 55.3% return to shareholders over the same three-year period, 

demonstrating a strong value creation for the shareholders. Schneider Electric delivered robust organic adjusted EPS improvement 

year-on-year and demonstrated consistent progress on the Group’s sustainability targets which are at the heart of the Group’s strategy. 

These strong results across the range of performance criteria led to a vesting outcome of 96.71% out of 100%.

• Adjusted EPS improvement (40%) 

During the three-year plan, the Adjusted EPS improved organically by more than +13% on average even though the targets were missed 

for 2020 due to COVID-19 and the Board’s decision not to change them. This result reflects the successful execution of the strategy 

combining top line growth, positive net pricing, better mix, industrial productivity, and better efficiency to reduce SFCs. Overall, the 

achievement rate for this criterion was 26.67% (out of 40%).

• Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 

vs. CAC 40 (17.5%) – The Group’s performance was acknowledged by the market and reflected in the stock price increase, which, 

combined with a robust dividend distribution policy and consistent share buyback program to balance the dilution coming from 

allocation of Performance Shares and employee shareholding schemes, generated strong returns to shareholders over the period. 

Schneider Electric’s TSR was ranked 6th among the CAC 40 companies. The achievement rate for this criterion was set at 19.83%, 

including the over-performance of 2.33%, which contributed to the offsetting of the non-achievement of the adjusted EPS criterion.

 vs. panel of competitors (17.5%) – Over the period, Schneider Electric’s TSR was ranked 3rd versus the selected peers (ABB, Legrand, 

Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, and Yokogawa). The 

achievement rate for this criterion was set at 26.25%, including the over-performance of 8.75%, which contributed to the offsetting of the 

non-achievement of the adjusted EPS criterion.

• Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index – SSERI (25%)  

The Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index measures the long-term sustainability performance of the Group in terms of 

relative performance, through a combination of external indices: (i) DJSI World which covers three dimensions: economic, environmental, 

and social; (ii) Euronext Vigeo which covers environment, community involvement, business behavior, human rights, corporate 

governance, and human resources; (iii) Ecovadis which covers four dimensions: environment, labor and human rights, sustainable 

procurement and ethics; and (iv) CDP Climate Change which covers climate change, water, and forests and represents a major 

reference for climate change leadership globally. The different rating achieved by Schneider in 2020, 2021 and 2022 in those indexes 

resulted in an achievement rate of the SSERI of 23.96% (out of 25%).

 (1) In 2020, the SSERI included the FTSE4GOOD index with the following target: 0% if Schneider is out of the index, 50% if Schneider is included in Developed & 

Environmental Leaders Europe 40 indexes, 100% if Schneider is included in Developed & Environmental Leaders Europe 40 indexes. In 2020, Schneider Electric was 

included in Developed & Environmental Leaders EU 40 indexes which triggered the maximum vesting for this year. From 2021 the FTSE4GOOD index has been 

replaced by Ecovadis index, due to the decommissioning of one of the two FTSE4GOOD indices.

The fact that the compensation mechanism has materialized this year does not create any disconnection between pay and performance 

considering that the impact is limited (i.e. 11%) and the payout rate actually reflects the good performance of the Company over the last 

three years and the strong 2022 results. In addition, this result is aligned with the shareholders’ experience, the TSR being 55.3% over this 

period.

4.2.2.3 Non-executive Directors’ compensation in relation to the 2022 fiscal year

Amounts granted to non-executive Directors are determined by 

taking into account the Board member’s responsibilities, the 

expected commitment for the role and the competitive market rates 

among international peers. Besides the fixed base amount, 

Directors’ compensation mostly depends upon the said Directors’ 

attendance at Board and committee meetings.

Upon the recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations 

Committee, the Board of Directors is responsible for setting the 

allocation of the Directors’ fees among Board members accordingly 

with the maximum annual amount of Directors’ fees that can be 

paid to the Board members set at €2,500,000 by the Annual 

Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 25, 2019. The 2022 

compensation policy approved by the Annual Shareholders’ 

Meeting held on May 5, 2022 provides the allocation rules of the 

fees to the non-executive Directors which are as follows:

• Non-executive Directors will be paid:

 − a fixed basic amount of €25,000 for membership of the 

Board;

 − an amount of €7,000 per Board meeting attended;

 − an amount of €4,000 per committee meeting attended;

 − an amount of €25,000 for the yearly strategy week (half in 

case of digital assistance);

 − an amount of €5,000 (for intercontinental travel) or €3,000  

(for intra-continental travel) per Board session 

physically attended.

• Additional annual payments are made to non-executive 

Directors who chair a committee to reflect the additional 

responsibilities and workload:

 − Audit & Risks Committee: €20,000;

 − Human Resources & CSR Committee, Digital Committee, 

and Investment Committee: €15,000; and

 − Lead Independent Director, who is also the Chairman of the 

Governance & Remunerations Committee: €250,000.

• For an observer, an annual fixed payment of €20,000 is paid, 

unless they become a non-executive Director at the next 

General Meeting. In this case, they will receive the same fees for 

attending the Board and committee meetings as non-executive 

Directors.

• All payments are prorated for time served during the year and 

are paid in cash.

Directors’ compensation earned in 2021 and 2022 was as follows, 

noting that Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman of the Board, and 

Xiaoyun Ma who represents the employee shareholders, waived 

the payments of the compensation they were entitled to as 

members of the Board.

4.2.2.4 Pay Equity ratio

Employees experience at Schneider Electric

Delivery of the strategy, both short term and long term, depends upon Schneider Electric’s success in attracting and engaging a highly 

talented workforce, and on equipping people with the skills for the future. The Group is committed to fair pay, which is at the forefront of the 

Group’s and executives’ agenda, ensuring that all Schneider Electric employees are appropriately and fairly rewarded for their contribution. 

The progress is monitored via the Schneider Sustainability Impact indicators. More information can be found in the Sustainable 

Development Chapter (Chapter 2) of the Universal Registration Document.

Pay Equity Living wage Recognition Well-being Engagement

Fair and equitable 

pay is a core 

component of the 

Group’s 

compensation 

philosophy. Since 

2015, the Company 

has adopted a Global 

Pay Equity 

Framework. With the 

help of this 

Framework, 

Schneider Electric 

has committed to 

reaching <1% pay 

gap for both females 

and males by 2025. 

Furthermore, the pay 

equity adjustment is 

fully integrated into 

the annual global 

salary review and its 

principles leveraged 

during the promotion 

and hiring processes.

Schneider Electric 

believes earning a 

decent wage is a 

basic human right 

and a key element to 

decent work. The 

Group is committed 

to paying employees 

in the lower salary 

ranges at or above 

the living wage to 

meet their family’s 

basic needs. By 

basic needs, the 

Group considers 

food, housing, 

sanitation, education, 

and healthcare, plus 

discretionary income 

for a given local 

standard of living.

Schneider Electric is 

committed to creating 

a culture where 

employees receive 

regular feedback and 

coaching from their 

managers and 

colleagues, 

celebrating people 

who constantly 

demonstrate the 

Company’s Core 

Values and go above 

and beyond – using 

global recognition 

portal “Step Up” and 

encouraging the 

recognition of small 

and big 

achievements by 

simply saying “Thank 

you”.

Health and well- 

being are embedded 

in the Schneider 

Electric strategic 

people priorities and 

contribute to its core 

sustainability mission. 

The Company has a 

commitment to a 

comprehensive 

well-being at work 

program translated 

into dual standards of 

access to healthcare 

and well-being 

training programs.

The Group listens to 

employees through a 

number of different 

channels, both 

formally and 

informally. Three of 

the Board Directors 

are employees of the 

Company, appointed 

through a formal 

designation process. 

The Group runs 

OneVoice internal 

survey designed to 

measure employee 

satisfaction and 

engagement; the 

Group also 

recognizes the 

importance of 

dialogue and 

engages with the 

local work councils 

on compensation 

matters on a regular 

basis.

Pay Equity Ratio

Pay Equity Ratio measures the ratio between the level of 

compensation of the Chairman & CEO and the average and median 

compensation of the employees, as required by Article L.22-10-9 I 

6° and 7° of the French Commercial Code.

Calculation methodology

The compensation comparisons and pay ratios set out below were 

calculated based on the AFEP-MEDEF guidelines. The calculation 

includes employees who were continuously employed during the 

financial years concerned. For part-time employees, compensation 

was established on a full-time equivalent basis.

Compensation elements taken into account:

For the Chairman & CEO:

• 2022 fixed compensation;

• Variable compensation paid in 2022 (for the performance year 

2021);

• Relevant benefits (cost of the company car, profit-sharing and 

employer matching contributions to employee saving plan) for 

2022;

• Value of the Performance shares granted in 2022 at their fair 

value (IFRS) on the grant date.

For the employees:

• 2022 fixed compensation;

• Variable compensation paid in 2022 (for the performance year 

2021);

• Relevant bonuses and benefits (in cash and kind) for 2022;

• Profit sharing and employer matching contributions to employee 

saving plan for 2022;

• Value of the Performance shares granted in 2022 at their fair 

value (IFRS) on the grant date.

Scope

France perimeter:

The legal scope, the issuer, comprises of only one employee, 

therefore, an alternate “relevant scope” was defined to reflect a 

larger representative employee population in France as prescribed 

by Article 27.2 of AFEP-MEDEF Code. It is based on the French 

holding entity Schneider Electric Société Européenne (SESE) (the 

issuer) as well as all employees in France of the operational 

company Schneider Electric Industries (SAS). This group of 

employees is employed on comparable terms to the Corporate 

Officer and represents more than 4,000 employees in France on a 

full-time equivalent basis.

Global perimeter:

In addition, from 2022 the Board of Directors, upon 

recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee 

and of the Human Resources & CSR Committee, decided to 

voluntarily report the evolution of the pay ratio between the 

Chairman & CEO and the average and median compensation of the 

employees on a broader scope which includes approximately 

126,000 Schneider Electric employees across the top 30 countries 

(“Global Scope”). This represents circa 87.5% of all Schneider 

Electric employees globally. There is no historical data for this ratio 

as the HR Information System was not ready before to report on this 

extended scope.

4.2.3 Compensation policy for the 2023 fiscal year  
(say on pay ex-ante)

The compensation policy intention is to provide a clear link between delivery of Schneider Electric’s strategy and the Corporate 

Officers’ compensation, while reflecting outcomes for shareholders. Set out below is the Corporate Officers and non-executive 

Directors’ compensation policy for 2023. It will be submitted to the shareholders at the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting (7th to 9th 

and 11th resolutions) and, subject to shareholders approval, will remain in force until the next policy is approved by the shareholders.

For the fiscal year 2023, as a consequence of the change of 

governance, four different compensation policies will be 

applicable:

 − to the Chairman & CEO (Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire) for the 

period running from January 1, 2023 to May 3, 2023 (subject 

of the 7th resolution proposed to the Annual General 

Meeting);

 − to the Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Peter Herweck) for the 

period running from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023 

(subject of the 8th resolution proposed to the Annual General 

Meeting);

 − to the Chairman of the Board of Directors (Mr. Jean-Pascal 

Tricoire) for the period running from May 4, 2023 to 

December 31, 2023 (subject of the 9th resolution proposed to 

the Annual General Meeting);

 − to the Board members for the full year 2023 (subject of the 

11th resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting).

4.2.3.1 Executive compensation policy

Schneider Electric follows a rigorous process for determining executive compensation, under the leadership of committed and 

independent Directors.

Role of the Governance & Remunerations Committee

The general principles and criteria forming part of the 

compensation policy for Corporate Officers, and their individual 

compensation packages are prepared and reviewed by the 

Governance & Remunerations Committee which makes 

recommendations to the Board of Directors for decision. The Board 

receives inputs and recommendations from the Human Resources 

& CSR Committee on the incentive structure and performance 

criteria (annual variable compensation and Long-term incentive 

plan) applied to the members of the Executive Committee (see 

section 4.2.4 of the Universal Registration Document), as well as 

the Group’s other employees.

To help the Board in the decision process, the Governance & 

Remunerations Committee and the Human Resources & CSR 

Committee are authorized to call upon external experts for specific 

topics, benchmarking data and analyses. The Committees hold at 

least one joint meeting every year to discuss the compensation 

structure applicable to Corporate Officers and other employees of 

the Group. 

These joint committee meetings are attended by one of the two 

employee Directors and the Director representing the employee 

shareholders who are members of the Human Resources & CSR 

Committee. 

As part of its preparatory work for its proposals to the Board, the Committee: 

Defines performance criteria Benchmarks Corporate Officers’ 

pay

Engages with shareholders

Defines performance criteria based 

on Schneider Electric’s executive 

compensation pillars and business 

strategy. Targets are determined at 

the beginning of the performance 

period in accordance with the goals of 

the Strategic Plan.

Based on circumstances and 

priorities, the targets also encompass 

risks raised by the Audit & Risks 

Committee as well as the 

recommendations of the Human 

Resources & CSR Committee.

Benchmarks Corporate Officers’ pay 

against the median of a peer group 

consisting of 24 French and 

international companies that are 

comparable to Schneider Electric in 

terms of market capitalization, 

revenue, and industry, or that 

represent a potential source of 

recruitment or attrition.

This benchmarking is used as an 

indicator, not as a target, and is done 

ex-post only for reference.

Relies on the Vice-Chairman & Lead 

Independent Director to directly 

engage with shareholders to ensure 

their perspectives and feedback on 

Schneider Electric’s compensation 

policy are heard and considered in 

decision-making.

The topic of Corporate Officers’ 

compensation is usually discussed at 

four Board meetings every year. 

Corporate Officers do not take part in 

the debates of the Board concerning 

their own compensation.

This process ensures consistency and alignment between the compensation policy applied to the other executives and employees and the 

compensation policy applied to Corporate Officers. They share the same objectives and priorities and their rewards are aligned with the 

Group’s performance and shareholder value creation.

Use of discretion

In determining executive compensation, the Board could use its 

discretionary power to ensure the execution of the compensation 

policy and related payouts remain in line with the performance of 

the Company. 

As such, and only in exceptional circumstances external to 

Schneider such as unexpected changes in the industry 

environment and in compensation practice generally, not taken into 

account when determining the current remuneration policy, the 

Board could exercise discretion, upwards or downwards, to adjust 

the formulaic outcome for annual or long-term incentive awards 

resulting from the strict application of the approved policy, where a 

qualitative assessment of performance is required to ensure that 

the awarded compensation is fair in light of the Corporate Officers’ 

actual contribution to the Company’s overall performance, its 

positioning vs. competition, and the outcomes for shareholders and 

employees.

If necessary, the Board could also adjust one or several parameters 

of the remuneration schemes, such as weights, targets or criteria, 

being specified that in any event, these adjustments or 

modifications will not result in exceeding the maximum of annual 

variable compensation and LTIP award as set in the current 

remuneration policy. 

Any use of discretion will be explained and an appropriate 

disclosure would be provided, so that shareholders understand the 

basis for the Board’s decisions.

Changes in the 2023 compensation policy

The Committee has reviewed the existing policy and reassessed 

the pillars and principles formulated in 2018, the compensation 

elements and criteria considering the feedback of shareholders 

received during the shareholder engagement process described 

above. Upon recommendations of the Governance & 

Remunerations Committee, the Board wishes to overall maintain the 

stability of the compensation policy which appears balanced and 

provides market competitive pay, ensuring a strong link between 

pay and performance, strong alignment with both employees and 

shareholders, and long-term focus, while at the same time taking 

into account the shareholders’ feedbacks. 

Therefore, based on the Committee’s analyses and 

recommendations, the Board proposes to implement the following 

changes for the 2023 compensation policy:

Key adjustments proposed in the 2023 Chief Executive Officer’s compensation policy (Mr. Peter Herweck) 

applicable as of May 4, 2023

Review of the targeted 

amounts for the fixed 

compensation, the annual 

variable compensation, 

the Long-term incentive 

plan and the pension

To determine the different components of the remuneration policy, the Board used notably an in-depth study of 

industry practices in term of compensation and took into account Mr. Peter Herweck’s experience and his 

compensation package as Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA, the size of the Group and its evolution over the past 

years, the compensation practices within the Company and in the Executive Committee.

Based on those considerations, the Board proposes: 

•  an increase in fixed compensation by 20% compared to the 2022 compensation policy applicable to 

Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire;

•  an annual variable remuneration of 100% of fixed remuneration on-target and 200% of fixed remuneration at 

maximum (compared to 130% and 260% respectively for Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire);

•  a targeted LTIP grant of around 85% of the combined fixed and target short-term variable compensation (or 

170% of the fixed compensation) and a decrease of the maximum annual award of LTIP (valued in accordance 

with IFRS standards) that the Corporate Officer can be granted (150% of the combined fixed and target 

short-term variable compensation vs. 200% previously).

The on-target pay mix would thus be 27% of fixed compensation, 27% of annual variable and 46% of LTIP, 

providing for 73% of performance-based compensation. The on-target global remuneration opportunity 

decreases by 23% compared to the previous Chairman & CEO remuneration policy. 

Introduction of a new 

criterion for the annual 

variable compensation: 

the Net Satisfaction 

Score (NSS)

The Board notably proposes to introduce a new criterion, the Net Satisfaction Score (NSS) to highlight the 

importance of building trust with our customers and focus on quality with a weight of 10%, while reducing the 

weights of organic sales growth and Adjusted EBITA organic margin improvement to 35% and 25% respectively.

Strengthening of the 

performance targets 

linked to the involuntary 

severance indemnity

The Board proposes to amend the post-mandate benefits granted to the Chief Executive Officer compared to the 

previous compensation policy by strengthening the performance targets upon which an involuntary severance 

indemnity may be due: no indemnity would be due if the average rate of achievement of the Group’s performance 

criteria used in the annual variable compensation for the last three fiscal years preceding the date of the Board’s 

decision is below 80% (vs. 66% previously).

Inclusion of a clawback 

provision

The Board proposes to introduce a clawback provision that would allow the Board the right to reduce or cancel 

some elements of compensation in the event of gross misconduct or fraud by the Chief Executive Officer.

How are performance criteria linked to Schneider 

Electric strategic priorities?

Variable pay is linked to performance metrics designed to deliver 

Schneider Electric strategy. At the start of each year, the Board 

reviews the measures, targets, and weightings to ensure they 

remain consistent with the annual priorities and Group strategy. For 

the annual variable compensation and the Performance Shares, the 

approach to performance measurement is intended to provide a 

balance of measures to assess performance focusing on execution 

of the Group’s strategic priorities.

Considerations of wider workforce compensation 

and shareholders’ views

The Board monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the 

compensation policy for Corporate Officer and senior management 

and has regard to its impact and consistency with compensation 

policies in the wider workforce. During the year, the Board is 

provided with information and context on pay in the wider 

workforce and various HR initiatives to enable its decision-making. 

This includes the approach to gender pay gap and living wage 

programs rolled out globally, the annual variable compensation 

results, and the total cost of LTIP awards.

The Board is committed to an open and transparent dialogue with 

Schneider Electric’s shareholders through the Vice-Chairman & 

Lead Independent Director. Where appropriate, Schneider Electric 

actively engages with shareholders and shareholder representative 

bodies, taking their views into account when making any decisions 

about the Corporate Officers’ compensation. The Vice-Chairman & 

Lead Independent Director is also available to answer questions at 

the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

2023 Compensation Pillars and Principles

 

Pay for Performance Alignment with shareholders’ 

interest

Competitiveness

• Principle 1: Prevalence of variable 

components: circa 80% for CEO (at 

target).

• Principle 2: Performance is 

evaluated via economic and 

measurable criteria.

• Principle 3: Financial and 

Sustainability objectives are fairly 

balanced and distributed between 

short-term (annual variable 

compensation) and medium-term 

(long-term incentive) components.

• Principle 4: Significant proportion 

of the total compensation delivered 

in shares.

• Principle 5: Performance 

conditions support Schneider 

Electric’s strategic priorities and 

are aligned with shareholders’ 

expectations.

• Principle 6: To benchmark the 

Corporate Officers’ compensation 

package “at target” in the median 

range of the Company’s updated 

peer group.

• Principle 7: To reference the 

CAC 40 third quartile and the 

STOXX Europe 50 median.

4.2.3.1.2 Compensation policy of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire as Chairman & Chief Executive Officer until 

May 3, 2023

Fixed compensation

The fixed compensation is reviewed at long intervals by the Board in accordance with the 

AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code. The Board ensures that the Chairman & 

CEO’s salary is set reasonably compared to similar roles in the market.

Considering the fact that Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire will end his function of Chief Executive 

Officer in 2023, the Board decided not to increase his salary for 2023 and to maintain his 

fixed compensation at €1,000,000 on a full year basis.

The amount will be prorated for the period from January 1, 2023 to May 3, 2023, to the 

effect that the amount paid will be equal to €341,398. 5%

Annual variable compensation

Annual variable compensation provides variable cash compensation which rewards achievement of the short-term financial and 

sustainability targets of the Group.

At the start of the fiscal year, financial and sustainability performance criteria, weightings, and annual targets are reviewed in detail by 

the Committee and recommended to the Board for approval. Outcomes will be determined based on performance against each of those 

targets. The Board has the flexibility to review targets during the year to ensure continuous alignment with shareholders’ interests.

The payment of the annual variable compensation is conditional upon approval by shareholders of the compensation granted to the 

Chairman & CEO. 

The pay-out opportunity at threshold performance is 0%, with 50% of maximum annual variable compensation payable for achieving 

target. The maximum annual variable compensation will only be earned where a strong performance is delivered on each performance 

metric. Pay-outs between threshold and target, and between target and maximum, are determined on a straight-line basis.

Schneider Electric does not operate a deferral program.

For 2023, the Board proposes that the measurable financial performance criteria determine 70% and sustainability and customer 

satisfaction criteria, 30% of the variable cash compensation of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire.

The Board notably proposed to introduce a new criterion, the Net Satisfaction Score (NSS) to highlight the importance of building trust 

with our customers and focus on quality with a weight of 10%, while reducing the weights of organic sales growth and Adjusted EBITA 

organic margin to 35% and 25% respectively (see more details on the NSS in section 4.2.3.1.3 of the Universal Registration Document).

Performance criteria Description and link to strategy

35% Group organic sales growth Fostering organic growth through deployment of strategic priorities in key 

markets

25% Adjusted EBITA organic margin improvement Enabling shareholder value creation through continuous efficiency

10% Group cash conversion Enabling returns to shareholders

10% Net satisfaction score improvement Focusing the Company on clients’ satisfaction and quality

20% Schneider Sustainability Impact Promoting continuous progress towards more sustainability and value for 

customers

For business confidentiality reasons and as in previous years, the targets cannot be disclosed on a prospective basis; however, the 

targets have been set precisely by the Board at the meeting of February 15, 2023 and will be communicated ex-post.

In compliance with Article L.22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code, the payment of this annual variable compensation will be 

subject to approval by the shareholders of the compensation granted to the Corporate Officer for the fiscal year 2023 at the 2024 annual 

Shareholders’ Meeting.

Performance shares (Long-term incentive plan – LTIP)

In line with best practice, the Board has considered that, given Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire will leave his executive position as of May 3, 

2023, he would not be entitled to any grant in 2023.

Pension benefits

The Chairman & CEO receives complementary cash payments in lieu of participation in the defined benefit pension scheme (Article 39) 

(“Top Hat”), which was discontinued for Corporate Officers following the decision of the Board of Directors on February 18, 2015.

The purpose of the pension cash payments is to provide a competitive retirement benefit in a way that is cost effective to the Company 

and that allows the Chairman & CEO to continue building his retirement benefits independently. The cash payments are a combination of 

fixed and variable payments that are considered “other benefits” to ensure consistency and comparability with other French or 

international companies. The maximum annual Complementary Pension Cash Benefit for 2023 remains unchanged, it will be prorated for 

the period from January 1, 2023 to May 3, 2023 and is detailed in the table below. The variable portion is subject to the same 

performance criteria and targets as the annual variable compensation. The Chairman & CEO has committed to depositing these 

additional payments, after taxes, into investment vehicles dedicated to the supplementary financing of his pensions.

Variable portion

Target (% of fixed 

compensation) Minimum At target Maximum Total at target

Full year amount €191,600 130% €0 €249,080 €498,160 €440,680

In compliance with Article L.22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code, the payment of the variable portion of the pension will be 

subject to approval by the shareholders of the compensation granted to the Corporate Officer for the fiscal year 2023 at the 2024 Annual 

Shareholders’ Meeting.

employment);

iii. The entitlement to a life annuity pension paid to the surviving spouse in the event of death before his retirement, or if he left the 

Company after the age of 55 without returning to work, equal to 60% of 25% of the average of compensation paid during the three

minus the amount of additional compensation that may be obtained under insurance conditions at the time the disability occurred;

v. In the event of an accident, the Group insurance covering the executive’s accident risk, stipulating the payment of a benefit the sum 

of which may be up to four times the annual compensation based on the type and circumstances of the accident.

Eligibility for benefits (ii) through (v) above is conditional on the fulfillment of one of the following conditions:

• the average of the free cash flow of the last five fiscal years preceding the event is positive.

Director’s fee

The Chairman & CEO has waived the attendance fees to which he is entitled in his capacity as Board member.

The compensation policy does not include any provisions for extraordinary payments. The Board decided to maintain the prohibition of 

one-off payments that are not provided for in the compensation policy approved by the shareholders.

Post-mandate benefits

As Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire will leave the position of Chief Executive Officer on May 3, 2023, to become non-executive Chairman of the 

Board, the Board decided that, he will not be entitled to receive any severance indemnity, nor any non-compete indemnity. Having said 

that, it should be underlined that, at the request of the Board, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire voluntarily undertook that, in the event of 

termination of his duties as Chairman for whatever reasons, he will be required, for a period of twelve months following termination, not to 

work, in whatever manner it may be, for the benefit of any entity carrying on operations which are in direct competition with Schneider 

Electric in any country. This commitment will not be indemnified by the Company.

Regarding the unvested LTIP granted in 2021 and 2022, the compensation policies for 2021 and 2022 that were supported respectively 

by more than 81% and 89% of the shareholders, provide that in case of retirement or change of assignment within the Group, the 

Chairman & CEO will retain his rights in full. The delivery of the Performance shares granted will nonetheless remain subject to the 

fulfillment of (i) the performance conditions stipulated in the plans and (ii) the continuous presence condition within the Group as 

Corporate Officer.

At its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board, upon the proposal of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, confirmed this rule. It 

is indeed applied to the more than 3,500 beneficiaries within the Group who also keep their LTIP if they retire or change assignment 

within the Group. The Board determined that since Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is going to change assignment becoming Chairman of the 

Board of Directors, and not leaving the Company; as any other employee, he should keep his rights. 

Under the leadership of Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire from 2003 to 2022, Schneider has multiplied its revenue by 3.9 (from €8.8 billion to 

€34.2 billion), its net Income by 8.8 (from €0.4 billion to €3.5 billion) and its market capitalization by 7 (from €12 billion to €88 billion). The 

Board is pleased for the Group to still benefit from Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire’s experience and considers it is in the best interest of the 

Company that he keeps his rights while he will be dedicated to ensure a smooth and productive leadership transition, with enlarged 

duties.

4.2.3.1.3 Compensation policy of Mr. Peter Herweck as Chief Executive Officer from May 4, 2023

Pursuant to the principles of the remuneration policy of Executive Officers described above, the Board of Directors on February 15, 

2023, on the recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, decided to set as follows the components of the Chief 

Executive Officer’s compensation policy to be granted as from his appointment to this position by the Board in connection with the 

implementation of a separated governance, i.e., as from May 4, 2023.

To determine this remuneration policy, the Governance & Remunerations Committee used an in-depth study of industry practices, 

including a benchmark of remuneration practices in CAC 40 and STOXX Europe 50 indices, and a selected group of peer companies 

(the composition of which is described in section 4.2.2.1 of the Universal Registration Document), with the assistance of an outside firm 

(WTW) based on publicly available data. With regard to this panel, it exhibits the necessary characteristics of competitiveness and 

comparability.

The remuneration policy is designed to be attractive and motivating. It notably takes into account:

• Mr Peter Herweck’s experience and skills, his successful career in particular within the Group which he joined in 2016 and his 

compensation package as Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA (fixed compensation of £785,000 with a maximum annual variable 

compensation opportunity of 200% of his fixed compensation);

• the size of the Group and its evolution over the past years, notably since the Board last adjusted the fixed salary of its top executive 

in 2018;

• the positioning of the compensation components compared with executive corporate officers with a comparable profile;

• the consistency of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation with that of Executive Committee members and compensation 

practices within the Company;

• Mr. Peter Herweck’s intention to unilaterally end his current employment contract with the Group by means of resignation as from the 

start of his corporate office, in compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and best governance practices.

Based on those considerations, the Board has decided to set the amount of the key compensation elements of Mr. Peter Herweck  

as follows:

• a fixed compensation of €1,200,000: this amount will be just under the median of the CAC 40 Companies, considerably below the 

25th centile of the STOXX Europe 50 companies and considerably below the median of the peer group;

• a targeted annual variable compensation representing 100% of the fixed compensation: this amount will be at the median of the 

CAC 40 Companies and below the 25th centile of the STOXX Europe 50 companies and peer group;

• a long-term incentive representing 170% of the fixed compensation (valued in accordance with the IFRS standard): this amount will 

be between the median and the 75th centile of the CAC 40 companies and between the 25th centile and the median of the STOXX 

Europe 50 Companies and peer group.

The Board thus proposes to position the total target compensation package of the Chief Executive Officer between the median and  

the 75th centile of the CAC 40 companies and considerably below the 25th centile of the STOXX Europe 50 companies and peer group. 

Compared to the former Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, despite an increase of the fixed compensation, this proposal represents  

a decrease of more than 23% of the total target compensation package. This proposal is also in line with the enlarged scope and 

responsibilities related to his change of role, when comparing to his previous pay package.

Fixed compensation

In consideration of all elements described above, the Board decided to set the fixed compensation of the Chief Executive Officer at 

€1,200,000. This amount will be prorated for 2023 at €790,323 for the period from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023.

The fixed compensation will be reviewed at long intervals by the Board in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance 

Code, unless there are specific circumstances that would warrant a salary increase, for example a major change in the duties.

Annual variable compensation

Annual variable compensation provides variable cash compensation which rewards achievement of the short-term financial and 

sustainability targets of the Group.

At the start of the fiscal year, financial and sustainability performance criteria, weightings, and annual targets are reviewed in detail by 

the Committee and recommended to the Board for approval. Outcomes will be determined based on performance against each of 

those targets. The Board has the flexibility to review targets during the year to ensure continuous alignment with shareholders’ interests. 

The pay-out opportunity at threshold performance is 0%, with 50% of maximum annual variable compensation payable for achieving 

target. The maximum annual variable compensation will only be earned where a strong performance is delivered on each performance 

metric. Pay-outs between threshold and target, and between target and maximum, are determined on a straight-line basis.

For 2023, the Board proposes that the measurable financial performance criteria determine 70% and sustainability and customer 

satisfaction criteria, 30% of the variable cash compensation of Mr. Peter Herweck.

The Board notably proposed to introduce a new criterion, the Net Satisfaction Score (NSS) to highlight the importance of building trust 

with our customers and focus on quality, with a weight of 10%, while reducing the weights of organic sales growth and Adjusted EBITA 

organic margin to 35% and 25% respectively.

The NSS is measured since 2018, it is a weighted average of the grade given by customers on six Critical Touch Points: 1) Select offer, 

2) Get quotation, 3) Get delivered, 4) Get delivered solutions, 5) Get technical support, 6) Get failure support. More than 240,000 

answers of customers are provided to the survey each year. The grades given by customers range from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very 

satisfied). The NSS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are dissatisfied (grade 0 to 6) from the percentage 

who are very satisfied (grade 9 and 10). It generates a score between -100% and 100%:

• At one end of the spectrum, if all of the customers gave a grade lower or equal to 6, this would lead to an NSS of -100%;

• On the other end of the spectrum, if all of the customers gave a grade of 9 or 10, then the NSS would be 100%.

The NSS targets would be set as a percentage point improvement versus previous year. In 2021, the NSS was 49% and in 2022, 48.5%.

Performance criteria Description and link to strategy

35% Group organic sales growth Fostering organic growth through deployment of strategic priorities in key markets

25% Adjusted EBITA organic margin improvement Enabling shareholder value creation through continuous efficiency

10% Group cash conversion Enabling returns to shareholders

10% Net satisfaction score improvement Focusing the Company on clients’ satisfaction and quality

20% Schneider Sustainability Impact Promoting continuous progress towards more sustainability and value for customers

For business confidentiality reasons and as in previous years, the targets cannot be disclosed; however, the targets have been set 

precisely by the Board at the meeting of February 15, 2023 and will be communicated ex-post.

In consideration of all elements described above, the Board decided to set the annual variable compensation opportunity at target and 

maximum as follows:

Minimum At target Maximum

0% of fixed 

compensation

100% of fixed 

compensation

200% of fixed 

compensation

Full year amount Nil €1,200,000 €2,400,000

Amount prorated for the period from May 4 to December 31, 2023 Nil €790,323 €1,580,646

The amount will be prorated for 2023 for the period from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023.

The payment of the annual variable compensation is conditional upon approval by shareholders of the compensation granted to the 

Chief Executive Officer. 

Schneider Electric does not operate a deferral program.

Performance Shares (Long-term incentive plan – LTIP)

LTIP links the largest part of the Chief Executive Officer’s 

compensation with the long-term performance of the Group 

and the actual outcome varies with performance against 

criteria linked directly to strategic priorities.

Shares granted are subject to a vesting period of three years 

with an additional mandatory one year holding period for 80% 

of shares which are granted under the Plan reserved to the 

Corporate Officers.

For threshold performance, 0% of shares granted will vest, for 

maximum, 100% will vest. Vesting will normally operate on a 

straight-line basis between these points.

The 2023 LTIP criteria will remain the same as in 2022, in line with Company’s objectives and the proposals approved by shareholders 

under the LTIP resolution at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 5, 2022 (15th resolution). The two changes introduced last year 

will be continued: the vesting scale of the criterion of TSR compared to a bespoke industry panel of 11 companies which would be 

made more stringent (no vesting under the median of the group would be allowed) and the disclosure of the targets set for the 

improvement of the adjusted EPS criterion which will be disclosed ex-post allowing shareholders to ensure the stringency of the targets 

set by the Board.

In order to align the interests of the Group’s executives to those of the shareholders, in 2023, the Board will allocate Performance 

Shares to more than 3,500 Group executives and senior management, leaders, and key talents. For the Group senior management, 

100% of shares allocated will be subject to performance conditions measured over three years.

The maximum annual award to the Corporate Officer, valued in accordance with IFRS standards, will be capped at 150% of the 

combined fixed and target short-term variable compensation at the date of grant to ensure that it does not represent a disproportionate 

percentage of his overall compensation. This new cap represents a decrease of 25% compared to the previous cap provided in the 

2022 remuneration policy (200% of the combined fixed and target short-term variable compensation).

For 2023, the Board intends to grant Mr. Peter Herweck an amount of LTIP, which value in accordance with IFRS standards will be 

around(1) 85% of the combined fixed and target short-term variable compensation (i.e. 170% of the fixed compensation), well below the 

maximum grant authorized under the remuneration policy. This amount is set for the full year 2023 including the months where Mr. Peter 

Herweck was Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA and transitioning to his new role. Mr. Peter Herweck will not be granted any other 

instruments for 2023. 

The volume of the annual award will be set in consideration of:

• The market practice and competitive positioning of the CEO’s compensation package;

• The Group’s performance, acknowledged by the market;

• The performance criteria applicable to the final acquisition of LTIP awards;

• The culture of ownership deeply rooted in Schneider Electric’s DNA.

In the context described above, the Board decided that the number of shares granted to the CEO continues to be reasonable in terms 

of quantum and market practice for comparable roles; it rewards the Company’s good performance in a challenging year and supports 

the culture of ownership strongly promoted by Schneider Electric.

(1) At the date of the grant, the IFRS value cannot be known with certainty as it is computed only at the end of the year. For the 2023 grant, the value of the grant to 

the Chief Executive Officer will be based on the assumption that the discount rate applied according to the IFRS rules will be 26% as it was for the 2022 grant.

Performance conditions

100% measurable and quantifiable criteria 75% financial and TSR and 25% sustainability

Performance conditions and weightings applicable to the 2023 LTIP:

• 40%, improvement of Adjusted EPS;

• 35%, relative TSR performance of Schneider Electric:

 − 17.5% measured vs. a bespoke panel of 11 companies: ABB, Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, 

Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, and Yokogawa,

 − 17.5% measured vs. CAC 40 companies;

• 25%, based on Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI).

• Adjusted EPS (40%)

Adjusted EPS is a key long-term performance metric which promotes the execution of Schneider Electric’s strategy to deliver profitable 

growth, thus reinforcing alignment with shareholders. Performance Shares could vest subject to the achievement of the following 

targets as set by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each year:

• a minimum Adjusted EPS improvement threshold under which there will be no vesting;

• an intermediary targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objective that the Company will have to achieve in order to vest 75% of the 

shares under this condition;

• a targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objective that the Company will have to achieve in order to vest all shares under this 

condition;

• the Performance Shares will vest progressively, on a linear basis, if the Adjusted EPS improvement is between these objectives.

As explained above, the Board commits to disclose ex-post, at the end of each Long-term incentive plan, the minimum Adjusted EPS 

improvement thresholds and the targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objectives.

Adjusted EPS performance is published in the external financial communications and its annual variance will be calculated using 

adjusted EBITA at constant FX from year N-1 to year N. Foreign exchange impacts below adjusted EBITA will be taken in full. Significant 

unforeseen scope impact could be restated from this calculation upon decision of the Board.

• Relative TSR (35%)

This criterion strengthens the alignment between the shareholders’ interests and compensation of the Corporate Officer.

• For 17.5% of the shares, Schneider Electric TSR will be compared to a bespoke industry panel consisting of 11 companies (ABB, 

Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric and 

Yokogawa) with a vesting scale as follows: 0% at rank 7 or below, 50% at median (rank 6), 100% at rank 4, 150% for ranks 3 to 1, and 

linear between these points. As explained above, the Board proposes to strengthen the vesting scale for a better alignment with 

performance.

• For the remaining 17.5%, Schneider Electric TSR will be compared with the TSR of the companies in the CAC 40 index to reflect the 

macro-economic and stock-market specific trends which influence the performance of the share and in turn, the return to 

shareholders with a vesting scale as follows: 0% below median, 50% at median (rank 20), 100% at rank 10, 120% in ranks 1 to 4, 

and linear between these points.

In case of over-performance, if Schneider Electric’s TSR ranks first to third of the bespoke industry panel or within top 9 of the CAC 40 

companies, this criterion may compensate the under-performance under the Adjusted EPS criterion up to the same number of shares. 

If the Schneider Electric TSR is closely clustered with that of other companies in the panel, then the Board of Directors will apply its 

judgement to decide whether Schneider Electric’s TSR shall be deemed to be ranked in the same position as those companies.

• Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index (SSERI) (25%)

The Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index measures the long-term sustainability performance of the Group in terms of 

relative performance, through a combination of external indices which cover a range of environmental, social, and governance 

indicators wider than and different from the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI). Using external indices would also ensure that the 

sustainability priorities governing the assessment of the long-term sustainability performance of the Group are at all times those which 

matter the most to the stakeholders. As their content is dynamic and includes new and more relevant topics as they emerge, it forces 

participants to constantly anticipate the most demanding trends in global sustainability. The Board has selected some of the most 

challenging external indices which are objective, recognized, and independent, covering main geographies in line with the Group’s 

global footprint and which complement each other as they cover different sustainability dimensions:

• DJSI World which covers three dimensions: economic, environmental, and social;

• Euronext Vigeo which covers environment, community involvement, business behavior, human rights, corporate governance, and 

human resources;

• Ecovadis which covers four dimensions: environment, labor and human rights, sustainable procurement and ethics; and

• CDP Climate Change which covers climate change, water, and forests and represents a major reference for climate change 

leadership globally.

According to the scale of the vesting of the Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index, only four companies in the world 

would have achieved 100% of the SSERI in 2021 (Schneider achieved only 87,5% failing to be sector leader in the DJSI World index) 

and only two companies achieved 100% of the SSERI in 2022 including Schneider Electric.

The table below summarizes the performance conditions that will apply to the plan:

40% Improvement of

For each grant, the performance conditions will be determined by the Board and, although the Board favors stability, they could be 

adapted from the ones presented above. Depending on the evolution of the Group’s strategic objectives, should they cease to be 

relevant or new criteria be deemed more appropriate based on their review by the Board of Directors, the latter would elect for criteria 

with similar long-term stringency, that will ensure a strong link between pay and performance.

Pension benefits

The Chief Executive Officer receives complementary cash payments which purpose is to provide a competitive retirement benefit in a 

way that is cost effective to the Company and that allows the Chief Executive Officer to build his retirement benefits independently. The 

cash payments will be equal to:

• a fixed portion equal to 15% of the fixed compensation; and 

• a variable portion equal to 15% of the actual annual variable compensation paid to the Chief Executive Officer.

The total Pension amount actually paid will thus depend on the Company’s performance, since the calculation base of the variable 

portion of the pension includes the actual variable compensation paid to the CEO depending on performance conditions linked to the 

Group’s results.

The CEO has committed to depositing these additional payments, after taxes, into investment vehicles of his choice, dedicated to the 

supplementary financing of pensions.

Listening carefully to some concerns raised by shareholders, the Board proposes to introduce a clawback provision that would allow 

the Board the right to reduce or cancel some elements of compensation in the event of gross misconduct or fraud.

In the event of gross misconduct or fraud causing a material adverse impact to the Group, in particular, resulting in a financial 

restatement, the Board reserves the right to reduce or cancel unvested LTIP or annual variabIe compensation amounts (malus), seek 

reimbursement of paid annual variabIe compensation or vested LTIP and/or obtain damages.

Post-mandate benefits

Listening carefully to some concerns raised by shareholders, the Board proposes to amend the post-mandate benefits granted to the 

Chief Executive Officer compared to the previous compensation policy by strengthening the performance targets upon which an 

involuntary severance indemnity may be due: no indemnity if the average rate of achievement of the Group’s performance criteria used 

in the annual variable compensation for the last three fiscal years preceding the date of the Board’s decision is below 80% (vs. 66% 

previously).

The table below presents a summary of the benefits that could be granted to the Chief Executive Officer on leaving office depending 

on the terms of the departure. The information provided in this summary is without prejudice to any decisions that may be made by the 

Board. In determining overall termination arrangements, the Board will ensure that termination benefits shall be granted only in case of 

forced departure and regardless of the form of the departure.

office for wrongful or gross misconduct Forced departure

• Definition of a forced departure: the termination benefits only become payable if the departure of the Chief Executive Officer is 

forced, including requested resignation, in the following cases;

 − Dismissal, non-renewal or requested resignation of the Chief Executive Officer, within the six months following a material change 

in Schneider Electric’s shareholder structure that could change the membership of the Board of Directors;

 − Dismissal, non-renewal or requested resignation of the Corporate Officer, in the event of a reorientation of the strategy pursued 

and promoted by the Chief Executive Officer until that time, whether or not in connection with a change in shareholder structure 

as described above; and

 − Dismissal, non-renewal or requested resignation of the Chief Executive Officer, although, on average, two-thirds of the Group 

performance criteria have been achieved for the last four fiscal years from the day of departure.

In any case, involuntary severance indemnity will not be paid if the resignation is a consequence of wrongful or gross misconduct.

• Amount of the involuntary severance indemnity: the “Maximum Amount” of the involuntary severance indemnity will be twice the 

arithmetical average of the annual fixed and variable cash compensation, to the exclusion of complementary pension payments, 

paid by the Group over the last 3 years taking into account the non-compete compensation, if any, and subject to the attainment of 

performance conditions. 

The aggregate amount of the involuntary severance indemnity and the non-compete compensation, if any, shall not exceed the 

Maximum Amount. 

During the first 12 months from the appointment date, a ratio will be applied to the amount of involuntary severance indemnity 

equivalent to: (i) half of the Maximum Amount, plus (ii) 1/ 24th of the Maximum Amount for each additional month of service until the 

12th month is completed (as which point the involuntary severance indemnity will be computed based on the full Maximum Amount).

• Performance conditions: Payment of the involuntary severance indemnity is subject to fulfillment of the following performance 

conditions based on the average rate of achievement of the Group’s performance criteria used in the annual variable compensation 

for the last three fiscal years preceding the date of the Board’s decision:

Group criteria achievement Severance payment

< 80% No payment

80%–100% 80%–100% of the Maximum Amount, calculated on a straight-line basis

>100% 100% of the Maximum Amount

It being specified that in case of departure during the first three years of office, the above performance conditions will be calculated 

on the fiscal year where the Corporate Officer was Chief Executive Officer (in case of forced departure in 2023, the performance 

condition will be calculated on the 2023 results after the closing of the fiscal year; in case of forced departure in 2024, the 

performance condition will be calculated on the 2023 results; in case of forced departure in 2025, the performance condition will be 

calculated on the 2023 and 2024 results).

• Non-compete agreement: The Chief Executive Officer is bound by a non-compete agreement in case of departure. The one-year 

agreement calls for compensation to be paid at 60% of annual fixed and target variable compensation (excluding complementary 

payments). In line with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the Board will determine whether to 

apply the non-compete clause at the time of departure of the Corporate Officer.

• Retention of unvested share awards: If the Chief Executive Officer leaves the Group in circumstances of a forced departure, he 

will be entitled to retain unvested Performance Shares, which would typically vest at the end of the relevant vesting period, subject 

to the applicable performance conditions, and which will be pro-rated for the time the Corporate Officer remained with the Group in 

any capacity during the vesting period. In case of retirement or change of assignment within the Group, the Chief Executive Officer 

will keep his right to the unvested Performance Shares granted to him previously, subject to the applicable performance conditions 

and without any prorata.

C O R P O R A T E  G O V E R N A N C E  R E P O R TChapter 4 – Corporate governance report

• Best practices: In conformity with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code:

 − The entitlement to involuntary severance indemnity is subject to strict performance conditions, assessed over a period not less 

than two years;

 − Only circumstances of a forced departure, regardless of the form of the departure, could trigger the entitlement to involuntary 

severance indemnity;

 − Together with the non-compete indemnity, if any, the involuntary severance indemnity could not exceed twice the average of the 

Corporate Officer’s annual compensation (fixed and variable part, to the exclusion of the pension benefits);

 − The Board shall determine unilaterally whether or not to apply the non-compete clause at the time of the departure of the 

Corporate Officer;

 − The Corporate Officer shall not be entitled to involuntary severance indemnity in the case that he is entitled to benefit from his/

her pension rights.

non-compete agreement

Peter Herweck, CEO NO NO YES YES

(1) Mr. Peter Herweck will unilaterally end his current employment contract with the Group by means of resignation as from the start of his corporate office.

Recruitment policy

On appointment of a new Corporate Officer, the Board expects any new Corporate Officer to be engaged on terms that are consistent 

with, and in no case more favorable than the policy approved by the shareholders at the last Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, until the 

next policy is approved. However, it is recognized that all circumstances in which Corporate Officer may be appointed cannot be 

anticipated. The Board will aim to set compensation that is appropriate to attract, motivate, retain, and reward an individual of the quality 

required to run the Group successfully, while avoiding paying more than is necessary. If the Board determines that it is in the best 

interests of the Company and shareholders to secure the services of a particular individual not promoted within the Group, it may require 

considering the terms of that individual’s existing employment and/ or their personal circumstances.

The table below summarizes the policy on appointment of a new Corporate Officer.

Fixed compensation Salaries are set by the Board, taking into consideration a number of factors including the current pay for other 

Corporate Officers, the experience, skill and current pay level of the individual, and external market forces. The 

Board may choose to set the salary below that of the market or the other Corporate Officers with the intention of 

applying staged increases as the individual gains experience in the role.

Annual variable 

compensation

Annual variable compensation will be awarded within the parameters of the policy in force.

Pension The Board would set the pension cash supplementary payments at the appropriate level based on an 

individual’s circumstances.

Other benefits The Board would expect any new Corporate Officer to participate in the benefit schemes that are open to other 

senior employees (where appropriate, referencing the candidate’s home country) but would take into account 

the individual’s existing arrangements, market norms, and their status as a Corporate Officer.

Buy-out awards The Board may offer compensatory payments or buy-out awards where an individual forfeits outstanding 

variable pay opportunities or contractual rights as a result of their appointment. The specifics of any buy-out 

awards would be dependent on the individual circumstances of recruitment and would be determined on a 

case-by-case basis. On assessing such awards, the Board will seek to make awards on a like-for-like basis to 

ensure that the value awarded would be no greater than the value forfeited by the individual. The Board may 

choose to apply performance conditions to these awards.

Relocation Where an individual is relocating in order to take up the role, the Board may approve certain one-off benefits 

such as reasonable relocation expenses, accommodation for a defined period following appointment, 

assistance with visa applications or other immigration issues, and ongoing arrangements such as tax 

equalization, annual flights home, and a housing allowance.

Internal promotion Where an existing employee is appointed to the Board, he/she will be required to resign from his/her 

employment contract and the Board will consider all existing contractual commitments including any 

outstanding share awards or pension entitlements.

In making any decision on the compensation of a new Corporate Officer, the Board would balance shareholder expectations, current 

best practice and the circumstances of any new Corporate Officer. It would strive not to pay more than is necessary to recruit the right 

candidate and would give full details in the next remuneration report.

4.2.3.1.4 Compensation policy of Jean-Pascal Tricoire as non-executive Chairman of the Board from  

May 4, 2023 
The principles presented hereafter apply in the event of the roles of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer being 

separated.

Fixed compensation

The fixed compensation is reviewed at long intervals by the Board in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, 

unless there are specific circumstances that would warrant a salary change, for example a major change in the duties. The Board 

ensures that the Chairman’s salary is set reasonably compared to similar roles at companies of similar size or complexity.

On the recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors’ meeting of February 15, 2023 set the 

gross annual fixed compensation of the Chairman of the Board at €930,000 from 2023. This amount will be prorated at €612,500 for the 

period from May 4, 2023 to December 31, 2023.

To determine this remuneration, the Governance & Remunerations Committee used an in-depth study of industry and market practices, 

including a benchmark of remuneration practice for non-executive chairmen in CAC 40, STOXX Europe 50 and peer group companies 

(the composition of which is described in section 4.2.2.1 of the Universal Registration Document), with the assistance of an outside firm 

(WTW) based on publicly available data. 

This study clearly identified three levels of compensation corresponding to the different types of duties performed by non-executive 

chairmen: 

• duties focusing solely on the chairing/leading the Board of Directors as well as being involved in the shareholder relations (25th 

centile );

• participation in a strategic committee to seek out and validate major investments (median);

• support for the new CEO to ensure the success of the transition or external recruitment (75th centile ).

On the recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors adopted a position just above the 75th 

centile of the CAC 40 companies, just above the 75th centile of the STOXX Europe 50 companies and above of the 75th centile of the peer 

group. This level of compensation is also explained by the enlarged mission given by the Board to its Chairman (which is described in 

section 4.1.1.2.1 of the Universal Registration Document) in order to ensure a smooth and efficient transition.

4.2.3.2 Non-executive Directors’ compensation policy

At the 2019 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the shareholders 

approved under the 13th resolution the maximum total amount of the 

annual compensation that can be paid to the members of the Board 

which since then stands at €2,500,000. It is proposed:

• To increase the maximum of the total compensation that may be 

awarded to members of the Board of Directors annually to 

€2,800,000, in view of the increase in the number of members of 

the Board of Directors and the number of Board meetings; and

• To keep the allocation rules unchanged and as detailed below.

Director’s individual compensation

• Non-executive Directors will be paid:

 − a fixed basic amount of €25,000 for membership of the Board;

 − an amount of €7,000 per Board meeting attended;

 − an amount of €4,000 per committee meeting attended;

 − an amount of €25,000 for the yearly strategy week (half in case of digital assistance);

 − an amount of €5,000 (for intercontinental travel) or €3,000 (for intra-continental travel) per Board session physically attended.

• Additional annual payments are made to non-executive Directors who chair a Committee to reflect the additional responsibilities and 

workload:

 − Audit & Risks Committee: €20,000;

 − Other Committees: €15,000; and 

 − Lead Independent Director: €250,000.

• For an observer, an annual fixed payment of €20,000 is paid, unless they become non-executive Director at the next General Meeting.  

In this case, they will receive the same fees for attending the Board and committee meetings as non-executive Directors.

• All payments are prorated for time served during the year and are paid in cash.

4.2 Compensation Report

4.2.4 Compensation of Group Senior Management  
(excluding Corporate Officers)

Scope of Senior Management in 2022

On December 31, 2022, Group Senior Management is composed 

of 17 Executive Committee members. The Executive Committee is 

chaired by the Chairman & CEO and includes:

• Executive Vice-Presidents of Corporate Functions: Finance, 

Supply Chain, Digital, Strategy & Sustainability, Innovation, 

Governance, Marketing and Human Resources;

• Executive Vice-Presidents of Operations: North America 

Operations, China & East Asia Operations, France Operations, 

Europe Operations, International Operations and Chief 

Executive Officer North America;

• Executive Vice-Presidents of Businesses: Industry Automation 

and Energy Management.

41% of the Group Senior Management (including Chairman & CEO) 

is composed of women.

Compensation policy

The compensation principles of the Group Senior Management 

(excluding the Corporate Officer) and their individual analyses are 

reviewed by the Human Resources & CSR Committee for 

information and consultation with the Board of Directors. The 

Human Resources & CSR Committee may consult external experts 

for specific analyses.

The compensation policy of the Group Senior Management follows 

the principles of competitiveness, pay-for-performance, and 

alignment with shareholders’ long-term interests, aligned with the 

principles applicable to the Corporate Officers as described in this 

report, with the following variations:

• The competitiveness of the Group Senior Management 

compensation is considered using a relevant geographical 

panel and the scope of responsibilities as prepared by the 

consultancy firm WTW;

• The proportion of variable components within their on target 

compensation package is around 70% versus around 80% for 

the Corporate Officer.

Compensation paid in 2022

Gross compensation, including benefits in kind, paid by Group 

companies in 2022 to the members of Group Senior Management 

other than the Corporate Officers, amounted to €33.9 million, 

including €11.4 million in variable compensation paid in the 2022 

fiscal year.

The performance objectives for the annual incentive for the fiscal 

year 2022 were:

• Group organic sales growth;

• Improvement of Group adjusted EBITA margin (organic);

• Group cash conversion rate;

• Improvement of Net Satisfaction Score;

• Schneider Sustainability Impact.

Long-term incentive plans

During the last three financial years, 506,774 Performance shares 

have been allocated to the Group Senior Management, excluding 

Corporate Officers. No stock options and no Stock Appreciation 

Rights (SARs) have been granted during the last three financial 

years. 

In 2022, Performance shares were allocated under the 2022 

Long-term incentive plan 40. 

Pension benefits

Schneider Electric’s policy concerning pension benefits states that:

• the Group’s Senior Management who are not subject to the 

French Social Security System are covered by pension plan 

arrangements in line with local practices in their respective 

countries;

• the Group’s Senior Management subject to the French Social 

Security system, with the exception of Corporate Officers, are 

covered by the additional defined-contribution pension (Article 

83) plans for employees, and/or Group Senior Management. 

Their defined-benefit pension plan (Article 39) was canceled on 

March 22, 2016.

4.2.5 Long-term incentive plans

Grant policy

As part of its overall staff pay policy, Schneider Electric sets up a 

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) every year. These plans allow the 

Group to ensure the competitiveness of the compensation offered 

by the Group, in dynamic and competitive international markets, 

and in sectors where the ability to attract talent is a key factor to 

success. These plans also aim at mobilizing Schneider Electric’s 

management for the achievement of the Group’s long-term 

objectives and align their interest with those of our shareholders.

The Long-term incentive plans are based on an allocation of 

Performance Shares. No stock options or SARs have been granted 

since December 2009 and the last plan of stock options 

implemented expired on December 31, 2019.

These plans are granted by the Board of Directors, based on the 

recommendation from the Human Resources & CSR Committee.

Beneficiaries include members of Group Senior Management, top 

managers, high-potential managers and employees in all countries 

whose performance was judged remarkable. The grants made in 

2022 are characterized by:

• A total of 3,963 beneficiaries in the 2022 LTIP (vs. 3,416 

beneficiaries in the 2021 LTIP);

• Allocations to Executive Committee members, including the 

Corporate Officer, represented 13.9% of the total attributions in 

the framework of the 2022 LTIP (similar to the proportion 

prevalent (14.0%) in the framework of the 2021 LTIP);

• 29.0% of the beneficiaries were women in the 2022 LTIP to 

whom 27.5% of the shares were granted (vs. 28.4% of women in 

the 2021 LTIP to whom 26.7% of the shares were granted).

Corporate Officers formally undertake, for each grant of shares, not 

to engage in hedging transactions until the end of their duties as 

executive Officers.

Note 1: Summary of accounting policies

1.1 – Accounting standards

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the international accounting standards (IFRS) as adopted by 

the European Union as of December 31, 2022. The same accounting methods were used as for the consolidated financial statements for the 

year ended December 31, 2021.

The IFRS standards and interpretations as adopted by the European Union are available at the following website: https://finance.ec.europa.eu/
capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/financial-reporting

Standards, interpretations and amendments endorsed by the European Union whose application is 

mandatory as of January 1, 2022

The following standards and interpretations that were applicable during the period did not have a material impact on the consolidated 

financial statements as of December 31, 2022:

• amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations: Reference to the Conceptual Framework;

• amendments to IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use;

• amendments to IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract;

• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020.

IAS 38 - Configuration or Customization Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement

The Group has considered the impact of the IFRIC agenda decision issued in April 2021 when accounting for costs of configuring or 

customizing a supplier’s application software in a Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement. This decision clarifies if those costs should be 

expensed, either immediately or over the contract duration, or capitalized. The group performed an inventory of those costs and amounts 

previously capitalized in 2022. This review has no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, and, given the 

limited impact, no restatement was made to the opening balance sheet.

Amendments to IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts – Cost 
of Fulfilling a Contract

On May 14th, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets to specify which costs 

an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a directly related cost 

approach. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs 

directly related to contract activities. These amendments had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

Standards, interpretations and amendments unendorsed by the European Union as of December 31, 2022 

or whose application is not mandatory as of January 1, 2022

• standards adopted by the European Union:

− amendments to IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts: Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information;

− amendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction;

− amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements. IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting policies;

− amendments to IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates; – IFRS

17 and amendments - Insurance Contracts;

• standards not yet adopted by the European Union:

− amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current; Deferral of

Effective Date; Non-current Liabilities with Covenants;

− amendments to IFRS 16 - Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback;

The Group is currently assessing the potential effect on the Group’s consolidated financial statements of the standards not yet applicable as 

of December 31, 2022. At this stage of analysis, the Group does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Climate-related matters

The potential impacts on the Group’s assets and liabilities measurement as well as on significant judgements and estimates, from the 

climate-related matters, have been analysed through both climate transition risk and opportunities perspective and carbon neutral external 

commitments perspective. The Group is committed to net-zero CO
2
 emissions in its operation by 2030, will be carbon neutral along the 

whole of its value chain by 2040 and net zero along the whole value chain by 2050.

To achieve its emission reduction objectives and meet net zero commitments taken, the Group has defined a roadmap and key actions to 

enable both its own operations and supply chain’s decarbonization, leading to direct consequences on processes, site transition, R&D and 

investment priorities:

• Redesign of the investment monitoring and approval tool in December 2022 to support internal and external reporting, monitor 

investments on Zero-CO
2
 sites and prioritize low-carbon investments;

• Significant investments on both industrial processes and real estate portfolio planned to decarbonize operations by 2030 (Scopes 1 & 2) 

in line with company-wide energy climate targets (150 Zero-CO
2
 sites by 2025, double energy productivity by 2030, 100% of electricity 

from renewables by 2030, shift 100% of corporate vehicle fleet to electric vehicles by 2030). Specifically on manufacturing and 

distribution centers, the Group has defined a priority list and planned to invest progressively on more electrification, sustainable and 

efficient systems (heat pumps, micro grids, solar panels, thermal insulation...) between 2023 and 2030 to achieve net-zero ready 

operations by 2030.

• Implementation of a process to follow carbon footprint evolution at an early stage of new product development to reduce the footprint of 

future generations of products. The Group committed on a step up in R&D in coming years, from an existing circa 5% of Group revenues 

dedicated to strategic R&D investment with a strong focus on sustainability. More than 6 billion of euros (absolute amount) have been 

invested in R&D between 2017 and 2021.

The actual and potential financial links and effects of the Group’s external commitments or the specific climate risks identified are detailed 

as follows: 

• No material impact to disclose, notably on evaluation and useful life of tangible assets or in the impairment tests performed at Group 

Level. The Group is not a capital-intensive company, majority of its sites are leased and not owned, and the individual residual value of its 

tangible assets in the most at-risk locations is not material. Additionally, the multi hub position of the Group with agile capacity to relocate 

its production in case of climate disaster is a way to significantly mitigate risks and potential effects. Also, the Group has a low 

dependence on water in its production processes, and its sites are slightly located in flood zones or coastal zones. Finally, the Group is 

on an opportunistic position regarding world’s desire for electrification & other company’s net zero commitments. The Group is currently 

working to improve the quantification of investments and additional costs needed as well as opportunities to achieve long-term net zero 

carbon commitments, taking into consideration several scenarios. The Group however identify no impairment risk as of December 2022.

• The Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), which includes a climate target, is used as a criterion in the annual variable compensation of 

the Corporate Officer and that of the 64,000 employees benefiting from such compensation (20% weight). In the same way, the 

Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI) is used for the long-term incentive plan granted to 3,000+ employees 

including the Corporate Officer (25% weight).

• To further tie climate-related issues to financial planning, Schneider successfully launched the first-ever sustainability-linked convertible 

bonds in 2020. This bond has been linked to three SSI targets by including the objective to save and avoid 800 million tonnes of CO
2
 on 

the customers’ end by 2025. In 2022, the Group has also linked its bank fundings with the SSI performance with the signature of a KPIs 

linked facility.

1.2 – Basis of presentation

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:

• derivative instruments and certain financial assets, measured at fair value;

• assets held for sale - measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell; 

• defined benefit pension plans - plan assets measured at fair value.

Financial liabilities are measured using the amortized cost model. The book value of hedged assets and liabilities, under fair-value hedge, 

corresponds to their fair value, for the part corresponding to the hedged risk.

1.3 – Use of estimates and assumptions

The preparation of financial statements requires the Group management and subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that are 

reflected in the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet, the revenues and expenses in the statement of 

income and the commitments created during the reporting period. Actual results may differ.

These assumptions and estimates mainly concern:

• the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (Note 1.8 and 1.9) and the 

measurement of impairment losses (Note 1.11);

• the measurement of the recoverable amount of non-current financial assets (Note 1.12 and 13);

• the realizable value of inventories and work in progress (Note 1.13);

• the recoverable amount of trade and other operating receivables (Note 1.14);

• the valuation of share-based payments (Note 1.20);

• the calculation of provisions or risk contingencies (Note 1.21);

• the measurement of pension and other post-employment benefit obligations (Note 1.19 and Note 20);

• the recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 14);

• the measurement of provisions covering uncertainties over income tax treatment (Note 1.21);

• the estimation of the margin at completion for Construction contracts (Note 1.24);

• the assumptions retained to evaluate the lease liability (IFRS 16): lease term and discount rate (Note 1.10).

1.4 – Consolidation principles

Subsidiaries, over which the Group exercises exclusive control, either directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated.

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 

ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.

Accounting policies of subsidiaries, joint-venture and associates have been changed when necessary to ensure consistency with the 

policies adopted by the Group.

Group investments in entities controlled jointly with a limited number of partners, such as joint ventures and companies over which the 

Group has significant influence (“associates”) are accounted for by the equity method. Significant influence is presumed to exist when more 

than 20% of voting rights are held by the Group.

Under equity method, the net assets and net result of a company are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share 

capital.

On acquisition of an investment in a joint venture or an associate, goodwill relating to the joint venture or the associate is included in the 

carrying amount of the investment.

When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceed its interest in the entity, the Group does not 

recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.

Companies acquired or sold during the year are included in or removed from the consolidated financial statements as of the date when 

effective control is acquired or relinquished.

Any acquisition or disposal of an interest in a subsidiary that doesn’t change the control is considered as a shareholder transaction and 

must be recognized directly in equity.

A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to 

reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any 

consideration paid or received is recognized in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners.

Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated.

The list of consolidated main subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates can be found in Note 29.

The reporting date for all companies included in the scope of consolidation is December 31, with the exception of certain immaterial 

associates accounted for by the equity method. For the latter however, financial statements up to September 30 of the financial year have 

been used (maximum difference of three months in line with the standards).

1.5 – Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, in accordance with IFRS 3 - Business Combinations. Acquisition 

costs are presented under “Other operating income and expenses” in the statement of income.

All acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, the fair value can be adjusted 

during a measurement period that can last for up to 12 months from the date of acquisition.

The differential between the cost of acquisition excluding acquisition expenses and the Group’s share in the fair value of assets and 

liabilities at the date of acquisition is recognized in goodwill. When the cost of acquisition is lower than the fair value of the identified assets 

and liabilities acquired, the badwill is immediately recognized in the statement of income.

Goodwill is allocated to Cash-Generating Units (CGUs) or groups of cash-generating units that benefit from business combination 

synergies.

Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired (see Note 

1.11 below). Any impairment losses are recognized under “Amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangible”.

The full goodwill method is applied at Group level, therefore, non-controlling interests are valued at fair value.

In accordance with IAS 32, put options granted to minority shareholders are recorded as financial liabilities at the option’s estimated strike 

price.

The share in the net assets of subsidiaries is reclassified from “Non-controlling interests” to “Purchase commitments over non-controlling 

interests” and the differential between the value of the non-controlling interests and the liability, corresponding to the commitment, is 

recorded in equity.

1.6 – Translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros.

The financial statements of subsidiaries that use another functional currency are translated into euros as follows:

• assets and liabilities are translated at the official closing rates;

• income statement, backlog and cash flow items are translated at average annual exchange rates.

The functional currency of an entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it carries out its operations. In most cases, 

the functional currency corresponds to the local currency. However, a functional currency other than the local currency can be retained for 

certain entities, if it represents the currency of the main transactions carried out by the entity and that it ensures faithful representation of its 

economic environment.

Translation adjustments are recorded in consolidated equity under “Translation reserve”.

Upon exit from the scope of consolidation, the cumulative translation reserve of a company whose functional currency is not the euro are 

recycled in the income statement and are part of the gain or loss on disposal.

The Group applies IAS 29 - Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies to the Group’s subsidiaries in countries with 

hyperinflationary economies (Argentina and Turkey). IAS 29 - Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies requires the non-monetary 

assets and liabilities and income statements of countries with hyperinflationary economies to be restated to reflect the changes in the 

general purchasing power of their functional currency, thereby generating a profit or loss on the net monetary position which is recognized 

in net income within “Other financial income and expenses”. In addition, the financial statements of the subsidiaries in these countries are 

translated at the closing exchange rate of the reporting period concerned, in accordance with IAS 21. In 2022, all the necessary conditions 

were met to consider Turkey as a hyperinflationary country within the meaning of IFRS. The Group has applied IAS 29 to Argentina in its 

financial statements from January 1, 2018 and to Turkey in its financial statements from January 1, 2022. The Group used the Consumer 

Price Index (CPI) for both Argentina and Turkey to remeasure its income statement items, cash flows and non-monetary assets and 

liabilities. This index was up 91% for Argentina and up 64% for Turkey compared with 2021.

1.7 – Foreign currency transactions

Foreign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rate in effect at the transaction date or at the hedging rate. At the balance 

sheet date, monetary items in foreign currency (e.g. payables, receivables, etc.) are translated into the functional currency of the entity at 

the closing rate or at the hedging rate. Gains or losses on translation of foreign currency transactions are recorded under “Net financial 

income/ (loss)”. Foreign currency hedging is described below, in Note 1.23.

However, certain long-term receivables and loans to subsidiaries are considered to be part of a net investment in a foreign operation, as 

defined by IAS 21 - The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. As such, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is recorded in 

equity and recognized in the statement of income when the investment is sold or when the long-term receivable or loan is reimbursed.

1.8 – Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired separately or as part of a business combination

Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized in the balance sheet at historical cost. They are subsequently measured using 

the amortized cost model.

Intangible assets (mainly trademarks, technologies and customer relationships) acquired as part of business combinations are recognized 

in the balance sheet at fair value at the combination date, appraised externally for the most significant assets and internally for the rest, and 

that represents its historical cost in consolidation. The valuations are performed using generally accepted methods, based on future inflows.

Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life or, alternatively, over the period of legal protection. 

Amortized intangible assets are tested for impairment when there is any indication that their recoverable amount may be less than their 

carrying amount.

Amortization expenses and impairment losses on intangible assets acquired in a business combination are presented on a separate 

statement of income line item, “Amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangible” assets.

Trademarks

The trademarks are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. The trademarks fair value is determined using the relief from royalty 

method.

Trademarks acquired as part of a business combination are not amortized when they are considered to have an indefinite life.

The criteria used to determine whether or not such trademarks have indefinite lives and, as the case may be, their lifespan, are as follows:

• brand awareness;

• outlook for the brand in light of the Group’s strategy for integrating the trademark into its existing portfolio.

Indefinite-lived trademarks are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication they may be impaired. When 

necessary, an impairment loss is recorded.

Internally-generated intangible assets

Research and development costs

Research costs are expensed in the statement of income when incurred. Development costs for new projects are capitalized if, and only if:

• the project is clearly identified and the related costs are separately identified and reliably monitored;

• the project’s technical feasibility has been demonstrated and the Group has the intention and financial resources to complete the project 

and to use or sell the resulting products;

• the Group has allocated the necessary technical, financial and other resources to complete the development;

• it is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the project will flow to the Group.

Development costs that do not meet these criteria are expensed in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period.

Before the commercial launch, capitalized development projects are tested for impairment at least annually. From the date of the 

commercial launch, capitalized development projects are amortized over the lifespan of the underlying technology, which generally ranges 

from three to ten years. The amortization expenses of such capitalized projects are included in the cost of the related products and 

classified into “Cost of sales” when the products are sold.

As for development-related assets which are in the amortization period, they are tested for impairment in case an impairment risk has been 

identified.

Software implementation

External and internal costs relating to the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications are capitalized when they 

relate to the programming, coding and testing phase. They are amortized over the applications’ useful lives.

1.9 – Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is primarily comprised of land, buildings and production equipment and is carried at acquisition cost, less 

accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Each component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a useful life that differs from that of the whole item is depreciated 

separately on a straight-line basis. The main useful lives are as follows:

• buildings: 20 to 40 years;

• machinery and equipment: 3 to 10 years;

• other: 3 to 12 years.

The useful life of property, plant and equipment used in operating activities, such as production lines, reflects the related products’ 

estimated life cycles.

Useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed periodically and may be adjusted prospectively if appropriate. The 

depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value, when the residual value is material.

Depreciation is expensed in the period and included in the production cost of inventory or the cost of internally-generated intangible assets. 

It is recognized in the statement of income under “Cost of sales”, “Research and development costs” or “Selling, general and administrative 

expenses”, as the case may be.

Items of property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication they may be impaired. Impairment losses 

are charged to the statement of income under “Other operating income and expenses”.

Since 2019, property, plant and equipment also includes right-of-use assets, in accordance with the recommended treatment in IFRS 16 - 

Leases, and as described in the following note.

1.10 – Leases

Scope of the Group’s contracts

The lease contracts identified within all the Group entities fall under the following categories:

• real estate: office buildings, factories, and warehouses;

• vehicles: cars and trucks;

• forklifts used mainly in factories or storage warehouses.

The Group has retained the exemption for low-value assets (i.e. assets with a cost lower than USD 5,000). Thus, the defined scope does not 

include small office or IT equipment, mobile phones or other small equipment, which all correspond to low-value equipment. 

Short-term contracts (i.e. less than 12 months without purchase option) are also exempted under the standard. In this case, for example, for 

occasional vehicle or accommodation rentals.

Rental obligation

At the inception date of the lease, the Group recognizes the lease liabilities, measured at the present value of the lease payments to be 

made over the term of the lease. The present value of payments is calculated mainly using the marginal borrowing rate of the contracting 

entity’s country, at the contract starting date.

Rental payments include fixed payments (net of rental incentives receivable), variable payments based on an index or rate initially measured 

using the index or rate as at the commencement date and amounts that should be paid under residual value guarantees. Besides, the 

simplification allowing not to split services components has not been elected by the Group. Therefore, only the rents are taken into account 

in the lease payments.

Lease payments also include, when applicable, the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group 

and the payment of penalties for the termination of a lease, if the term of the lease takes into account the fact that the Group has exercised 

the termination option.

Variable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or rate are recognized as an expense in the period in which the event or 

condition that triggers the payment occurs.

After the start date of the contract, the amount of rental obligations is increased to reflect the increase in interest and reduced for lease 

payments made.

In addition, the carrying amount of the lease liabilities is revalued in the event of a reassessment or modification in the lease (e.g. change in 

the term of the lease, change in lease payments, application of annual indexation, etc.).

The obligation is recorded under other current and other non-current liabilities.

Right-of-use assets

The Group accounts for the assets related to the right-of-use on the lease starting date (i.e. the date on which the underlying asset is 

available).

Assets are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for the revaluation of lease liabilities.

The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities, initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made on or before the 

effective date, minus lease inducements received. They are recognized as tangible assets, in the Balance Sheet.

Unless the Group is reasonably certain that it will become the owner of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recorded right-of-

use assets are depreciated using the linear method over the shortest period of time between estimated life of the underlying asset and the 

duration of the lease. The assets related to the right-of-use are subject to depreciation.

Determining the duration of contracts

The duration of the Group’s contracts varies according to geographies.

The real estate contracts have variable durations depending on the countries and local regulations. Vehicles and forklifts are generally 

contracted between 3 and 6 years.

In certain geographies, the Group’s real estate contracts offer unilateral options for termination of contracts (particularly in France with 

contracts 3-6-9).

According to the recommendation of IFRIC, on a case-by-case analysis and based on Real Estate teams’ expertise, experience strategy 

and projects, the Group is determining the most probable duration to perform our calculations.

In most of cases, the duration chosen is the enforceable duration of the real estate contracts, in particular on the most strategic buildings 

and factories.

1.11 – Impairment of assets

The Group assesses the recoverable amount of its long-lived assets as follows:

• for all property, plant and equipment subject to depreciation and intangible assets subject to amortization, the Group carries out a review 

at each balance sheet date to assess whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. Indications of impairment are identified 

based on external or internal information. If such an indication exists, the Group tests the asset for impairment by comparing its carrying 

amount to the higher of fair value minus costs to sell and value in use;

• non-amortizable intangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the 

assets may be impaired.

Value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows that will be generated by the tested assets. These future cash flows are based 

on Group management’s economic assumptions and operating forecasts presented in business plans over a period generally not 

exceeding five years, and then extrapolated based on a perpetuity growth rate. The discount rate corresponds to the Group’s Weighted 

Average Cost of Capital (WACC) at the measurement date. The WACC stood at 7.8% at December 31, 2022 (6.8% at December 31, 2021). 

This rate is based on (i) a long-term interest rate of 1.1%, corresponding to the average interest rate for 10-year OAT treasury bonds over the 

past year, (ii) the average premium applied to financing obtained by the Group in 2022, and is completed by, for Cash-Generating Unit 

(CGU) WACC only, (iii) the weighted country risk premium for the Group’s businesses in the countries in question.

The perpetuity growth rate is 2.0%, unchanged from the previous financial year.

Impairment tests are performed at the level of the CGU to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest group of assets 

that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. The cash-generating units 

are Low Voltage, Medium Voltage, Industrial Automation and Secure Power. CGUs net assets were allocated to the CGUs at the lowest 

possible level on the basis of the CGU activities to which they belong; the assets belonging to several activities were allocated to each CGU 

(Low Voltage, Medium Voltage and Industrial Automation mainly).

The WACC used to determine the value in use of each CGU was 8.6% for Low Voltage, 8.9% for Medium Voltage, 8.7% for Secure Power, 

and 8.7% for Industrial Automation.

Goodwill is allocated when initially recognized. The CGU allocation is done on the same basis as used by Group management to monitor 

operations and assess synergies deriving from acquisitions.

When the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is lower than its book value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the book 

value over the recoverable value. The recoverable value is defined as the highest value between the value in use and the selling price less 

costs to sell. When the tested CGU comprises goodwill, any impairment losses are firstly deducted from goodwill.

1.12 – Non-current financial assets

Investments in non-consolidated companies are initially recorded at their cost of acquisition and subsequently measured at fair value. The 

fair value of investments listed in an active market may be determined reliably and corresponds to the listed price at balance sheet date 

(Level 1 from the fair value hierarchy as per IFRS 7).

IFRS 9 standard allows two accounting treatments for equity instruments:

• change in fair value is recognized through “Other Comprehensive Income” in the comprehensive income statement, and in equity under 

“Other reserves” in the balance sheet, with no subsequent recycling in the income statement even upon sale.

• change in fair value, as well as gain or loss in case of sale, are recognized in the income statement.

The election between those two methods is to be made from inception for each equity investment and is irrevocable. For significant 

investments not listed in an active market, the valuation is performed by external experts at least annually and whenever there is an 

indication that it may be impaired.

Venture capital (FCPR) / Mutual funds (SICAV) are recognized at fair value through income statement, in accordance with IFRS 9.

1.13 – Inventories and work in progress

Inventories and work in progress are measured at the lower of their initial recognition cost (acquisition cost or production cost generally 

determined by the weighted average price method) or of their estimated net realizable value.

Net realizable value corresponds to the estimated selling price net of remaining expenses to complete and/or sell the products. Inventory 

impairment losses are recognized in “Cost of sales”.

The cost of work in progress, semi-finished and finished products, includes the cost of materials and direct labor, subcontracting costs, all 

production overheads based on normal manufacturing capacity and the portion of development costs that are directly related to the 

manufacturing process (corresponding to the amortization of capitalized projects in production and product and range of products 

maintenance costs).

1.14 – Trade and other operating receivables

Trade and other receivables are measured at their transaction price upon initial recognition and then at amortized cost less any impairment 

losses based on expected credit losses model.

Trade and other operating receivables are depreciated according to the simplified IFRS 9 model. From inception, trade receivables are 

depreciated to the extent of the expected losses over their remaining maturity.

The credit risk of trade receivables is assessed on a collective basis country by country, as the geographical origin of receivables is 

considered representative of their risk profile. Countries are classified by risk profile using the assessment provided by an external agency. 

The provision for expected credit losses is evaluated using (i) the probabilities of default communicated by a credit agency, (ii) historical 

default rates, (iii) aging balance, (iv) as well as the Group’s assessment of the credit risk considering actual guarantees and credit 

insurance.

Once it is known with certainty that a doubtful receivable will not be collected, the doubtful account and its related depreciation are written 

off through the income statement.

Accounts receivable are discounted in cases where they are due in over one year and the discounting impact is significant.

Assignment of receivables

When it can be demonstrated that the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and benefits related to assignment of receivables, 

particularly the credit risk, the items concerned are derecognized. Otherwise, the operation is considered as a financing operation, and the 

receivables remain in the balance sheet assets, with recognition of a corresponding financial liability.

1.15 – Assets held for sale and liabilities of discontinued operations

Assets held for sale

Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 

transaction rather than through continuing use. This classification occurs when the Group takes the decision to sell them and that the sale is 

considered highly probable.

The assets and liabilities held for sale are presented on different lines of the balance sheet. They are measured at the lower of their carrying 

amount or fair value less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated (amortized) as of the date they are 

classified as assets or disposal groups held for sale.

When a sale involving the loss of control of the subsidiary is considered highly probable, all the assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are 

classified as being held for sale, independently of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the entity after its sale. 

Discontinued operation

A discontinued operation is a clearly identifiable component that the Group either has abandoned or that is classified as held for sale:

• representing a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;

• being part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or,

• being a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Once the criteria are met, the profit and loss and the cash flow from discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated 

income statement and the consolidated cash flow statement for each period.

1.16 – Taxes

Income tax expense

The tax rate is calculated on the basis of the fiscal regulations enacted or substantively enacted at the fiscal year closing date in each 

country where the Group’s companies carry out their business. The Group’s applicable tax rate corresponds to the average of the 

theoretical tax rates in force in each country, weighted according to profit obtained in each of these countries. The average effective tax rate 

is calculated as follows: (current and deferred income tax expense)/(net profit before tax less share of profit of associates, and net profit 

from discontinued operations).

Deferred taxes

Deferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base 

(excluding if it arises from the initial recognition of goodwill), the tax loss carryforwards and the unused tax credits.

Deferred taxes are based on tax rates and tax rules that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and 

are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled. The effect of any 

change in the current and deferred taxes is recognized in P&L, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized on OCI or directly in 

equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in OCI or equity.

When the Group decides not to distribute profits retained by the subsidiary within the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is 

recognized.

Future tax benefits arising from the utilization of tax loss carry forwards (including amounts available for carry forward without time limit) are 

recognized only when they can reasonably be expected to be realized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is tested for impairment 

at each balance sheet date and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will 

be available against which the deferred tax asset can be fully or partially offset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are recorded in the balance sheet under non-current assets and liabilities. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the same unit and which are expected to reverse in the same period are offset.

1.17 – Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents presented in the balance sheet consist of cash, bank accounts, term deposits of three months or less and 

marketable securities traded on organized markets. Marketable securities are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 

convertible to known amounts of cash at maturity. They notably consist of bank deposits, commercial paper, mutual funds and equivalents. 

Considering their nature and maturities, these instruments represent insignificant risk of changes in value and are treated as cash 

equivalents.

1.18 – Treasury shares

Schneider Electric SE shares held by the parent company or by fully consolidated companies are measured at acquisition cost and 

deducted from equity.

Gains/(losses) on the sale of own shares are canceled from consolidated reserves, net of tax.

1.19 – Pensions and other employee benefit obligations

Depending on local practices and laws, the Group’ subsidiaries participate in pension, termination benefit and other long-term benefit 

plans. Benefits paid under these plans depend on factors such as seniority, compensation levels and payments into mandatory retirement 

programs.

Defined contribution plans

Payments made under defined contribution plans are recorded in the income statement, in the year of payment, and are in full settlement of 

the Group’s liability. As the Group is not committed beyond these contributions, no provision related to these plans has been booked.

In most countries, the Group participates in mandatory general plans, which are accounted for as defined contribution plans.

IFRIC decision - Attribution of benefits to periods of service IAS 19 – Employee Benefits

The Group has taken into account the impact of the IFRIC agenda decision issued in April 2021 when measuring employee benefit 

obligations. This decision, without any material impact for the Group, clarifies the periods over which employee benefits should be attributed 

in allocating the IAS 19 expense.

Defined Benefit plans

Defined Benefit plans are measured using the projected unit credit method.

Expenses recognized in the statement of income are split between operating costs (for service costs rendered during the period) and net 

financial income/(loss) (for financial costs and expected return on plan assets).

The amount recognized in the balance sheet corresponds to the present value of the obligation, and net of plan assets. The valuation is 

performed by external actuaries.

When this is an asset, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefit due in the form of plan refunds or 

reductions in future plan contributions.

Changes resulting from periodic adjustments to actuarial assumptions regarding general financial and business conditions or 

demographics (i.e., changes in the discount rate, annual salary increases, return on plan assets, years of service, etc.) as well as 

experience adjustments are immediately recognized in the balance sheet as a separate component of equity in “Other reserves” and in 

comprehensive income as “Other comprehensive income/loss”.

Past service cost is recorded in “Other operating income and expenses”.

Other commitments

Provisions are funded and expenses recognized to cover the cost of providing health-care benefits for certain Group retirees in Europe and 

the United States. The accounting policies applied to these plans are similar to those used to account for Defined Benefit pension plans.

The Group also funds provisions for all its subsidiaries to cover seniority-related benefits (primarily long service awards for its French 

subsidiaries). Actuarial gains and losses on these benefit obligations are fully recognized in profit or loss.

1.20 – Share-based payments

The Group grants performance shares to senior executives and certain employees.

These equity instruments are measured at fair value, on the date of grant, using the market price discounted from the expected dividend 

yield during the vesting period and adjusted for market conditions achievement.

The Group is using the Monte Carlo method to estimate the achievement of Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) vs. CAC 40 and a Panel 

of peer companies (market conditions).

The number of equity instruments granted can be adjusted during the vesting period to reflect the Group best estimate of non-market 

conditions achievement.

Main non-market conditions are the following:

• Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS) improvement rate;

• Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index (“SSERI”); 

• Service conditions.

An employee benefits expense is recognized with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, in 

general three years.

1.21 – Provisions and risk contingencies

A provision is recognized when it is probable that the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is 

probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 

the obligation. If the loss or liability is not likely and cannot be reliably estimated, but remains possible, the Group discloses it as a 

contingent liability. Provisions are calculated on a case-by-case or statistical basis and discounted when the impact from discounting is 

significant.

Provisions are primarily set aside to cover:

• economic risks: these provisions relate to probable tax risks, other than income tax related, arising on positions taken by the Group or 

its subsidiaries. Each position is assessed individually and not offset, and reflects the best estimate of the risk at the end of the reporting 

period. Where applicable, it includes any late-payment interest and fines. In accordance with IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over income tax 

treatments, provisions covering uncertainties over income tax treatment are presented under “Accrued taxes and payroll costs” since 1st 

of January 2019;

• customer risks: provisions for customer risks mainly integrate the provisions for losses at completion for some of long-term contracts. 

Provisions for expected losses are fully recognized as soon as they are identified;

• product risks: these provisions comprise

 − statistical provisions for warranties: the Group funds provisions on a statistical basis for the residual cost of Schneider Electric 

product warranties not covered by insurance. The provisions are estimated with consideration of historical claim statistics and the 

warranty period;

 − provisions to cover disputes concerning defective products and recalls of clearly identified products.

• environmental risks: these provisions are primarily funded to cover clean-up costs. The estimation of the expected future outflows is 

based on reports from independent experts;

• restructuring costs, when the Group has prepared a detailed plan for the restructuring and has either announced or started to 

implement the plan before the end of the year. The estimation of the liability includes only direct expenditure arising from the 

restructuring.

1.22 – Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities primarily comprise bonds, commercial paper and short and long-term bank borrowings. These liabilities are initially 

recorded at fair value, from which any direct transaction costs are deducted. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost based on 

their effective interest rate.

1.23 – Financial instruments and derivatives

Risk hedging management is centralized. The Group’s policy is to use derivative financial instruments exclusively to manage and hedge 

changes in exchange rates, interest rates or prices of certain raw materials. The Group uses instruments such as foreign exchange 

forwards, foreign exchange options, cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and commodities future, swaps or options, depending on 

the nature of the exposure to be hedged.

All derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of income, except when 

they are qualified in a hedging relationship.

Cash flows from financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying 

transactions.

Foreign currency hedges

The Group periodically enters into foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the currency risk associated with foreign currency transactions.

Whenever possible, monetary items (except specific financing items) denominated in foreign currency carried in the balance sheet of Group 

companies are hedged by rebalancing assets and liabilities per currency through foreign exchange spots realized with Corporate Treasury 

(natural hedge). The foreign exchange risk is thus aggregated at Group level and hedged with foreign exchange derivatives. When foreign 

exchange risk management cannot be centralized, the Group contracts foreign exchange forwards to hedge operating receivables and 

payables carried in the balance sheet of Group companies. In both cases, the Group does not apply hedge accounting because gains and 

losses generated on these foreign exchange derivatives naturally offset within “Net financial income/(loss)” with gains or losses resulting 

from the translation at end-of-year rates of payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency.

The Group also hedges future cash flows, including recurring future transactions and planned acquisitions or disposals of investments. In 

accordance with IFRS 9, these are treated as cash flow hedges. These hedging instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance 

sheet. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is accumulated in equity, under 

“Other reserves”, and then recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects profit or loss.

The Group also hedges foreign exchange risk financing receivables or payables (including current accounts and loans with subsidiaries) 

using foreign exchange derivatives than can be documented either in Cash Flow Hedge or Fair Value Hedge depending on the nature of the 

derivative.

The Group may also designate foreign exchange derivatives or borrowings as hedging instruments of its investments in foreign operations 

(net investment hedge). Changes of value of those hedging instruments are accumulated in equity and recognized in the statement of 

income symmetrically to the hedged items.

The Group qualifies foreign exchange derivative based on the spot rate. The Group adopted the cost of hedging option offered by IFRS 9 to 

limit volatility in the statement of income related to forward points:

• For foreign exchange derivatives hedging an item on the balance sheet : forward points are amortized in statement of income on a 

straight-line basis. Forward points related to foreign exchange derivatives hedging financing transactions are included in “Finance costs, 

net”;

• For foreign exchange derivatives hedging future transactions not yet recorded on the balance sheet: Forward points are recorded in the 

statement of income when the hedged transaction impacts the statement of income.

Interest rate hedges

Interest rate swaps allow the Group to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The derivative instruments used are financially adjusted to 

the schedules, rates and currencies of the borrowings they cover. They involve the exchange of fixed and floating-rate interest payments. 

The differential to be paid (or received) is accrued as an adjustment to interest income or expense over the life of the agreement. The Group 

applies hedge accounting as described in IFRS 9 for interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on re-measurement of interest rate swaps at fair 

value on the balance sheet are recognized in equity (for Cash Flow Hedges) or in profit or loss (for Fair Value Hedges).

Borrowings hedged by an interest rate derivative in a fair value hedge are reevaluated at fair value for the portion of risk being hedged, with 

offsetting entry in the statement of income.

Cross-currency swaps may be presented as foreign exchange hedges or as interest rate hedges depending on the characteristics of the 

derivative.

Commodity hedges

The Group also purchases commodity derivatives including forward purchase contracts, swaps and options to hedge price risks on all or 

part of its forecast future purchases. According to IFRS 9, these qualify as cash flow hedges. These instruments are recognized in the 

balance sheet at fair value at the period-end (mark to market). The effective portion of the hedge is recognized separately in equity (under 

“Other reserves”) and then recognized in income (gross margin) when the underlying hedge affects consolidated income. The effect of this 

hedging is then incorporated in the cost price of the products sold.

1.24 – Revenue recognition

The Group’s revenues primarily include transactional sales and revenues from services, system contracts (projects) and software.

Some contracts may include the supply to the customer of distinct goods and services (for instance contracts combining build followed by 

operation and maintenance). In such situations, the contract is analyzed and segmented into several components (“performance 

obligations”), each component being accounted for separately, with its own revenue recognition method and margin rate. The selling price is 

allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to the specific selling price of the underlying goods and services. This allocation 

should reflect the share of the price to which Schneider Electric expects to be entitled in exchange for the supply of these goods or services.

Revenue associated with each performance obligation identified within a contract is recognized when the obligation is satisfied, i.e. when 

the control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer.

The following revenue recognition methods can be applied:

Recognition of revenue at a point of time

Revenue from sales is recognized at a point of time, when the control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. This 

method is applicable for all transactional sales and for specific services such as spare parts deliveries, or on-demand services.

Recognition of revenue over time

To demonstrate that the transfer of goods is progressive and recognize revenue over time, the following cumulative criteria are required:

• the goods sold have no alternative use, and

• enforceable right to payment (corresponding to costs incurred, plus a reasonable profit margin) for the work performed to date exists, in 

the event of early termination for convenience by the customer.

When these criteria are fulfilled, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred 

in relation to total estimated costs of the performance obligation. The cost incurred includes direct and indirect costs relating to the contracts.

Expected losses on contracts are fully recognized as soon as they are identified.

Penalties for late delivery or for the improper execution of a contract are recognized as a deduction from revenue.

This method is applicable for systems contracts (projects) as the constructed assets are highly customized, and thus the Group would incur 

significant economic losses to redirect the built solutions to other customers.

Revenue from most services contracts is recognized over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the 

services provided. When costs incurred are stable over the contract’s period, revenue is linearized over the contract’s length.

Provisions for the discounts offered to distributors are accrued when the products are sold to the distributor and recognized as a deduction 

from revenue. Certain Group’ subsidiaries also offer cash discounts to distributors. These discounts and rebates are deducted from sales.

Consolidated revenue is presented net of these discounts and rebates.

Recognition of software revenue

The group generates software-related revenue mainly through subscriptions, licenses, maintenance and services. Revenue is recognized 

upon transfer of control of the promised software or service to the customers.

• Subscriptions contracts are either:

 − SaaS (Software as a Service: remote access to a cloud software solution, hosting and services) contracts, which are recognized 

linearly over the contract term

 − On premise subscriptions: containing two separate performance obligations pertaining to on premise software license and 

maintenance, the revenue from such arrangements is recognized in line with revenue from arrangements with multiple performance 

obligations. 

• Software license revenue represents fees earned from granting customers licenses to use the Group’s software. It includes license 

revenue of perpetual and periodic license sales of software products and is recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to 

the client.

• Maintenance includes annual fees as well as separate support and maintenance contracts. Revenue is recognized over time on a 

straight-line basis over the period of the contract.

• Services include notably setup services, training services, customization services. Revenue from these services is recognized over time 

as the services are performed.

Backlog and balance sheet presentation

Backlog (as disclosed in Note3) corresponds to the amount of the selling price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied 

(or partially unsatisfied) at closing date and includes binding contracts only.

The cumulated amount of revenue accounted for, less progress payments and accounts receivable (presented on a dedicated line of the 

balance sheet) is determined on a contract-by-contract basis. If this amount is positive, the balance is recognized under “contract assets” in 

the balance sheet. If it is negative, the balance is recognized under “contract liabilities” (see Note 16). Reserves for onerous contracts (so 

called reserves for loss at completion) are excluded from contract assets and liabilities and presented among the “provisions for customer 

risks” item.

1.25 – Earnings per share

Earnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33 - Earnings Per Share.

Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the weighted average number 

of shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of performance shares outstanding at the balance sheet date. The dilutive effect of performance 

shares is determined by applying the “treasury stock” method.

1.26 – Statement of cash flows

The consolidated statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect method, which consists of reconciling net profit to net cash 

provided by operations. The opening and closing cash positions include cash and cash equivalents, comprised of marketable securities, 

net of bank overdrafts and facilities.

1.27 – Other operating income and expenses

Material non-recurring operations that could affect operating performance readability are classified under “Other operating income and 

expenses”.

They notably include:

• gains or losses from the disposal of activities or groups of assets;

• costs in relation with acquisitions or separation (advisors’ fee, costs from external experts involved in the due diligence process);

• costs in relation with integration (one-off costs expensed in the next three years after acquisition, in relation with upgrade or modification 

of existing IT systems, to reach the Group standards);

• significant provisions and impairment losses for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;

• provisions or costs relating to significant legal risks or litigations;

• gain or loss related to the amendment, curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan.

1.28 – Other financial income and expense

Other financial income and expenses notably include:

• bank commissions

• Factoring fees

Note 2: Changes in the scope of consolidation
The list of main consolidated companies can be found in Note 29.

2.1 – Scope variations

Transaction with AVEVA’s non-controlling interests

On September 21, 2022, the Group confirmed its firm intention to acquire the share capital of AVEVA that it did not already own.

On November 11, 2022, the board of Schneider Electric and the AVEVA Independent Committee announced that they reached an 

agreement on the terms of a cash offer of 3,225 pence per AVEVA share. Such acquisition is to be effected by means of a Court approved 

scheme of arrangement, under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006.

On November 25, 2022, the requisite majority of AVEVA’s shareholders approved the Scheme, and passed the Special Resolution to 

implement the Scheme during respectively the Court Meeting and the General Meeting. This led to the immediate recognition of a current 

financial liability in the Group’s financial statements of GBP 4,039 million (EUR 4,704 million as of November 25, 2022 closing rate). The 

liability represents the commitment for the Group to purchase the 123,429,542 outstanding AVEVA shares not already owned as of 

November 25, 2022, and the 1,814,217 shares to be issued in the context of AVEVA’s long term incentive plans. The recognition of this 

liability triggered an immediate reduction in non-controlling interests for EUR 2,865 million and in the group share of equity for EUR 1,839 

million. In addition, the Group recognized transaction costs against equity.

The liability, presented under “Current purchase commitments over non-controlling interests”, amounted to EUR 4,554 million as of 

December 31, 2022. In order to meet the certain funds requirements under UK regulation law (and guarantee the availability of funds at 

closing date), the Group held at December 31, 2022 an undrawn bridge facility to approximately GBP 2.4 billion (with a twelve months 

maturity), a term loan facility of GBP 1.5 billion (with a three-year maturity) and a EUR 423 million cash deposit held at Schneider Electric SE 

(classified in Cash and cash equivalents).

The acquisition of the remaining shares of AVEVA was hedged during the second semester 2022 by entering into FX options for a total of 

GBP 4,000 million. The EUR 12 million realized loss on the hedging instruments was recorded in “Costs of acquisitions and integrations” 

within “Other operating income and expenses” (in this context, hedge accounting is not possible under IFRS).

As of December 31, 2022, all regulatory conditions were met, however the Scheme remained to be sanctioned by the Court.

On January 16, 2023, AVEVA announced that the Court had sanctioned the Scheme to effect the acquisition.

On January 18, 2023, following the deliverance of the Court Order to the Registrar of Companies, the Scheme became effective. AVEVA 

shares were unlisted from the London Stock Exchange on January 19, 2023. The transaction has been settled in cash in January 2023.

In accordance with IFRS 5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries were 

classified respectively as assets and liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2022 and measured at the lower of net carrying amount and 

fair value less costs to sell. A resulting impairment of EUR 75 million was recognized within Other Operating Income and Expenses.

The transaction was completed on January 6, 2023.

Industrial sensors business

On October 27, 2022, the Group announced the signing of a binding agreement with YAGEO to divest its industrial sensors business,

Group will grant YAGEO a license to use the Telemecanique Sensors trademark.

The completion of the proposed transaction is expected to occur in the coming months, subject to the receipt of required regulatory 

approvals and employee information consultation process. In accordance with IFRS 5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 

Operations, the assets and liabilities have been classified as “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities held for sale”, for EUR 653 million and

Note 3: Segment information
The Group is organized into two reporting segments as follows:

Energy Management leverages a complete end-to-end technology offering enabled by EcoStruxure. The Group’s go-to-market is oriented 

to address customer needs across its four end-markets of Buildings, Data Centers, Industry and Infrastructure, supported by a worldwide 

partner network.

Industrial Automation includes Industrial Automation and Industrial Control activities, across discrete, process & hybrid industries.

Expenses concerning General Management that cannot be allocated to a particular segment are presented under “Central functions & 

digital costs”.

Operating and reporting segment data is identical to that presented to the Chief Executive Officer, which has been identified as the main 

decision-making body for allocating resources and evaluating segment performance. Performance and decisions on the allocation of 

resources are assessed by the Chief Executive Officer and are mainly based on Adjusted EBITA.

Share-based payment is presented under “Central functions & digital costs”.

The Chief Executive Officer does not review assets and liabilities by business.

The same accounting principles governing the consolidated financial statements apply to segment data.

Details are provided in the Management Report.

Due to the substantial number of customers served by the Group, to their significant diversity in multiple sectors and to their wide 

geographical dispersion, the Group’s largest customer does not exceed 10% of Schneider Electric’s revenue.

Note 8: Income tax expenses
Wherever the regulatory environment allows it, the Group entities file consolidated tax returns. Schneider Electric SE files a consolidated tax 

return with its French subsidiaries held directly or indirectly through Schneider Electric Industries SAS.

Impact of tax losses 24 33

Withholding taxes (79) (70)

Other elements without tax bases (current or deferred) (80) (48)

INCOME TAX EXPENSE (1,211) (966)

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 25.7% 23.2%

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WITHOUT RUSSIA DECONSOLIDATION 24.6%

The Company’s consolidated income from continuing operations being predominantly generated outside of France, theoretical tax expense 

from continuing operations is reconciled above from the Company’s weighted-average global tax rate (rather than from the French domestic 

statutory tax rate).

Restating the EUR 195 million Russia and Belarus deconsolidation impact from the profit before tax (no tax impact attached), the effective 

tax rate would be 24.6%.

Note 9: Goodwill

9.1 – Main items of goodwill

Group goodwill is broken down by Cash Generating Units (CGUs) as follows:

(in millions of euros) Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021

Energy Management: 14,570 13,944

Low Voltage 9,060 8,496

Medium Voltage 2,243 2,245

Secure Power 3,267 3,203

Industrial Automation 10,566 10,779

TOTAL GOODWILL 25,136 24,723

The Group performed the annual impairment test of all the CGUs using the same methodology as the one used on previous periods and 

described in Note 1.11.

Impairment tests performed in 2022 did not trigger any impairment losses on the CGUs’ assets.

The sensitivity analysis on the test hypothesis shows that no impairment losses would be recognized in each of the following scenarios, for 

each CGU:

• a 0.5 point increase of the discount rate;

• a 1.0 point decrease in the growth rate;

• a 0.5 point decrease in the margin rate.

Given the volatility environment of interest rates and its impact on discount rates, the Group increased the sensitivity analysis up to 1.0 point 

increase of the discount rate. It shows that no impairment losses would be recognized for each CGU in such a case.

9.2 – Movements during the year

The main movements during the year are summarized as follows:

(in millions of euros) Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021

Net goodwill at opening 24,723 19,956

Disposals (119) (118)

Reclassifications (536) -

Translation adjustment 681 1,168

NET GOODWILL AT END OF YEAR 25,136 24,723

including cumulative impairment losses (367) (367)

Acquisitions & Disposals

Movements from acquisitions and disposals are described in Note 2.

Other changes

Reclassifications mainly relates to Assets held for sale described in Note 2.

Translation adjustments mainly concern goodwill denominated in US dollar and UK pound sterling.

10.2 – Trademarks

On December 31, 2022, the main trademarks recognized were as follows:

(in millions of euros) Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021

APC (Secure Power) 1,724 1,637

Clipsal (Low Voltage) 162 163

Digital (Industrial Automation) 39 42

Other 84 72

TRADEMARKS NET BOOK VALUE 2,447 2,375

Indefinite-lived brands are tested on a yearly basis for impairment.

In 2022, the Group reviewed the value of the main trademarks in accordance with valuation model describe in Note 1.8. Particularly, APC 

brand was tested using the royalty relief method. The future cash flows used are based on Group management’s economic assumptions 

and operating forecasts presented in Secure Power’s business plan, and then extrapolated based on a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.

Impairment tests carried out on indefinite-lived brands in 2022 did not show any impairment risk.

The sensitivity analysis on the test hypothesis shows that no material impairment losses would be recognized in the following scenarios:

• a 0.5 point increase of the discount rate; 

• a 1.0 point decrease in the growth rate;

• a 0.5 point decrease in the royalty rate.

Given the volatility environment of interest rates and its impact on discount rates, the Group increased the sensitivity analysis up to 1.0 point 

increase of the discount rate. It shows that no material impairment losses would be recognized for each brand in such a case.

In 2022, in relation with the terms of AVEVA’s transaction, a EUR 28 million share-based payments was recognized in “Other income and 

expenses” corresponding to the acceleration of multiple AVEVA plans.

Worldwide Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Every year, Schneider Electric gives its employees the opportunity to become group shareholders thanks to employee share issues. In 

countries that meet legal and fiscal requirements, the classic plan has been proposed to employees.

Under the classic plan, employees may purchase Schneider Electric shares at a 15% discount to the price quoted for the shares on the 

stock market. Employees must then hold their shares for five years, except in certain cases provided for by law. The share-based payment 

expense recorded in accordance with IFRS 2 is measured by reference to the fair value of the discount on the locked-up shares.

On May 10, 2022 the Group gave its employees the opportunity to purchase shares at a price of EUR 117.51 per share, as part of its 

commitment to employee share ownership. This represented a 15% discount to the reference price of EUR 138.26 calculated as the average 

opening price quoted for the share during the 20 days preceding the Chief Executive Officer’s decision to launch the employee share issue.

Altogether, 1.8 million shares were subscribed, increasing the capital by EUR 209 million as of July 6, 2022. The value of the lock-up cost is 

higher than the discount cost. Therefore, the Group did not recognize any cost related to the transaction.

19.5 – Schneider Electric SE treasury shares

On December 31, 2022, the Group held 11,978,255 Schneider Electric shares in treasury stock, which have been recorded as a deduction 

from retained earnings.

The Group has repurchased 1,659,933 shares for a total amount of EUR 219 million in 2022.

19.6 – Income tax recorded in equity

Total income tax recorded in equity amounts to EUR 107 million as of December 31, 2022 and can be analyzed as follows:

TOTAL 103 130 (27)

19.7 – Non-controlling interests

In 2022, the Group recognized a current financial liability which represents the commitment to purchase the outstanding AVEVA shares not 

already owned and the shares to be issued in the context of AVEVA’s long term incentive plans. The recognition of this liability triggered an 

immediate reduction in non-controlling interests for EUR 2,865 million (Note 2).

Note 20: Pensions and other post-employment benefit 
obligations
The Group has set up various post-employment benefit plans for employees covering pensions, termination benefits, healthcare, life 

insurance and other benefits, as well as long-term benefit plans for active employees.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Group’s main Defined Benefit pension plans are located in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). They respectively 

represent 57% (2021: 62%) and 24% (2021: 22%) of the Group’s total Defined Benefit Obligations (DBO) on pensions. The majority of benefit 

obligations under these plans, which represent 92% of the Group’s total commitment at December 31, 2022, are partially or fully funded 

through payments to external funds. These funds are never invested in Group assets.

United Kingdom

The Group companies operate several Defined Benefit pension plans in the UK. The main one is related to the Invensys Pension Scheme. 

Pensions payable to employees depend on average final salary and length of service within the Group. These plans are registered schemes 

under UK tax law and managed by independent Boards of Trustees. They are closed to new entrants, and for most of them, the vested 

rights were frozen as they have been replaced by Defined Contributions plans.

These plans are funded by employer contributions, which are negotiated every three years based on plan valuations carried out by 

independent actuaries, so that the long-term financing services are ensured.

In relation to risk management and asset allocation, the Board of Trustees’ aims of each plan are to ensure that it can meet its obligations to 

the plan’s beneficiaries both in the short and long-term. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the plan’s long-term investment strategy 

and defines and manages long-term investment strategies to reduce risks, including interest rate risks and longevity risks. A certain 

proportion of assets hedges the liability valuation change resulting from the interest rates evolution. Those assets are primarily invested in 

fixed income investments, particularly intermediate and longer-term instruments.

Following the agreement reached with the Trustee of the Invensys Pension Scheme on February 2014, Schneider Electric SE guaranteed all 

obligations of the Invensys subsidiaries which participate in the Scheme, up to a maximum amount of GBP 1.75 billion. At December 31, 

2022, plan assets exceed the value of obligations subject to this guarantee and thus this guarantee cannot be called.

Schneider UK pension plans contain provisions of pension called Guaranteed Minimum Pension (“GMP”). GMPs were accrued for 

individuals who subscribed to the State Second Pension prior to April 6, 1997. Historically, there was an inequality in the benefits between 

male and female members concerning GMP.

A High Court case concluded on October 26, 2018, confirmed that all UK pension plans must equalize “GMPs” between men and women. 

In the light of these events and new information, the Group updated the related assumptions, leading to a net experience adjustment in 

“Other Comprehensive Income” of EUR 56 million. Following a further High Court ruling in November 2020, an additional net experience 

adjustment of EUR 7 million was recognized in other comprehensive income in 2020.

United States

The United States’ subsidiaries operate several Defined Benefit pension plans. These plans are closed to new entrants, frozen to future 

accruals and have been replaced by Defined Contributions plans. Pensions payable to employees depend on the average final salary and 

the length of service within the Group.

Each year, the Group companies contribute a certain amount to the Defined Benefit pension plans. This amount is determined actuarially 

and is comprised of service costs, administrative expenses and payments toward any existing deficits. Since the plans are closed and 

frozen, there is generally no service cost component.

The companies delegate various responsibilities to Pension Committees. These committees define and manage long-term investment 

strategies to reduce risks, including interest rate risks and longevity risks. A certain proportion of assets hedges the liability valuation 

change, resulting from the interest rates evolution. Those assets are primarily invested in fixed income investments, particularly intermediate 

and longer-term instruments.

In October 2022, a contract was purchased from an insurer for USD 518 million covering all current retirees and a portion of non-retirees of 

Invensys pension plan. The buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust and is accounted for at fair value as an 

investment of the trust. This transaction resulted in an additional net experience adjustment of USD 24 million recognized in other 

comprehensive income in 2022.

Assumptions

Actuarial valuations are generally performed each year. The assumptions used vary according to the economic conditions prevailing in the 

country concerned, as follows:

Group weighted average rate Of which United Kingdom Of which United States

Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021

Discount rate 4.82% 2.12% 4.85% 2.05% 5.35% 2.77%

Rate of compensation increases 2.58% 2.60% 3.63% 3.64% n.a. n.a.

The discount rate is determined based on the interest rate for investment-grade (AA) corporate bonds or, if a liquid market does not exist, 

government bonds with a maturity that matches the duration of the benefit obligation. In the United States, the average discount rate is 

determined based on a yield curve for AA and AAA investment-grade corporate bonds.

In the Euro zone, the 2022 discount rate is 3.75%.

The rate of compensation increases includes both the salary increase and inflation rate if relevant.

Weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations plans:

 − EUR 600 million worth of bonds issued in November 2022, at a rate of 3.50%, maturing in November 2032.

In addition, the Group has issued a bond that is convertible into or exchangeable for a new or existing shares (OCEANEs) for EUR 650 

million at a rate of 0.00%, maturing in June 2026. The OCEANE has a debt component, assessed on inception date on the basis of the 

market interest rate applied to an equivalent non-convertible bond, is recognized in non-current financial debts and an optional component 

recognized in equity. At end of December 2022, the debt component recorded at net book value amounts to EUR 651 million and the 

optional component to EUR 42 million.

The initial conversion and/or exchange ratio of the Bonds was one share per Bond with a nominal value set at EUR 176.44 and has been 

adjusted to 1.003 shares per bond in May 2022. According to Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, if the average sustainability 

performance score (calculated as the arithmetic average of the scores of the three key performance indicators) does not reach a certain 

level by December 31, 2025, the Group will pay an amount equal to 0.50% of the face value.

The three key performance indicators from the 11 new Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) 2021-2025 indicators are the following:

• Climate: Deliver 800 megatons of saved and avoided CO
2
 emissions to our customers;

• Equality: Increase gender diversity, from hiring to front-line managers and leadership teams (50/40/30);

• Generation: Train 1 million underprivileged people in energy management.

The detailed rating methodology and approach are presented in the Group’s Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework.

For all those transactions, issue premium and issue costs are amortized per the effective interest rate method.

Note 23: Classification of financial instruments
The Group uses financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and metal prices.

Financial assets and liabilities can be classified at the fair value following the hierarchy levels below:

1. Level 1: market value (non-adjusted) on active markets, for similar assets and liabilities, which the company can obtain on a given 

valuation date;

2. Level 2: data other than the market rate available for level 1, which are directly or indirectly observable on the market;

3. Level 3: data on the asset or liability that are not observable on the market.

23.3 – Foreign currency hedges

Since a significant proportion of affiliates’ transactions are denominated in currencies other than the affiliate’s functional currency, the Group 

is exposed to currency risks. If the Group is not able to hedge these risks, fluctuations in exchange rates between the functional currency 

and other currencies can have a significant impact on its results and distort year-on-year performance comparisons. As a result, the Group 

uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to exchange rates mainly through FX forwards and natural hedges. Furthermore, some 

long-term loans and borrowings granted to the affiliates are considered as net investment in foreign operations according to IAS 21.

Schneider Electric’s currency hedging policy is to protect its subsidiaries against risks on transactions denominated in a currency other than 

their functional currency. Hedging approaches are detailed in Note 1.23.

The breakdown of the nominal of foreign change derivatives related to operating and financing activities is as follows:

23.4 – Interest rate hedges

Interest rate risk on borrowings is managed at the Group level, based on consolidated debt and taking into consideration market conditions 

to optimize overall borrowing costs. The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rates through swaps or 

cross-currency swaps. Cross-currency swaps may be presented both as foreign exchange hedges and interest rate hedges depending on 

the characteristics of the derivative.

During the fiscal year 2022, the Group has set up EUR 250 million interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure.

23.5 – Commodity hedges

The Group is exposed to fluctuations in energy and raw material prices, in particular steel, copper, aluminum, silver, lead, nickel, zinc and 

plastics. If the Group is not able to hedge, compensate for or pass on to customers any such increased costs, this could have an adverse 

impact on its results. The Group has, however, implemented certain procedures to limit exposure to rising non-ferrous and precious raw 

material prices. The Purchasing departments of the operating units report their purchasing forecasts to the Corporate Finance and Treasury 

department. Purchase commitments are hedged using forward contracts, swaps and, to a lesser extent, options.

All commodities instruments are futures and options designated as cash flow hedge under IFRS standards, of which:

The Group trades over-the-counter derivatives with tier-one banks under agreements which provide for the offsetting of amounts payable 

and receivable in the event of default by one of the contracting parties. These conditional offsetting agreements do not meet the eligibility 

criteria within the meaning of IAS 32 for offsetting derivative instruments recorded under assets and liabilities. However, they do fall within 

the scope of disclosures under IFRS 7 on offsetting.

23.7 – Counterparty risk

Financial transactions are entered with carefully selected counterparties. Banking counterparties are chosen according to the customary 

criteria, including the credit rating issued by an independent rating agency.

Group policy consists of diversifying counterparty risks and periodic controls are performed to check compliance with the related rules. In 

addition, the Group takes out substantial credit insurance and uses other types of guarantees to limit the risk of losses on trade accounts 

receivable.

23.8 – Liquidity risk

As of December 31, 2022, the Group had confirmed credit lines of EUR 2.950 million, all unused with EUR 2.850 million maturing after 

December 2023. Among them, EUR 2.700 million are sustainable-linked credit line with margin indexed on the annual performance of the 

Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI).

With EUR 2.9 billion available committed facility and EUR 4.0 billion cash & cash equivalent, the liquidity of the Group amounts to EUR 6.9 

billion end of the year. In the next 12 months, the total short term and bond maturity amounts to EUR 3.1 billion.

In addition, to secure the funding of the minority interest of Aveva and to meet certain funds requirement under UK regulation, the Group 

held undrawn bridge facility and term loan for a total amount of approximately EUR 3.9 billion.

Loan Agreement and committed credit lines do not include any financial covenants or credit rating triggers in case of rating downgrade.

23.9 – Financial risk management

Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations. 

These exposures arise from sales in currencies other than the Group’s presentational currency of Euro.

The main exposure of the Group in terms of currency exchange risk is related to the US dollar, Chinese Yuan and currencies linked to the US 

dollar. In 2022, revenue in foreign currencies amounted to EUR 27.3 billion (EUR 23.0 billion in 2021), including around EUR 9.9 billion in US 

dollars and EUR 4.8 billion in Chinese yuan (respectively EUR 7.4 and EUR 4.4 billion in 2021).

The Group manages its exposure to currency risk to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to changes in exchange rates. The financial 

instruments used to hedge the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates are described above.

The table below shows the impact of a 10% change in the US dollar and the Chinese Yuan against the Euro on Revenue and Adjusted 

EBITA. It includes the impact from the translation of financial statements into the Group’s presentation currency and assumes no scope 

impact.

F I N A N C I A L  S T A T E M E N T SChapter 5 – Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022

Note 25: Related party transactions

25.1 – Transactions with associates

Companies over which the Group has significant influence are accounted through the equity method. Transactions with these related 

parties are carried out on arm’s length terms.

Related party transactions were not material in 2022.

25.2 – Transactions with key management personnel

No transactions were carried out during the year with members of the supervisory board or management board. Compensation and 

benefits paid to the Group’s top senior executives are described in Note 24.

Note 26: Commitments and contingent liabilities

26.1 – Guarantees and similar undertakings

The following table discloses the maximum exposure on guarantees given and received:

(in millions of euros) Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021

Market counter guarantees * 3,543 3,702

Pledges, mortgages and sureties ** 181 81

Other commitments given 435 314

GUARANTEES GIVEN 4,159 4,097

Endorsements and guarantees received 80 64

GUARANTEES RECEIVED 80 64

* On certain contracts, customers require some commitments to guarantee that the contract will be fully executed by the subsidiaries of the Group. The risk linked to the 

commitment is assessed and a provision for contingencies is recorded when the risk is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Market counter 

guarantees also include the guaranteed obligations towards pension schemes.

** Some loans are secured by property, plant and equipment and securities lodged as collateral.

26.2 – Contingent liabilities

As previously disclosed, investigations were conducted in September 2018 by the French judicial authority and French Competition 

Authority (“Autorité de la concurrence”) at Schneider Electric’s head office and other premises concerning the sale of electrical products 

through commercial distribution activities in France.

On July 4, 2022, Schneider Electric received a statement of objections (notification de griefs) from the French Competition Authority alleging 

that the pricing autonomy of some distributors in the French market would have been limited, in breach of competition rules.

Schneider Electric strongly disagrees with the allegations of the statement of objections and has submitted its response to the French 

Competition Authority on October 4, 2022.

Concurrently on October 7, 2022 Schneider Electric was indicted by an investigating judge who required Schneider Electric to provide a 

bank guarantee of €20 million and a cash guarantee of €80 million which was paid mid-January 2023. As at December 31, 2022, this cash 

guarantee was recognized as “Other current liabilities” against “Non-current financial assets”. Those actions do not mean that Schneider 

Electric will ultimately be found guilty of any wrongdoing. Schneider Electric firmly disagrees with all the allegations made by the French 

investigating judge and the French Competition Authority and intends to vigorously and fully defend itself. Should the French Competition 

Authority deny Schneider Electric’s arguments and conclude, after examining the substance of the matter, that anti-competitive practices 

have been involved, it has broad discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis the financial fines it may impose in accordance with the 

principles of proportionality and individuality. In light of the difficulty in assessing the extent to which the French Competition Authority takes 

into account the arguments of Schneider Electric in its defense as well as the multiple factors contributing to the determination of a fine, it is 

not possible to reliably estimate the amount of any potential fine that might be incurred in the event of an adverse decision, even though it 

might have a significant impact on the Group. In this context, no provision has been made at this stage of the investigation.

Schneider Electric has other contingent liabilities relating to legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of its 

business. Known or ongoing claims and litigation involving the Group or its subsidiaries were reviewed at the date on which the 

consolidated financial statements were approved for issue. Based on the advice of legal counsel, all provisions deemed necessary have 

been made to cover the related risks.

5.6 Statutory Auditors’ report on the 
consolidated financial statements

To the Annual General Meeting of Schneider Electric S.E.,

Opinion

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated 

financial statements of Schneider Electric S.E. for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the 

Group at December 31, 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial 

Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Risks Committee.

Basis for opinion 

Audit framework

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have 

obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under these standards are further described in the “Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the 

consolidated financial statements” section of our report. 

Independence

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code (Code de 

commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory Auditors for the period from January 1, 2022 to the date of 

our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.

Justification of assessments – Key audit matters 

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our 

assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were 

the most significant in our audit of the consolidated financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.

These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the 

opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

5.6 Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements

Measurement of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives

Notes 1.3, 1.8, 1.11, 5 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements

Description of risk As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives was 

€25,136 million and €2,447 million respectively, representing 47% of the Group’s total assets.

As described in Notes 1.8 “Intangible assets” and 1.11 “Impairment of assets” to the consolidated financial 

statements, trademarks with indefinite useful lives and Cash Generating Units (CGUs) to which goodwill has 

been allocated are tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment.

The Group’s CGUs are Low Voltage, Medium Voltage, Industrial Automation and Secure Power, and correspond 

to the smallest identifiable groups of assets generating cash inflows that are largely independent from the cash 

inflows generated by other assets or groups of assets.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is defined as the higher between its value in use and its fair value less costs 

to sell. The value in use of a CGU is determined by discounting future cash flows that will be generated by its 

underlying assets and which are based on the Group management’s economic assumptions and operating 

forecasts.

The recoverable amount of trademarks with an indefinite useful life is measured using the royalty method.

An impairment loss is recognized whenever the recoverable amount of a CGU or a trademark is less than its 

carrying amount, to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. When the tested CGU 

comprises goodwill, the impairment loss is primarily deducted therefrom.

The valuation of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives is a key audit matter due to their significance 

in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet and the level of judgment required by management to:

• define the CGUs, as improper mapping could lead the Group to not recognize, or to underestimate, the 

impairment of goodwill;

• determine the assumptions used for the impairment tests of goodwill, particularly the discount rate, 

perpetuity growth rate and the expected margin rates or royalty rates.

How our audit 

addressed this risk

Our audit work consisted in:

• reviewing the Group’s method for defining the CGUs;

• comparing the carrying amount of assets tested with the accounting data;

• assessing the procedures implemented by the Group to evaluate the discounted future cash flows 

underlying the determination of the value in use of each CGU and checking their consistency with the 

business plans/cash flow projections approved by the Group’s Board of Directors;

• for the main trademarks with indefinite useful lives, assessing the procedures implemented to model the 

revenue projections attached to the trademarks;

• assessing the reasonableness of the business forecasts underlying the future cash flows, in particular with 

respect to past performance;

• with the assistance of our valuation experts, assessing the assumptions used such as the discount rate, 

perpetuity growth rate and expected margin rates, as well as the sensitivity of impairment test results to 

changes in these key assumptions;

• corroborate the royalty rates used with respect to (i) the theoretical royalty rates determined at the acquisition 

date of the trademark and (ii) the performance achieved;

• reconciling the sensitivity analyses performed by the Group with our sensitivity calculations;

• verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the impairment tests.

Lastly, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial 

statements.

Uncertain tax positions and recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets recognized for tax loss carryforwards

Notes 1.3, 1.16 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements

Description of risk The Group operates in several different tax jurisdictions around the world. As a result, the company and its 

subsidiaries may be subject to audits or questions from local tax authorities. Situations where cash outflows are 

considered probable give rise to liabilities, measured on the basis of the known facts in the jurisdiction 

concerned. 

In accordance with IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, provisions covering uncertainties over 

tax treatments are presented under “Accrued taxes and payroll costs”, as specified in Note 1.21 to the 

consolidated financial statements. 

In addition, the Group recognizes deferred tax assets in several countries based on its ability to recover them in 

future years. As of December 31, 2022, deferred tax assets in respect of tax loss carryforwards recognized in 

the consolidated balance sheet amounted to €724 million, mainly in France for an amount of €468 million.

As described in Note 1.16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group only recognizes future tax relief 

arising from the use of tax loss carryforwards when it can be reasonably anticipated that such relief will be 

granted, including when such amounts can be carried forward indefinitely.

The Group’s ability to recover deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards is assessed by management at the 

end of each reporting period. The recognition and correct valuation of these deferred tax assets are subject to 

the quality of the forecasts made by the Group.

The recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards and the recognition 

of liabilities for uncertain tax positions are key audit matters, given the judgment required from the Group to (i) 

assess the recoverability of the deferred taxes and (ii) estimate the likely outflow of resources in a constantly 

changing international environment.

How our audit 

assessed this risk

We held meetings with management, gained an understanding of the internal control procedures implemented 

by the Group to identify tax risks, and, where appropriate, to recognize any tax loss. 

With the assistance of our tax specialists, we also assessed the judgments made by management as part of our 

estimate of the income tax likely to be payable and the amount of any potential exposure, and, by extension, the 

reasonableness of the estimates as regards tax liabilities.  

With regard to the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards, our 

audit approach consisted in assessing the Group’s likelihood of benefiting from future tax relief arising from the 

use of tax loss carryforwards, in particular with regard to:

• plans for the consumption of the tax loss carryforwards of the subsidiaries or tax consolidation groups 

concerned;

• the main data and assumptions underlying the plans for the consumption of tax loss carryforwards 

underlying the recognition and measurement of the corresponding deferred tax assets by the Group.

We also verified the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial 

statements.

Specific verifications 

As required by legal and regulatory provisions and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also 

performed the specific verifications on the information pertaining to the Group presented in the Board of Directors’ management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. 

We attest that the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report includes the consolidated non-financial 

performance statement required under Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code. However, in accordance with Article L. 823-10 

of the French Commercial Code, we have not verified the fair presentation and consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the 

information given in that statement, which will be the subject of a report by an independent third party.

Other verifications and information pursuant to legal and regulatory requirements

Presentation of the consolidated financial statements to be included in the annual financial report 

In accordance with professional standards applicable to the Statutory Auditors’ procedures for annual and consolidated financial 

statements presented according to the single European electronic reporting format, we have verified that the presentation of the 

consolidated financial statements to be included in the annual financial report referred to in paragraph I of Article L. 451-1-2 of the French 

Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) and prepared under the Chief Executive Officer’s responsibility, complies with 

this format, as defined by European Delegated Regulation No. 2019/815 of December 17, 2018. As it relates to the consolidated financial 

statements, our work included verifying that the markups in the financial statements comply with the format defined by the aforementioned 

Regulation.

F I N A N C I A L  S T A T E M E N T SChapter 5 – Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022

5.6 Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements

On the basis of our work, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements to be included in the annual financial 

report complies, in all material respects, with the single European electronic reporting format.

Due to the technical limitations inherent in the macro-tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the European 

single electronic reporting format, the content of certain tags in the notes to the financial statements may not be rendered identically to the 

consolidated financial statements attached to this report.

In addition, it is not our responsibility to ensure that the consolidated financial statements to be included by the Company in the annual 

financial report filed with the AMF correspond to those on which we carried out our work.

Appointment of the Statutory Auditors

We were appointed Statutory Auditors of Schneider Electric S.E. by the Annual General Meetings held on May 6, 2004 for Mazars and on 

May 5, 2022 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit. 

At December 31, 2022, Mazars was in the nineteenth consecutive year of their engagement and PricewaterhouseCoopers in their first year.

Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial 

statements 

Management is responsible for preparing consolidated financial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with International 

Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary 

for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going 

concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to 

liquidate the Company or to cease operations. 

The Audit and Risks Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk 

management systems, as well as, where applicable, any internal audit systems, relating to accounting and financial reporting procedures.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.

Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements 

Objective and audit approach

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 

consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 

not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it 

exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 

expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  

As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the 

Company’s management.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional 

judgment throughout the audit. 

They also:

• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 

perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a 

basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 

fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

• obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;

• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and 

the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements;

• assess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 

whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue 

as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events 

or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material 

uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 

statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;

• evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying 

transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to

Business and Statement of Income highlights

Transaction with AVEVA’s non-controlling interests

On September 21, 2022, the Group confirmed its firm intention to acquire the share capital of AVEVA that it did not already own.

On November 11, 2022, the board of Schneider Electric and the AVEVA Independent Committee announced that they reached an 

agreement on the terms of a cash offer of 3,225 pence per AVEVA share. Such acquisition is to be effected by means of a Court approved 

scheme of arrangement, under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006.

On November 25, 2022, the requisite majority of AVEVA’s shareholders approved the Scheme, and passed the Special Resolution to 

implement the Scheme during respectively the Court Meeting and the General Meeting. This led to the immediate recognition of a current 

financial liability in the Group’s financial statements of GBP 4,039 million (EUR 4,704 million as of November 25, 2022 closing rate). The 

liability represents the commitment for the Group to purchase the 123,429,542 outstanding AVEVA shares not already owned as of 

November 25, 2022, and the 1,814,217 shares to be issued in the context of AVEVA’s long term incentive plans. The recognition of this 

liability triggered an immediate reduction in non-controlling interests for EUR 2,865 million and in the group share of equity for EUR 1,839 

million. In addition, the Group recognized transaction costs against equity.

The liability, presented under “Current purchase commitments over non-controlling interests”, amounted to EUR 4,554 million as of 

December 31, 2022. In order to meet the certain funds requirements under UK regulation law (and guarantee the availability of funds at 

closing date), the Group held at December 31, 2022 an undrawn bridge facility to approximately GBP 2.4 billion (with a twelve months 

maturity), a term loan facility of GBP 1.5 billion (with a three-year maturity) and a EUR 423 million cash deposit held at Schneider Electric SE 

(classified in Cash and cash equivalents).

The acquisition of the remaining shares of AVEVA was hedged during the second semester 2022 by entering into FX options for a total of 

GBP 4,000 million. The EUR 12 million realized loss on the hedging instruments was recorded in “Costs of acquisitions and integrations” 

within “Other operating income and expenses” (in this context, hedge accounting is not possible under IFRS).

As of December 31, 2022, all regulatory conditions were met, however the Scheme remained to be sanctioned by the Court.

On January 16, 2023, AVEVA announced that the Court had sanctioned the Scheme to effect the acquisition.

On January 18, 2023, following the deliverance of the Court Order to the Registrar of Companies, the Scheme became effective. AVEVA 

shares were unlisted from the London Stock Exchange on January 19, 2023. The transaction has been settled in cash in January 2023.

fair value less costs to sell. A resulting impairment of EUR 75 million was recognized within Other Operating Income and Expenses.

The transaction was completed on January 6, 2023.

Industrial sensors business

On October 27, 2022, the Group announced the signing of a binding agreement with YAGEO to divest its industrial sensors business, 

Telemecanique Sensors. Telemecanique Sensors had revenue of around EUR 280 million in 2021, Telemecanique Sensors is reported within

reported basis. Organic growth was driven by a continuation of strong and dynamic market demand in the majority of end-markets and 

segments served by the Group, supported by accelerating energy transition trends and recovery in late-cycle segments. Consumer-linked 

segments saw softness in some geographies in the second half of the year. The Group saw good volume expansion year-on-year, with price 

actions also contributing strongly to growth. Supply chain pressures were evident throughout the year, with progressive easing through the 

second half, though some tightness related to the supply of electronic components remains. Growth was impacted by the Group’s 

withdrawal from Russia and the effects of COVID-19 infections and related lockdowns in China. Forex impact were +5.7% primarily due to 

the strengthening of the USD against the EUR, while there was a net negative impact of (0.2)% from acquisitions and disposals.

Energy 

Management
Industrial 

Automation Total

Full Year 2022 26,442 7,734 34,176

Full Year 2021 22,179 6,726 28,905

Energy Management generated revenues of EUR 26,442 million, equivalent to 77% of the Group’s revenues and was up +12.9% organically. 

North America grew +18% organic with strong demand across all end-markets, including residential buildings. Western Europe was up 

+13% organic with double-digit growth in each of the five main economies of the region with continued good traction in Data Center & 

non-residential Buildings, though residential markets were impacted by pressures on consumer-spending. Asia-Pacific grew +9% organic 

impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19 and softer residential markets in China, but with strong growth across the rest of the region, 

notably in India. Rest of the World was up +10% organic with strong project execution in resource driven economies and despite headwinds 

from Russia prior to the Group’s exit.

Industrial Automation generated revenues of EUR 7,734 million, equivalent to 23% of the Group’s revenues and was up +9.5% organically. 

Growth was led by Discrete automation markets while sales into Process & Hybrid markets grew strongly, benefiting from recovery in 

resource driven economies. North America grew +10% organic led by performance in Discrete automation markets, while strong growth in 

Process & Hybrid markets was supported by execution on a project in Mexico. Western Europe was up +14% organic, with strong growth in 

Discrete automation markets, particularly in Italy, Spain and France. Asia-Pacific was up +7% organic, impacted by the resurgence of 

COVID-19 in China, but with strong growth across the rest of the region, including in India and Japan. Rest of the World was up +8% organic 

despite headwinds from Russia prior to the Group’s exit.

Gross profit

Gross profit was up +10.8% organic with Gross margin down -50bps organic, reaching 40.6% in 2022. The decline in margin was mainly 

driven by lower productivity due to inflationary pressures in the supply chain.

Research and development expenses, net of capitalized development costs and excluding research and development costs booked in 

costs of sales, increased by 21.6% from EUR 855 million for 2021 to EUR 1,040 million for 2022. As a percentage of revenues, the net cost of 

research and development remain stable, at 3.0%.

Other operating income and expenses

For 2022, other operating income and expenses amounted to a net expense of EUR 433 million. The gains and losses on disposal of 

business for EUR (108) million are mainly due to the termination of activities and disposal of the main subsidiaries in Russia and Belarus, 

partially compensated by the gains from the disposal of Eurotherm, Asco Load Banks as well as Eberle activities. The impairment of assets 

mainly relates to the impairment of assets held for Sale in relation with the disposal of Transformers plants in Poland and Turkey. The costs of 

acquisition and integration slightly increase versus 2021, reaching EUR 180 million, mainly due to the EUR 28 million share-based payments, 

corresponding to the acceleration of multiple AVEVA plans, in line with the terms of the transaction.

Restructuring costs

For 2022, restructuring costs remain stable at EUR 227 million, and are linked to the Group’s initiatives to decrease support function costs.

EBITA and Adjusted EBITA

EBITA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of purchase accounting intangibles. EBITA comprises operating profit 

before amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangible assets and before goodwill impairment. Adjusted EBITA is adjusted 

as EBITA before restructuring costs and before other operating income and expenses, which includes acquisition, integration and 

separation costs.

Adjusted EBITA amounted to EUR 6,017 million for 2022, compared to EUR 4,987 million for 2021, an organic increase of 14.4%. As a 

percentage of revenues, adjusted EBITA increased at 17.6% with margin improving 40 bps organically.

EBITA increased from EUR 4,741 million for 2021 to EUR 5,357 million in 2022. As a percentage of revenues, EBITA decreases at 15.7% in 

2022 (16.4% for 2021).

Adjusted EBITA (%) 20.3% 18.5% 17.3%

On December 31, 2021, the total backlog to be executed in more than a year amounted to EUR 640 million.

Energy Management reporting segment generated an adjusted EBITA of EUR 5,392 million, or 20.4% of revenues, up c. +40 bps organic 

(up +10 bps on a reported basis), due mainly to a combination of good volumes and strong pricing, an improvement of gross margin in the 

systems business, and good control of Support Function Costs more than offsetting the inflationary pressures in the supply chain.

Industrial Automation reporting segment generated an adjusted EBITA of EUR 1,458 million, or 18.9% of revenues, up c. +30 bps organic 

(up +40 bps on a reported basis), due mainly to a combination of good volumes and strong pricing, more than offsetting the inflationary 

pressures in the supply chain and a negative mix impact from lower sales at AVEVA.

Central functions & digital costs in 2022 amounted to EUR 833 million (EUR 756 million in 2021), reducing slightly as a proportion of revenue 

to 2.4%. Investment in the Group’s strategic priorities continued, while the Corporate cost element continued to be an area of focus and 

remained under tight control, remaining at around 0.7% of Group revenues in 2022.

Amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangibles

The amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangibles amounted to EUR 424 million compared with EUR 410 million last year. 

The increase is mostly driven by additional amortization linked with acquisitions completed in the second semester 2021 (ETAP) and the 

second semester 2022 (EV Connect and Autogrid).

Operating income (EBIT)

Operating income or EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), increased from EUR 4,331 million for 2021 to 4,933 million for 2022, an 

increase of 13.9%, as EBITA.

Net financial income/loss

Net financial loss amounted to EUR 215 million for 2022, compared to EUR 176 million for 2021, mainly due to the slight increase in cost of 

debt (from EUR 95 million in 2021 to EUR 106 million in 2022), following the increase in interest rates observed in the fourth quarter of 2022, 

as well as an increased negative impact from foreign exchange fluctuations (from EUR 8 million in 2021 to EUR 27 million in 2022).

Income tax expense

The effective tax rate was 25.7% for 2022, and 23.2% for 2021. Restating the EUR 195 million Russia and Belarus deconsolidation impact 

from the profit before tax (no tax impact attached), the effective tax rate would be of 24.6%. The corresponding income tax expense 

increased from EUR 966 million for 2021 to EUR 1,211 million for 2022.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities before changes in working capital requirement reached EUR 5,393 million for 2022, increasing compared 

to EUR 4,469 million for 2021. It represented 15.8% of revenues for 2022 (15.5% of revenues from 2021).

Change in working capital requirement consumed EUR 1,039 million in cash in 2022, compared to a consumption of EUR 853 million in 

2021.

In all, net cash from operating activities increased from EUR 3,616 million in 2021 to EUR 4,354 million in 2022.

Investing Activities

Net capital expenditure, which includes capitalized development projects, increased, at EUR 1,024 million for 2022, compared to EUR 817 

million for 2021, and representing 3.0% of sales in 2022 compared to 2.8% in 2021.

Free cash-flow (cash from operating activities net of net capital expenditure) amounted to EUR 3,330 million in 2022 versus EUR 2,799 

million in 2021.

Cash conversion rate (free cash-flow over net income attributable to the equity holders of the parent company on continuing operations) 

was 96% in 2022 versus 87% in 2021.

The acquisitions net of disposals represented a cash out of EUR 297 million (net of acquired cash) for 2022, compared with EUR 4,231 

million for 2021. Those amounts correspond mainly to the acquisitions and disposals described in Notes 2.1 and 2.2 of the Consolidated 

Financial Statements (Chapter 5).

Financing Activities

Net cash outflow from financing activities amounted to EUR 1,453 million during the year 2022, compared to cash outflow of EUR 3,093 

million during the year 2021. The variance is mainly due to the bond issuances in 2022 for EUR 1.1 billion (no bonds issuance in 2021), as 

well as a year-on-year net increase in commercial papers and short-term debt of EUR 0.5 billion.

The dividend paid by Schneider Electric was EUR 1,618 million in 2022, compared with EUR 1,447 million in 2021.

6.3 Notes to the financial statements

(All amounts are in thousands of euros unless otherwise indicated)

6.3.1 Significant events of the financial year
• Schneider Electric announced by press release dated November 29, 2021, its planned merger by absorption of the company IGE+XAO 

(subsidiary of the group since February 2018). This merger, dated May 5, 2022, took place in several stages and impacted the accounts 

of Schneider Electric SE:

1) Schneider Electric Industries S.A.S. (SEISAS) sold its shares in IGE+XAO to Schneider Electric S.E. (SESE) before the implementation of 

the Merger Plan, for 293 million euros.

2) At the same time, the company IGE+XAO merged within the entity Schneider Electric S.E (retroactive effect from January 1, 2022)

3) SESE subsequently sold its SEEMSF shares to SEI SAS, for 311 million euros.

• Investigations were conducted in September 2018 by the French judicial authority and French Competition Authority (Autorité de la 

concurrence) at Schneider Electric’s head office and other premises concerning the sale of electrical products through commercial 

distribution activities in France. On July 4, 2022, Schneider Electric received a statement of objections (notification de griefs) from the 

French Competition Authority alleging that the pricing autonomy of some distributors in the French market would have been limited, in 

breach of competition rules. Schneider Electric strongly disagrees with the allegations of the statement of objections and has submitted 

its response to the French Competition Authority on October 4, 2022. Concurrently on October 7, 2022 Schneider Electric was indicted 

by an investigating judge who required Schneider Electric to provide a bank guarantee of 20 million euros and a cash guarantee of 80 

million euros which was paid mid-January 2023. As at December 31, 2022, this cash guarantee was recognized as “Other liabilities” 

against “Financial assets”. These actions do not mean that Schneider Electric will ultimately be found guilty of any wrongdoing. 

Schneider Electric firmly disagrees with all the allegations made by the French investigating judge and the French Competition Authority 

and intends to defend itself fully and vigorously. Should the French Competition Authority deny Schneider Electric’s arguments and 

conclude, after examining the substance of the matter, that anti-competitive practices have been involved, it has broad discretion to 

determine on a case-by-case basis the financial fines it may impose in accordance with the principles of proportionality and individuality. 

In light of the difficulty in assessing the extent to which the French Competition Authority takes into account the arguments of Schneider 

Electric in its defense as well as the multiple factors contributing to the determination of a fine, it is not possible to reliably estimate the 

amount of any potential fine that might be incurred in the event of an adverse decision, even though it might have a significant impact on 

the Group. In this context, no provision has been made at this stage of the investigation.

• In September 2022, as part of the operation to acquire minority interests in AVEVA by its indirect subsidiary Ascot Acquisition Holdings 

Limited and to comply with UK regulations on public offers, Schneider Electric SE implemented placed a 4.1 billion british pounds 

bridging line of credit for 12 months with the possibility of requesting two successive 6-month extensions. This line of credit was then 

partially refinanced by a 3-year loan line of 1.5 billion British Pounds and cash deposited in a segregated account. At closing, the amount 

of the bridging line of credit was 2.4 billion British Pounds and was supplemented by the loan line for 1.5 billion British Pounds and a 

cash deposit of 423 million Euros invested in Money market SICAVs meeting the criteria for registration as cash.

• On November 9, 2022, SESE carried out a bond issue in two tranches of respectively 500 million euros at a rate of 3.25% and maturing in 

November 2027 and 600 million euros at a rate of 3.5% and maturing in November 2032. These two transactions implemented as part of 

the financing of the acquisition of AVEVA’s minority interests included a reimbursement clause allowing the company to reimburse them 

in the event that the acquisition did not take place.

• Since January 1, 2022, Schneider Electric SE has held full ownership of the Schneider Electric brand and has managed it. As such, it 

collects the royalties invoiced to all the companies in the Group and bears the related costs. In May 2022, the 2021 dividend was paid in 

the amount of 1,619 million euros. The company bought back 1.6 million of its own shares for 219 million euros.

• As of December 31, 2022, the company decided to fund some of its current action plans on existing shares and to re-invoice the related 

expense to the various Group companies. As a result of these movements, the provision for charges was adjusted to 312 million euros.

6.3 Notes to the financial statements

6.3.2 Accounting principles
As in the prior financial year, the financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 have been prepared in accordance 

with French generally accepted accounting principles and with the ANC no. 2014-03.

Accounting principles for the preparation of the financial statements of the parent company were applied, in accordance with precautionary 

principle and based on the following fundamental assumptions: 

• going concern,

• consistency of accounting methods from one period to the next,

• accrual basis

Assets and liabilities are measured according to the historical cost convention. 

Only significant information is disclosed.

Non-current assets

Non-current assets of all types are stated at historical cost.

Historical costs include purchase price include import duties and non-refundable taxes, as well as any expenses directly attributable to the 

preparation of the asset for use (registration fees, salaries related to the installation, set-up costs, testing…)

The company uses the component approach as defined by CRC regulation 2002-10. The analysis and investigations carried out by the 

company and the Schneider Electric Group have allowed to ensure the current split of non-current asset met this principle: components with 

distinct useful life are indeed accounted for separately, according their own amortization plan.

Intangible assets

Intangible rights are amortized over a maximum of 5 years.

Property, plant and equipment

Amortizable items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 

to 10 years. Lands are not depreciated.

Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates

Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates are recorded at acquisition cost, plus directly attributable costs (including acquisition costs related to 

these transactions).

Provisions for depreciation may be made if the book value is higher than the value in use estimated at the end of the financial year. This 

estimate is determined mainly by reference to the net book value of the investment.

Equity investments are valued at their value in use each year.

Own shares

Treasury stocks are assessed by category (shares in subsidiaries and affiliates, marketable securities), according to the FIFO method 

“first-in, first-out”.

The accounting classification of treasury stocks depends on the purpose for which they are held:

• own shares are classified in marketable securities if they are the object of an explicit or implicit allocation to cover performance share 

distribution plans or if they are bought to regulate the share price of the Group.

• own shares are classified in long-term investments if they are not the object of an explicit allocation to cover a performance share or if 

they are bought with the aim of their use within the context of a liquidity contract by an investment services provider, or of their later 

cancellation within the framework of a capital reduction.

The accounting of an impairment of own shares depends on the purpose for which they are held:

• when own shares are allocated to cover of performance share distribution plans, there is no reason to record a provision for impairment.

• in other cases, it is necessary to book an impairment if the average stock market price of the month before the closing is lower than the 

weighted average cost.

A provision for risks and charges is recognized when the treasury shares are subject to an explicit or implicit allocation to cover 

performance share plans.

Receivables and debts

Receivables and debts are valued at their face value (historical cost). Receivables are, where applicable, depreciated by means of a 

provision to take account of the risk of non-recovery.

At the end of the period, receivables and debts in foreign currencies are revalued at the rate at the end of the period.

The foreign exchange risk borne by the company is managed centrally at the level of Boissière Finance SNC.

The Schneider Electric group organizes a foreign exchange risk hedging policy (“Fair Value Natural Hedge”, hereinafter “FVNH”) aimed at 

comprehensively managing the monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies recorded on the balance sheets of the subsidiaries.

The monetary assets and liabilities included in the company’s FVNH position (customer invoices, supplier invoices, banks, current accounts) 

are consolidated and balanced on a daily basis through spot foreign exchange transactions carried out in current accounts with Boissière 

Finance SNC. Foreign exchange gains and losses related to the revaluation at the closing ECB fixing rate of monetary assets and liabilities 

in foreign currencies offset each other within the foreign exchange position.

Provisions for depreciation of bad debts are recorded when it becomes probable that the debt will not be collected, and it is possible to 

reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. The identification of doubtful debts as well as the amount of the corresponding provisions are 

based on the historical experience of definitive losses on debts, the analysis by age of the specific accounts as well as the related credit 

risks. When the certainty is acquired that a doubtful debt will not be recovered, it is, as well as its constituted provision, canceled by the 

income statement.

Other exploitation products

Royalties from the Schneider brand have been recognized in this item of the income statement

Non-recurring income

Income and expenses for the financial year are classified in the income statement in such a way as to show by difference the items of 

current profit and the items of extraordinary profit, including: the achievement is not related to the day-to-day operation of the business 

which are not likely to be recurring over which the company has only limited control

Pension obligations

The present value of termination benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method. Provisions are funded for the supplementary 

pension benefits provided by the company on the basis of the contractual terms of top-hat agreements, granting a level of benefits 

exceeding the general regimes. The company applies the corridor method to actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in estimates. 

Under this method, the portion of net cumulative actuarial gains and losses exceeding 10% of the projected benefit obligation is amortized 

over 10 years.

The actuarial assumptions used to determine the company’s commitment are as follows:

• Valuation date: December 31, 2022.

• Data date: September 30, 2022.

• Inflation rate: 2.20%.

• Discount rate: 3.75%.

• Rate of return on assets: 2.75%.

• Retirement age: Full rate age.

• Age of beginning of salaried activity: 23 years old.

• Turnover rate: 0.00%.

• Mortality rate: TGH, TGF 05.

• Annuity growth rate: 1.50%.

Currency risk

When necessary, a contingency provision is put in place for unrealized exchange losses. However, when there are unrealized exchange 

gains and losses on back-to-back transactions in the same currency and with the same maturity, the amount of the provision is then limited 

to the net loss.

Bonds

Issue costs are amortized over the life of the bonds and are booked under “deferred expenses”. Issuance premiums are booked under “Call 

premiums” & amortized over the duration of the bonds. 

In the case of convertible bond (OCEANE), at conversion, the bond will be reclassified as equity for its nominal conversion amount.

During the year, the company reimbursed one bond amounting USD 800 million matured on September 2022. In the previous financial year 

2021, the revaluation of the Schneider Electric SE 2022 bond issue by USD 800 million had led to an asset translation difference of EUR 85

Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, if the average sustainability performance score (calculated as the arithmetic average of the 

scores of the three key performance indicators) does not reach a certain level by December 31, 2025, the Group will pay an amount equal 

to 0.50% of the face value.

The three key performance indicators from the 11 new Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) 2021–2025 indicators are the following:

• Climate: Deliver 800 megatons of saved and avoided C02 emissions to our customers;

• Equality: Increase gender diversity, from hiring to front-line managers and leadership teams (50/40/30);

• Generation: Train 1 million underprivileged people in energy management.

The detailed rating methodology and approach are presented in the Group’s Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework. For all those 

transactions, issue premium and issue costs are amortized per the effective interest rate method 

At December 31, 2022, the other remaining bonds are as follows:

exposure to interest rates.

Note 22 Contingencies

Investigations were conducted in September 2018 by the French judicial authority and French Competition Authority (Autorité de la 

concurrence) at Schneider Electric’s head office and other premises concerning the sale of electrical products through commercial 

distribution activities in France.

On July 4, 2022, Schneider Electric received a statement of objections (notification de griefs) from the French Competition Authority alleging 

that the pricing autonomy of some distributors in the French market would have been limited, in breach of competition rules.

Schneider Electric strongly disagrees with the allegations of the statement of objections and has submitted its response to the French 

Competition Authority on October 4, 2022.

Concurrently on October 7, 2022 Schneider Electric was indicted by an investigating judge who required Schneider Electric to provide a 

bank guarantee of EUR 20 million and a cash guarantee of EUR 80 million which was paid mid-January 2023. At December 31, 2022, this 

cash guarantee was recognized as “Other liabilities” against “financial assets”.

Those actions do not mean that Schneider Electric will ultimately be found guilty of any wrongdoing. Schneider Electric firmly disagrees with 

all the allegations made by the French investigating judge and the French Competition Authority and intends to defend itself fully and 

vigorously. Should the French Competition Authority deny Schneider Electric’s arguments and conclude, after examining the substance of 

the matter, that anti-competitive practices have been involved, it has broad discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis the financial 

fines it may impose in accordance with the principles of proportionality and individuality. In light of the difficulty in assessing the extent to 

which the French Competition Authority takes into account the arguments of Schneider Electric in its defense as well as the multiple factors 

contributing to the determination of a fine, it is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of any potential fine that might be incurred in the 

event of an adverse decision, even though it might have a significant impact on the Group. In this context, no provision has been made at 

this stage of the investigation.

Note 23 Other Information

23.1 – Workforce

The average number of employees is 2.5 over 2022.

23.2 – Consolidated financial statements

Schneider Electric SE is the parent company of the Group and accordingly publishes the consolidated financial statements of the Schneider 

Electric Group.

23.3 – Subsequent events

On January 30, 2023 as part of the closing of the transaction, SESE used the bridging loan for an amount of EUR 1 billion and the loan line 

for an amount of EUR 1.7 billion and made the corresponding cash available to Ascot Acquisition Holdings Limited.

On January 13, 2023 SESE carried out a bond issue in two tranches: EUR 600 milllion at a rate of 3.125% and maturing in October 2029 and 

€600m at a rate of 3.375% and maturing in April 2034.

6.4  Statutory auditors’ report on the 
annual financial statements

To the Annual General Meeting of Schneider Electric S.E.,

Opinion 

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial 

statements of Schneider Electric S.E. for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company at 

December 31, 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Risks Committee.

Basis for opinion 

Audit framework

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have 

obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under these standards are further described in the “Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the 

financial statements” section of our report. 

Independence

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code (Code de 

commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory Auditors for the period from January 1, 2022 to the date of 

our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.

Justification of assessments – Key audit matters

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our 

assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were 

the most significant in our audit of the financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.

These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we 

formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.

Measurement of investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances

“Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates” paragraph of the “Accounting principles” section and Note 2 “Investments” to the financial statements

Description of risk At December 31, 2022, shares in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances recorded in the 

Company’s balance sheet amounted to €5,358 million and €2,513 million respectively.

As described in the “Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates” paragraph in the “Accounting policies” section of the 

notes to the financial statements, shares in subsidiaries and affiliates are recorded at their acquisition cost and 

written down when their estimated value in use at the reporting date is less than their carrying amount. The 

estimated value in use of shares in subsidiaries and affiliates is determined primarily by reference to the 

accounting net assets of the investments and by taking into account the profitability of the investments and the 

outlook for the economic environment. For listed securities, the average share price for the last month of the 

financial year is taken into account.

Due to the judgment required from management in making these estimates, particularly when they are based on 

forward-looking information, we considered that the valuation of shares in subsidiaries and affiliates, and by 

extension the related loans and advances, is a key audit matter.

How our audit 

addressed this risk

We examined the methodology employed by the Company to estimate the value in use of shares in subsidiaries 

and affiliates. Our audit work consisted in:

• comparing the share in accounting net assets used to determine the value in use of shares in subsidiaries 

and affiliates with the financial statements of those subsidiaries and affiliates that have been audited or 

subject to analytical procedures;

• assessing, when values in use have been determined on the basis of forecasts, the appropriateness of the 

valuation method on which the estimation is based;

• assessing the main assumptions used in estimating values in use, in particular the long-term growth rate and 

the discount rate, with the help of our valuation experts, where appropriate;

• verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the value in use calculations used by your Company;

We also assessed the recoverability of the related receivables in light of the impairment tests performed on the 

shares in subsidiaries and affiliates.

Specific verifications

In accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also performed the specific verifications required by French legal 

and regulatory provisions. 

Information given in the management report and in the other documents provided to the shareholders with respect to the 

Company’s financial position and the financial statements

We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the 

Board of Directors’ management report and in the other documents provided to the shareholders with respect to the Company’s financial 

position and the financial statements. 

We attest to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information about the payment terms referred to in 

Article D. 441-6 of the French Commercial Code. 

Report on corporate governance

We attest that the Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-4, L. 22-10-10 

and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.

Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code relating to 

compensation and benefits paid or awarded to corporate officers and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified its 

consistency with the financial statements or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements, and, where 

applicable, with the information obtained by the Company from controlled companies within its scope of consolidation. Based on this work, 

we attest to the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.

Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code relating to 

those items the Company has deemed liable to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, we have verified its 

consistency with the underlying documents that were disclosed to us. Based on this work, we have no matters to report with regard to this 

information.

Other information

voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.

Other verifications and information pursuant to legal and regulatory requirements

Format of the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report

statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the 

presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French 

Monetary and Financial Code (code monétaire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer, complies with 

the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.

Based on our work, we conclude that the presentation of Schneider Electric S.E.’s statutory financial statements to be included in the annual 

financial report complies, in all material aspects, with the single electronic reporting format.

We have no responsibility to verify that the financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial 

report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.

Appointment of the Statutory Auditors

We were appointed Statutory Auditors of Schneider Electric S.E. by the Annual General Meetings held on May 6, 2004 for Mazars and on 

May 5, 2022 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit. 

At December 31, 2022, Mazars was in the nineteenth consecutive year of their engagement and PricewaterhouseCoopers in their first year.

Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements

Management is responsible for preparing financial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with French accounting principles, 

and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of financial statements that are free of material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 

disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate 

the Company or to cease operations. 

The Audit and Risks Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and 

risk management systems, as well as, where applicable, any internal audit systems, relating to accounting and financial reporting 

procedures.

The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. 

Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the financial statements

Objective and audit approach

Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 

statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an 

audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 

arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 

economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these financial statements. 

As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the 

Company’s management.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional 

judgment throughout the audit. They also:

• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 

procedures in response to those risks and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their 

opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 

involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

• obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;

• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and 

the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements;

• assess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 

whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue 

as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events 

or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material 

uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 

disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;

• evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions 

and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Report to the Audit and Risks Committee

We submit a report to the Audit and Risks Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit 

program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have 

identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.

Our report to the Audit and Risks Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most 

significant for the audit of the financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.

We also provide the Audit and Risks Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our 

independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French 

Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence 

and the related safeguard measures with the Audit and Risks Committee.

6.8  Extract of the management report for 
the year ended December 31, 2022

Review of the parent company financial statements

In 2022, Schneider Electric SE reported an operating gain of EUR 229 million compared with a loss of EUR 22 million  

the previous year.

Income from ordinary activities before tax stood at EUR 1,709 million in 2022 compared with an income of EUR 1,437 million in 2021. The 

variance is mainly due to the Schneider Electric brand royalties income, as Schneider Electric SE became the full owner of the brand from 

January 1st, 2022.

The net income stood at EUR 1,744 million in 2022 compared with EUR 1,498 million in 2021.

Net equity amounted to EUR 7,213 million at December 31, 2022 versus EUR 6,874 million at the previous year-end, taking  

into account 2022 profit and dividend payments of EUR 1,619 million.

mutual funds (FCPE), or through Performance Share plans, representing 3.8% of the share capital and 6.6% of the voting rights, taking into 

account double voting rights.

Voting rights attached to shares held by corporate mutual funds are exercised by the supervisory boards of these corporate mutual funds.

The Group’s employee shareholders are spread across over 50 countries, as follows: 22% in France, 13% in China, 16% in India, 9% in the 

United States, and 40% elsewhere. Approximately 71% of all employees are shareholders of the Group.

39ter, 40, 41, 41bis, and 41ter, delivery of which, either in existing shares or shares to be issued, has not yet been determined by the

Board). If all Performance Shares were vested, this would lead to the issuance of 1,588,909 shares. Schneider Electric SE capital would

be composed of 572,681,830 ordinary shares, i.e. a 0.28% increase of the number of shares as of December 31, 2022; and of

• 3,683,972 OCEANEs. If all OCEANEs were exercised, this would lead to the issuance of 3,695,023 shares(1). Schneider Electric SE

capital would be composed of 574,787,944 ordinary shares, i.e. a 0.65% increase of the number of shares as of December 31, 2022.

(1) The initial conversion and/or exchange ratio was set at one share per OCEANE subject to standard adjustments including dividend protection at €2.55€ per share. As

the result of the dividend distribution of €2.90 per share on May 19  2022, the conversion and/or exchange ratio has been adjusted to 1.003 share per OCEANE.

7.2.5 Share buybacks

7.2.5.1 Current share buyback program

We remind you that on February 14, 2019, Schneider Electric initiated a new €1.5 billion to €2.0 billion share buyback program. The program 

has been launched under the 15th resolution approved at the 2018 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and pursued under the 14th, 17th, 15th, and 

14th resolutions approved respectively at the 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Annual Shareholders’ Meetings. These buybacks are part of a 

policy to neutralize the dilution resulting from capital increases reserved for employees or from Long Term Incentive Plans. All the shares 

acquired by the Company as part of the share buyback program are held to cover Long Term Incentive Plans.

At the beginning of 2021, due to the economic uncertainty, and considering the ongoing acquisitions, the share buyback program remained 

on-hold after its suspension due to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. The share buyback program restarted at the end of July 2021. On May 5, 

2022, the proposal to raise the cap on purchase price to €250 per share (from the previous €150 per share) was approved at the Annual 

Shareholders’ Meeting. Schneider Electric did not further progress the buyback in the second half-year primarily due to restrictions on 

account of the proposed transaction with the AVEVA minority shareholders that was in progress during the period. Schneider Electric 

remains committed to the completion of the existing share buyback program.

Since the beginning of the program in 2019, a total €796,969,443 of share buyback corresponding to 7,601,716 shares bought back by the 

Company had been completed including €219,470,200 of share buyback in 2022 corresponding to 1,659,933 shares bought back by the 

Company pursuant to the last authorizations.

7.2.5.2 Share buyback program to be submitted to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting

7.4 Shareholders’ rights and obligations

7.4.1 Annual Shareholders’ Meetings (Article 19 of the 
Articles of Association)
This section is part of the Board of Directors’ Corporate Governance Report.

Annual Shareholders’ Meetings are called and run in accordance with the conditions prescribed by law.

The meetings are held at the head office or any other address provided in the call to meeting. The Board may decide, when each meeting is 

called, to organize the public transmission of all or part of the meeting by video conference and/or using teletransmission techniques.

All shareholders may attend meetings, in person or by proxy, after providing proof of identity and share ownership in accordance with 

applicable laws and regulations.

When the decision is made to call an Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the Board of Directors may also decide to allow shareholders to 

participate or vote at Annual Shareholders’ Meetings using video conferencing facilities and/or any other telecommunication medium 

allowed under applicable legislation.

Remote voting procedures are governed by the applicable laws and regulations. In particular, shareholders may send proxy and mail ballot 

forms before Annual Shareholders’ Meetings either in paper form or, if approved by the Board of Directors and stated in the meeting 

announcement and/or notice, electronically.

When the decision is made to call an Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the Board of Directors may authorize shareholders to fill out and sign 

these forms electronically through a secure site set up by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting organizer using a process that complies with 

applicable laws and regulations (Paragraph 2 of Article 1367 of the French Civil Code) and consisting of a username and password.

Proxies or votes so submitted electronically before the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, as well as the related acknowledgments of receipt, 

will be considered irrevocable and binding documents. However, in the event that shares are sold before the applicable record date 

(midnight Paris time two business days before the meeting date), the Company will cancel or amend, as appropriate, any related proxy or 

electronic votes submitted before the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

Meetings shall be chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or in his absence by the Vice-Chairman, or in his absence by a 

member of the Board of Directors specially appointed for that purpose by the Board of Directors. In the event that no chairman has been 

selected, the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting elects its chairman.

The two shareholders present who hold the largest number of votes and who accept shall act as scrutineers. The Board appoints a 

secretary, who is not required to be a shareholder.

As required by law, a register of attendance is kept.

Copies or extracts of the meeting’s minutes are certified either by the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the Annual 

Shareholders’ Meeting’s secretary.

7.4.2 Voting rights
This section is part of the Board of Directors’ Corporate Governance Report.

7.4.2.1 Double voting rights (Article 20 of the Articles of Association)

Voting rights attached to shares are proportionate to the equity in the capital they represent, assuming that they all have the same nominal 

value. Each capital share or dividend share confers the right to one vote except where compulsory legal provisions limit the number of votes 

a shareholder may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, double voting rights are attributed to fully paid-up shares registered in the name of 

the same holder for at least two years prior to the end of the calendar year preceding that in which the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting takes 

place, subject to compliance with the provisions of the law. In the case of a bonus share issue paid up by capitalizing reserves, earnings, or 

additional issue premiums, each bonus share allotted in respect of shares carrying double voting rights will also have double voting rights.

The shares are stripped of their double voting rights if they are converted into bearer shares or transferred, except in the case of the transfer 

from one registered holder to another as part of an inheritance or family gift.

Double voting rights may also be stripped by a decision of the Extraordinary Annual Shareholders’ Meeting after ratification by a Special 

Shareholders’ Meeting of beneficiaries benefiting from double voting rights.

The minimum holding period to qualify for double voting rights was reduced from four to two years by decision of the Ordinary and 

Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting of June 27, 1995.

7.4.2.2 Ceiling on voting rights (Article 20 of the Articles of Association)

At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, no shareholder may exercise, either in person or through a proxy, by virtue of single voting rights 

conferred by the shares they hold directly and indirectly and by virtue of the proxy votes entrusted to them, more than 10% of the total 

number of the voting rights conferred by shares in the Company. However, if a shareholder also holds double voting rights directly or 

indirectly and/or as proxy, the limit set may be exceeded taking into consideration only the resulting additional voting rights, without the total 

voting rights thereby held exceeding 15% of the total number of the voting rights conferred by the shares in the Company.

To apply these provisions:

• The total number of voting rights allowed are calculated as of the date of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and announced to the 

shareholders at the beginning of such Annual Shareholders’ Meeting;

• The number of voting rights held directly and indirectly are understood to include those conferred by shares held personally by a 

shareholder, those conferred by shares held by a legal entity controlled by a shareholder as defined by Article L. 233-3 of the French 

Commercial Code, and those shares that are assimilated to the shares owned, as defined by the provisions of Articles L. 233-7 et seq. of 

the Code; and

• Shareholders’ proxies returned to the Company that do not appoint a representative are subject to the above ceilings. However, these 

ceilings do not apply to the meeting chairman voting on behalf of such proxies.

The above ceilings will no longer apply, without it being necessary to put the matter to the vote again by the Extraordinary Shareholders’ 

Meeting, if any individual or legal entity, acting alone or jointly with one or other individuals or legal entities, acquires or increases its stake to 

at least two-thirds of the Company’s capital through a public tender offer for all the Company’s shares. The Board of Directors takes note of 

this nullity and undertakes the formalities necessary to amend the Articles of Association. The ceiling on voting rights was approved by the 

Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings of June 27, 1995.

In accordance with Article L. 225-96, Paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code, any amendment to the Articles of Association must be 

approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting, by a majority of at least two-thirds of the voting rights represented by shareholders in 

attendance or participating by proxy.

7.4.3 Allocation of income (Article 22 of the Articles  
of Association)
Net income for the year less any losses brought forward from prior years is appropriated in the following order:

• 5% to the legal reserve (this appropriation is no longer required once the legal reserve represents one-tenth of the capital, provided that 

further appropriations are made in the case of a capital increase);

• To discretionary reserves, if appropriate, and to retained earnings; and

• To the payment of the balance in the form of a dividend.

The Shareholders’ Meeting may decide to offer shareholders the opportunity to receive the dividend in cash or in the form of new shares. 

Dividends not claimed within five years from the date of payment are forfeited and paid to the government, in accordance with the law.

7.4.4 Holding of shares (Article 7 Paragraph 1 of the 
Articles of Association)
Shareholders may elect to hold their shares in registered or bearer form. To establish proof of ownership, the shares must be recorded in the 

shareholder’s account in accordance with the procedures and conditions defined by current legislation and regulations.

7.4.5 Disclosure thresholds (Article 7 Paragraph 2  
of the Articles of Association)
The Articles of Association stipulate that any individual or legal entity that owns or controls (as these terms are defined in Article L. 233-9 of 

the French Commercial Code) directly or indirectly, shares or voting rights representing at least 1% of the total number of shares or voting 

rights outstanding, or a multiple thereof, is required to disclose the total number of shares, voting rights and share equivalents held directly, 

indirectly or in concert to the Company by registered letter with return receipt requested, within five trading days of the disclosure threshold 

being crossed. In addition, effective November 1, 2009, the shareholder must notify the Company, in the disclosure letter, the number of 

existing shares it is entitled to acquire by virtue of agreements or financial instruments referred to in point b) of the third paragraph of Article 

L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code and of the number of existing shares covered by any agreement or financial instrument referred to 

in point c) of said paragraph. Shareholders are also required to notify the Company if the number of shares or voting rights held falls below 

one of the thresholds defined above. In the case of failure to comply with these disclosure obligations, the shares in excess of the disclosure 

threshold will be stripped of voting rights at the request of one or several shareholders owning at least 2.5% of the share capital, subject to 

compliance with the relevant provisions of the law. These provisions are from the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings of 

June 27, 1995, May 5, 2000, and April 23, 2009.

provision was adopted by the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings of June 30, 1988 and May 5, 2000.

7.4.7 Disposal of shares (Article 8 of the Articles

7.4.8 Publication of information of Article L. 22-10-11  
of the French Commercial Code
This section is part of the Board of Directors’ Corporate Governance Report.

Items that could have an impact in the event of a public tender offer include:

• Agreements calling for payments to the Corporate Officers (see section 4.2.3.1 of this Universal Registration Document) or to employees 

if they resign or are terminated without real cause or if their employment ends due to a public tender offer;

• Certain financing arrangements with conditional provisions of anticipated reimbursement or cancellation in the event of change of 

control. Under these provisions, the debt holders may request for repayment or cancellation if a shareholder or shareholders acting 

together hold more than 50% of the Company’s shares. As of December 31, 2022 back-up facilities with this type of condition amounted 

€2.9 billion, fully undrawn. It also  applied to the Bridge Facility and Term Loan set up  for a total amount of approximately €3.9 billion to 

secure the funding of the minority interest of AVEVA. Bonds include such a change of control event if the change of control triggers a 

down grading of the Company’s rating. As of December 31, 2022, €8.6 billion of bonds were subject to this type of conditions; and

• Statutory restrictions in the Articles of Association on the exercise of voting rights (see section 7.4.2 of this Universal Registration 

Document) relating to the non-application of the ceiling on voting rights when a public tender offer is successfully completed.

8.1  Explanatory comments & draft resolutions submitted to the Annual  
Shareholders’ Meeting

8.1.1 Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting

1st, 2nd, and 3rd resolutions: Approval of annual financial statements and setting the 
distribution

Explanatory statement

Under the 1st and 2nd resolutions, shareholders are invited to approve: 

• the statutory financial statements of Schneider Electric SE for the year 2022 which show a profit of €1,744,408,093.62; and

• the consolidated financial statements for the year 2022 which show a net income for the Group of €3,477 million.

The activity and the results for the 2022 fiscal year are presented in the 2022 Universal Registration Document as well as in the Notice 

of meeting available on the Company’s website.

Under the 3rd resolution, we recommend a distribution of €3.15 per share, representing a distribution rate of 44.5% of the Group’s net 

adjusted income and an estimated total distribution of €1,761,214,530.60(1) (based on the number of shares ranking for dividends at 

December 31, 2022). No dividend will be paid on treasury shares held by the Company on the payment date. This distribution will be 

paid out of the distributable earnings amounting to €2,069,815,278.53. The proposed dividend is an integral part of Schneider Electric’s 

policy to reward shareholders over the long term. It represents an increase of 9% versus last year.

The distribution will be paid according to the following schedule:

• Dividend ex-date: May 9, 2023

• Record date:   May 10, 2023

• Dividend payment date: May 11, 2023

For individual beneficiaries who are tax residents in France, the dividend is subject upon payment to a social security tax of 17.2% and, 

in principle, to a mandatory non-definitive levy of 12.8%. This tax is levied at source and is computed on the gross amount of the 

dividend.

For its taxation in 2024, this dividend will fully be eligible for the 40% tax rebate referred to in Article 158.3.2° of the French Tax Code 

where an express, global, and irrevocable election is made for taxation under the progressive scale of personal income tax. Where this 

option is not made, the dividend will be taxed at a final flat-rate income 12.8% and will not be eligible for this 40% rebate. In both cases, 

the levy of 12.8% borne at the time of the payment of the dividend is deducted from the individual income tax due.

Text of the first resolution

(Approval of statutory financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year)

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of 

Directors’ report and the statutory auditors’ report, approves the statutory financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year as presented, as well 

as the transactions reflected in these statements or summarized in these reports showing a net profit of €1,744,408,093.62.

In addition, pursuant to Article 223 quater of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts), the Shareholders’ Meeting approves the value 

of expenses and charges non-deductible from taxable result liable to corporate income tax and amounting to €7,042 as well as the 

theoretical tax borne as a result of these charges amounting to €1,819.

Text of the second resolution

(Approval of statutory financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year)

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of 

Directors’ report and the statutory auditors’ report, approves the statutory financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year as presented, as well 

as the transactions reflected in these statements or summarized in these reports.

Text of the third resolution

(Appropriation of profit for the financial year and setting the dividend)

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having noted that the 

Company’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 closed with a net profit of €1,744,408,093.62 and, considering the retained earnings 

amounted to €325,407,184.91, the distributable earnings amounted to €2,069,815,278.53, upon proposal of the Board of Directors, decides:

• the distribution to the shareholders of a dividend of €3.15 per share, i.e., €1,761,214,530.60(1) on the basis of the number of shares ranking 

for dividends at December 31, 2022 paid from the distributable earnings; and

• the allocation of the balance of the distributable earnings after distribution to the retained earnings.

The ex-dividend date will be May 9, 2023 and the dividend will be payable from May 11, 2023. If, at the time of payment of the dividend,  

the number of treasury shares held by the Company has changed compared to that held on December 31, 2022, the fraction of the dividend 

relating to this variation will either increase or reduce retained earnings.

(1) This amount is calculated based on the number of shares ranking for dividends at December 31, 2022 and could therefore change if this number varies between 

January 1, 2023 and the ex-dividend date.

For individual beneficiaries who are tax residents in France, the dividend is subject upon payment to a social security tax of 17.2% and, in 

principle, to a mandatory non-definitive levy of 12.8%. This tax is levied at source and is computed on the gross amount of the dividend.

For its taxation in 2024, this dividend will fully be eligible for the 40% tax rebate referred to in Article 158.3.2° of the French Tax Code where 

an express, global, and irrevocable election is made for taxation under the progressive scale of personal income tax. Where this option is 

not made, the dividend will be taxed at a final flat-rate income 12.8% and will not be eligible for this 40% rebate. In both cases, the levy of 

12.8% borne at the time of the payment of the dividend is deducted from the individual income tax due.

12th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th resolutions: Renewal of Mr. Léo Apotheker, 
Mr. Gregory Spierkel and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan, appointment of Mrs. Giulia Chierchia  
and Mr. Abhay Parasnis

Explanatory statement

As of March 28, 2023, the Board of Directors is composed of 14 members, including nine who are deemed independent within the 

meaning of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, two Directors representing the employees and one Director representing 

the employee shareholders.

Each year, the Board of Directors conducts a review to ensure that there is an appropriate balance in its composition and that of its 

committees. In particular, the Board seeks to ensure gender balance and broad diversity in terms of skills, experience, nationality, and 

age, as described in its diversity policy (see section 4.1.2.4 of Chapter 4 of the Universal Registration Document). The Board 

investigates and evaluates not only potential candidates, but also whether existing Directors should seek reappointment based on their 

individual performance assessment and contribution. The Board seeks above all to ensure that its composition is consistent with the 

strategic needs of the Company and reflects the values that are essential to its proper functioning: independence of mind, richness of 

perspective, competence, commitment, and complementarity of experience and people.

As part of the Board’s continuous review of its composition, the Board of Directors asked the Governance & Remunerations Committee 

to make a recommendation on the renewal of Mr. Léo Apotheker, Mr. Gregory Spierkel and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan, as well as search for 

complementary profiles in line with the skillset highlighted by its Board skills matrix and the challenges of the Company (see section 

4.1.2.4 of Chapter 4 of the Universal Registration Document describing the director recruitment process).

S H A R E H O L D E R  I N F O R M A T I O NChapter 8 – Annual Shareholders’ Meeting

In that respect, the Committee has analyzed Mr. Léo Apotheker’s, Mr. Gregory Spierkel’s and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan’s situation with regards to 

their relevance and performance, as well as their time commitment and availability to fulfill their duties as well as the value added by 

each of them to the work of the Board.

• Mr. Léo Apotheker holds only one other position in a listed company (Director of NICE-Systems Ltd), and his attendance rate at Board 

meetings in 2022 is 100%, while his attendance rate at meetings of the Committees in which he participates is 90%. The Committee 

recommended to the Board that Mr. Léo Apotheker continues to participate in the work of the Board, particularly in the areas of 

software and M&A, where his expertise as former Chief Executive Officer of SAP and Hewlett-Packard is essential, as well as his 

excellent knowledge of the Group and the balance of the composition of the Board of Directors in terms of seniority. However, in view 

of his age and his non-independence under the AFEP-MEDEF Code, considering he has been a member of the Board since 2008, 

the Committee has proposed limiting his term of office to two years.

• Mr. Gregory Spierkel holds two other mandates in listed companies (Director of MGM Resorts International and PACCAR Inc.), his 
attendance rate at the meetings of the Board and the committees in which he participates in 2022 is 100%. Mr. Gregory Spierkel 
brings to the Board the benefit of his experience as former Chief Executive Officer of Ingram Micro, Inc. and a solid profile in digital 
and technology matters, which leads the Board to propose to you the renewal of his mandate for a four-year term.

• Mr. Lip-Bu Tan holds three offices in listed companies in addition to his office at Schneider Electric: Chairman of Cadence Design 
Systems, Inc., from which he retired as Chief Executive Officer in 2021 and will retire as Chairman in 2023 as he announced he will not 

seek re-election to the Board at the 2023 Annual Meeting (https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000813672/cd2ef8b8-

abb5-4620-a08d-c5c49565fc6c.pdf), Chairman of the Board of Directors of Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. and Director of Intel 

Corporation. After the 2023 Cadence’s Annual Meeting planned on May 4, Mr. Lip-Bu Tan will therefore hold two offices in listed 
companies in addition to his office at Schneider Electric. In view of his commitments, the Governance & Remunerations Committee has 

carefully examined his situation. In particular, it has ascertained from him his willingness and commitment to devote sufficient and 

necessary time to the Board of Schneider Electric, as Mr. Lip-Bu Tan has always done in the past, as evidenced by his level of 
attendance at Board meetings in 2022 (100%) and at the meetings of the committees in which he participates (90%), as well as his 
physical participation in several meetings, including the Strategy Session in August 2022. His average attendance rate at Board and 
committee meetings over his term of office (2019 - 2022) was 94% and 97.5% respectively, reflecting his commitment and availability. 

The Committee also took into consideration the assessment of Mr. Lip-Bu Tan’s effective contribution to the work of the Board that was 

conducted among the Directors in October 2022 during the Board’s self-assessment, which concluded that

Mr. Lip-Bu Tan brings to the Board unique expertise in the areas of software and technology, particularly in the energy sector, venture 

capital, and in-depth knowledge of the Asian and US markets. For all of these reasons, the Board has determined that his continued 

service as a Director is in the best interests of the Company, its shareholders, and is consistent with the composition objectives 

identified by the Board, and therefore invites you to reappoint Mr. Lip Bu-Tan for a four-year term.

The Governance & Remunerations Committee also identified the skills that would be useful to diversify and strengthen the Board 

composition and hired an external recruitment firm (Heidrick & Struggles) to search for suitable candidates. Among these candidates, 

the Governance & Remunerations Committee preselected a short list and the members of the Committee interviewed them. Following 

these interviews, the Committee recommended two candidates to the Board of Directors, Mr. Abhay Parasnis and Mrs. Giulia 

Chierchia, who were appointed as Observers respectively on July 27, 2022 and February 15, 2023 with the aim to propose their 

appointment to the 2023 Shareholders’ Meeting.

Mr. Abhay Parasnis, a US citizen based in San Francisco and an entrepreneur, is Adobe’s former Chief Technology Officer and Chief 

Product Officer and serves on the Board of Directors at Dropbox. He will bring to the Board his remarkable technology and digital 

skills, especially his experience in shifting to the cloud and in SaaS transformation as well as his spirit of innovation and reinvention. He 

will qualify as an independent Director with regard to all the criteria set by Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance 

Code and, if appointed, will join the Digital Committee.

Mrs. Giulia Chierchia, an Italian and Belgian dual citizen based in the United Kingdom, is currently Executive Vice-President Strategy, 

Sustainability and Ventures of BP. She will bring to the Board her expertise in ESG and energy sector, in particular, her experience in 

energy transition strategy in large companies with a global approach including strategy, sustainability, capital allocation and ventures. 

She will qualify as an independent Director with regard to all the criteria set by Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance 

Code and, if appointed, will join the Investment Committee.

Acting upon recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors proposes to shareholders:

• in the 12th resolution, to renew the term of office of Mr. Léo Apotheker for a two-year (2) term;

• in the 13th resolution, to renew the term of office of Mr. Gregory Spierkel for a four-year (4) term;

• in the 14th resolution, to renew the term of office of Mr. Lip-Bu Tan for a four-year (4) term;

• in the 15th resolution, to appoint Mr. Abhay Parasnis as a Director for a four-year (4) term; and

• in the 16th resolution, to appoint Mrs. Giulia Chierchia as a Director for a four-year (4) term.

Should these resolutions be approved, the Board of Directors would consist of 16 members (including one Director representing the 

employee shareholders and two Directors representing the employees), with an independence rate of 85% and 46% of women 

(excluding the three Directors who are also employees) and 81% being of non-French origin or nationalities.

Mr. Léo Apotheker’s, Mr. Gregory Spierkel’s, Mr. Lip-Bu Tan’s, Mrs. Giulia Chierchia’s, and Mr. Abhay Parasnis’ biographies are 

provided in section 2.2.3 of the Notice of meeting and section 4.1.2.2 of Chapter 4 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.

17th resolution: Opinion on the Company Climate strategy

Explanatory statement

Under the 17th resolution, the Board wishes to consult the Shareholders’ Meeting on Schneider Electric’s Climate strategy as 

described in section 2.3 of Chapter 2 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document and summarized in section 3 of the Notice of 

meeting.

The sustainability strategy including Climate is overseen by the Board of Directors with the assistance of the Human Resources & CSR 

Committee. Schneider Electric was one of the first companies to address this topic at the Board level with the creation of the Human 

Resources & CSR Committee in 2014. Schneider Electric further addressed the topic by deciding that the annual variable 

compensation of both the Chief Executive Officer and of the more than 64,000 employees (who benefit from a variable compensation), 

includes ESG criteria, part of which relates to Climate. The long-term incentive plan is also correlated with ESG criteria (for more detail 

on compensation, please refer to section 4.2 of Chapter 4 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document).

Several other governance bodies are involved in this matter: the Executive Committee and its Function Committee, the Stakeholder 

Committee and the Sustainability department. At Group level, the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, who is part of the Executive 

Committee, helps determine and enforce the Group’s environmental goals and underlying transformations. Three Committees involving 

Group Executive Vice-Presidents and Senior Vice-Presidents are dedicated to oversee the implementation of the Group’s 

decarbonation roadmap, respectively focusing on the supply chain, low-carbon product design and the decarbonization of Schneider 

Electric’s operational emissions. 

Upon a joint recommendation from the Human Resources & CSR Committee and the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the 

Board decided to offer its shareholders an opportunity to express their views on Schneider Electric’s Climate strategy.

• Scientifically validated Climate roadmap

Schneider Electric, as an Impact Company, wants to be both a sustainability enabler, supporting partners and customers with its 

decarbonation and digital solutions and services, and a sustainability practitioner committed to becoming Net-Zero across its 

end-to-end value chain. Schneider Electric considers itself part of an end-to-end ecosystem and reviews its progress along three 

dimensions: first aligning the Group and its supply chain with a 1.5°C Climate trajectory; second helping customers to do the same 

through Schneider Electric’s offers; and third helping Schneider Electric communities accelerate Climate action. As a result, the 

Group’s Climate strategy addresses all of its stakeholders and shows there are ways for companies to “do good while doing well”. In 

line with the ambition to contribute to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C, Schneider Electric is committed to reach the targets 

described below as validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.

Concrete actions and investment plans to reach those targets are described in section 2.3 of Chapter 2 of the 2022 Universal 

Registration Document.

• Consultation process

Investors’ consultation on Schneider Electric’s Climate strategy is part of the continuous and strong shareholder engagement 

conducted each year. The goal is that shareholders express their views on our Climate transition plan to be able to take into 

consideration their feedback.

However, shareholders are not asked to take responsibility for Schneider Electric’s Climate strategy, which remains the exclusive 

responsibility of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Therefore, in order to comply with the respective specific powers of 

each of the corporate bodies, the nature of this resolution is purely consultative, and this vote will not be binding.

The Board invites shareholders to support this strategy, which will influence every aspect of the Group’s actions over the long-term. A 

widespread approval of Schneider Electric’s Climate strategy will comfort the Company in its leading and ambitious Corporate Social 

Responsibility (CSR) roadmap and is essential to bolster the Company’s efforts to further accelerate its decarbonization journey in a 

transparent way.

The Board will take into account the level of support received on this resolution and continue engaging with its shareholders. Should 

the level of dissent reach 50% or more, the Board will seek information on the reasons for which some investors may not have 

supported the proposed resolution to be able to propose a revised Climate strategy.

• Transparency

As the transparency of the implementation of the Climate strategy is decisive in maintaining a relationship of trust between the 

Company and the various stakeholders, all the actions carried out and the associated key indicators are detailed annually in the 

Extra-Financial Performance Statement (DPEF) audited by an independent third party and included in the Universal Registration 

Document. In addition, the key indicators are part of the Schneider Sustainability Impact, from which results are shared transparently 

quarterly in the financial and non-financial communication of the Company. The Company also details the risks and opportunities linked 

to Climate change as well as the associated governance, in accordance with all the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-

related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

• Next vote on the Climate strategy

The Board intends to repeat this consultation at the 2026 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in order to allow shareholders to express their 

views on the progress made on the implementation of the strategy and the strategy itself. It will correspond to the launch of the new 

cycle of the Schneider Sustainability Impact, the current plan ending in 2025.

Text of the seventeenth resolution

(Opinion on the Company Climate strategy)

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the 

Company’s Climate strategy as described in section 2.3 of Chapter 2 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document, issues a favorable 

opinion on this Climate strategy.

18th resolution: Share buybacks

Explanatory statement

As the pre-existing authorization comes to its term in November 2023, it is hereby proposed, in the 18th resolution submitted to the 

Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, to reconduct, for a new eighteen-month period starting after the present Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, 

the authorization given to the Board of Directors to purchase the Company’s shares as part of a share buyback program pursuant to 

the provisions of Article L. 22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code and European Regulation (EU) no. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014 on 

market abuse.

We remind you that on February 14, 2019 Schneider Electric initiated a new €1.5 billion to €2.0 billion share buyback program. These 

buybacks are part of a policy to neutralize the dilution resulting from capital increases reserved for employees or from Long- term 

Incentive Plans.

At the beginning of 2021, due to the economic uncertainty, and considering the on-going acquisitions, the share buyback program 

remained on-hold after its suspension due to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. The share buyback program restarted at the end of July 

2021. On May 5, 2022, the proposal to raise the cap on purchase price to €250 per share (from the previous €150 per share) was 

approved at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. Schneider Electric did not further progress the buyback in the second half-year 

primarily due to restrictions on account of the proposed transaction with the AVEVA minority shareholders that was in progress during 

the period. Schneider Electric remains committed to the completion of the existing share buyback program.

Since the beginning of the program in 2019, a total €796,969,443 of share buyback corresponding to 7,601,716 shares bought back by 

the Company had been completed including €219,470,200 of share buyback in 2022 corresponding to 1,659,933 shares bought back 

by the Company pursuant to the last authorizations.

All the 11,977,197 treasury shares held on December 31, 2022 (representing 2.10% of the share capital) are allocated to employees and 

Corporate Officers as a long-term compensation tool.

The authorization that you would give to the Board would allow to proceed to purchase shares for the purposes, amongst others, of:

• their allotment to employees or Corporate Officers as a long-term compensation tool;

• their delivery as a result of the exercise of rights attached to securities giving access to the Company’s capital;

• their cancellation;

• their delivery in connection with external growth operations; and

• their disposal in the course of a share management agreement.

Shares bought back may be canceled under the authorization adopted by this Annual Shareholders’ Meeting (27th resolution).

The number of shares thus purchased, and the number of shares held may not exceed 10% of the share capital at any time (for 

reference purposes, based on the issued capital on December 31, 2022: 57,109,292 shares). The maximum purchase price of the 

shares would be set at €250 and the total amount allocated to the share repurchase program would not exceed €14.3 billion. As for 

previous years, the resolution prevents that the authorization be used during a public offering on the Company’s shares.

Further information on the Company’s share buyback programs can be found in section 7.2.5 of Chapter 7 of the 2022 Universal  

Registration Document.

S H A R E H O L D E R  I N F O R M A T I O NChapter 8 – Annual Shareholders’ Meeting

Text of the eighteenth resolution

(Authorization granted to the Board of Directors to buy back Company shares)

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of 

Directors’ report, hereby authorizes the Board of Directors, pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code, 

Regulation (EU) no. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014 on market abuse and its delegated regulations and the French Financial Market Authority’s 

General rules, to buyback or arrange for the buyback of the Company’s shares for the purpose of:

• the allotment or transfer of shares to employees or Corporate Officers of the Company and/or of current or future related companies, for 

the purposes of implementing any stock option or Performance Share plan, or any other grant, allocation, or disposal to employees and 

Corporate Officers of the Company;

• the delivery of shares as a result of the exercise of rights attached to securities giving access to the Company’s capital by redemption, 

conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or by any other mean;

• the cancellation by way of share capital decrease of all or part of these repurchased shares;

• the delivery of shares (for exchange, payment or otherwise) in connection with external growth operations (up to a limit of 5% of the share 

capital);

• their provision for the purposes of a share management agreement entered into with an investment services provider in order notably to 

maintain a liquid market; or

• the implementation of any market practice which would be allowed by the French Financial Market Authority.

This authorization also allows the Company to trade in its shares for any other purposes authorized or that may be authorized by law or 

regulation. In such a case, the Company would inform its shareholders through a public release.

Shares acquired may also be canceled, subject to compliance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-204 and L. 225-205 of the French 

Commercial Code and in accordance with the 27th resolution of this Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

The number of shares that may be purchased shall be subject to following limits:

(i)  the number of shares that the Company may purchase during the term of the buyback program should not exceed 10% of the 

Company’s share capital at any time (i.e. for information purposes, 57,109,292 shares, on the basis of the share capital as of December 

31, 2022), it being specified that the number of shares acquired in view of their retention and their future delivery for the purpose of an 

external growth operation cannot exceed 5% of the Company’s share capital; and

(ii) the number of shares that the Company can hold at any time may not exceed 10% of the Company’s share capital.

The maximum share purchase price is set at €250 per share (excluding acquisition costs) without exceeding the maximum price set by 

applicable laws and regulations. The total amount allocated to the share repurchase program will not exceed €14.3 billion (excluding 

acquisition costs).

The purchase, exchange, disposal or transfer of shares can be decided by the Board of Directors on one or more occasions, at any time 

except during takeover bid involving the Company’s shares, and by any means, provided that laws and regulations in force are complied 

with, on or off the stock market, over the counter, in whole or in part in blocks of shares, by takeover bid in cash or in shares, by using 

options or derivatives, either directly or indirectly through the intermediation of an investment services provider, or in any other way.

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting grants authority to the Board of Directors, which may further delegate as permitted by law, to adjust the 

price set forth above in the event of transactions on the Company’s share capital, and in particular an increase in capital through the 

capitalization of reserves, the allocation of free shares, a stock split or reverse stock split, the distribution of reserves or any other assets, 

impairment of share capital or any other transaction involving share capital or shareholders’ equity, to take into account the impact of these 

transactions on the stock value.

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting gives full powers to the Board of Directors with powers to subdelegate under the conditions set out by 

law, to use this authorization, in particular to give any and all orders, enter into any and all agreements, allocate or reallocate the shares 

acquired to the objectives pursued under the applicable legal and regulatory conditions, set the terms and conditions under which the 

rights of holders of securities giving access to the share capital or other rights giving access to the share capital will be preserved, if 

applicable, in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions and, if applicable, contractual provisions providing for other cases of 

adjustment, prepare all documents and press releases, carry out any and all formalities and make all appropriate declarations to the 

authorities, and in general take all necessary measures.

This authorization supersedes, for the unused portion, the authorization given to the Board of Directors by the Shareholders’ Meeting of 

May 5, 2022 in its 14th resolution and is granted for an eighteen (18)-month period as from this Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

8.1.2 Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting

19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 24th resolutions: Delegations of authority to the Board  
of Directors to increase the share capital with or without shareholders’ preferential 
subscription rights

Explanatory statement

As it is the case every two years, you are requested to approve a set of resolutions, giving the Board of Directors authority to increase 

or reduce the share capital, immediately or in the future, with preferential subscription rights or without, through the issuance of shares 

and/or equity-linked securities, for a limited period.

These resolutions involve financial delegations that will give the Board of Directors the authority to select, at any moment and from 

among a broad range of securities providing access to the share capital, the transaction most suited to Schneider Electric’s needs and 

growth, based on market characteristics at the time.

Under the 19th resolution, you are requested to delegate to the Board of Directors the authority to issue, in France and abroad, with 

shareholders’ preferential subscription rights, ordinary shares and/or equity-linked securities. The maximum nominal amount of the 

capital increases that may be carried under this resolution shall not exceed €800 million in aggregate, i.e. 200 million shares 

representing 35.02% of the capital as of December 31, 2022. The capital increases that may be realized in accordance with the 20th, 

21st, 22nd, 23rd and 24th resolutions shall be counted against this aggregate ceiling.

For the 20th and 21st resolutions, you are requested to cancel the preferential subscription rights to shares. Indeed, depending on 

market conditions, the types of investors involved and the type of securities issued, it may be preferable, or even necessary, to cancel 

the preferential subscription rights in order to carry out a securities placement under optimal conditions, particularly when the speed of 

transactions is a prerequisite to success, or when the issuances are carried out on overseas financial markets. The cancellation of the 

preferential subscription rights can facilitate the Company’s access to capital due to more favorable issuance conditions. Capital 

increases without preferential subscription rights may take the form of a public offering (other than those referred to in Article L. 411-2-1° 

of the French Monetary Code in which case a priority period for shareholders can be established (20th resolution) or of an offering in 

accordance with Article L. 411-2-1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code (21st resolution). In compliance with the French 

Commercial Code (Code de commerce), the issue price of shares issued without preferential subscription rights will be at least equal to 

the lowest price provided for according to the regulatory provisions applicable on the date of issue (currently, the average market price 

of the shares in the three (3) trading days on the regulated market Euronext Paris preceding the setting of the price, reduced by a 

discount of 10%). Regarding the issuance of securities giving access, immediately or in the future, to the Company’s share capital, the 

issuance price of these securities will be so that the amount received by the Company, immediately or in the future, for each share to 

which such securities give the right, is at least equal to the minimum issuance price of the shares as defined above. The maximum 

nominal amount of the capital increases that may be carried under these resolutions shall not exceed €224 million, i.e. 56 million shares 

representing 9.81% of the capital as of December 31, 2022.

In the 22nd resolution, we are asking you to authorize the Board of Directors to increase the number of securities to be issued under 

the 19th, 20th and 21st resolutions in the event of an over-subscription (greenshoe). An additional capital increase could thus be carried 

out within the timeframe and limits provided for by the legislation applicable as of the date of issue (currently, within 30 days of the 

closing of the subscription period and up to 15% of the initial issuance).

The 23rd resolution concerns the issuance of share and/or securities giving immediate or deferred access to the Company’s capital 

with a view to remunerate contributions in kind granted to the Company. This resolution allows the Board of Directors to carry out 

external growth operations with a consideration in shares within a limit of €224 million, i.e. 56 million shares representing 9.81% of the 

capital as of December 31, 2022.

If granted, these delegations would be valid for 26 months. The Board of Directors may not use this delegation from the date of filing of 

a takeover bid for the shares of the Company by a third party and for the duration of the bid period.

Under the 24th resolution, we are asking you to authorize the Board of Directors to increase the share capital by incorporating 

premiums, reserves or profits. The rights of shareholders would not be affected by this transaction, which results in free shares 

allotment, increase in the nominal value of the existing shares, or a combination of both. This transaction does not change the 

Company’s shareholders’ equity.

access to existing equity securities or securities to be issued by, and/or to debt securities of companies in which the Company holds 

directly or indirectly, at the time of issue, more than half of the share capital, and/or (v) securities representing debt securities governed 

or not by Article L. 228-91 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, giving access or likely to give access to equity securities to be

a.  this amount would be increased by the nominal amount of the capital increase resulting from the issuance of shares to be carried 

out as the case may be, in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions, and, where applicable, relevant contractual provisions 

providing for other adjustments, in order to preserve the rights of holders of securities giving access to the share capital, and  

b.  the maximum aggregate nominal amount of capital increases that may be undertaken immediately or in the future on the basis of 

this resolution and the  20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 24th resolutions of this Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, is set at €800 million;

which they have the right to subscribe and, in any case, up to the number of shares requested,

c.  decides that, if the subscriptions as of right (à titre irréductible) and, as the case may be, on a prorata basis (à titre réductible), do 

not absorb the entirety of the share issuance, the Board of Directors may use, under the conditions set by law and in such order as 

it shall determine, either one of the options provided under Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code, listed below: (i) limit 

the capital increase to the amount of the subscriptions, provided that they reach at least three-quarters of the initially approved

public, on the French market or the international market, all or part of the issued and unsubscribed shares,

d.  decides that any issuance of share subscription warrants of the Company may be carried out either pursuant to a subscription 

offer under the conditions described above, or by granting free shares to owners of existing shares,

linked securities, their interest rate, maturity, their fixed or variable redemption price, with or without premium and the conditions for 

redemption,

d. decide how shares and/or securities are to be paid for,

e.  set, if necessary, the terms of the exercise of the rights attached to the shares or securities issued or to be issued and, in particular,

conditions for completing the issuance(s),

f.  set the terms and conditions under which the Company would have the right, as the case may be, to purchase or exchange, at any 

time or during fixed periods, securities issued or to be issued,

g. provide the ability to suspend the exercise of rights attached to such securities,

h.  establish, as required, the conditions for preserving the rights of holders of equity-linked securities with future rights to shares of

applicable, deduct from this amount the amounts required to bring the legal reserve to one-tenth of the new share capital after 

each capital increase, and

j.  generally, enter into any agreement, in particular to ensure the successful completion of the contemplated issuance(s), take all 

measures and carry out all formalities necessary for the financial servicing of the securities issued pursuant to this delegation as 

well as the exercise of rights attached thereto, to acknowledge the completion of each capital increase and modify the Articles of 

Association accordingly;

6.  decides that the Board of Directors may not use this delegation from the filing of a takeover bid by a third party and for the duration of 

the offer period.

This delegation (i) supersedes, for the portion not yet used, the previous delegation given to the Board of Directors by the General 

Shareholders’ Meeting of April 28, 2021 in its 16th resolution and (ii) is granted for a twenty-six (26)-month period as from this Shareholders’ 

Meeting.

or securities giving access to share capital of the Company without shareholders’ preferential 
subscription right through a public offering other than those referred to in Article L. 411-2-1° of the

25th and 26th resolutions: Capital increases reserved for employees

Explanatory statement

Schneider Electric is convinced of the importance of developing the Company’s employee shareholder base in order to align employee 

interests with those of shareholders and also stabilize the Company’s share capital. The Board of Directors wishes to continue making 

the Company’s share capital accessible to a large number of employees, in particular through employee share ownership plans 

(WESOP). As of December 31, 2022, employees held 3.8% of the capital either directly or through the corporate mutual funds (FCPE).

The Company carried out capital increases reserved for Group employees in 2022 (WESOP 2022). These transactions are presented 

in section 7.1.2.2 of Chapter 7 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.

As part its offer policy to Group employees on an annual basis, the Board decided that there will be a new employee share ownership 

plan implemented in 2023. As part of the 16th and the 17th resolutions of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of May 5, 2022, the Board of 

Directors, at its meeting of December 14, 2022, decided to renew the annual employee shareholder plan in 2023, within a limit of 3.7 

million shares (approximately 0.65% of the capital). This plan, which does not include a leveraged offer, is open to 47 countries 

representing more than 90% of the Group’s employees. The shares are offered with a discount of 15% on the share price to all 

subscribers and a maximum employer contribution of €1,400.

To allow for the implementation of a new global employee share ownership plan in 2024, you are requested to approve:

• the 25th resolution which will grant the Board of Directors the authority to carry out capital increases reserved for employees 

participating in a company savings plan within the limit of 2% of the Company’s capital, with the provision that the maximum 

discount at which the shares could be offered is set at 30% (it will be valid for a period of twenty-six (26) months; the authority in 

force as voted by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of May 5, 2022 in its 16th resolution shall cease to be effective as from August 1, 

2023(1));

• the 26th resolution which will grant the Board of Directors the authority to carry out capital increases reserved for employees and 

Corporate Officers of non-French Group companies or to entities acting on their behalf; this authorization will not exceed 1% of the 

capital and will be deducted from the ceiling of 2% of the capital set for the issuance of shares to employees who are member of a 

company savings plan (this authorization will be valid for a period of eighteen (18) months and may only be used on or after August 

1, 2023(2)).

(1)  The maximum amount of subscription applicable to the employee share ownership operations carried out before July 31, 2023 will be the ceiling applicable to 

the 16th resolution of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of May 5, 2022.

(2)  The maximum amount of subscription applicable to the employee share ownership operations carried out before July 31, 2023 will be the ceiling applicable to 

the 17th resolution of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of May 5, 2022.

In accordance with article R. 225-116 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we will issue a supplementary report, if 

necessary, when your board of directors has exercised these authorizations in case of the issue of marketable securities that are equity

8.2.3 Statutory auditors’ report on the issuance  
of shares or securities reserved for a category of 
beneficiaries
Shareholders’ meeting as of May 4, 2023 - resolution n°26

To the Shareholders of the company Schneider Electric SE,

In our capacity as Statutory auditors of your company and in compliance with articles L. 228-92 and L. 225-135 et seq. of the French 

Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we hereby report on the proposal to delegate to the Board of Directors the competence to decide 

on the issue of ordinary shares or securities giving access to the share capital of the company, with cancellation of preferential subscription 

right, an operation upon which you are called to vote.

This resolution is reserved to the following classes of beneficiaries: 

(i)  employees and officers of companies of Schneider Electric Group affiliated with the Company under the terms and conditions set forth 

in Article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code and Article L. 3344-1 of the French Labour Code (Code du travail) and the head 

office of which is located outside France;

(iii)  and/or any banking institution or affiliate or subsidiary of such institution acting at the Company’s request for purposes of implementing 

and giving effect to a shareholder incentive or investment or savings plan for the benefit of the persons described in (i) of this 

paragraph, to the extent that subscription of the person authorized in accordance with this resolution would make it possible for 

employees of subsidiaries located outside France to benefit from and take advantage of forms of shareholder incentive or investment or 

savings plans equivalent in terms of economic benefit to those from which the other employees of the Group benefit.

The maximum nominal amount of the increase in capital that may result from this issue is €24 million (i.e. 1,05% of the share capital on the 

date of this annual shareholders’ meeting), it being specified that this amount shall be deducted from the overall ceiling common to the 

twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth resolutions of €46 million (i.e. 2,01% of the share capital on the date of this annual shareholders’ meeting) set 

out in the twenty-fifth resolution of this annual shareholders’ meeting.

Your board of directors proposes that, on the basis of its report, it be authorized, with the right of sub-delegation, for a period of eighteen 

months, to decide on whether to proceed with an increase in capital and to cancel your preferential subscription rights to securities to be 

issued. If applicable, it shall determine the final conditions of this operation.

This delegation cancels, effective August 1, 2023, the authorization given by the annual shareholders’ meeting of May 5, 2022 in its 

seventeenth resolution for its amounts unused by the board of directors.

It is the responsibility of the board of directors to prepare a report in accordance with articles R. 225-113 et seq. of the French Commercial 

code (Code de commerce). Our role is to report on the fairness of the financial information taken from the accounts, on the proposed 

cancellation of preferential subscription rights, and on other information relating to the share issue provided in this report.

price of the equity securities to be issued.

Subject to a subsequent examination of the conditions for the issue that would be decided, we have no matters to report as to the methods 

used to determine the issue price of the equity securities to be issued provided in the board of director’s report.

As the final conditions for the issue have not yet been determined, we cannot report on these conditions and, consequently, on the 

proposed cancellation of preferential subscription rights.

In accordance with article R. 225-116 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we will issue a supplementary report, if

8.2.4 Statutory auditors’ report on the reduction  
of capital
Shareholders’ meeting as of May 4, 2023 - resolution n°27

To the Shareholders of the company Schneider Electric SE,

In our capacity as statutory auditors of your company and in compliance with article L. 22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code (Code de 

commerce) in the event of a capital reduction by cancellation of acquired shares, we have prepared this report in order to inform you of our 

opinion on the causes for and the terms and conditions of the proposed capital reduction.

Your board of directors proposes that you delegate to the board, for a period of twenty-four months, all powers to cancel, up to 10% of 

company capital on the date of the transaction, per twenty-four months period, the shares purchased under the implementation of an 

authorization of purchase by your company of its own shares under the provisions of the aforesaid article.

We have performed those procedures which we considered necessary to comply with the professional guidance issued by the French 

national auditing body (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) for this type of engagement. These procedures consisted in 

examining whether the causes for and the terms and conditions of the proposed capital reduction, which is not likely to adversely affect the 

equality of shareholders, are in order.

We have no comment to make on the causes for and the terms and conditions of the proposed capital reduction.
