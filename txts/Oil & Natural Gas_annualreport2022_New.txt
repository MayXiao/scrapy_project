creation. ONGC is focusing on creating a diversified energy play in the long run that will holistically address the changing energy scenario and 
contribute to the country’s Net Zero Agenda. The ONGC 2040 blueprint comprehensively details the strategic way forward for consolidating 
key upstream companies (national and worldwide), expansion into value-adding adjacencies in the oil and gas value chain, diversification 
into renewables, and exploration of new pathways through venture play. The success of this strategy will be determined by ONGC’s ability 
to incorporate a holistic approach, drawing on the inter-connectedness of the capitals to address complex realities and tap opportunities 
to achieve future aspirations.

Creating Value through Stronger Stakeholder Relationships

Stakeholders are defined as entities or individuals that can 
reasonably be expected to be significantly affected by the reporting 
organization’s activities, products, or services; or whose actions 
can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of the organization 
to implement its strategies or achieve its objectives.

ONGC believes that strengthening stakeholder participation is 
imperative for seamless operations and fostering collaborations 
and exchange of ideas across the ecosystem to bolster business 
growth and operational efficiencies. Engaging with the stakeholders 
helps the Company identify and monitor their expectations and 
develop pragmatic solutions to meet those needs. This exercise 
not only assists ONGC in aligning corporate objectives with future 
targets but also helps implement result-driven measures in the key 
areas.

ONGC has always prioritised regular stakeholder interactions that 
build healthy and long-lasting partnerships, foster mutual trust and 

generate value. To ensure that all relevant stakeholders are included 
in decision-making, the Company has a structured process for 
identifying internal and external stakeholders who impact or are 
impacted by the organisation’s operations in the short, medium 
and long-term, either directly or indirectly.

The Company uses several mechanisms to maintain regular 
communication with stakeholder groups and strengthen the 
integration of sustainability into its business practices. These 
include customer grievance mechanisms, customer and employee 
feedback surveys, Annual General Meeting (AGM), investor 
meetings, marketing meets, vendor meets, and ESG engagements.

Material Matters 

ONGC recognises the importance of conducting materiality 
assessments for identifying key areas that require its focus and 
response. Materiality assessments play a fundamental role in 
determining the ESG performance of the Company. ONGC 
conducted an in-depth materiality assessment to identify and 
update material issues that can potentially impact the Company 
and its stakeholders. 

The materiality assessment exercise was carried out by identifying 
key stakeholders who directly or indirectly influence or are influenced 
by the Company’s business operations. These stakeholders were 
identified based on the following criteria:

Human Rights and Labour Relations

ONGC is committed to human rights protection and has a robust 
policy in place to minimise associated consequences across the 
organisation. It recognises Freedom of Association and Collective 
Bargaining. Details of Associations or Unions recognised by the 
company are listed in Essential Indicator of Principle 3 of Business 
Responsibility & Sustainability Report. 

The Company’s strong corporate governance mechanism ensures 
fairness, accountability, responsibility, and transparency. There are 
well-established practices in place, such as an Online Grievance 
Management System and Whistle Blower Policy/Vigil Mechanism. 
Strict adherence to laws is mandated, including labour rights, 

health and safety, zero discrimination, freedom of association and 
collective bargaining, human rights, contract management, and 
POSH. While discharging its functions, each department is guided 
by the Book of Delegated Powers, manuals, policy and guidelines, 
which are periodically reviewed and updated. The conduct of 
employees is regulated by the Employees Conduct, Discipline 
and Appeal Rules and Standing Orders. In addition, ONGC has an 
independent Chief Vigilance Officer reporting to the Government 
of India’s Chief Vigilance Commission. Robust monitoring systems 
ensure compliance with all labour regulations. 

ONGC believes that all members of the ONGC Group, including 
labour, contractors, manufacturers, and suppliers, should be 
treated equally. To comply with all legal wage obligations, the 
Company ensures fair compensation, which is at least the minimum 
wage as mandated by regulations or the applicable prevailing 
salary, whichever is higher. ONGC also ensures compliance with 
the Payment of Wages Act, 1936; Minimum Wages Act, 1948; Equal 
Remuneration Act, 1976; Industrial Dispute Act, 1947; ESI Act, 
1948; Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Act, 1952,

Employee Grievance and Employee Satisfaction

A structured four-tier Grievance Management System is in place 
to address employee grievances. Grievance channels include 
the Reporting Authority of the employee, Sectional In-charge, Key 
Executive, and the Appeals Committee.  The Appeals Committee 
has external professionals as members and is empowered to 
suggest measures to prevent similar grievances in the future. The 
Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) takes the final decision 
regarding the grievances of employees with inputs from the Director 
(HR) if required.

The mechanism allows employees to escalate their grievances to 
the level of the Director (HR) of the Company and, in some cases, 
even to the Executive Committee for justifiable redressal of issues 
& concerns. Collectives and Officers associations are engaged at 
every stage to discuss and negotiate policy issues and address 
concerns. An Executive Director level leader oversees Employee 
Relations and Industrial Relations (ER&IR) and is responsible for 
maintaining a cordial, motivated and spirited work atmosphere.  
All the employees have access to the CMD and Directors 
through e-mails. ONGC has introduced an e-Grievance handling 
mechanism for quick redressal of grievances, which can be 
accessed on https://grievance.ongc.co.in/.

by leveraging in-house competencies while creating value for 
all stakeholders. The MoU offers a framework for expanding 
cooperation in energy-related areas.

• ONGC has signed an MoU with Solar Energy Corporation of India 
(SECI) on 2nd December 2021 in New Delhi to develop renewable 
energy-based power for achieving its green energy objectives.

• GHRTC and ONGC, Panvel signed an agreement with the Indian 
Oil Corporation’s (IOC) R&D Centre in Faridabad for the synthesis 
and evaluation of suitably functionalised nanomaterials for their use 
as Kinetic Inhibitors (KHI) for Gas Hydrates. 

• OEC is in the process of developing a Helium pilot plant using 
hybrid Pressure Swing Adsorption and cryogenic technology to 
produce helium grade with 99.9% purity. This is a step towards 
making the country self-reliant in Helium.

• Geothermal for Carbon Neutral Ladakh is the first step to putting 
India on the Geothermal World Map. The MoU for the same was 
signed with the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, 
Leh, on 6 February 2021. Phase-I of the initiative will involve 
exploratory cum production drilling of wells up to 1000 m depth and 
the setting up of a Pilot Plant of up to 1 MW power capacity. The 
drilling operation is expected to begin by August 2022.

Hydrogen Generation at Closed Loop experimental facilities 

• A bioprocess has been developed in association with TERI 
to enhance the production of Coal Bed Methane which was 
successfully tested in the poor and marginally producing CBM 
wells of ONGC’s Bokaro oil field. 

Safety Enhancement for the Foundation of a Process Platform

• IEOT applied the new and advanced method for the computation 
of axial capacity of pile foundation. The technique was developed 
based on the results of an international Joint Industry Project 
(JIP) using CPT (i.e., an in-situ soil test carried out offshore using 
an instrumented cone). The method has been used for the life 
extension of offshore process platform ICG in the Mumbai High 
field. This has helped establish the required level of safety for the 
foundation of the process platform and avoid costly alternatives like 
strengthening the foundation by installing additional piles.

• ONGC Energy Centre (OEC) has established the Hydrogen 
Generation at Closed Loop experimental facilities at the Indian 
Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT-D). The next priority is to scale 
up to pilot scale demonstrations in 2025. Value addition includes 
the generation of Hydrogen indigenously by the convergence of 
R&D activities in the area of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, Hydrogen 
storage, Membranes, Molten salts/CSP (Concentrated Solar 
Power), Materials of Construction (MOC), alternate electrodes, 
energy storage back up, oil field water purification, safety systems 
and process intensification to achieve the goals of the National 
Hydrogen Mission during and beyond energy transitions. 

• A novel combination of bimetallic catalysts for the CO2 
methanation process has been developed in collaboration with 
the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT) Mumbai, which showed 
better CO2 conversion (CH4 yield 64-84%) and stability (up to 4000 
hrs of reaction time).

Intellectual Property for strong market positioning

The Company’s robust internal Intellectual Property (IP) governance 
framework ensures that its patents align with the organisation’s

Responsible Water Management

‘Water is one of the most precious resources available on earth’.

At ONGC, efficient water management is imperative to ensure 
business continuity as water is a key resource for all its operational 
activities. The Company treats wastewater generated from plants 
and refineries and focuses on effectively utilising produced water 
for operational purposes. The Company mainly relies groundwater, 
surface water and municipal water to meet its needs. 

ONGC’s operations, including crude oil extraction, natural gas 
exploration and production activities, are highly water intensive. 
The Company has significantly invested in sustainable water 
management practices over the last decade to effectively recycle 
and reuse treated water. Its practices include analysing site-wise 
risks and impacts related to water security and managing the 
quality of water returned to the environment.

New technology adoption for generation of potable water in offshore at 
NBP-B well Platform of B&S Asset

Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG) that converts atmospheric 
water vapor into fresh and clean drinking water has been installed 
at NBP-B well platform. Unmanned platforms are not equipped with 
the utilities for longer stay. One of the main challenges is to arrange 
potable water at these unmanned well platforms, which has now 
been overcome by adopting this technology.

The installed AWG is of 1,000 LPD capacity having small footprint 
of 1. 5X1.2X2.6 Mts (L-W-H). It can operate efficiently between 15 - 
50°C temperatures with 25 – 99    percent relative humidity. When 
the atmospheric air is passed through the cooling chambers, water 
vapor is condensed and water droplets are formed. Produced 
water   is  drinking grade, free of pathogens, organic and chemical 
impurities which was validated by testing in laboratory.

This technology has been introduced for the first time in ONGC 
Offshore by installing at NBP-B Platform of B&S Asset and can have 
multiple applications in offshore. This has resulted in substantial 
savings in logistic cost. The new AWG would ensure availability 
of water even during monsoon and rough sea conditions, when 
potable water is to be transported from FPSO to well platforms.

The NBP (erstwhile D1) Field is situated around 200 km South-West 
of Mumbai in Deep Continental Shelf at a water depth of 85 – 90 m. 
NBP field consists of 5 Well Platforms viz. NBP-A, B, C, D & E, which 
are connected to FPSO. FPSO “Armada Sterling” has been taken 
on lease to process the well fluid of NBP field before evacuation of 
stabilized crude through tankers. FPSO is moored by internal turret 
system at 1.5 kms from NBP-B Platform.

The NBP is a unique field and first of its kind in entire ONGC where 
all the wells are completed with Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP). 
ESPs, having technologically intricate systems, require vigorous 
monitoring to ensure enhanced run-life. NBP Field is remotely 
located and hence in-field movements are restrictive due to which 
people have to stay at well platforms during trouble shooting of 
ESPs & other surface equipment.

Procurement was done through the Government e-procurement 
Management (GeM) portal. Installed AWG is Made in India making 
another step towards Aatmanirbhar  Bharat and Make in India 
initiatives.

Wastewater Management 

ONGC is investing in wastewater management for an effective 
treatment system to reduce its footprint and dependency on 
fresh water for operations. For the Company, it is a challenge that 
offers great scope for recycling and reuse. Due to the complex 
characteristics of wastewater, its management is challenging. 
It requires skilled operations to produce quality treated water for 
reuse in compliance with prescribed regulations. The Company 
always aims to go beyond the prescribed compliance limits of 
wastewater treatment by the Central and State Pollution Control 
Board ( CPCB & SPCB).

         ACHIEVING glorious heights

Board’s Report 
Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of your Company, it is my 
pleasure to present the 29th Annual Report of Oil And Natural 
Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC/ the Company) and its Audited 
Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 (FY’22), 
together with the Auditors’ Report and Comments on the Financial 
Statements by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.

As the global economy recovers from the stress of COVID-19 
pandemic, supply chain disruptions, extreme weather events, 
energy supply crunch and geo political upheavels have caused 
turbulence in energy sector. With global demand rebounding and 
outpacing supply, energy prices have increased substantially from 
the last years level. Years  of inadequate financial returns coupled 
with low commodity prices and surge in net zero aspirations have 
depressed investments in fossil fuels. The whittled down spare 
capacity has contributed to the present demand supply mismatch 
and the same is not expected to moderate in 2022.

Your Company, on its part, has been maintaining the pace of 
capital spending and project execution, sustaining its production, 
optimizing  operating costs to improve the value proposition for all  
stakeholders while looking for cleaner ways of doing its business.

Your Company, along with its group companies, has registered yet 
another  year of robust performance and made substantial progress 
on most of the priority areas.

Despite the challenges faced by the Company during the second 
wave of  pandemic and the consequent logistic constraints,  your 
Company’s standalone production during the year was 40.453 
Million Metric Tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas (MMTOE) (against 
FY’21 production of 42.369 MMTOE ). 

• Crude oil production, including share of JV production, was 
21.707 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) during FY’22 against 22.533 
MMT during the previous year. 

• Natural gas production, including share of JV production, was at 
21.680 Billion Cubic Metres (BCM) against 22.816 BCM during 
FY’21. 

• Value Added Products (VAP) production during FY’22 was 3.089 
MMT against 3.120 MMT  during FY’21.

Backed by an intensive and continuous exploration programme, 
your Company declared four oil and gas discoveries (two on-land 
and two offshore) during FY’22. 

During FY’22, accretion of In-place volume and EUR (Estimated 
Ultimate Reserves) in 2P category from ONGC operated areas 
in India has been 90.50 MMTOE and 40.82 MMTOE respectively. 
Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR – 2P EUR) from domestic 
fields was 1.01 with respect to 2P reserves. Your Company has 
maintained Reserve Replacement Ratio (2P) of more than 1 for the 
16th consecutive year.

Your Company has four direct subsidiaries, namely ONGC Videsh 
Limited (OVL), Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited 
(MRPL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and 
Petronet MHB Limited (PMHBL). 

Your Company also has nine Associates/ Joint Ventures, namely 
ONGC Petro additions Limited (OPaL), ONGC Tripura Power

MMT during FY’21. The gas production of 4.231 BCM during the 
year was 6.6% less compared to FY’21 production of 4.529 BCM.. 

12. Other Exploration Initiatives/Activities

a) National Seismic Programme (NSP):

To accomplish its mandate of 2D seismic data Acquisition, 
Processing & Interpretation (API) in un-appraised areas of Indian 
sedimentary basins grouped in 11 on-land sectors, your Company 
completed data acquisition of 41,714.37 LKM and data processing 
and interpretation of 41,745.7 LKM. The program has been 
completed and all API deliverables have been submitted to NDR, 
DGH. This data in turn would contribute in augmenting domestic 
production of oil and gas.

b) Basement Exploration:

As a part of concerted excploration efforts for Basement Play, a 
total of 12 wells were drilled , which included  3 wells (BH-80, SD-
15 & HR-1) in Mumbai Offshore, 2 wells (Charali-53 & Borhola-67) 
in Assam Shelf and 7 wells (Padra-150, Padra-152, Padra-155, 
Padra-158, Padra-161, Padra-163 and CBONH182A-1) in WON 
Basin. 

Out of these, five wells (Padra-152, Padra-158, Padra-161, BH-
80, HR-1) proved oil bearing and one well (SD-15) proved gas 
bearing.  In addition, six wells drilled during FY’21 (2 in WON Basin, 
4 in Mumbai Offshore) were tested during the year. Out of these, 
well Padra-146 (WON Basin) proved to be oil bearing in Basement 
section (Trap) and HC indications were observed in wells BH-81 & 
BH-82 (Mumbai Offshore) in Basement section.

HP-HT Exploration:

High pressure- High Temperature (HP-HT) and Tight reservoirs have 
been an exploration and development challenge for your Company. 
Your Company is striving hard in the field of HP-HT due to bore hole 
complications, fluid design, high-cost drilling technology including 
HP-HT cementing, well construction and other reservoir engineering 
issues. In ONGC operated areas, HP-HT regime is encountered in 
areas like Periyakudi, Bhuvanagiri in Cauvery Onland, Kottalanka, 
Nagyalanka, Bantumilli South and Malleswaram in KG Onland.  
Yanam in KG Shallow offshore, G-4-6, D-33 and GS-OSN-2004/1 
in Western Offshore were also classified as HP-HT reservoirs. 
Additionally, high pressure regime is often encountered in certain 
areas of Assam Arakan Fold Belt.

During recent campaign of high-tonnage hydro-fracturing (HF) 
in Malleswaram field, significant gain in oil production could be 
achieved.

13. Exploration and Production from Unconventional Sources

a) Coal Bed Methane (CBM):

Of the 9 original blocks that the Company was awarded as part 
of the CBM bidding rounds including nomination, your Company 
relinquished 5 blocks on the basis of data generated from 
exploratory efforts and has been operating 4 blocks (Jharia, Bokaro 
and North Karanpura in Jharkhand and Raniganj in West Bengal) 
where exploration activities have been completed. Developmental 
activities are at an advanced stage in three of these blocks viz. 
Bokaro, Jharia and North Karanpura.

b) Gas Hydrate Exploration Program

Your Company has been an active contributor on gas hydrates 
exploratory research under National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP) 
of Govt. of India. ONGC, as a Consortium Member of National 
Gas Hydrate Program of GoI has played a significant role in G&G 
studies for the identification of sites for NGHP-01 and NGHP R&D 
Expedition-02. Based on the results of NGHP-02 and subsequent 
studies and review by international experts,  KG-DWN-98/5  has 
been found suitable for  pilot production test. Various studies like 
sand control measures, well design, reservoir and production 
simulation modelling  as prerequisite for the pilot production have 
been completed. Your Company would undertake pilot production 
test in deep waters for gas hydrate. 

ONGC had signed an MoU with initial validity of five years on 
02.03.2021 with Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology 
(Skoltech), Moscow for Collaborative Studies to establish 
cooperation in the Gas Hydrate Research & Technology applicable 
to Indian Basins. ONGC has also signed an MOU with IOC R&D for 
development of nanoparticles as kinetic inhibitors in the dissociation 
of gas from gas hydrates under reservoir conditions.

14. Drilling Services

There has been continuous induction of new technologies in Drilling 
Services. Some of these new technologies, which are now being 
used extensively are:

a) Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD): MPD, used to precisely 
control the annular pressure profile throughout the wellbore, was 
inducted first time in ONGC at Tripura Asset for mitigation of 
down-hole complications. Two more wells ROAH_Sub, ADAT were 
successfully completed with this technology during FY’22.

b) Casing While Drilling:  In view of 30” conductor piling issues and 
further drilling for 20” casing, implemented Casing While Drilling 
(CWD) in five wells of Mumbai.

c) Auto-Driller: Automatic bit feeding system (eWildcat TM 2.0) 
implementated in 5 drilling rigs (Type-II & above rigs of ONGC) to 
enhance the drilling efficiency.

d) Introduction of Micro Bubble technology: Eco-friendly Micro 
Bubble technology developed by IDT is used to drill reservoirs 
with low pressure (4.5-6.0 ppg). Same has been used in wells of 
Assam, Cambay and Mumbai.Since this technology is indigenous 
and found to be cost effective, it is planned to be used extensively 
in sub-hydrostatic reservoirs. 

e) Introduction of System LCM: For controlling of mud losses in 
Reservoir and Non-reservoir sections, “System LCM” Drillezy and 
Fracseal were introduced on pilot scale to drill loss prone zone. 
Based on the success, Fracseal is being used to drill non reservoir 
loss prone zone as a preventive measure. Barablend LCM pill was 
used to successfully remediate Activity/Lost circulation problem 
and enabled testing of the basement formation Western Offshore 
Basin.

Your Company is also implementing technologies like Liner While 
Drilling, Axial Oscillation Tool  for friction reduction & improved axial 
force transfer in drill string, SoftSpeed-II and E-Drilling predictive 
analysis.

Project Title  Ravindra Joshi Medical Foundation for ONGC Bandra Promenade at Bandra Reclamation, Mumbai 
Project Brief On 5 March 2019, an agreement was signed between Ravindra Joshi Medical Foundation, a charitable 

organisation engaged in health-related social causes, and ONGC for the development of project activities 
that contribute towards the promotion of yoga, edutainment activities, and environmental sustainability. The 
infrastructure that the agreement decided to establish, included the following: 

i. ONGC Tribute Garden with Infotainment Theme (4066 sqm - 1 acre) ii. Traffic Island Development (extension 
of existing Yoga Garden) (2700 sqm - 0.67 acre) iii. Linear Garden for jogging and walking (18348 sqm - 4.53 
acre) iv. Children Garden with play equipments (3800 sqm - 0.94 acre) v. Skating Rink for children (2248 sqm 
- 0.56 acre) vi. Wastewater Treatment Plant (10 Lakh kL/day) vii. Solar Power Plant (210 kWp) viii. Public Toilet 
(180 sqm) ix. Gates & Fencing (360 m x 1.8 m)

Project Duration Project to be completed within 1 year from the date of signing the agreement. Promenade to be maintained by Ravindra 
Joshi Medical Foundation for two years with OPEX support from ONGC (period of two years starting two months after 
development of Promenade) 

Commencement of  facility 30 March 2018
Project Cost ` 1365.66 Lakhs 

(` 1219.38 Lakhs CAPEX + ` 146.28 Lakhs OPEX)
Impact Assessment Agency  UN Global Compact Network India  
Methodology  (i) Structured interviews (ii) Exploratory and semi-structured interviews (iii) Quantitative impact modeling 
Findings  For every ` 1 spent by ONGC on this project, the Social Return on Investment was ` 7.4. 

Observations: 

• Overall, the consensus amongst the users of the Bandra Promenade was that the project has significantly 
contributed to the neighbourhood by offering a new play area for children, greenery and a sea-facing view 
for relaxation with family and friends, a space for practicing yoga as well as large tracks for walking and 
jogging. Many have gradually increased the frequency of their visits to the Promenade. 

• The Promenade is designed to address environmental concerns such as soil erosion, soil stabilization of 
highway embankment, rainwater harvesting etc. 

The integration of the solar panels and introduction of the sewage treatment plant are significant features 
of the promenade. 

With the objective of creating a carbon-free garden, plants with the capacity to absorb salt content and 
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the daytime were selected.

• The study found that the Bandra Promenade poses the highest challenge among all CSR projects 
assessed for this report with respect to routine maintenance and for the operation and maintenance of the 
solar energy and sewage treatment units. 

In less than two years of its functioning, visitors to the area have identified malfunctioning streetlights, the 
use of water tankers for landscaping, and the poor/broken condition of the children’s park among their 
core issues. 

They have also highlighted the lack of adequate drinking water and signages to guide visitors to the 
Promenade’s different sections. 

• There is a lack of clarity about the long-term role of MSRDC as there is no mention of their expected role in 
sustaining the project as per the contractual agreement.

Recommendations:

• Doubling the number of security personnel as only 1 security guard could monitor a stretch of about 200 
meters of the Promenade at any given time 

• Hiring a resource person to carry out more than basic civil work

• Development of a sustenance plan for the Bandra Promenade, including an entrance fee and space rentals 
for events

• Establishment of an adequate and better quality toilet block 

• Ensuring complete functionality of the solar energy equipment and sewage treatment plant to gradually 
reduce the use of water tankers for the garden area

         ACHIEVING glorious heights

Project Title  Seva Bharti Purbanchal for construction of Yoga Nilayam at Abhoypur, North Guwahati, Assam 
Project Brief On 22 January 2016, an agreement was signed between Seva Bharti Purvanchal, a voluntary organization 

founded in 1998 for working in  North Assam (Bhramaputra Valley), Meghalaya and Nagaland in Northeast 
India, and ONGC. The agreement was for the construction of a 3 storied building of 1765 square meters for 
the Yoga Nilayam –Yoga and Naturopathy Institute, which Seva Bharti Purvanchal had founded in a temporary 
structure in 2011. The agreement of 5 years duration, was for assistance to build the following structures:

I. Ground floor - 563.13 Sqm. 

II. First floor - 600.84 Sqm.

III. Second floor - 600.84 Sqm.
Project Duration 5 years 
Commencement of facility 28 January 2019
Project Cost ` 259.0 Lakhs 
Impact Assessment Agency  UN Global Compact Network India  
Methodology  (i) Structured interviews (ii) Exploratory and semi-structured interviews (iii) Quantitative impact modeling 
Findings  For every ` 1 spent by ONGC on this project, the Social Return on Investment was ` 0.2. 

Observations:  

• The residential yoga education, training and treatment centre was inaugurated on 28 January 2019. The 
centre serves patients through both inpatient and outpatient departments. It imparts yoga training through 
diploma and certificate courses and conducts yoga sessions. In addition, workshops, seminars, and 
training courses are organised for the community. 

• Overall, the patients of the Yoga Nilayam are satisfied with the infrastructure and found the treatment 
affordable. But 66% of the respondents of the survey on the patients felt a need for more experienced 
doctors and staff as well as improvements in naturopathic treatments and food.

• 100% of the respondents from the current trainees of the yoga PG diploma course appreciated the 
teachers and training and rated the usefulness of training 10 out of 10. But only 67% of the respondents 
of the trainees wanted to teach yoga after completion. Moreover, 100% of the respondents were unaware 
of the funder ONGC to establish the institute and 62% of the respondents were unaware of ONGC as an 
organization.

• Overall, 100% of the alumni of the training programs surveyed claimed they have faith in the institute and 
they appreciate the teachers training. However, only 67% of alumni rated 10 out of 10 to their overall yoga 
training experience. Alumni have taught yoga to 3600+ people since the completion of their course. The 
average growth in monthly income after the course for the alumni surveyed was ` 12,500 with average 
monthly incomes close to ` 16,500, where 67% of them have teaching yoga as their primary source of 
income. The employers of the trainers as well favored the training at Yoga Nilayam.

• The staff at Yoga Nilayam have strong faith in the values of the institutions and believe in serving the 
community  

Recommendations:

There is a need for greater branding and communication of ONGC’s contribution to the centre. The trainees 
and patients are not well aware of ONGC’s contribution to this project.  

Awareness on the Yoga Nilayam centre is also necessary among the local regions to increase the awareness 
towards the ayurvedic treatment provided in one of its kind naturopathy centres. 

Further enhancement in the quality of healthcare providers and treatments is required. This may increase the 
number of IPD-OPD patients and subsequently create a significant impact on the wellbeing of the community 
by the project.

Project Title  Skill Development Institute in association with ONGC and other oil PSUs established at the Jagannath Cultural Academy 
and Research Centre, in Ahmedabad 

Project Brief Skill Development Institute, Ahmedabad, supported by ONGC in association with other oil PSUs is established 
at the Jagannath Cultural Academy and Research Centre, Adalaj, Ahmedabad. SDI Ahmedabad in association 
with the ADS Foundation implements the project and imparts training in 10 job roles in sectors such as 
capital goods, renewable energy, apparel, hydrocarbon, healthcare, retail, power, electronics, construction & 
plumbing and telecom. 

Project Duration Information not available 
Commencement of  facility 23 September 2017
Project Cost `86.58 lakh 
Impact Assessment Agency  UN Global Compact Network India  
Methodology  (i) Structured interviews (ii) Exploratory and semi-structured interviews (iii) Quantitative impact modeling 
Findings  For every ` 1 spent by ONGC on this project, the Social Return on Investment is ` 20.5. 

Observations:

Although many of the trainees joined after the completion of vocational training courses at the Industrial 
Training Institutes, they found that the courses they took at SDI were better at helping them execute the work 
they learnt during their earlier training at the ITIs.

• The institute caters to students from rural areas, with no or less formal basic education. Hostel facilities are 
provided with bus pick up and drop facilities for the students.

• In 2017-2018, trainees from disadvantaged backgrounds constituted 64% of the total trainees, 78% in 
2018-2019, 76% in 2019-2020 2020 and 72% in 2020-2021. Cumulatively, since 2017 SDI Ahmedabad has 
trained 812 candidates belonging to backward communities.

• Practical training: Presently, only one batch is functioning and the students are about to pass, placement 
sessions are going on. The institute is expanding to the nearby acquired land where it plans to start a Centre 
for Excellence, training courses for robotics welding, EV battery fabrication and a healthcare laboratory. The 
students are trained on live projects in-house as well.

• Soft skills: A strict tobacco-free campus is offered to students with discipline and students follow a 
timetable for their classes and breaks. All the students have responsibilities ranging from health & safety 
while working/training, food waste, fire management, restricting tobacco usage, water management, event 
management. The students are supported by the management in all their stages of education – grooming, 
soft skills, personal development, communication skills, technical skills, behaviour management.

• Placements: SDI Ahmedabad offers placements to its trainees.

While the placement rates have been decreasing over the years - 95% in FY 18, 65% in FY 19, 78.6% in FY 
20, 72.5% in FY 21, the salary range has widened.

The institute has in-house market research and placement teams that help in inviting industries over and 
estimating what kind of demand is expected in the near future, on which the students can be trained.

72.5% of students were placed through SDI in their respective areas of training.

10% of trainees left the trade they had trained on at SDI, due to insufficient minimum wages offered by 
placement agencies (approximately ` 9,000 per month). Those practicing independently could easily earn 
around ` 15,000 per month.

Employers of the alumni found SDI’s graduates to be well-trained, diligent, and hard working. Some of the 
employers also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with SDI for hiring trainees from specific areas 
such as the Sahaj Solar Private Limited.

• Monitoring: The institute keeps track of the competition with the other skilling institutes under the various 
oil PSUs and takes pride in the method and discipline that the institute follows. There are constant visits by 
industry professionals and government officials being in the capital city of the state.

Recommendations:

• Greater monitoring needed. This was the only CSR project amongst the 8 CSR projects assessed where 
impact and spend data was not readily available.

Project Title  Manav Seva Pratisthan for construction of school building, hostel and multipurpose hall at Karmadanga, Birbhum 
District, West Bengal

Project Brief On 19 September 2017, Manav Seva Pratishtan signed an agreement with ONGC for the construction of 
a two-storied school building, a two-storied hostel, and a multi-purpose hall at Karmadanga - a village in 
Birbhum District, West Bengal. The agreement was signed for a duration of one year for the construction of 
the following structures: 

• School building with two floors of 361 Sqm for each floor

• Hostel building with two floors of 175.27 Sqm for each floor, and

•  Multi-purpose hall with 316.94 Sqm.
Project Duration Project to be completed within one year of signing the agreement 
Commencement of facility Inaugurated on Sept 2019 
Project Cost ` 135.13 Lakh 
Impact Assessment Agency  UN Global Compact Network India  
Methodology  (i) Structured interviews (ii) Exploratory and semi-structured interviews (iii) Quantitative impact modeling 
Findings  For each ` 1 spent by ONGC on this project, the Social Return on Investment was ` 0.3. 

Observations:

Although the project was completed, the school could not start functioning fully because of COVID-19. The 
project also does not have the official permit to function as a school.

• The building is currently used as a tutorial centre for tribal children who attend nearby government run 
schools. The children come to the tutorial centre after 2 pm everyday of the week and get free tuition in 
Mathematics, Bengali, English and Alchiki - the tribal language. The children spend about 4 hours at the 
tutorial centre. There are five tutors who teach from 3 pm to 7 pm. They remain available for varied student 
needs such as counselling, nutrition, and extracurricular activities.

• The Manav Seva Pratisthan has positively impacted and contributed to the lives of the children. The tutorial 
centre provides tuition classes to the students at zero cost in Math, Bengali, English, and Alchiki - the tribal 
language.

• The students that were interviewed as part of the field visit said that they enjoyed their lessons and rapport 
with the teachers. All the students also responded favourably to the school infrastructure. All students felt 
that Manav Seva Pratishtan has positively contributed to their lives. There were no complaints received 
from the students.

• The management believed that the institution was not just a tutorial centre but a child care centre where 
tribal children spent time after school hours. The school also organised health camps for the tribe’s men, 
women, and children roughly every quarter. In addition, the school distributed seeds of nutritious fruit and 
vegetable bearing plants to all students, under a health programme. The objective of this initiative is to 
encourage tribal people to create kitchen gardens which would become a source of nutrition, income, 
when the produce is sold in local markets. The increase in income from the produce would reduce the 
dependence on working as cheap labour in stone quarries.

• All the 4 parents of the students surveyed expressed their satisfaction over marked improvements in 
learning outcomes. They also felt hopeful of their children performing well in Class X board exams. 50% of 
the parents interviewed felt that the tuition centre was positively changing the lives of their children.

Recommendations:

• The fact that the intended school does not yet have the permit to run a school indicates lack of project 
design and planning. However, we recommend no action needed by ONGC as the centre in its current role 
of a tuition centre is creating a high social impact.

• Provision of advice or funding for the sustenance of the institution. The institution is lacking in resources. 
Teachers often use their own money to buy blackboard, chalk. Students lack adequate notebooks and 
books. Offer advice/ handholding or invest in actions that ensure the sustenance of the institution.

Project Title  Sivananda Centenary Boys’ High School, Bhubaneswar, Odisha for the construction of an academic building and two 
hostel buildings 

Project Brief The Sivananda Centenary Boys’ School, Bhubaneshwar, an English medium and CBSE affiliated fully 
residential school, signed an agreement with ONGC on 27 February 2018 for financial assistance for the 
construction of a three-storied academic building and 2 hostel buildings on the school campus with a total 
area of all buildings 4030.11 sqm. 

Project Duration Project to be completed within 18 months of signing the agreement 
Commencement of facility School operationalised in August 2020 
Project Cost ` 471.85 Lakhs 
Impact Assessment Agency  UN Global Compact Network India  
Methodology  (i) Structured interviews (ii) Exploratory and semi-structured interviews (iii) Quantitative impact modeling 
Findings  For each ` 1 spent by ONGC on this project, the Social Return on Investment was -` 0.2. 

Observations:

The English-medium and CBSE affiliated residential school identifies itself as a modern gurukul where 
spirituality and education go hand-in-hand. The campus has academic blocks, staff residence, hostel blocks, 
dining hall with kitchen, a dispensary, a gaushala, a Saraswati temple, and a huge prayer-cum-yoga hall for 
the students. The new building and the hostel blocks were inaugurated on 6 September 2019.

• The management identified a routine comprising yoga classes at 4 pm and a diet of complete satvik food 
as additional benefits and learnings for the students. Operation and maintenance costs were covered by 
student fees.

• The management had good connections with corporations because of several associations with the 
International Divine Life Society.

• This helped the management secure CSR funding to build infrastructure and set up laboratories.

• It also helped the school add classes XI and XII in the science and commerce streams. Funding from 
NALCO aided in the establishment of physics, chemistry, biology and computer science laboratories.

• Additional aid from NTPC also resulted in the construction of a dining hall.

• The school also organised medical coaching classes with support from Aakash Institute. Students were 
satisfied with the school as well as hostel facilities.

• Most of the teachers were hostel residents as well and were available for classes in the hostel for the 
students. Housemasters from each block supported the students with their homework and assignments.

• The management of the school believes that ONGC’s financial support has reaped benefits such as:

Enhanced access for more students from distant locations needing educational and financial support to 
attend a good school.

The wardens of the hostels find that the new hostels have more space per student and that they are better 
maintained and ventilated compared to the old hostel.

• Families of the students at the fully residential school were happy with the education and all-round 
development that their children were receiving.

Recommendations:

• The management of the school has a vision for the students and the future of the school by utilising the 
open land to build an indoor activity area for the students. The school committee has its own team of 
architects and designers for drafting the plans and putting them forward to companies for CSR funding.

Methodology  (i) Structured interviews (ii) Exploratory and semi-structured interviews (iii) Quantitative impact modeling 
Findings  For each ` 1 spent by ONGC on this project, the Social Return on Investment was ` 10.4.

Observations:

• ONGC’s CSR initiative has enabled the school committee to establish a new academic block that has a 
big prayer hall, rooms for setting the laboratories and a library. The school has also constructed a hostel 
of about 120 students capacity. ONGC’s funding for the construction of the new block has the potential to 
accommodate 2000-2500 students at once.

• According to the management this school is of a higher quality than the other 7 schools managed by Sishu 
Mandir, and other schools in the area. The examination results of the students are good with 100% passing 
rate for standard X students.

• Stakeholder feedback on the school:

All stakeholders interviewed were aware in their own capacity about the CSR funding provided by ONGC 
for the hostel and academic block, because of the ONGC logo on one big painted wall.

Students appreciated the new prayer hall but expressed a desire to have a well-stocked library and 
computer facilities. Some, however, expressed concerns with accessing the school’s sole water cooler 
that was installed on the ground floor, particularly in the middle of their classes.

Parents strongly believe that the teachers are supportive, and the school infrastructure and timings are 
good. The new construction of the school, completed in 2018-2019, has enhanced the infrastructure 
considerably.

• The heavy revenue crunch for the school which was caused by the decline in school fees as a result of 
COVID-19 impacted the utilization of the new block. The school cannot afford to buy furnishing, electrical 
equipment, computers for the laboratory and basic amenities such as a water cooler on every floor. The 
hostel infrastructure is complete, but the kitchen and rooms are not fully furnished or functional.

Recommendations:

• Provision of support by way of advice or financial aid to establish project sustenance.

• Optional action for ONGC: Due to the pandemic, the revenues from fees, and teachers’ salaries have 
been impacted. The hostel has no students. ONGC may advise or structure financial support for COVID-19 
impact on the school’s operations.

Project Title  Sarada Seva Trust school building at Sarda Vidya Mandir Hemtabad (Uttar Dinajpur, West Bengal) 
Project Brief The Sarada Seva Trust signed an agreement with ONGC Foundation on 15 November 2018 for financial 

assistance for the construction of a 2 storied school building at Sarada Vidya Mandir, Hemtabad in Uttar 
Dinajpur District of West Bengal. The private and unaided Bengali-medium and co-educational school is in a 
very remote area, functions from classes I to X, and is affiliated with the West Bengal Education Board. 

Project Duration 18 months 
Commencement of facility November 2018 
Project Cost ` 254.87 Lakhs 
Impact Assessment Agency  UN Global Compact Network India  
Methodology  (i) Structured interviews (ii) Exploratory and semi-structured interviews (iii) Quantitative impact modeling 
Findings  For each ` 1 spent by ONGC on this project, the Social Return on Investment was ` 10.30. 

Observations:

• Despite its remote location, the school had good infrastructure – 4 blocks with a ground floor, a common 
room including a sanitiser sprayer and a vending machine for sanitary napkins. There was also running 
water available in the toilet blocks for students. During the pandemic, the school functioned online for 22 
months including during examination periods.

• Approximately 80% of the students, male and female, were from scheduled castes. Their performance 
showed substantial improvements such as improved marks of more than 50% of the students, students 
pursuing either employment or higher education.

• The school had sought funds from local business organisations that helped in growing its infrastructure 
from temporary walls and sheet roofs earlier. Today, the school continues to receive funding from local 
donors, and the operating costs are covered by student fees as well as donations from locals in the area.

• As per interviews conducted for this study, one of the greatest plus points for all parents surveyed is that the 
school runs on strict discipline. 50% of the parents interviewed say that the large playground in the school 
offers a fantastic opportunity for children to play. 20% of the parents feel the school imparts values that are 
conducive to the growth of their child.

Recommendations:

• The construction deviated from approved technical drawing. It is reported by the school that ` 41 lakhs 
funds are pending to be received by the school from ONGC. ONGC to review this.

• ONGC needs to imperatively document and publicly communicate more about this school as an inspiration 
for other educational institutions and for their own brand strengthening.

• Optional action by ONGC - The parents of the students believe that the school can benefit greatly with the 
inclusion of better equipment in scientific labs which is currently missing.

Under ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mohatsav’, ONGC is spearheading the support of 
traditional art and craft forms of India

EXPLORING hidden depths

         ACHIEVING glorious heights

Project Title  Medical equipment for Diagnostic Centre at Seva Bharti Sanstahan, Ashok Vihar, Delhi 
Project Brief Sewa Bharti, Ashok Vihar, Delhi, signed an agreement with the ONGC on 29 August 2018 for financial 

assistance for the purchase of medical equipment for a diagnostic centre at Sewa Bharti Sewa as follows:

• 1.5T MRI with 16 channels with dedicated knee coil, shoulder coil and breast coil

• 16 slice CT with Dual Head Injector

• Colour Doppler with 4 probes

• Digital X-ray

• Laboratory Diagnostic Equipments

• Biochemistry, Immunoassay and other accessories

• Versa Automation for connectivity of analysers etc.

The proposal was aimed at providing affordable health care services to socio-economically weaker sections 
living in nearby slums. The diagnostic centre was part of a chain of 31 existing dispensaries of Sewa Bharti 
across various locations in Delhi that together cater to approximately 1.5 lakh patients per year.

Project Duration 6 months 
Project Date 29 August 2018 
Project Cost ` 1071.52 Lakhs 
Impact Assessment Agency  UN Global Compact Network India  
Methodology  (i) Structured interviews (ii) Exploratory and semi-structured interviews (iii) Quantitative impact modeling 
Findings  For each ` 1 spent by ONGC on this project, the Social Return on Investment was ` 8.7. 

Observations:

• The management of the diagnostic centre offered positive feedback about the day-to-day functioning of 
the centre, except for the expensive annual maintenance costs of ` 1 crore for the equipment to be paid to 
Siemens. As per the management, the latter is a significant financial burden/cost.

• The doctors were happy that the diagnostic centre was well maintained after the recruitment of Dr. Anuj 
who was instrumental in creating an extensively detailed patient care protocol. Dr. Anuj felt that the quality 
of the ultrasonography machine needed to be better.

• Technical staff of the pathology department stated that although the equipment is of high quality, it has not 
been used to its full capacity because the lab is not yet certified by the National Accreditation Board for 
Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). The accreditation process is ongoing and may take another 
year to complete.

• Doctors at the diagnostic centre attended to roughly 40 to 50 patients in a single day. Patients expressed 
high satisfaction with the quality of care and the cooperative nature of the technical staff and stated that 
this propelled them to choose the Seva Bharti Diagnostic Centre over others.

• According to the family of a patient undergoing dialysis at the Seva Bharti Centre, Safdarjung Hospital, 
the latter provides subsidized services but only undertakes dialysis for its in-house patients. Hence, for 
residents around Ashok Vihar, the Seva Bharti Diagnostic Centre in their own neighbourhood is very useful 
for their family members.

Recommendations:

• The NABL certification, which should have been part of the project planning, to be expedited with support 
from ONGC.

• The expensive AMC of machines, especially of those that are being underutilised, needed to have been 
included during the planning phase of the project. Now, ONGC could assist the centre in finding a solution 
for paying the expensive AMC of the machines.

• Purchase of equipment as per need should have been part of the project design and planning. ONGC may 
now assist the centre in the sale or leasing of unused medical equipment.

• Optional action for ONGC: The centre expressed a requirement for a small ICU and emergency facility 
at the dialysis unit. Typically, patients need to undergo a fistula surgery to be able to receive the dialysis 
through their arteries - currently, there are no such systems available. Further, in the event of an emergency, 
the institute does not have the capacity to treat emergency patients. A requirement was felt for ICU, 
Emergency, CPR systems.

Project Duration Two Years 
Commencement of facility  1 Match 2019 (Services of Phase-I Hospital)  
Project Cost Phase-I: ` 99.07 Cr   
Impact Assessment Agency  Reach India Trust 
Methodology  Desk Review, Interviews, Observations, Case Study 
Findings  As per the main objective of the project the hospital has succeeded in providing low-

cost treatment (at 70% of the market rate) and also able to address the issue of bed deficit. Some of the 
highlights of the findings are as under:

• Patient Served: 35850 patient served since starting of the hospital out of which 7369 were dialysis patient 
(Earlier there was no dialysis facility available in Sivasagar and patient had to travel to Dibrugarh for availing 
the facilities.

• Covid Care: An emergency Covid ward was set up within 30 days during the Covid 19 outbreak in 2020 and 
provided treatment to 100 patients.

• Feedback from Beneficiaries: Reviews and feedback were taken from different sets of beneficiaries including 
patients admitted, patients discharged, Covid affected patients, OPD patients and local population. The 
details of feedback on three main parameters are as under:

a. 90 % of the respondent said overall treatment in the hospital is Good and Low cost

b. 82% of the responded said experience of appointment with doctors are excellent.

c. 76 % of the respondent felt that medical facilities and services are good /excellent and another 24 % 
felt it is fair.

• Employment Generation: Out of the total staff engaged in the hospital 51% are male and 49% are female. 
Only 4% employee are from outside Assam and 96 % are from local areas which reflects that apart from 
providing affordable and quality treatment the hospital has also contributed towards creating employment 
opportunity.

Additional observation:

• While looking at the feedback record of the hospital, it is found that all most all patients were satisfied on 
the services provided by the hospital.

• The hospital maintained some systematic operating protocol (SOP) across all the departments and 
management of the organization, but there is scope for integration.

• The most important observation is hospital authority have maintained proper care toward maintenance of 
hygiene and sanitation.

• Training on behavioural aspects of the staff toward the patients is taken care by authority.

• Authority have kept more option and plan of action in advance for further development of the hospital 
keeping in mind more extensive services both in terms of quality and quantity.

Recommendations:

• Tie ups with Insurance company

• Increasing Ambulance number with Advance life support

• Increase awareness on the facilities available in the hospital for more inflow of patients

• Skill development Centre for training of local youth

• Starting Blood sample collection centers outside the hospital in town area

• Enhancing community engagement program

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

COMMENTS OF THE COMPTROLLER AND AUDITOR GENERAL OF INDIA UNDER SECTION 143 (6) (b) OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 ON THE STANDALONE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS CORPORATION LIMITED FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2022 AND MANAGEMENT REPLY THERETO:

Comments Management’s Reply

The preparation of financial statements of Oil and Natural 
Gas Corporation Limited for the year ended 31 March 2022 in 
accordance with the financial reporting framework prescribed 
under the Companies Act, 2013 (Act) is the responsibility of the 
management of the company. The statutory auditor appointed by 
the Comptroller and Auditor General of India under section 139 
(5) of the Act is responsible for expressing opinion on the financial 
statements under section 143 of the Act based on independent 
audit in accordance with the standards on auditing prescribed 
under section 143 (10) of the Act. This is stated to have been done 
by them vide their Audit Report dated 28 May 2022.          

I, on the behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, 
have conducted a supplementary audit of the financial statements 
of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited for the year ended  
31 March 2022 under section 143(6)(a) of the Act. This supplementary 
audit has been carried out independently without access to the 
working papers of the statutory auditors and is limited primarily to 
inquiries of the statutory auditors and company personnel and a 
selective examination of some of the accounting records.

Based on my supplementary audit, I would like to highlight the 
following significant matters under section 143(6)(b) of the Act which 
have come to my attention and which in my view are necessary for 
enabling a better understanding of the financial statements and the 
related audit report:

Statement of fact.

A.COMMENT ON PROFITABILITY 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2022 
Current Liabilities 
Provisions (Note 24): `33,468.87 million

Above does not include `5,526.59 million on account of following 
liabilities:

(i) `645.24 million demanded by Director General of Hydrocarbons 
toward liquidated damages on account of non-completion of 
Minimum Work Program within fixed time frame for Shale Gas & Oil 
exploration & exploitation.

 

(i) Shale Gas Policy 2013 stipulates in its para V, section-I of the 
Permission letter of the Govt. of India for grant of Shale Gas and 
Oil exploration/exploitation rights, withdrawal from shale gas and oil 
operations after G&G studies, without LD, in case the assessment 
does not establish shale gas and oil resources. Based on above, 
liquidated damages is not applicable as assessment through G&G 
studies in different basins has not established shale gas and oil 
resources. The same is further reiterated in the Policy Framework 
for Exploration and Exploitation of Unconventional Hydrocarbons 
dated 20.08.2018 issued by the Govt. of India which states that in 
nomination blocks given to National Oil Companies (NOCs), the 
NOCs will be allowed to explore and exploit all types of hydrocarbons 
under the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act 1948 and the 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules , 1959 as per existing fiscal and 
contractual terms of PEL/PML granted under nomination acreages. 
The shale gas policy of 2013 will be deemed to be modified and /or 
extended to that extent. 

Further the demand for liquidated damages was raised by DGH 
vide their letter dated 19.04.2017.The matter was replied to and 
was discussed and followed up in various meetings with DGH/
MoPNG and DGH has not followed up for payment of LD after our 
submissions. However the matter is being pursued actively with 
DGH / MoPNG for closure of the issue.

(ii) `4,881.35 million on account of unpaid/short payment of Royalty 
(for blocks KG-OSN-2001/3 and CB-OS/2) to Government of India 
which has been demanded by Director General of Hydrocarbons.

Non-provisioning of above liabilities has resulted in understatement 
of provisions and overstatement of profit by `5,526.59 million.

(ii) This consists of principal amount of `262.41 million and penal 
interest of ̀ 148.74 million in respect of NELP Block KG-OSN-2001/3 
for the period 2016-17 to 2020-21 and principal amount of  ̀ 1,209.48 
million and penal interest of `3,260.72 million  on the same  in 
respect of pre-NELP Block CB-OS/2 for the period 2006-07 to 2020-
2021. The demand raised by DGH is not tenable in terms of various 
provisions of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) read with statutory 
provisions of Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act 1948 
(ORD Act) & Petroleum & Natural Gas (PNG Rules) Rules, 2003 
and notifications issued thereunder. As per the ORD Act royalty is 
payable at the prescribed rate of the value obtained at well head. It 
also provides that the post wellhead cost/ well head price shall be 
determined based on actual post well head expenditure reported 
in previous year’s audited account. Further as per the provisions of 
the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in respect of the block KG-
OSN-2001/3, Companies (Lessee) shall be required to pay royalty 
to the Government (Lessor) at the prescribed rate of the well-head 
value of Crude Oil and Natural Gas. 

The Petroleum Mining Lease also provides that the lessee is subject 
to ORD Act, 1948 (53 of 1948) and the P&NG Rules, 1959. It further 
provides that the royalty shall be payable by the lessee as per the 
terms of any contract entered into between the lessee and the 
Government in respect of the said block/ contract area or at such 
rates as may be fixed by the Government of India from time to time. 

The matter has been taken up with DGH/MoPNG through various 
meetings and written communications, the last correspondence 
being letter dated 9 Sep 2021 in respect of the block KG-
OSN-2001/3 and 26 Oct 2021 in respect of the block CB-OS/2.

In view of the above creating liability against the demand raised 
by DGH in respect of both the above cases is not warranted. 
Accordingly these cases will be taken up with DGH/MoPNG.

COMMENTS OF THE COMPTROLLER AND AUDITOR GENERAL OF INDIA UNDER SECTION 143 (6) (b) READ WITH SECTION 129 (4) OF THE COMPANIES 
ACT, 2013 ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS CORPORATION LIMITED FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 
2022 AND MANAGEMENT REPLY THERETO:

Comments Management’s Reply

The preparation of consolidated financial statements of Oil and 
Natural Gas Corporation Limited for the year ended 31 March 2022 
in accordance with the financial reporting framework prescribed 
under the Companies Act, 2013 (Act) is the responsibility of the 
management of the company. The statutory auditors appointed by 
the Comptroller and Auditor General of India under section 139 (5) 
read with section 129 (4) of the Act are responsible for expressing 
opinion on the financial statements under section 143 read with 
section 129 (4) of the Act based on independent audit in accordance 
with the standards on auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of 
the Act. This is stated to have been done by them vide their Audit 
Report dated 28 May 2022.

I, on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, have 
conducted a supplementary audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited for the 
year ended 31 March 2022 under section 143 (6) (a) read with 
section 129 (4) of the Act. We conducted a supplementary audit 
of the financial statements of (Annexure I) but did not conduct 
supplementary audit of the financial statements of (Annexure II) 
for the year ended on that date. Further, section 139 (5) and 143 
(6) (a) of the Act are not applicable to (Annexure III) being private 
entities incorporated in foreign countries under the respective laws for 
appointment of their Statutory Auditor and for conduct of supplementary 
audit.  Accordingly, Comptroller and Auditor General of India has neither 
appointed the Statutory Auditors nor conducted the supplementary audit 
of these companies. This supplementary audit has been carried out 
independently without access to the working papers of the statutory 
auditors and is limited primarily to inquiries of the statutory auditors 
and company personnel and a selective examination of some of the 
accounting records. 

Based on my supplementary audit, I would like to highlight the 
following significant matters under section 143 (6) (b) read with 
section 129(4) of the Act which have come to my attention and 
which in my view are necessary for enabling a better understanding 
of the financial statements and the related audit report:

Statement of fact.

A.COMMENT ON PROFITABILITY 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2022 
Current Liabilities 
Provisions (Note 32): `66,630.26 million

Above does not include `5,526.59 million on account of following 
liabilities:

(i) `645.24 million demanded by Director General of Hydrocarbons 
toward liquidated damages on account of non-completion of 
Minimum Work Program within fixed time frame for Shale Gas & Oil 
exploration & exploitation.

 

(i) Shale Gas Policy 2013 stipulates in its para V, section-I of the 
Permission letter of the Govt. of India for grant of Shale Gas and 
Oil exploration/exploitation rights, withdrawal from shale gas and oil 
operations after G&G studies, without LD, in case the assessment 
does not establish shale gas and oil resources. Based on above, 
liquidated damages is not applicable as assessment through G&G 
studies in different basins has not established shale gas and oil 
resources. The same is further reiterated in the Policy Framework 
for Exploration and Exploitation of Unconventional Hydrocarbons 
dated 20.08.2018 issued by the Govt. of India which states that in 
nomination blocks given to National Oil Companies (NOCs), the 
NOCs will be allowed to explore and exploit all types of hydrocarbons 
under the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act 1948 and the 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules , 1959 as per existing fiscal and 
contractual terms of PEL/PML granted under nomination acreages. 
The shale gas policy of 2013 will be deemed to be modified and /or 
extended to that extent.

(ii) `4,881.35 million on account of unpaid/short payment of Royalty 
(for blocks KG-OSN-2001/3 and CB-OS/2) to Government of India 
which has been demanded by Director General of Hydrocarbons.

Non-provisioning of above liabilities has resulted in understatement 
of provisions and overstatement of profit by `5,526.59 million.

Further the demand for liquidated damages was raised by DGH 
vide their letter dated 19.04.2017.The matter was replied to and 
was discussed and followed up in various meetings with DGH/
MoPNG and DGH has not followed up for payment of LD after our 
submissions. However the matter is being pursued actively with 
DGH / MoPNG for closure of the issue.

(ii) This consists of principal amount of `262.41 million and penal 
interest of ̀ 148.74 million in respect of NELP Block KG-OSN-2001/3 
for the period 2016-17 to 2020-21 and principal amount of  ̀ 1,209.48 
million and penal interest of ` 3,260.72 million  on the same  in 
respect of pre-NELP Block CB-OS/2 for the period 2006-07 to 2020-
2021. The demand raised by DGH is not tenable in terms of various 
provisions of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) read with statutory 
provisions of Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act 1948 
(ORD Act) & Petroleum & Natural Gas (PNG Rules) Rules, 2003 
and notifications issued thereunder. As per the ORD Act royalty is 
payable at the prescribed rate of the value obtained at well head. It 
also provides that the post wellhead cost/ well head price shall be 
determined based on actual post well head expenditure reported 
in previous year’s audited account. Further as per the provisions of 
the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in respect of the block KG-
OSN-2001/3, Companies (Lessee) shall be required to pay royalty 
to the Government (Lessor) at the prescribed rate of the well-head 
value of Crude Oil and Natural Gas. 

The Petroleum Mining Lease also provides that the lessee is subject 
to ORD Act, 1948 (53 of 1948) and the P&NG Rules, 1959. It further 
provides that the royalty shall be payable by the lessee as per the 
terms of any contract entered into between the lessee and the 
Government in respect of the said block/ contract area or at such 
rates as may be fixed by the Government of India from time to time. 

The matter has been taken up with DGH/MoPNG through various 
meetings and written communications, the last correspondence 
being letter dated 9 Sep 2021 in respect of the block KG-OSN-2001/3 
and 26 Oct 2021 in respect of the block CB-OS/2.

In view of the above creating liability against the demand raised 
by DGH in respect of both the above cases is not warranted. 
Accordingly these cases will be taken up with DGH/MoPNG.

Management Discussion and Analysis Report
Subsequent waves of pandemic and conflict in Ukraine has dealt 
a severe blow to the global economy, shattering expectations of a 
fast paced recovery from the damaging impact of the COVID-19 
and has triggered an inestimable humanitarian crisis that demands 
a harmonious resolution. As tensions between Russia and Ukraine 
escalated into a full-blown crisis, global oil and gas market faced an 
upward rally in crude oil prices, to surge past USD100 per barrel, a 
phenomenon that is likely to sustain if the conflict prolongs.

The global economic recovery continues amid evolving challenges, 
Companies and Governments worldwide are re-evaluating their 
dependencies and re-analysing their strategies. For oil and gas, the 
volatility reflects the unwinding of partnerships between Western 
and Russian energy groups. The impact of supply issues will vary 
by country and be heavily influenced by the geopolitical actions. 
Gas is particularly vulnerable, with almost 40% of the natural gas 
consumed in the European Union originating in Russia. 

The immediate and longer-term impact on raw materials, logistics/
transportation, implementation teams, and infrastructure is 
inevitable. The conflict in Ukraine exposes once more the risks 
associated with the interconnected nature of global trade.  India 
meets half its gas needs through imports of liquefied natural 
gas (LNG). Though Russian LNG imports are low, the crisis has 
pushed up the fuel prices. India’s economic recovery amid rapid 
vaccination will also be affected severely as it is intricately linked 
to accessibility, availability and affordability of Energy. Inflationary 
pressures on economies due to rising fuel costs has prompted 
hardening of monetary policy by the Central Banks. 

In the present circumstances, energy security has joined energy 
transition as a top global priority, though the energy picture is 
less clear at the global level. The energy sector impacts of the 
present crisis will reverberate across every corner of the globe. It 
is expected that countries would accelerate the implementation 
of their decarbonisation policies, in particular energy demand 
reduction strategies. 

1. Global Economy

Ukraine-Russia crisis unfolded while the global economy was on a 
mending path but had not yet fully recovered from the COVID-19 
pandemic. April edition of the World Economic Outlook highlighted 
that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has “severely set back” global 
economic recovery. As per IMF, global growth is projected to slow 
from an estimated 6.1 percent in 2021 to 3.6 percent in 2022 and 
2023. This is 0.8 and 0.2 percentage points lower for 2022 and 
2023 than projected in January. World Bank in its Global Economic 
Prospects report published in June 2022, has lowered global growth 
forecast for calendar year 2022 to 2.9 per cent from 4.1 per cent.

World Bank reported that Global median headline CPI inflation rose 
to 7.8 percent (y/y) in April 2022, its highest level since 2008 due 

Indian Economy: 

Indian economy grew 8.7 per cent in 2021-22 as per latest 
Provisional Estimates of National Statistics Office. The GDP growth 
for 2021-22 takes the economy above its pre-pandemic level and 
is an improvement after contracting 6.6 per cent in 2020-21. The 
economic impacts from the most recent COVID-19 Omicron wave 
were relatively small and the populations are well-vaccinated. 
World Bank expressed concerns regarding deterioration in asset 
quality previously masked by COVID-era lending support measures 
including loan forbearance can resurface as these measures are 
phased out. 

Pandemic has left country with rising fiscal deficit. High import prices 
and demand during the recovery have led to deteriorating current 
account balance, while supply constraints and rising commodity 
prices have added to inflationary pressures. The ongoing conflict 
further adds to supply constraints and financial sector uncertainties, 
as trade embargoes and financial sanctions on Russia reverberate 
through the global goods and financial markets. The unemployment 
rate has declined to levels seen prior to the pandemic, but the labor 
force participation rate remains below pre-pandemic levels. 

In India, rising inflationary pressures led to an unscheduled policy 
rate hike in May & June 2022. Considering the microeconomic 
uncertainties, World Bank has also lowered India’s growth forecast 
for the current fiscal year (2022-23) to 7.5% from its previous 
estimate of 8% made in January. 

RBI: Monetary Policy Statement (June)

IMF: World Economic Outlook

to war-induced commodity price increases and broadening price 
pressures. Aggregate Emerging Market and Developing Economies 
(EMDE) inflation reached over 9.4 percent-its highest level since 
2008-while inflation in advanced economies, at 6.9 percent, is the 
highest since 1982. 

IMF also states that frequent and wider-ranging lockdowns in 
China-including in key manufacturing hubs-have also slowed 
activity there and could cause new bottlenecks in global supply 
chains. In several countries uncertainty has steeply risen and further 
increases in commodity prices, additional supply disruptions, and 
tighter financial conditions remain threats.  World Bank highlighted 
that higher, broader, and persistent price pressures shall slow 
down the global trade growth to 4 percent in 2022. Overall risks 
to economic prospects have risen sharply and policy trade-offs 
have become ever more challenging. Maintaining the resilience of 
financial institutions through effective regulation is also critical at 
this juncture.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

There has been a strong rebound in oil demand that has not been 
matched by a rebound in investment in supply. Despite upward 
pressure on prices, upstream spending in 2021 is set to remain 
below 2019 levels. Major international companies are diversifying 
their spending and building their portfolio in low carbon business. 
Financial resilience is increasingly becoming a function of climate 
resilience, companies are keen to build a portfolio that is resilient to 
both lower commodity prices and higher carbon prices. 

Gas & LNG

Global natural gas consumption showed a strong recovery in 2021, 
with an estimated 4.5% y-o-y increase. This is more than twice the 
equivalent of the decline experienced in 2020 and the third strongest 
year since 2000, after 2010 and 2018 (which grew by 7.8% and 5.2% 
respectively). This strong growth resulted from the combination of a 
rebound in economic activity after the lockdowns of 2020, boosting 
consumption in the industrial and power generation sectors, and 
a succession of extreme weather events that led to higher than 
expected heating and power generation needs. Growth slowed 
significantly in the second half of 2021 due to a challenging price 
environment and softening of the economic recovery.

Global LNG trade expanded by 6% in 2021, slightly below the 7% 
average rate in the 2015-2020 period, but much faster than the 1% 
increase in 2020. The Asia Pacific region saw an 8% increase in 
LNG imports and accounted for more than 95% of the net growth in 
LNG trade globally. China (up by 17%) and Korea (up by 14%) were 
the largest contributors in volume terms, particularly in the first three 
quarters of 2021, and China became the world’s biggest importer 
of LNG last year.

Russia is Europe’s largest natural gas supplier, meeting 33% of 
the region’s demand in 2021 after constant growth over the past 
decade due to the depletion of domestic production. Higher LNG 
import needs in Europe are putting pressure on an already tight 
global LNG market balance in 2022. Natural gas storage played a 
crucial role in meeting seasonal swings in gas demand across all 
key gas regions during the 2021/22 heating season. Gas storage 
levels both in Europe and the United States stood well below their 
five-year average levels at the end of the heating season, indicating 
strong restocking needs.

The record highs in spot natural gas prices in 2021 and 2022 have 
refocused attention on the role of natural gas, and raised new 
questions about the extent to which, and for how long, it can retain 
a place in the energy mix as clean energy transitions accelerate.

Exploration

Oil and gas companies have continued to keep a tight control on 
exploration spending following the market upheavals in the middle 
of the last decade and more recently from the damage wrought 
on global demand by the Covid-19 pandemic. Exploration drilling 
activity saw a significant drop in 2020 due to the impact of the 
Covid-19 pandemic on global oil demand.  A rise in oil prices from

2. Global Energy Sector

World has experienced multiple waves of infections from the 
contagious virus, and new variants have brought additional 
challenges. Global energy markets are under stress as it is facing 
double whammy of energy crunch and higher prices caused by 
pandemic & conflict in Ukraine. Crude oil prices increased by 36 
percent between August 2021 and February 2022, driven by a 
strong recovery in oil demand, followed by geopolitical tensions. 
Brent crude oil temporarily reached USD 140 in early March as 
markets started to reduce Russian oil imports. The global energy 
system is facing extreme uncertainty in the near, medium and long 
terms, while the consumers are facing hardships due to the limited 
availability of oil and gas.

The oil and gas sector is confronted with the biggest task in society-
addressing climate change. The structure of energy demand is 
changing, with the importance of fossil fuels gradually declining. 
What pathways can companies opt, and how can they steer towards 
low carbon opportunities in an economically viable manner is a big 
question. There has been a marked strengthening in the past two 
years in the ambitions of governments around the world to increase 
the pace and extent of reductions in carbon emissions. Wind and 
solar power are expanding rapidly, underpinned by continuing falls 
in their costs and an increasing ability of power systems to integrate 
high concentrations of variable power sources.

BP energy outlook 2022 estimates that share of fossil fuels in 
primary energy shall fall from close to 80% in 2019 to 30-20% by 
2050 in Accelerated and Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenarios. The 
declining importance of fossil fuels in global energy is offset by the 
increasing role played by renewable energy, whose share in primary 
energy increases from a little over 10% in 2019 to 55-65% by 2050 
in Accelerated and Net Zero scenarios. It is believed that the recent 
energy crisis will accelerate the adoption of renewable energy.

Oil Prices & Demand

With Oil markets struggling to navigate supply losses and 
dislocations stemming from Russia-Ukraine conflict, US and 
International Energy Agency (IEA) coordinated stock releases are 
somehow easing the pressure emanating from supply crunch and 
providing a crucial buffer to oil markets that’s facing heightened 
uncertainty amid the multitude of repercussions stemming from 
sanctions and embargoes targeted at Russia. As per IEA, global 
demand for oil in 2022 is forecasted to average 99.4 million barrels 
a day, up by 1.9 mb/d from 2021.

Woodmac expects oil demand to grow at 3.6 million b/d in 2022 (still 
the second-biggest annual jump ever) and 2.2 million b/d in 2023. 
However, annual demand for 2022 has been trimmed by 0.8% and 
for 2023 by nearly 1% – mainly due to Covid-related lockdowns in 
several major cities in China and the weaker outlook for Russia’s 
economy due to sanctions. The impact of higher prices in some 
countries is a secondary factor.

IHS Markit’s base case scenario projects Dated Brent to average 
about USD 104/bbl in 2022, assuming disruptions to Russian oil 
supply of the order of 1-3 MMb/d, which are offset to a degree by 
higher Iranian exports, unilateral output hikes by Saudi Arabia and 
the UAE, and strong supply gains outside of OPEC+. If there are 
more extreme cuts to Russian supply, then prices could average 
USD 133/bbl or more, with spikes to even higher daily levels at times. 
Short-term prices have jumped as a result of tightening supply and 
demand conditions as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As more 
supply emerges, particularly from the US and demand growth 
decelerates, prices are expected to ease back to the low USD 70s 
in 2023. However, there are plausible scenarios where prices move 
even higher as a result of Russian supply disruptions.

EXPLORING hidden depths

         ACHIEVING glorious heights

last year has not directly translated into a similar hike in exploration 
capex, as upstream players maintain financial discipline and focus 
on high-quality prospects. Rystad predicts that licensing activity is 
likely to see a drop in 2022. 66 rounds are expected to be completed, 
out of which around 14 are currently in the bid evaluation stage and 
16 are open for bidding, with the remaining 36 still in the planning 
stage. The rounds that are still under planning are high-risk rounds 
and around 50% of these likely to face delays and closing dates be 
extended to next year. The rounds that are yet to open have higher 
risk and could face delays in actual awards, with results potentially 
by next year. Most of the rounds that are likely to be completed are 
in mature basins.

Investment 

Upstream investment is rebounding off a 15-year low, led by 
resource holding NOCs. But demand is recovering faster and high 
prices suggest more investment is needed. As many oil and gas 
companies have started to reshape and reorient their portfolios, 
only a few are positioned to react swiftly to the recent oil price surge 
to provide much-needed additional production. 

The current upcycle –which has seen Brent crude surge past USD 
100 per barrel –is remarkable in that, despite the oil price surge 
and robust cash flow generation, exploration and production (E&P) 
investment is only showing a modest uptick, with little sign of a 
recovery to levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic kicked off 
in early 2020.

One of the key reasons for the reduced investment sensitivity 
to oil price movements is a shift in cash flow distribution among 
industry players. Amid the downturn caused by the drop in demand 
due to the Covid-19 pandemic, returning cash to shareholders 
became a top priority and companies reshaped their business 
models accordingly. Companies are also shifting priorities towards 
diversification, resilience and decarbonisation.

The focus for the most part is on short-cycle, fast-payback 
conventional, deep water or shale projects. For the year 2022, 
Rystad Energy expects that the global upstream investments will 
grow around 20%. From 2020 to 2023, the average yearly growth in 
investments is estimated at 7%. It expects shale/tight oil investments 
to increase almost 35% this year. Deepwater is expected to grow 
around 30% this year. Brazil, Guyana, West Africa and Australia will 
drive most of this growth. 

Woodmack observes that Investment is on track to rebound from 
USD 350 billion in 2020 to USD 430 billion by 2023 but price volatility 
created by demand uncertainties would serve to reinforce or break 
discipline, or recreate capital starvation, perpetuating the risk of 
under or over investment. Upstream capital requirements depend 
on expected demand and achievable capital efficiency. 

M&A

Deloitte’s 2022 oil and gas M&A outlook highlighted that aggressive 
acquisition strategy of O& G companies has given way to restrained, 

strategic, and environment-focused buying in 2021. Despite a 75% 
rebound in oil prices and record cash flows, for example, global 
O&G M&A deal activity increased by only 18% and capex grew by 
only 17% in 2021. Rystad Energy reported that Global upstream 
merger and acquisition (M&A) deals rebounded to pre-Covid-19 
levels in 2021, reaching a total of USD 181billion, a 70% increase 
over 2020. The total deal value for 2021 was the highest in three 
years and almost reached the highs seen in 2017 and 2018 of USD 
205 billion and USD 199 billion, respectively. Deals valued at more 
than USD 1 billion accounted for USD 126 billion, or 70%, of the 
global total. 

Geopolitical uncertainties may impede O&G M&A momentum in 
2022. ESG consideration in M&A is emerging and evolving. Private 
Equity (PE) interest has started looking for low-carbon solutions. 
However, portfolio-rebalancing amid the evolving geopolitical 
landscape and ongoing opportunities to integrate hydrocarbon 
and green energy assets could provide some support to the M&A 
activity in 2022.The deal pipeline is robust, and the upstream M&A 
market looks set to continue to strengthen.

3. India Energy Snapshot

India is the world’s third largest energy consumer and a major force 
in the global energy economy. Energy consumption in India doubled 
since 2000, due to growing population, rapid industrialisation and 
large scale urbanisation. While the pandemic seriously hampered 
capacity growth in 2020 and 2021 the pace is likely to further pick 
up in 2022. Energy use on a per capita basis is well under half the 
global average, and there are widespread differences in energy use 
and the quality of service across states and between rural and urban 
areas. Over 80% of India’s energy needs are majorly met by three 
fuels: coal, oil and solid biomass. Coal remains the largest single 
fuel in the energy mix. Oil consumption and imports have grown 
rapidly on account of rising vehicle ownership and road transport 
use. Domestic fuel sales have been rising since the government 
has been lifting COVID-19–induced curbs. 

BP Energy Outlook has envisaged that there will be a strong 
growth in primary energy led by renewables and, to a lesser extent, 
natural gas. Average growth per year would be around 2.5%- 2.7%. 
As result of this strong growth, India would account for around 
13%-14% of the global primary energy consumption in 2050, up 
from around 7% in 2019. The country is the world’s fifth largest 
renewable energy market with installed capacity of close to 109 GW. 
India has increased its Conference of Parties (COP) 21 Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs) commitment, the country has set 
an ambitious target of 500GW by 2030. 

Crude Oil & Natural Gas Production

As per Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) data, domestic 
crude oil production in FY’22 stood at 29.69 Million Metric Tonnes 
(MMT) versus 30.49 MMT during FY’21. ONGC’s standalone 
production was 19.54 MMT vs 20.27 MMT in FY’21. Production 
from Oil India Ltd and PSC/ JVs was 2.98 MMT and 7.16 MMT 
respectively. 



131

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

Natural Gas output in FY’22 was 34.02 Billion Cubic Metres (BCM), 
versus 28.67 BCM in FY’21. The increase in gas output was mainly 
contributed by private operator in Eastern Offshore. 

ONGC’s standalone domestic output stood at 20.91 BCM. Oil India 
produced 2.89 BCM and other private operators 10.22 BCM.

Consumption of Petroleum Products

According to PPAC figures, domestic petroleum products 
consumption in FY’22 increased by over 4 percent to 202.71 MMT, 
as demand for transport fuels surged as the pandemic-linked 
lockdown restrictions eased and economic activity picked up. 
Except SKO, petcoke & others, all petroleum products reported a 
growth in consumption during April-March 2022 compared to the 
same period of the previous year.

Petrol consumption was up 10.3 per cent at 30.9 million tonnes 
in 2021-22 while diesel sales were up 5.4 per cent at 76.7 million 
tonnes. Consumption of LPG was up 3 per cent at 28.3 million 
tonnes. Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) demand soared 35 per cent 
to 5 million tonnes but was less than the consumption recorded 
during the pre-pandemic year. This was mainly because full aviation 
services resumed only towards the end of the year.

Import and Export

PPAC reported that Crude oil imports increased by 7.9 percent 
in FY’22 to 211.9 MMT. The country’s import dependence has 
increased owing to a steady decline in domestic output and surge 
in demand, however, lower than pre-pandemic imports of 227 
million tonnes in 2019-20.

Petroleum product exports increased to 62.7 MMT from 56.8 MMT 
in FY’21. Forex outgo for imports for FY’22 surged to all time high at 
USD 120.4 billion versus USD 62.2 billion in the previous financial 
year. The higher import bill may significantly affect the forex reserves 
and current account deficit. 

Crude Oil Price: Indian Basket

Crude oil price of the Indian basket averaged USD 79.18 per barrel 
during FY’22 compared to USD 44.82 per barrel in the previous 
fiscal. The rise in prices was the steepest in the month of March 
2022 when the Indian basket averaged USD 112.87 per barrel. The 
supply concerns have kept global oil prices elevated since Russia-
Ukraine Crisis in February. India, which meets nearly 85% of its oil 
needs through imports, could be hit by a widening trade deficit, 
weakening rupee and persistent higher inflation. Higher oil Prices 

leads to broader price increases since it adds to input costs for 
large number of products. While current prices are at a level that 
aligns with ONGC’s strategic outlook and will boost the capex 
spending and fast track the monetization of discovered fields.

Domestic Gas Prices

The ongoing Ukrain-Russia conflict has added further pressure and 
uncertainty to an already tight natural gas market. Europe’s natural 
gas supply has been a topic of concern since mid-2021. Short-term 
prices have reached all-time record highs since the beginning of 
the conflict. The competition for flexible LNG cargoes pushed Asian 
spot prices to a record high and led to further curtailment in price-
sensitive importing markets, particularly in emerging Asia. Price 

volatility also reached record levels as a result of unprecedented 
uncertainty.

Domestic gas prices in FY’22 have been revised – it was priced at USD 
2.90/MMBTU for H2FY’22 as against USD 1.79/MMBTU for H1FY’22.  
Also the ceiling price for gas produced from challenging fields of 
deep-water and HP/HT areas was revised to USD 6.13 per MMBTU 
for October 2021-March 2022 from USD 3.62 per MMBTU in H1FY’22. 
Further, the prices of domestic natural gas for H1 FY’23 have been 
revised to USD 6.10 per MMBTU (million British thermal units). For 
the Gas produced from discoveries in deep-water, ultra deep-water 
and HPHT fields, the gas price ceiling is USD 9.92 per MMBTU.

In order to give a fillip to the gas based economy, focus is being

given to enhancing domestic gas production, expeditious 
development of gas infrastructure as well as development of Gas 
market by providing open access to gas infrastructure. To further 
facilitate conducive business environment for competitive gas 
markets, efforts are underway to rationalise gas pipeline tariff 
structure for improving the affordability of gas across the country 
and for attracting investments into the gas infrastructure. Reform 
measures like e-auction, Gas exchange platform, common carrier 
etc. will create conducive conditions for growth of gas based 
economy in the country.

Present remunerative prices will unlock value while ensuring a 
steady and reliable supply of indigenously developed gas to the 
country’s growing industrial and commercial setup – making that 
the perfect embodiment of an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ philosophy. 

Domestic Upstream Reforms and Initiatives

The last few years in the domestic upstream sector have been a 
sight for significant policy reforms and progressive decisions, GOI 
has undertaken several policy measures to increase exploration 
and production activities in India. The rapid pace of policymaking 
and swift progress on the ground with projects such as the National 
Seismic Project and Reassessment of Hydrocarbon potential 
will provide the necessary support for exploration activities in the 
country and further augment Oil & Gas supplies.

Some of the key reform measures have been, the introduction of 
a new licensing regime – Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing 
Policy (HELP) – that allows for Open acreage system of bidding 
with marketing and pricing freedom among other incentives. New 
players that entered the fray through the DSF and OALP bid rounds 
will provide the much needed thrust to explore the prospectivity of 
the Indian Sedimentary Basins. Government also brought in policy 
to incentivize greater recovery from our hydrocarbon producing 
assets through the EOR Policy. 

Further, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG), 
Government of India, vide Notification dated 15 October 2020, has 
allowed the producers to sell the natural gas through e-bidding 

where the contracts require market price discovery through 
transparent means. These affirmative policy actions are a much-
needed vital nudge for a sector that has enormous untapped 
potential and is a key strategic plank for supporting the country’s 
sovereign growth and development pursuits.

ONGC has made significant progress in this timeframe. It has 
completely monetized ‘U’ Field of KG-DWN-98/2 project. Its 
efforts contributed to the upgrading of Bengal and Vindhyan from 
Category 3 to Category 2 Basins, of which the former became a 
Category 1 basin soon after with commercial production of first oil 
from its Ashokenagar-1 well. 

Perseverance of ONGC over the last 25 years, has now paid off – 
the Vindhyan Basin is close to becoming the ninth producing Basin 
of India. On testing, the Well Hatta#3 in the Son valley sector of 
Madhya Pradesh produced over 62,044 cubic meters/day gas, thus 
confirming the production potential of Proterozoic Basin for the first 
time in India. ONGC is fully geared to consolidate this development. 
With belief in prospectively, it has already acquired 5 Blocks under 
OALP rounds on the same Play trend.

At present world is witnessing double jolt of Pandemic and Ukraine-
Russia Crisis. Energy Transition has gained fresh impetus due to 
unsustainable Oil & Gas Prices which will entail fresh challenges 
to E&P Sector. Some key issues that merit attention at this point 
are the moderation of OID Cess and royalty rates and coverage of 
crude oil and natural gas under GST.  

Operational Performance

For FY’22, Oil & Gas production of ONGC Group, including PSC-
JVs and from overseas Assets has been 55.72 MMTOE (against 
58.39 MMTOE during FY’21). ONGC-operated domestic fields 
accounted for bulk of the countries oil and gas production – 66 
percent and 61 percent respectively.

Notes: 

1. Change in Inventory Turnover Ratio

Inventory Turnover ratio for FY 2021-22 is 13.51 against 8.00 in FY 
2020-21 i.e. increase of 68.88%, due to increase in revenue from 
operations by `422,043 million and decrease in average inventory 
by ̀ 3,526 million. The increase in revenue from operations is mainly 
due to increase in crude oil revenue by ̀ 357,274  million on account 
of  increase in crude oil prices, increase in natural gas revenue 
by `10,198 million on account of increase in natural gas prices, 
increase in value added products revenue by `53,242 million and 
increase in other operating revenue by `1,329 million.

2. Change in Interest Coverage Ratio 

The Interest Coverage ratio for FY 2021-22 is 142.18 against 
55.95 in FY 2020-21 i.e. increase of 154.12%, this is mainly due to 
increase in Profit Before Interest & Tax (PBIT) by `261,576 million 
and marginal decrease in interest cost during the year. The increase 
in PBIT is mainly due to increase in revenue from operations by 
`422,043 million which is partly offset by increase in statutory levies 
by `115,085 million as the levies are charged on ad-valorem basis.

3. Change in Debt Equity Ratio 

The Debt Equity ratio for FY 2021-22 is 0.03 against 0.07 in FY 
2020-21 i.e. decrease of 57.14%, due to decrease in Debt by 
`86,257 million and increase in other equity by `325,895 million. 
The decrease in Debt is due to repayment of current borrowings 
during FY 2021-22.

4. Change in Operating Profit Margin

The Operating Profit Margin for FY 2021-22 is 39.33 % against 
25.30 % in FY 2020-21 i.e. increase of 55.45 %, this is mainly due 
to increase in Profit Before Interest & Tax (PBIT) by `261,576 million 
The increase in PBIT is mainly due to increase in revenue from 
operations by `422,043 million which is partly offset by increase 
in statutory levies by `115,085 million as the levies are charged on 
ad-valorem basis.

5. Change in Net Profit Margin

The Net Profit Margin for FY 2021-22 is 36.53% against 16.50% in 
FY 2020-21 i.e. increase of 121.39%, this is due to increase in Profit

4. Opportunities & Threats

The recent geopolitical crisis amidst the ongoing pandemic, has 
proved just once again, how vulnerable the global economy remains 
to systemic risks. The oil and gas industry has rebounded strongly 
in 2021, with oil prices reaching their highest levels in six years. 
These price increases come on top of already tight commodity 
markets due to a solid demand recovery from the pandemic, as 
well as numerous pandemic-related supply constraints posed 
by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has disrupted 
production and trade of several commodities, particularly those 
where Russia and Ukraine are key exporters, including energy, 
fertilizers, and grains. IHS in its recent report has highlighted that 
the world oil supply cost curve has shifted upward. This results in 
about a USD 15/bbl increase in their price outlook to 2050 in base-
case scenario. It is expected that the general price environment 
between 2030 and 2050 shall average about USD 74/bbl in real 
terms (or about USD 117/bbl in nominal terms). While the recovery 
is better than expected, pressure is mounting on E&P companies to 
accelerate the shift of energy system away from one dominated by 
hydrocarbons towards the one with low-carbon system.

Most models of the energy transition also suggest that continued 
petrochemical demand and use in industry & transportation will 
ensure a considerable level of oil and gas demand, even in a net-
zero scenario. The global energy mix is not changing nearly as 
quickly as the world needs it to, as it is influenced by a range of 
factors, from political support, economics, to the development of 
emerging technologies. IHS Markit predicts that higher oil prices 
and a renewed focus on energy security are expected to jump-start 
global upstream capex spending. Liquids demand (demand for 
refined products, natural gas liquids, biofuels, and other liquids) is 
now expected to peak at about 109 MMb/d in 2030.

Despite the challenges, many E&P companies are sustaining efforts 
to decarbonize their operations and their value chains. A number 
of oil and gas companies have already set net-zero-emissions 
targets. The Paris Agreement strengthened the global response to 
the threat of climate change. According to new data released by 
the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), renewable 
energy continued to expand steadily and well above the long-term 
trend, with share in total capacity expansion reaching new record 
of 81% last year. Global renewable generation capacity amounted 
to 3,064 Gigawatt (GW) by the end of 2021, increasing the stock of 
renewable power by 9.1 per cent.  

Total installed renewable capacity (excluding hydro) in FY’22 has 
reached 109 GW in India. The share of renewables in the power 
sector is already at 27.5 percent and is likely to step up further with 
the development of more efficient and cheaper storage solutions. 
India has also already raised the nationally determined contribution 
(NDC) target of non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030. 
At present nearly 1 Million Electric Vehicles are already plying on 
Indian roads. Rystad Energy’s report states that in the 2030s, the 
EV revolution will spill over into electric trucks which will see a 
delayed transition, but once it takes hold, on a per unit basis, will 
have a material negative impact on oil demand that will materialize 
in the 2040s. 

Energy consumption in India has doubled since 2000, with 80% 
of demand still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. On a per 
capita basis, India’s energy use is less than half the world average. 
As Indian economy is the fastest growing major economy, it is re-
entering a very dynamic period in its energy development. Over the 
coming years energy demand and energy dynamics is expected 
to transform from fossil to low-carbon by the second half of this 



135

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

century. Despite the ongoing transition, IEA has underlined that Oil 
& Gas will remain central to the Indian economy over the next three 
decades.

Being an energy starved country, GoI has laid special onus 
on ONGC to carry out surveillance programme on behalf of 
Government of India to probe and explore remaining unexplored 
sedimentary basins of the country. As per the most recent resource 
reassessment study, a total of about 42 BTOE of resource potential 
was estimated from all category basins. Out of this about 12 BTOE 
has already been discovered, with a large potential of about 30 
BTOE yet to be discovered. ONGC will have opportunities to take 
lead in acquiring prospective areas through OALP & DSF for 
exploration of oil & gas and to expand its reserve base. ONGC has 
already initiated and is continuing efforts for identifying such areas 
in various basins. 

ONGC added one more basin (Vindhyan) to the hydrocarbon 
map of India by testing the well, Hatta-3 which flowed @ 62,044 
standard cubic metre of gas per day. With this, ONGC discovered 
08 out of 09 active basins of the country. ONGC has declared 4 
New hydrocarbon discoveries (2 in onland and 2 in offshore) during 
FY 2021-22 in its operated acreages. Six hydrocarbon discoveries 
have been monetized during the year including 2 discoveries 
notified during the FY 2021-22. ONGC plans to invest `3,10,000 
million in next 03 years on exploration. This will help ONGC achieve 
its acreage acquisition program to bring around 5,00,000 sq. km 
under  active exploration by 2025. Your Company has also lined up 
25 projects in next 03 years on field development.

Beyond  ambitious renewable  energy target for ES 2040, your 
Company is also looking to aggressively induct technology 
across all facets of its business ensuring greater energy 
efficiency, more productivity and improving safety performance. 
This focus has only sharpened in the wake of the COVID-19 
pandemic which has reset expectations and priorities of our 
business. ONGC is also focused on leveraging its extensive 
experience in meeting vast and complex challenges to 
advance solutions at scale in the highest-emitting sectors of the 
economy and keenly striving to enhance its renewable portfolio. 
ONGC is exploring growth options in low-carbon businesses, 
technologies like clean hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, 
and storage to lessen emissions intensive footprint and steadily 
wants to increase its size and scale in renewable sector.

Extra cash generated in a higher commodity price scenario may 
allow E&P companies to reinforce their financial position and 
to move into the next phase of the capital allocation framework. 
Companies must now, in all probability, also invest resources 
towards making their portfolio lighter or more diverse depending 
on their expertise, future opportunity set and shareholder / investor 
demands.

5. Risks and Concerns

The biggest impact on physical oil fundamentals so far in 2022 is on 
the demand side because of prevailing geo political concerns. But 
this is expected to shift as China will start reopening its lockdowns 
areas. 

There is diminishing likelihood of a revitalized US-Iran nuclear 
deal, which will keep out 1 MMb/d of additional Iranian oil output 
that had been expected to begin to enter the market later in 2022. 
Other factors include OPEC+ running out of spare capacity, 
falling Russian oil production, the European Union eliminating 
most Russian oil imports, the risk of US supply gains falling short 
of expectations as producers adhere to capital discipline, and oil 
inventories that are already very low.

Russia’s isolation following its invasion of Ukraine is deepening, 
Russia has historically been a source of low-cost oil for the world 
market. IHS in its report expects Russian crude and condensate 
output to fall from 10.4 MMb/d in 2021 to 9.1 MMb/d in 2022. Further 
output declines are expected over the longer term given Russia’s 
loss of foreign investors and access to international capital and 
technology. Amid the widening supply and demand uncertainties, 
oil market volatility remains rife.

For oil companies, an array of issues have influenced capital 
planning strategies, these factors include the industry’s growing 
emphasis on the energy transition, rising inflation, Govt. regulations, 
geopolitical concerns and more recently a surge in commodity 
prices and an increased focus on energy security following Russia-
Ukraine conflict. High oil prices poses risk for less capital discipline 
which reduces the focus on new opportunities, companies focus 
more on the core business through higher capex spending. Current 
O&G price regime is apt for companies to fund their sustainability 
commitments. 

Further, domestic gas sector is prone to price fluctuations The fact 
that our project pipeline is quite gas-rich  with break-evens in the 
USD5-USD9/MMBtu range-current price range will support the 
vision of Gas based Economy. We are hopeful that the setting up of 
the online gas hub - India Gas Exchange - is the first step towards 
liberalising prices and moving away from the current formula which 
is a derivative of international gas-rich and liquid hubs that do not 
really reflect the reality of our domestic market. ONGC has acquired 
5% equity in Indian Gas Exchange (IGX) as strategic investment and 
is also a member of IGX. ONGC has become the first Exploration 
and Production (E&P) company in India to trade domestic gas on 
Indian Gas Exchange from its KG-98/2 block.

The expanding LNG business also supports its global reach, and 
with the emerging concept of ‘green LNG’ it will gain traction even 
among the more climate-forward regions of the world. Under more 
aggressive scenarios where world transitions faster to lower carbon 
ecosystem, the verdict for more oil is quite extreme – IEA in its NZE 
case sees oil demand at 72 mb/d in 2030 and 24 mb/d by 2050.  
Natural gas demand increases in all scenarios over the next five 
years, with sharp divergences afterwards. Many factors affect to 
what extent, and for how long, natural gas can retain a place in 
the energy mix when clean energy transitions accelerate, and the 
outlook is far from uniform across different countries and regions. 
In the NZE, demand drops sharply from 2025 onwards and falls 
to 1,750 bcm in 2050. By 2050, more than 50% of natural gas 
consumed is used to produce low-carbon hydrogen, and 70% of 
gas use is in facilities equipped with Carbon Capture Utilization and 
Storage (CCUS). Whereas, Rystad Energy has forecasted that  oil 
demand to peak at 107 million bpd in 2025 and then progressively 
decline to 51 million bpd by 2050. While these are merely forecasts 
right now and much depends on how actually leading countries 
or regions or economic blocs like EU and countries like US and 
China move ahead with implementing their COP-21 commitments 
and their own internal Net-Zero goals/ policies. 

Oil and gas companies have kept their exploration spending low 
following the market crashes in the middle of the last decade 
and more recently from the damage wrought on global demand 
by the Covid-19 pandemic. A rise in oil prices from last year has 
not directly translated into a similar hike in exploration capex, as 
upstream players maintain financial discipline and focus on high-
quality prospects. Exploration drilling activity saw a significant drop 
in 2020 due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on global 
oil demand. The total number of exploration wells drilled in 2021 
was on the low side with a marginal drop of around 5% from the 
previous year, however there was an opposite trend for offshore

wells where activity increased. Rystad Energy in its analysis expect 
a similar trend in 2022 and could see an around 10% increase in 
offshore well numbers this year.

ONGC, however, continues to aggressively pursue exploration 
programs to maximize its reserve base as well as to augment the 
country’s prospective hydrocarbon-bearing areas. This means a 
combination of near-field appraisal and conventional wildcats. Your 
Company also runs the risk of running into unplanned delays on 
account of various environmental and regulatory issues. A single 
window clearance system may be expedited to facilitate prudent 
utilisation of resources and enable timely delivery of results in 
strategic and economically sensitive sector like oil and gas. 
Loss of valued experience, in a technology-intensive sector like 
E&P, where the pool of expertise is already limited is a serious 
obstacle.  The possibility of not attracting enough talent into the 
sector is an area of grave concern. However, diversification and 
technology-integration could not only ease people requirements of 
companies but may be useful to get the younger generation to join 
this vital industry by offering a different value proposition.

ONGC has implemented updated OISD Standards to improve 
contingency combat capabilities. International underwriters, 
enabling a lower-than-peer insurance premium for these assets, 
have rated ONGC offshore assets under ‘acceptable risk’. 

Operational safety is a high-risk element for most upstream 
operations. It requires companies to adopt a more holistic approach 
through a well-designed and strong HSE framework. With future 
operations, at least domestically, moving to more difficult terrains 
with challenging geologies, the centrality of Safety cannot be over-
emphasized at this point.

Energy Strategy 2040 

ONGC had adopted Energy Strategy 2040 as its strategic blueprint 
for future in 2019. ‘Energy Transition’ was one of the fundamental 
drivers of the roadmap and, going along, it is clear that this 
transition is going to play an increasingly stronger role in charting 
out the future policies and strategies.

ONGC remains committed to expand its production from both 
domestic and overseas operations to 110 MMTOE by 2040. 
However the pandemic has introduced further challenges in 
production particularly from difficult plays. ONGC is in the process 
of sourcing new technologies and partnerships for harnessing 
these fields as it remains focussed on shorter business cycles.

In Downstream, Your Company is well poised to expand its capacity 
through the expansion and green-field activities in progress at its 
subsidiary units. Your Company is also expanding its footprints in 
CGD & regas through group entities and has presence in 23 GA’s 
across 12 states. A 5 MMTPA LNG regasification terminal at Chhara 
port (Gir Somnath District) in Gujarat is under implementation 

Your Company is progressing well on the path of strategic restructuring 
of the group businesses with amalgamation of OMPL with MRPL.  
In addition, your Company is also exploring opportunities in the 
field of Renewables in India and abroad. ONGC has signed MoU 
with SECI for pursuing clean energy Goals.

6. Outlook

Your Company is positioned well for further business avenues 
backed by steady cash-flows. ONGC is exploring opportunities 
in new energy as part of its transformation into a true energy 
behemoth. Not only do we have the largest exploratory acreage 
of 1,26,657 Km2  in India as an operator as on 31.03.2022. We 
also are making continuous efforts to create a commercial play in 
newer and frontier areas. Over the last few years, we have brought 

more and more discoveries into the production stream quicker 
as well as made solid contributions to national E&P missions. In 
terms of supplies, the Company has a strong pipeline of projects – 
greenfield projects as well as brownfield redevelopment schemes. 

Presented below is a brief overview of our current exploration status 
as well as efforts in emerging areas and production enhancement 
efforts.

A. Exploration

ONGC continues to make meaningful discoveries while 
consolidating its reserves. It has adopted a ‘Play Based Exploration’ 
approach to accelerate the exploration activities from prospect 
focus to play focus. The strategic change to play based concept 
is primarily to assess the maximum YTF resource potential and 
enhance the reserve base of the company. In the present OALP 
regime, your Company is continuously evaluating prospectivity of 
new areas to maximize its acreage holding as well as to carry out 
aggressive exploratory efforts. Recent exploratory breakthrough in 
terms of finding hydrocarbon in Bengal basin, commercial flow of 
hydrocarbons in Vindhyan basin, and presence of gas within intrusive 
in Mesozoic sequence in Kutch Offshore are major leads to boost 
exploratory efforts. In Mahanadi offshore basin, your Company has 
restarted its exploratory campaign. With the culmination of fifth 
round of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) bidding, ONGC 
was awarded 24 blocks as an operator in onshore and offshore 
areas falling in 3 tier category Indian sedimentary basins adding 
exploration acreage of 46,313.36 Km2. Your Company participated 
aggressively in the OALP rounds VI & VII held during the year and 
emerged as the highest bidder winning an acreage measuring 
34,097 Sq. Km. in OALP Round VI against the total offered area of 
35,346 Sq. Km. ONGC emerged as sole bidder in 3 blocks in OALP-
VII and is expecting an addition of at least 9,397 Sq. Km.

Currently, all the awarded OALP blocks are in exploratory phase. 
Cumulatively as on 01.04.2022, a total 3,047.66 LKM of 2D seismic 
data and 8,965.05 SKM of 3D seismic data has been acquired 
and one exploratory well has been drilled in OALP Blocks. Further 
exploration activities are in progress. 

The significant potential growth areas in exploration are:

• Kopili, Sylhet, Barail, Bokabil and Tipam in South Assam Shelf 
area, Kuargaon-Mahakuti-Lakwa-Lakhmani-Banamali-Safrai 
corridor In North Assam Shelf, Lower Bhuban play in high-
pressure area in Rokhia field, Middle Bhuban formation in 
Kunjaban field 

• Exploration focus in the coming years will be oriented towards 
probing Early Paleocene Olpad, Late Paleocene OCS/
Mandhali and Early Eocene YCS/Chhatral, Paleocene-Early 
Eocene Panna Play with significant YTF potential.

• Kutch-Saurashtra will be of prime importance in the coming 
years. Plio-Pleistocene play in deep water block KG-DWN-98/2 
& Bhuvanagiri play shall also be targets for future exploration. 

• Exploration focus will also be oriented towards opening of 
new potential corridors in newly acquired OALP blocks in Son 
Valley Vindhyan Basin especially for Rohtas, Mohana Fawn, 
Jardepahar and Kajrahat plays.

• Probing of sub-thrust Dharamsala sequences in Palampur-
Sarkaghat areas and Subathus/ Bilaspur Limestone in 
Palampur thrust areas in Kangra-Mandi sector of Himalayan 
Foot hills will remain as prime focus areas for future exploration. 

• For the first time, ONGC will venture into Bikaner Nagaur 
Basin through its newly acquired OALP block to largely probe 
potential of Jodhpur and Upper Carbonate plays.

B. Development of new fields

On the production front, while legacy fields continue to be the 
mainstay of our base production, there is significant traction on the 
development of new fields as well as new schemes for maximizing 
recovery in mature areas. 

ONGC is cognizant of the role it assumes in the national energy 
landscape. It has made cumulative core E&P spends of over  
` 1,500 billion over the past 5 years. As on 01.04.2022, 20 major 
projects are under implementation with a total projected cost of 
around ` 5,90,000 million with envisaged gain of ~85.5 MMTOE. 

Among these is ONGC’s mega offshore deep-water project in 
East Coast, Cluster-2 Development of KG-DWN-98/2. U Field of 
this project has been fully monetised with the opening of third well 
U-1-A. The completion of this project is expected to substantially 
enhance the Gas portfolio of your Company.

Further, your Company, supported by Government’s policy support, 
is strongly pursuing improving recovery from existing areas. As part 
of expanding its EOR portfolio under the ER policy, 211 fields of 
ONGC located in onshore and offshore areas were considered for 
screening. Total of 33 ER Proposal were submitted, out of which 17 
have already been approved. Two fields, Gandhar GS-9 & Gandhar 
GS-11, are under feasibility Study.

ONGC for the first time executed a Pilot polymer flood project in 
heavy oil field of Mehsana.  The Pilot was completed on 15.09.2020 
before the scheduled period. The pilot was successful in achieving 
all its objectives. The incremental gain is 5057 m3 in 13 Months 
against FR envisaged 4960 m3. The closure report was approved 
by DGH on 08.11.2021. Commercial scheme for the same has 
already been submitted and envisages incremental oil gain of 1.79 
MMt (~ 5 % over BAU) and recovery of 23.3 % by 2046.

7. Internal Control Systems

To manage the large portfolio, your Company has institutionalized 
robust internal control systems to continuously monitor critical 
businesses, functions and operations; particularly field operations.  
The top management of your Company monitors and reviews 
various activities on continuous basis. A set of standardized 
procedures and guidelines has been issued for all the facets of 
activities to ensure that best practices are adopted and those 
percolate even up to ground level. 

Your Company has a dedicated Performance Management and 
Benchmarking Group (PMBG) which monitors the performance 
of each business unit against the Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) defined in the Performance Contracts between the top 
management and the Key Executives. As part of its push for 
systemic transformation and strengthening of control systems, your 
Company has placed adequate emphasis on institutionalization 
of tools, practices and systems that facilitate greater operational 
efficiencies and workplace productivity. Your Company has 
introduced E-Grievance handling mechanism for quick redressal of 
grievances of its various stake-holders.

Your Company has dedicated Internal Audit (IA) group which carries 
out audits in-house. At the same time, based on requirement, 
specialized agencies are engaged to carry out audit in the identified 
areas. Statutory auditors are appointed by Comptroller and Auditor 
General (CAG) of India for fixed tenures.

Third party safety audits are conducted regularly for offshore and 
onshore installations by established national and international 
HSE agencies such as Oil Industry Safety Directorate (“OISD”), an 
organization under the control of the MoPNG, which issues safety 
guidelines. Further, subject to the safety regulations prescribed by 
the Directorate General of Mines and Safety (DGMS), each work 

center has teams dedicated to HSE, which execute the safety 
guidelines prescribed by OISD as well as DGMS. HSE teams are 
also responsible for obtaining necessary licenses and clearances 
from the State Pollution Control Boards. 

All transactions in the company are carried out on upgraded SAP  
S/4HANAsystem. It is the successor to SAP R/3 and SAP ERP and 
is optimized for SAP’s in-memory database SAP HANA. Proper and 
adequate system of internal control exists to ensure that all aspects 
are safeguarded and protected against loss from unauthorized use 
or disposition and that each transaction is authorized, recorded 
and reported. The system further ensures that financial and other 
records are fact-based and reliable for preparing the financial 
statements.

Outcome Budget analysis: Your Company has established the 
linkages of budget expenditure with anticipated outcomes to 
have clear sight on the future growth orientation parameters. 
Expenditure proposed in Budget towards Development drilling 
and creation of Capital Facilities is co-related with the incremental 
gain in Oil and Gas production targets for next 5 years. Some of 
the other parameters included for outcome budget analysis are 
profitability variation analysis, budgeted Balance Sheet and Cash 
Flow, sensitivity analysis on profitability and cash flow as a result of 
changes in Crude Price and Exchange Rate.

8. Human Resource Development

Employees are the cornerstone of ONGC’s growth and value 
creation. ONGC’s HR Vision is to build and nurture a world class 
human capital by continuously innovating and adopting best-in-
class HR practices through engaged, empowered and enthused 
employees.

Your Company’s talent management strategy is focused on building 
an optimal and competent workforce to meet business needs 
and is centred around workforce planning and talent acquisition, 
performance management, learning & development, career growth, 
succession planning, leadership development, and extending best 
of employee facilities, welfare benefits and work environment. As 
on 31.03.2022 there were 27,165 employees on rolls of ONGC. 
Even amidst the challenges of pandemic, ONGCians ensured 
critical supplies of Oil & Gas through their commitment, and spirit 
of collective collaboration & achieved a stellar physical & financial 
performance during the year.

Capacity building of the workforce is a priority area, with dedicated 
institutes effectively catering to the learning & development needs 
of our employees to efficiently meet the challenges of dynamic & 
evolving E&P industry. ONGC also has tie-ups with various reputed 
national & international institutions, agencies and business schools 
for this purpose. During FY 2021-22, learning methodologies were 
continued on online mode. 19,219 executives and 4,338 non-
executives were imparted training in relevant domains, spanning 
66,660 executive and 9617 non-executive training days.

Learning Management System (LMS) undertaken by ONGC is a 
pioneer project under the Government’s Digital India Initiative. 
LMS portal brings competency-based learning, to enable self-
paced continual learning, through learning pathways, world class 
trainings, latest content and assessment-based progress. With this, 
ONGC has become the first PSE to onboard Learning Management 
System in 2022 under Mission Karmayogi launched by Hon’ble 
Prime Minister.

Leadership Development: ONGC has in place strategic 
development interventions across executive levels, to 
build and nurture a continual pipeline of energy leaders.

than 3,100 executives.  Further, to take care of development needs 
of the young officers, under ONGC Mentor Mentee Exercise 2021-
22, 600 Mentors have been initiated into the mentoring journey, who 
are each mentoring 1-2 young executives from their work centre.

Digitisation of HR Processes: A number of digital initiatives 
were taken up, during the year, towards improved employee 
processes, HR workflows, digitization of Trust records, in line 
with the organization’s push for technology & digitization. ONGC 
has introduced IT Enabled paperless Medical Referral process 
system through Medical Smart Cards (ONGCCares) to regular/
retired employees & their dependents thus making the system 
more convenient & transparent. Further, Paperless Medical 
reimbursement processes and referral systems was also launched 
in 2021,  directly impacting more than 1.5 Lakh beneficiaries, 
leading to considerable reduction in carbon footprint, as well as 
system improvement. 

Continuous communication & connect of top leadership with 
operations teams at ONGC locations across the country was 
ensured to reinforce employee safety, boost workforce morale 
and provide all necessary support for smooth operations. Towards 
supporting its workforce for timely immunisation, ONGC organized 
Vaccination camps at various work locations across the country for

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited Report on the 
Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 

1. Opinion 

We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial 
Statements of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (“the 
Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 
31, 2022, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other 
Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and 
the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes 
to the Standalone Financial Statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Standalone Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone Financial 
Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair 
view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards specified 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the 
state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2022, and its profit 
(including other comprehensive income), the changes in equity and 
its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

2. Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions 
of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.

3. Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to following Notes to the Standalone Financial 
Statements:-

i. Note No. 10.3, which explains that certain exploratory fields have 
been identified by DGH, MoPNG, GOI for bidding under DSF III, 
after considering the value of such fields as Nil. As these fields need 
to be handed over to the successful bidders, pending finalization 
of mechanism of recovery of carrying cost of these fields, an 
impairment provision of ` 12,549.06 million has been made during 
the year towards carrying value of the land and exploratory wells in 
these fields.

ii. Note No. 38.1, which states that pursuant to Section 115BAA of 
the Income Tax Act, 1961, during the current year, the Company 
has decided to avail the option of lower tax rate with effect from the 
financial year 2020-21. Accordingly, the Company has recognised 
provision for tax expenses in the financial statements for the 
year ended March 31, 2022 and re-measured its net Deferred 
Tax liabilities on the basis of the provision prescribed in the said 
section. The net impact due to availing the said option has resulted 
in decrease in deferred tax by ` 90,905.15 million (of which  
` (-) 1,382.25 million has been accounted in Other Comprehensive 

Income) and decrease in current tax by ` 28,019.77 million 
(including ` 1,639.72 million relating to earlier years). 

iii. Note No. 48.1.1(d), wherein it is stated that Directorate General 
of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had raised a demand on all the JV 
partners under the Production Sharing Contract with respect to 
Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas (PMT JV), 
being BG Exploration and Production India Limited (BGEPIL) and 
Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) (together “the Claimants”) and the 
Company (all three together referred to as “Contractors”), towards 
differential GOI share of Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be 
payable by contractors pursuant to Government’s interpretation 
of the Final Partial Award of Arbitral Tribunal (40% share of the 
Company amounting to USD 1624.05 million equivalent to  
` 123,022 million, including interest upto 30th November, 2016). 
Subsequent to Tribunal Orders dated October 12, 2016, DGH vide 
letter dated May 25, 2017, June 4, 2018 and January 14, 2019 had 
asked contractor for re-casting of accounts of the PMT JV and for 
remitting the respective PI share of balance dues including interest 
till the date of remittance. As the Company is not a party to the 
arbitration, the details of the proceedings of arbitration and copy of 
the order of London High Court are not available with the company. 
The Company has responded that The English High Court has 
delivered its final verdict on May 2, 2018 following which the Arbitral 
Tribunal re-considered some of its earlier findings from the 2016 FPA 
(Revised Award); The Government of India and JV Partners have 
challenged parts of the Revised Award before English court. On 
February 12, 2020, the English Court passed a verdict favouring the 
challenges made by BGEPIL and RIL and also remitted the matter 
in the Revised Award back to Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. 
In January 2021, the Tribunal issued a verdict favouring BGEPIL/
RIL on the remitted matter, which has been challenged by the GOI 
before the English Court. Pending finalization of the decision of 
the Arbitral Tribunal, the Company has indicated in their letters to 
DGH that the final recasting of the accounts is premature and the 
issues raised by DGH may be kept in abeyance and therefore no 
provision for the same has been considered necessary and has 
been considered as contingent liability. 

iv. Note No. 48.1(b), with respect to ongoing disputes/demands 
raised on various work centres of the company under Service Tax 
(ST) and Goods & Service Tax (GST) in respect of ST and GST on 
Royalty levied on Crude Oil and Natural Gas. Based on the legal 
opinion, the company has disputed such levies and contesting the 
same at various forums. The estimated amounts under disputes as 
worked out towards ST and GST (including interest and penalty upto 
March 31, 2022) of ` 40,172.56 million and ` 1,02,731.94 million 
respectively (Total ` 1,42,904.50 million), has been considered 
as contingent liability. As a measure of abundant caution, the 
company has deposited ST and GST along with interest under 
protest amounting to ` 13,524.39 million and ` 74,043.48 million 
respectively (Total ` 87,567.87 million).

Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements is not modified 
in respect of these matters.

4. Key Audit Matters 

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of these Standalone 
Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters 
to be communicated in our report:

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the matter

Evaluation of adequacy of provision for impairment for tangible and 
intangible assets 

(Refer Note 47 to the Standalone Financial Statements) 

Management has assessed whether any provision needs to be 
recognised on account of impairment of tangible and intangible 
assets. 

The Company reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and 
intangible assets (Oil and Gas Assets including Capital Work-
in-Progress (CWIP) & Development Wells in Progress (DWIP), 
Other Property, Plant & Equipment (including Capital Works-in-
Progress, Right of Use Assets) for the “Cash Generating Unit” 
(CGU) determined at the end of each reporting period to assess 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered any 
impairment loss. 

Oil and Gas price assumptions have a significant impact on CGU 
impairment assessments and are inherently uncertain. Furthermore, 
oil and gas prices are subject to increased uncertainty, given 
regulatory guidelines including notified gas prices, climate change 
and the global energy transition. 

The management’s assumptions for prices of oil and gas in future 
are highly judgemental and may not be reflective of above factors, 
leading to a risk of material misstatement. 

Given the long timeframes involved, certain recoverable amounts 
of assets are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Since the 
determination of appropriate discount rate is judgemental, there is 
a risk that discount rates may not reflect the return required by the 
market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted, 
which may lead to a material misstatement. 

A key input to impairment assessments and valuations is the 
production forecast, in turn closely related to the Company’s 
reserves estimates, production profile and field development 
assumptions with reference to Oil and Gas. 

The determination of recoverable amount, being the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value- in use is based on the factors 
as discussed above, necessitating judgement on the part of 
management.

In case of exploration and evaluation assets, based on 
management’s judgement, assessment for impairment is carried 
out when further exploration activities are not planned in near future 
or when sufficient data indicate that although a development is likely 
to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration asset is unlikely 
to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale. 
Based on the above factors, we have considered the measurement 
of Impairment as Key Audit Matter.

Our audit procedures included the following: 

We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s identification 
of the CGUs and exploration and evaluation assets and tested the 
operating effectiveness of controls over the impairment assessment 
process, including indicators of impairment.

We reviewed the reasonableness of the judgments and decisions 
made by the management regarding assumptions (including the 
relevant regulatory guidelines) for Oil and Gas prices in future to 
identify whether there are indicators of possible management bias 
and accordingly relied upon the management’s assumptions for Oil 
and Gas prices in future. 

We reviewed the appropriateness of discount rates used in the 
estimation. 

We relied on the technical assessment of the Management with 
regard to the Reserves and the Production profile of Oil and Gas, 
as shown to us by the management. 

We performed testing of the mathematical accuracy of the cash 
flow models and checked the appropriateness of the related 
disclosures. We evaluated management’s assessment and related 
calculations of impairment including comparison of the recoverable 
amount with the carrying amounts of respective CGUs in the books 
of accounts. 

We perused the future plans related to exploration activities. Further, 
we have relied upon management’s assessment that the Mining 
Lease (ML)/ Petroleum Mining Lease (PML) shall be re-granted, 
wherever expired/ is expiring in near future.

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the matter

Estimation of Decommissioning liability 

(Refer Note 24 to the Standalone Financial Statements) 

The Company has an obligation to restore and rehabilitate the 
Asset/fields operated upon by the Company at the end of their use. 
This decommissioning liability is recorded based on estimates of 
the costs required to fulfil this obligation. 

The provision is based upon current cost estimates and has 
been determined on a discounted basis with reference to current 
legal requirements and technology. At each reporting date the 
decommissioning liability is reviewed and re-measured in line with 
changes in observable assumptions, timing and the latest estimates 
of the costs to be incurred at reporting date. 

We have considered the measurement of decommissioning costs 
as Key Audit Matter as it requires significant management judgment, 
including accounting calculations and estimates that involves high 
estimation uncertainty.

Our audit procedures included the following: 

Evaluated the approach adopted by the management in determining 
the expected costs of decommissioning. 

Identified the cost assumptions used that have the most significant 
impact on the provisions and tested the appropriateness of these 
assumptions. 

Reviewed the appropriateness of discount and inflation rates used 
in the estimation. 

Verified the unwinding of interest as well as understanding if any 
restoration was undertaken during the year. 

We have relied upon the technical assessment with respect to the 
Production Profile as estimated by the management based on 
which the Terminal year of the Asset /fields for decommissioning 
has been estimated.

We have relied upon management’s assessment that the Mining 
Lease (ML) / Petroleum Mining Lease (PML) would be regranted, 
till the terminal year of the field as estimated by the management. 

Relied on the judgments of the internal/ external experts for the 
purpose of technical /commercial evaluation. 

Assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the 
financial statements.

Litigations and Claims 

(Refer Note 48 to the Standalone Financial Statements) 

Litigation and claims are pending with multiple tax and regulatory 
authorities and there are claims from vendors/suppliers and 
employees which have not been acknowledged as debt by the 
company (including Joint Operations). 

In the normal course of business, financial exposures may arise 
from pending legal/regulatory proceedings and from above referred 
claims not acknowledged as debt by the company. Whether a claim 
needs to be recognized as liability or disclosed as a contingent 
liability in the Standalone Financial Statements or is considered 
as remote, is dependent on a number of significant assumptions 
and judgments made by the management. The amounts involved 
are potentially significant and determining the amount, if any, to be 
recognized or disclosed in the financial statements, is inherently 
subjective. 

We have considered Litigations and claims as Key Audit Matter 
because the estimates on which these amounts are based involve a 
significant degree of management judgment, including accounting 
estimates that involves high estimation uncertainty.

Our audit procedures included the following:

Understood Management’s internal instructions, process and 
control for determining and estimating the tax litigations, other 
litigations and claims and its appropriate accounting and/or 
disclosure. 

Tested key controls surrounding such litigations. 

Discussed pending matters with the Company’s personnel with 
respect to status of cases of litigation and claims. 

Assessed management’s conclusions through understanding 
precedents set in similar cases, reviewed the recommendations 
of the internal committee specially formed by the management, 
placed reliance upon the expert opinions, wherever obtained by the 
management. 

We have assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of 
presentation and disclosure of the Contingent liabilities in the 
Standalone Financial Statements.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the matter

Information Technology and General Controls

The Company is dependent on its Information Technology (“IT”) 
systems for processing and recording its transactions, including 
financial reporting processes. 

Appropriate IT general controls and application controls are 
required to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the 
data, as required, completely, accurately and consistently for 
reliable financial reporting. 

IT application controls are critical to ensure that changes to 
applications / files / information and underlying data are made in an 
appropriate manner and under controlled environment. Appropriate 
controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors 
as a result of changes to applications and data. 

MIS reports, relevant for financial reporting, have been developed 
and tested through internal and outsourced support arrangements 
and ultimately authenticated by the users.

On account of the pervasive use of its IT systems and related 
control environment on the Company’s financial reporting process, 
the testing of the general computer controls of the IT systems used 
in financial reporting has been considered to be a Key Audit Matter.

In assessing the integrity of the IT systems relevant for financial 
reporting, we obtained an understanding of the IT infrastructure and 
IT systems relevant to the Company’s financial reporting process 
for evaluation and testing of relevant IT general controls and IT 
application controls (‘SAP’), through inquiries with the management 
and review of the reports of the Information system control audits 
done by a third party.

Access rights were tested over applications, operating system, on 
a sample basis, which are relied upon for financial reporting. We 
further tested segregation of duties, including preventive controls 
to ensure that access to change applications, the operating system 
or databases in the production environment were granted only to 
authorized personnel.

Our audit included making necessary inquiries with the management, 
scrutiny of the report on ‘IT audit and security’ by a third-party 
expert, access security (including controls over privileged access), 
segregation of duties and delegation of authority. 

In response to the above IT requirements, enhancement of 
functionalities in IT System made during the year, we performed 
the following: 

- tested controls and performed additional substantive procedures 
of key general ledger account reconciliations.

- observed that training sessions are also provided to users, to 
enable full utilization of SAP functionalities.

We also tested key automated and manual business cycle controls 
and logic for the reports generated through the IT infrastructure 
including those relating to MIS, that were relevant for financial 
reporting or were used in the exercise of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statement, including testing of the 
compensating controls or alternate procedures to assess whether 
there were any unaddressed IT risks that would materiality impact 
the Standalone Financial Statements.

5. Other Matters

i. We have placed reliance on technical/commercial evaluation by 
the management in respect of categorization of wells as exploratory, 
development, producing and dry well, allocation of cost incurred 
on them, production profile, proved (developed and undeveloped)/ 
probable hydrocarbon reserves, and depletion thereof on Oil 
and Gas Assets, impairment, liability for decommissioning costs, 
evaluation and timelines for completion of projects under progress, 
liability for NELP and nominated blocks for under performance 
against agreed Minimum Work Programme.

ii. As mentioned in Note No. 46.1.1, the Standalone Financial 
Statements include the Company’s share in the total value of 
assets, liabilities, expenditure and income of 166 blocks under 
New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP)/ Hydrocarbon Exploration 
and Licensing Policy (HELP) / Discovered Small Fields (DSFs)/ 
Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALPs) and Joint Operations (JO) 
accounts for exploration and production out of which:

a. 9 NELPs/ HELPs/ JOs accounts have been certified by other 
Chartered Accountants. In respect of these 9 NELPs/ HELPs/ 
JOs, Standalone Financial Statements include proportionate 
share in assets and liabilities as on March 31, 2022 amounting 
to Rs 88,362.73 million and Rs 52,020.32 million respectively and 
revenue and profit including other comprehensive Income for the 
year ended March 31, 2022 amounting to Rs 98,583.94 million and 
Rs 15,236.73 million respectively. Our opinion is based solely on 
the certificate of the other Chartered Accountants.

b. 12 NELPs / HELPs/ JOs have been certified by the management 
in respect of NELPs / HELPs/ JOs operated by other operators. 
In respect of these 12 NELPs / HELPs/ JOs, Standalone Financial 
Statements include proportionate share in assets and liabilities 
as on March 31, 2022 amounting to ` 9,566.20 million and  
` 8,602.73 million respectively and revenue and profit/(loss) 
including other comprehensive Income for the year ended March 
31, 2022 amounting to ` 38.31 million and ` (708.40) million 
respectively. Our opinion is based solely on management certified 
accounts.

Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements is not modified 
in respect of these matters.

6. Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and 
Auditor’s Report Thereon

EXPLORING hidden depths

         ACHIEVING glorious heights

In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information identified above 
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone 
Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 

When we read the other information, if we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate 
actions necessitated by the circumstances and the applicable laws 
and regulations.

7. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance 
for the Standalone Financial Statements 

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
and presentation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give 
a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, 
changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 
133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate Internal 
Financial Controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial 
Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the Board of 
Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so. 

The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process. 

8. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Standalone Financial 
Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial 
Statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also: 

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 

design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also 
responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company 
has adequate Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such 
controls. 

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management. 

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related 
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the Standalone 
Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation. 

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone 
Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements may 
be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified 
misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit. 

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure - 2 to Independent Auditors’ Report   
(Referred to in paragraph 9 (3) (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) 

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements under Clause (i)  
of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act

To the Members of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited 

We have audited the Internal Financial Controls with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation 
Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2022 in conjunction with 
our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Company 
for the year ended on that date.

Management’s Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements 
based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate Internal 
Financial Controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation 
of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards 
on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material 
respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the adequacy of the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining 
an understanding of such Internal Financial Controls, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due 
to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements 

A Company’s Internal Financial Control with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A Company’s Internal financial control with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
Standalone Financial Statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to 
financial statements

Because of the inherent limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management, override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the Internal 
Financial Control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an 
adequate Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements and such Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements  were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the criteria for Internal 
Financial Control over financial reporting established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India.

Other Matters

As informed to us that the Audit Committee was re-constituted w.e.f 
November 14, 2021, and hence during the current period till such 
re-constitution, the mandatory functions of the Audit Committee, 
such as review/approval/ oversight/evaluation of the company’s 
external financial reporting, related party transactions, Internal 
financial controls over financial reporting, risk management system, 
internal audit function, whistle blower and vigil mechanism, end 
utilisation of funds etc., have been directly carried out by the Board 
of Directors of the company.

         ACHIEVING glorious heights

1. Corporate information

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (‘ONGC’ or ‘the Company’) 
is a public limited Company domiciled and incorporated in India 
having its registered office at Plot No. 5A-5B, Nelson Mandela 
Road, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, South West Delhi – 110070. The 
Company’s shares are listed and traded on Bombay Stock 
Exchange and National Stock Exchange in India. The Company is 
engaged in exploration, development and production of crude oil, 
natural gas and value added products.

2. Application of new Indian Accounting Standards

All the Indian Accounting Standards issued under section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 and notified by the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs (MCA) under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 (as amended) till the financial statements are approved 
have been considered in preparation of these Financial Statements.

2.1. Standards issued but not yet effective

The MCA has notified the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards 
/ Ind AS) Amendment Rules, 2022 on March 23, 2022, whereby 
the amendments to various Indian Accounting Standards has been 
made applicable with effect from April 1, 2022 onwards.

The amendments made vide aforesaid notification dated March 
23, 2022 has brought few additions and substitutions in Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) particularly in Ind AS 101- First-time 
Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards, Ind AS 103- Business 
Combinations, Ind AS 109- Financial Instruments, Ind AS 16- 
Property, plant and Equipment, Ind AS 37- Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets and Ind AS 41- Agriculture, the 
Company is evaluating the requirements of the same and its effect 
on the Financial Statements is not likely to be material.

3. Significant accounting policies

3.1. Statement of compliance

In accordance with the notification dated 16th February, 2015, 
issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the Company has 
adopted Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) 
issued under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 and notified 
under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
(as amended) with effect from April 1, 2016.

The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 
Ind AS notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 (as amended), the Companies Act, 2013 and Guidance 
Note on Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Ind AS) 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 

3.2. Basis of preparation

The Financial Statements have been prepared on going concern 
basis on the historical cost convention using accrual system 
of accounting except for certain assets and liabilities which are 
measured at fair value/amortised cost/Net present value at the end 
of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies 
below.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

As the operating cycle cannot be identified in normal course due to 
the special nature of industry, the same has been assumed to have 
duration of 12 months. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities have 
been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s 
operating cycle and other criteria set out in Ind AS-1 ‘Presentation 
of Financial Statements’ and Schedule III to the Companies Act, 
2013.

The Standalone Financial Statements are presented in Indian 
Rupees and all values are rounded off to the nearest two decimal 
million except otherwise stated.

Fair value measurement

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date under current market 
conditions. 

The Company categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value into one of three levels depending on the ability to observe 
inputs employed in their measurement which are described as 
follows:

(a) Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities. 

(b) Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or 
indirectly, other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the 
asset or liability. 

(c) Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
reflecting significant modifications to observable related market 
data or Company’s assumptions about pricing by market 
participants.

3.3. Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures 

The Company records the investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures at cost less impairment loss, if any. 

When the Company issues financial guarantees on behalf of 
subsidiaries, initially it measures the financial guarantees at their 
fair values and subsequently measures at the higher of:

i. the amount of loss allowance determined in accordance with 
impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
and 

ii. the amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, the 
cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with 
the principles of Ind AS 115 ‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers’.

The Company records the initial fair value of financial guarantee 
as deemed investment with a corresponding liability recorded 
as deferred revenue under financial guarantee obligation. Such 
deemed investment is added to the carrying amount of investment 
in subsidiaries. Deferred revenue is recognized in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss over the remaining period of financial guarantee 
issued as other income. 

On disposal of investment in subsidiary, associate and joint venture, 
the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amounts (including corresponding value of dilution in deemed 
investment) are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Interest free loans provided to subsidiary are recognized at fair 
value on the date of disbursement and the difference on fair 
valuation is recognized as deemed investment in subsidiary. Such 
deemed investment is added to the carrying amount of investment 



187

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

in subsidiaries. Loans are accounted at amortized cost method 
using effective interest rate. If there is an early repayment of loan 
made by the subsidiary, the proportionate amount of the deemed 
investment recognized earlier is adjusted.  

Where the Company is a sponsor in respect of Compulsory 
Convertible Debentures issued by subsidiaries & joint ventures and 
is mandatorily required to purchase such debentures, a financial 
liability is recognized at fair value with a corresponding debit to 
deemed investment. Financial liability is subsequently measured at 
amortized cost. The deemed investment is added to the carrying 
amount of investment in subsidiaries or joint ventures and carried 
at cost.

3.4. Interests in joint operations

A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that 
have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and 
obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. 

The Company has Joint Operations in the nature of Production 
Sharing Contracts (PSC) and Revenue Sharing Contracts (RSC) 
with the Government of India and various body corporates for 
exploration, development and production activities.

The Company’s share in the assets and liabilities along with 
attributable income and expenditure of the Joint Operations is 
merged on line by line basis with the similar items in the Financial 
Statements of the Company and adjusted for depreciation, 
depletion, survey, dry wells, decommissioning provision, impairment 
and sidetracking in accordance with the accounting policies of the 
Company.

The hydrocarbon reserves in such areas are taken in proportion to 
the participating interest of the Company. 

With respect to use of leased assets in the joint operations, the 
Company recognizes lease liability and corresponding right-of-
use asset in accordance with the terms of related joint operating 
agreement/production sharing contracts.

Gain or loss on sale of interest in a block, is recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss, except that no gain is recognized 
at the time of such sale if substantial uncertainty exists about the 
recovery of the costs applicable to the retained interest or if the 
Company has substantial obligation for future performance. The 
gain in such situation is treated as recovery of cost related to that 
block. 

3.5. Non-current assets held for sale

Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.

Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for 
sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a 
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition 
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the 
asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for 
sale of such assets. Management must be committed to the sale, 
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed 
sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, 
and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate 
that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or 
that the plan will be withdrawn.

Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets are not 
depreciated or amortized once classified as held for sale.

3.6. Government Grants

Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable 

assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions 
attached to them and that the grants will be received.

Monetary Government grants, whose primary condition is that the 
Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-
current assets and are recognized and disclosed as ‘deferred 
income’ under non-current liability in the Balance Sheet and 
transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and 
rational basis over the useful lives of the related assets.

All Non-monetary grants received are recognized for both asset 
and grant at nominal value.

3.7. Property, Plant and Equipment (other than Oil and Gas Assets) and 
Right-of-use assets

The Company had elected to continue with the carrying value of all 
of its Property, Plant and Equipment recognised as of April 1, 2015 
(transition date) measured as per the Previous GAAP and used that 
carrying value as its deemed cost as of the transition date except 
adjustment related to decommissioning provisions.

Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of 
goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in 
the Balance Sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Freehold land and land under perpetual 
lease are not depreciated.

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) in the course of construction 
for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at 
cost, less any recognised impairment loss. The cost of an asset 
comprises its purchase price or its construction cost (net of 
applicable tax credits), any cost directly attributable to bring the 
asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by the Management and 
decommissioning cost as per Note no 3.13. It includes professional 
fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised 
in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy. Such 
properties are classified to the appropriate categories of PPE when 
completed and ready for intended use. Parts of an item of PPE 
having different useful lives and significant value and subsequent 
expenditure on Property, Plant and Equipment arising on account of 
capital improvement or other factors are accounted for as separate 
components. Expenditure on dry docking of rigs and vessels are 
accounted for as component of relevant assets.

Depreciation of PPE commences when the assets are ready for 
their intended use.

Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE (other than freehold 
land, Oil and Gas Assets and properties under construction) less 
their residual values, using the written down value method (except 
for components of dry docking capitalised) over the useful life of 
PPE as stated in the Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or 
based on technical assessment by the Company. Estimated useful 
lives of these assets are as under:

Description Years

Building & Bunk Houses 3 to 60

Plant & Machinery 2 to 40

Furniture & Fixtures 3 to 25

Vehicles, Ships & Boats 3 to 20

Office Equipment 2 to 20

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation 
method are reviewed on an annual basis and if necessary, changes 
in estimates are accounted for prospectively.

Depreciation on additions/deletions to PPE (other than of Oil and 
Gas Assets) during the year is provided for on a pro-rata basis with 
reference to the date of additions/deletions except low value items 
not exceeding ` 5,000/- which are fully depreciated at the time of 
addition.

Depreciation on subsequent expenditure on PPE (other than of Oil 
and Gas Assets) arising on account of capital improvement or other 
factors is provided for prospectively over the remaining useful life.

Depreciation on refurbished/revamped PPE (other than of Oil and 
Gas Assets) which are capitalized separately is provided for over 
the reassessed useful life. 

Depreciation on expenditure on dry docking of rigs and vessels 
capitalized as component of relevant rig / vessels is charged over 
the dry dock period on straight line basis. 

Depreciation on PPE (other than Oil and Gas Assets) including 
support equipment and facilities used for exploratory/ development 
drilling is initially capitalised as part of drilling cost and expensed / 
depleted as per Note No. 3.11. Depreciation on equipment/ assets 
deployed for survey activities is charged to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term or useful life of the underlying asset, whichever is less.

An item of PPE is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use 
of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement 
of an item of PPE is determined as the difference between the net 
sales/disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

3.8. Intangible Assets

(i) Intangible assets acquired separately

The Company had elected to continue with the carrying value of 
all of its intangible assets recognised as of April 1, 2015 (transition 
date) measured as per the Previous GAAP and used that carrying 
value as its deemed cost as of the transition date.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately 
are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives not exceeding five years from the date of 
capitalisation. The estimated useful life is reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period and the effect of any changes in estimate is 
accounted for prospectively.

Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains 
or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are 
determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset, and recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.

(ii) Intangible assets under development -  Exploratory Wells in Progress 

All exploration and evaluation costs incurred in drilling and 
equipping exploratory and appraisal wells, are initially capitalized 
as Intangible assets under development - Exploratory Wells 
in Progress till the time these are either transferred to Oil and 
Gas Assets on completion as per Note No.3.11 or expensed as 
exploration and evaluation cost (including allocated depreciation) 
as and when determined to be dry or of no further use, as the case 
may be.

Cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic test wells are initially 
capitalized as Intangible assets under development - Exploratory 

Wells in Progress till the time these are either transferred to Oil 
and Gas Assets as per Note No. 3.11  or expensed as exploration 
and evaluation cost (including allocated depreciation) as when 
determined to be dry or the Petroleum Exploration License is 
surrendered. 

Costs of exploratory wells are not carried over unless it could be 
reasonably demonstrated that there are indications of sufficient 
quantity of reserves and sufficient progress has been made in 
assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability 
of the project.  All such carried over costs are subject to review for 
impairment as per the policy of the Company.

3.9. Impairment of tangible, intangible assets and right-of-use assets

The Company reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and 
intangible assets (Oil and Gas Assets, Development Wells in 
Progress (DWIP), Property, Plant and Equipment (including Capital 
Works-in-Progress) and right-of use assets of a “Cash Generating 
Unit” (CGU) at the end of each reporting period to determine whether 
there is any significant indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of 
the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount and impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.

An assessment is made at the end of each reporting period to see if 
there are any indications that impairment losses recognized earlier, 
may no longer exist or may have come down. The impairment loss 
is reversed, if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the previous 
impairment loss was recognized. If it is so, the carrying amount of 
the asset is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the 
carrying amount that have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior 
years. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future 
periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any 
residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. 
Reversals of Impairment loss are recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.

Exploration and Evaluation assets are tested for Impairment when 
further exploration activities are not planned in near future or when 
sufficient data exists to indicate that although a development is 
likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration asset is 
unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by 
sale. Impairment loss is reversed subsequently, to the extent that 
conditions for impairment are no longer present.

3.10. Exploration & Evaluation, Development and Production Costs 

(i) Pre-acquisition cost

Expenditure incurred before obtaining the right(s) to explore, 
develop and produce oil and gas are expensed as and when 
incurred.



189

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

(ii) Acquisition cost

Acquisition costs of Oil and Gas Assets are costs related to right to 
acquire mineral interest and are accounted as follows: -

Exploration and development stage

Acquisition cost relating to projects under exploration or 
development are initially accounted as Intangible Assets under 
development - exploratory wells in progress or Oil & Gas Assets 
under development - development wells in progress respectively. 
Such costs are capitalized by transferring to Oil and Gas Assets 
when a well is ready to commence commercial production.  In 
case of abandonment / relinquishment of Intangible Assets under 
development - exploratory wells in progress, such costs are written 
off.

Production stage

Acquisition costs of producing Oil and Gas Assets are capitalized 
as proved property acquisition cost under Oil and Gas Assets 
and amortized using the unit of production method over proved 
reserves of underlying assets.

(iii) Survey cost

Cost of Survey and prospecting activities conducted in the search 
of oil and gas are expensed as exploration cost in the year in which 
these are incurred.

(iv) Oil & Gas asset under development - Development Wells in Progress

All costs relating to Development Wells are initially capitalized as 
‘Development Wells in Progress’ and transferred to ‘Oil and Gas 
Assets’ on “completion”.

(v) Production costs

Production costs include pre-well head and post-well head 
expenses including depreciation and applicable operating costs of 
support equipment and facilities.

3.11. Oil and Gas Assets

The Company had elected to continue with the carrying value of all 
of its Oil and Gas assets recognised as of April 1, 2015 (transition 
date) measured as per the Previous GAAP and used that carrying 
value as its deemed cost as of the transition date except adjustment 
related to decommissioning provisions.

Oil and Gas Assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated 
depletion and impairment losses.  These are created in respect 
of an area / field having proved developed oil and gas reserves, 
when the well in the area / field is ready to commence commercial 
production.

Cost of temporary occupation of land, successful exploratory wells, 
all development wells (including service wells), allied facilities, 
depreciation on support equipment used for drilling and estimated 
future decommissioning costs are capitalised and classified as Oil 
and Gas Assets.

Oil and Gas Assets are depleted using the “Unit of Production 
Method”.  The rate of depletion is computed with reference to 
an area covered by individual lease/license/asset/amortization 
base by considering the proved developed reserves and related 
capital costs incurred including estimated future decommissioning 
/ abandonment costs net of salvage value. Acquisition cost of Oil 
and Gas Assets is depleted by considering the proved reserves. 
These reserves are estimated annually by the Reserve Estimates 
Committee of the Company, which follows the International 
Reservoir Engineering Procedures.

3.12. Side tracking

In the case of an exploratory well, cost of side-tracking is treated in 
the same manner as the cost incurred on a new exploratory well. 
The cost of abandoned portion of side tracked exploratory wells is 
expensed as ‘Exploration cost written off’.

In the case of development wells, the entire cost of abandoned 
portion and side tracking is capitalized.

In case of side tracking of producing wells and service wells which 
form part of the development schemes are treated as development 
wells and the cost incurred on the side tracking is capitalized.

In the case of side tracking of producing wells and service wells 
which do not form part of the development schemes and the side-
tracking results in additional proved developed oil and gas reserves 
or increases the future economic benefits therefrom beyond 
previously assessed standard of performance, the cost incurred on 
side tracking is capitalised, whereas the cost of abandoned portion 
of the well is depleted in the normal way. Otherwise, the cost of side 
tracking is expensed as ‘Work over Expenditure’. 

3.13. Decommissioning costs

Decommissioning cost includes cost of restoration. Provision for 
decommissioning costs is recognized when the Company has 
a legal or constructive obligation to plug and abandon a well, 
dismantle and remove a facility or an item of Property, Plant and 
Equipment and to restore the site on which it is located.  The full 
eventual estimated provision towards costs relating to dismantling, 
abandoning and restoring well sites and allied facilities are 
recognized in respective assets when the well is complete / facilities 
or Property, Plant and Equipment are installed.

The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future 
expenditure determined using existing technology at current prices 
and escalated using appropriate inflation rate till the expected date 
of decommissioning and discounted up to the reporting date using 
the appropriate risk free discount rate. 

An amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is 
recognized along with the cost of exploratory well or Property, Plant 
and Equipment. The decommissioning cost in respect of dry well is 
expensed as exploratory well cost.

Any change in the present value of the estimated decommissioning 
provision other than the periodic unwinding of discount is adjusted 
to the decommissioning provision and the carrying value of the 
related asset. In case reversal of decommissioning provision 
exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset including WDV of 
the capitalised portion of decommissioning provision in the carrying 
amount of the related asset, the excess amount is recognized in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss. The unwinding of discount on 
provision is charged in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance 
cost.

Provision for decommissioning cost in respect of assets under 
Joint Operations is considered as per participating interest of the 
Company on the basis of estimates approved by the respective 
operating committee. Wherever the same are not approved by the 
respective operating committee, decommissioning cost estimates 
of the Company are considered.

3.14. Inventories

Finished goods (other than Sulphur and carbon credits) including 
inventories in pipelines / tanks are valued at cost or net realisable

value whichever is lower. Cost of finished goods is determined on 
absorption costing method. Sulphur and carbon credits are valued 
at net realisable value. The value of inventories includes excise duty 
and royalty (wherever applicable) but excludes cess.

Crude oil in semi-finished condition at Group Gathering Stations 
(GGS) is valued at cost on absorption costing method or net 
realisable value whichever is lower.

Crude oil in unfinished condition in flow lines up to GGS / platform 
is not valued as the same is not measurable. Natural Gas is not 
valued as it is not stored.

Inventory of stores and spare parts is valued at weighted average 
cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Provisions are made 
for obsolete and non-moving inventories.

Unserviceable and scrap items, when determined, are valued at 
estimated net realisable value.

3.15. Revenue recognition 

The Company derives revenues primarily from sale of products and 
services, such as crude oil, natural gas, value added products, 
pipeline transportation and processing services.

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized at the point 
in time when the Company satisfies a performance obligation by 
transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer 
at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company 
expects to be entitled in exchange for the sale of products and 
service, net of discount, taxes or duties. The transfer of control on 
sale of crude oil, natural gas and value added products occurs at the 
point of delivery, where usually the title is passed and the customer 
takes physical possession, depending upon the contractual 
conditions. Any retrospective revision in prices is accounted for in 
the year of such revision.

Sale of crude oil and natural gas (net of levies) produced from 
Intangible assets under development – Exploratory Wells in 
Progress / Oil and Gas assets under development – Development 
Wells in Progress is deducted from expenditure on such wells.

Any payment received in respect of contractual short lifted gas 
quantity for which an obligation exists to make-up such gas in 
subsequent periods is recognised as Contract Liabilities in the 
year of receipt. Revenue in respect of such contractual short lifted 
quantity of gas is recognized when such gas is actually supplied 
or when the customer’s right to make up is expired, whichever is 
earlier. 

As per the Production Sharing Contracts for extracting the Oil and 
Gas Reserves with Government of India, out of the earnings from the 
exploitation of reserves after recovery of cost, a part of the revenue 
is paid to Government of India which is called Profit Petroleum.  It is 
reduced from the revenue from Sale of Products as Government of 
India’s Share in Profit Petroleum.

Revenue in respect of the following is recognized when collectability 
of the receivable is reasonably assured:

(i) Contractual short lifted quantity of gas with no obligation for 
make-up

(ii) Interest on delayed realization from customers and  cash calls 
from JV partners

(iii) Liquidated damages from contractors/suppliers

Dividend and interest income

Dividend income from investments is recognised when the 
shareholder’s right to receive payment is established and it became 
probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend 
will flow to the company, and the amount of the dividend can be 
measured reliably. 

Interest income from financial assets is recognised at the effective 
interest rate method applicable on initial recognition. 

3.16. Leases

Effective April 01, 2019, the Company adopted Ind AS 116 “Leases” 
using the modified prospective approach. The new standard defines 
a lease as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  
The Company has exercised the option not to apply this standard 
to leases of intangible assets.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: 

(i) the Contract involves use of an identified asset, 

(ii) the Company obtains substantially all of the economic benefits 
from the use of the asset through the period of the lease and 

(iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. 

The Company as a ‘lessee’

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognises 
a right-of-use asset (ROU asset) and a corresponding lease liability 
for all hiring contracts / arrangements in which it is a lessee, except 
for lease with a term of twelve months or less (i.e. short term leases) 
and lease of low value assets. For these short-term and low value 
leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments on straight-
line basis over the term of the lease.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or 
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised.

The lease liability is initially measured at present value of the future 
lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, 
if it not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rate. 
For leases with similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease by 
lease basis, applies either the incremental borrowing rate specific 
to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a 
whole.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which 
comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the inception 
date of the lease along with any initial direct costs, restoration 
obligations and lease incentives received. 

Subsequently, the right-of-use assets is measured at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if 
any. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line 
method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease 
term or useful life of right-of-use assets. The Company applies Ind 
AS 36 to determine whether a ROU asset is impaired and accounts 
for any identified impairment loss as described in the accounting 
policy below on “Impairment of tangible, intangible assets and 
right-of-use assets”.



191

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

The interest cost on lease liability (computed using effective 
interest method), is expensed in the statement of profit and loss, 
unless eligible for capitalization as per accounting policy below on 
“Borrowing costs”.

The Company accounts for each lease component within the 
contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of 
the contract in accordance with Ind AS 116 and allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis 
of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the 
aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in 
the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.

3.17. Foreign Exchange Transactions

The functional currency of the Company is Indian Rupees which 
represents the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates.

Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end 
of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated using mean exchange rate prevailing on 
the last day of the reporting period. 

Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.

3.18. Employee Benefits

Employee benefits include salaries, wages, Contributory provident 
fund, gratuity, leave encashment towards un-availed leave, 
compensated absences, post-retirement medical benefits and 
other terminal benefits.

All short term employee benefits are recognized at their 
undiscounted amount in the accounting period in which they are 
incurred.

(i) Defined contribution plans

Employee Benefit under defined contribution plans comprising 
Contributory provident fund, Post Retirement benefit scheme, 
Employee pension scheme-1995, composite social security 
scheme etc. is recognized based on the undiscounted amount of 
obligations of the Company to contribute to the plan. The same is 
paid to a fund administered through a separate trust.

(ii) Defined benefit plans

Defined employee benefit plans comprising of gratuity, post-
retirement medical benefits and other terminal benefits, are 
recognized based on the present value of defined benefit obligation 
which is computed using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual 
reporting period. These are accounted either as current employee 
cost or included in cost of assets as permitted.

Net interest on the net defined liability is calculated by applying 
the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined 
benefit liability or asset and is recognised the Statement of Profit 
and Loss except those included in cost of assets as permitted.

Remeasurement of defined retirement benefit plans except for 
leave encashment towards un-availed leave and compensated 

absences, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the 
changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan 
assets (excluding net interest as defined above), are recognised 
in other comprehensive income except those included in cost of 
assets as permitted in the period in which they occur and are not 
subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. 

The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities with respect to 
gratuity and un-availed leave to the ONGC’s Gratuity Fund Trust 
(OGFT) and Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), respectively. 
Liability towards post-retirement medical benefits is being funded 
and contributed to LIC. Other defined benefit schemes are 
unfunded.

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Financial 
Statements represents the actual deficit or surplus in the Company’s 
defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is 
limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in 
the form of reductions in future contributions to the plans.

(iii) Other long term employee benefits

Other long term employee benefit comprises of leave encashment 
towards un-availed leave and compensated absences. These are 
recognized based on the present value of defined obligation which 
is computed using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting 
period. These are accounted either as current employee cost or 
included in cost of assets as permitted.

Re-measurements of leave encashment towards un-availed leave 
and compensated absences are recognized in the Statement of 
profit and loss except those included in cost of assets as permitted 
in the period in which they occur.

3.19. Voluntary Retirement Scheme

Expenditure on Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) is charged to 
the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred.

3.20. General Administrative Expenses

General administrative expenses which are directly attributable are 
allocated to activities and the balance is charged to Statement of 
Profit and Loss.

3.21. Insurance claims

Insurance claims are accounted for on the basis of claims admitted/
expected to be admitted to the extent that the amount recoverable 
can be measured reliably and it is virtually certain to expect ultimate 
collection.

3.22. Research and Development Expenditure

Expenditure of capital nature are capitalised and expenses of 
revenue nature are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss, as 
and when incurred.

3.23. Income Taxes

Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and 
deferred tax.

(i) Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s current tax

is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous year.

(ii) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally 
recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled 
or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, 
and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the 
tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or 
settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, and any unused tax losses to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available in future against which 
the deductible temporary differences, and unused tax losses can 
be utilised, except when the deferred tax asset relating to the 
deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit or loss nor taxable profit or loss.

(iii) Current and deferred tax expense for the year

Current and deferred tax expense is recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in 
which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

3.24. Borrowing or Finance Costs

Borrowing costs including finance cost on lease liability specifically 
identified to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets or 
development wells or exploratory wells is capitalized as part of such 
assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial 
period of time to get ready for intended use. All other borrowing 
costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences arising from 
foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as 
an adjustment to interest costs i.e. equivalent to the extent to which 
the exchange loss does not exceed the difference between the cost 
of borrowing in functional currency (`) when compared to the cost 
of borrowing in a foreign currency.

When there is an unrealised exchange loss which is treated as 
an adjustment to interest and subsequently there is a realised or 
unrealised gain in respect of the settlement or translation of the 

same borrowing, the gain to the extent of the loss previously 
recognised as an adjustment is recognised as an adjustment to 
interest.

3.25. Rig Days Costs

Rig movement costs are booked to the next location drilled/planned 
for drilling. Abnormal Rig days’ costs are considered as un-allocable 
and charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

3.26. Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation, 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of 
the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the 
cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of 
the time value of money is material).

Contingent assets are disclosed in the Financial Statements by 
way of notes to accounts when an inflow of economic benefits is 
probable.

Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the Financial Statements 
by way of notes to accounts, unless possibility of an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefit is remote. Contingent 
liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of the management/
independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate.

3.27. Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instruments. 

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at 
fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other 
than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the 
financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial 
recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition 
of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss.

3.28. Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

3.29. Financial assets

(i) Cash and cash equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments, 
which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are 
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original 
maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase, to be 
cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances 
with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

(ii) Financial assets at amortised cost 

Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method if these financial assets are held 
within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order 



193

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding. 

(iii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a 
business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of 
the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding. 

The Company has made an irrevocable election to present in other 
comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of 
equity investments not held for trading. 

(iv) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss 
unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income on initial recognition.

(v) Impairment of financial assets 

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a 
financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 
109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss 
allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for 
trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. 
For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured 
at an amount equal to 12 month expected credit losses or at an 
amount equal to lifetime expected losses, if the credit risk on the 
financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

(vi) Derecognition of financial assets

The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the asset to another party. 

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety (except for equity 
instruments designated as FVTOCI), the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received 
and receivable is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

3.30. Financial liabilities

(a) Financial guarantee contracts

A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer 
to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it 
incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when 
due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are initially 
measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at FVTPL, are 
subsequently measured at the higher of:

i. the amount of loss allowance determined in accordance with 
impairment requirements of Ind AS 109; and

ii. the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the 
cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with 
the principles of Ind AS 115. [refer Note No.. 3.3 for Financial 
guarantee issued to subsidiaries] 

(b) Financial liabilities 

Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.

(c) Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only 
when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or 
have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the 
financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and 
payable is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

When an existing financial liability is exchanged with another 
financial liability, from the existing lender of the debt instrument on 
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing financial 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original financial liability and 
the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amount is recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.

3.31. Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the net 
profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is 
computed by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted average 
number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per 
share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that 
could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.

3.32. Statement of Cash Flow 

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit 
after tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash 
nature, any deferrals or accruals of future or past operating cash 
receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows are 
segregated into operating, investing and financing activities.

3.33. Segment reporting

Operating segments are identified and reported taking into account 
the different risks and returns, the organization structure and the 
internal reporting systems.

4. Critical Accounting Judgments, Assumptions and Key Sources of 
Estimation Uncertainty

Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used 
in preparing the Financial Statements is the need for Management 
to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the 
estimates and assumptions used. 

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are 
affected.

Key source of judgments, assumptions and estimation uncertainty 
in the preparation of the Financial Statements which may cause 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year, are in respect of Oil and

Gas reserves, long term production profile, impairment, useful 
lives of Property, Plant and Equipment, depletion of oil and gas 
assets, decommissioning provision, employee benefit obligations, 
impairment, provision for income tax,  measurement of deferred tax 
assets, litigation and contingent assets and liabilities.

4.1. Critical judgments in applying accounting policies

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations (refer Note No. 4.2), that the Management have made 
in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies and 
that have the significant effect on the amounts recognized in the 
Financial Statements.

(a) Determination of functional currency

Currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Company operates (“the functional currency”) is Indian Rupee 
(`) in which the Company primarily generates and expends cash. 
Accordingly, the Management has assessed its functional currency 
to be Indian Rupee (`).

(b) Classification of investment 

Judgement is required in assessing the level of control obtained 
in a transaction to acquire an interest in another entity; depending 
upon the facts and circumstances in each case, the Company may 
obtain control, joint control or significant influence over the entity 
or arrangement. Transactions which give the Company control of a 
business are business combinations. If the Company obtains joint 
control of an arrangement, judgement is also required to assess 
whether the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. If 
the Company has neither control nor joint control, it may be in a 
position to exercise significant influence over the entity, which is 
then classified as an associate.

The Company has 49.36% equity interest in ONGC Petro additions 
Limited (OPaL). The Company has subscribed for 3,451.24 million 
(Previous year 3,451.24 million) share warrants as at March 31, 
2022, entitling the Company to exchange each warrant with an 
equity share of face value of ` 10 each against which ` 9.75 each 
has been paid. 

Further the Company has entered into an arrangement for 
backstopping support towards repayment of principal and coupon 
of Compulsory Convertible Debentures (CCDs) amounting to ` 
77,780.00 million (Previous year ` 77,780.00 million) issued by 
ONGC Petro additions Limited in three tranches. The outstanding 
interest accrued as at March 31, 2022 is ̀  1,699.28 million (Previous 
year ` 1,926.75 million). 

The Company has evaluated the interest in OPaL to be in the nature 
of joint venture as the shareholder agreement between OPaL and 
the joint Venture partners, Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) 
and the company provides for sharing of control on the decisions 
relating to specific activities of OPaL by both the Joint Venture 
partners.

(c) Identifying whether a contract includes a lease 

The Company enters into hiring/service arrangements for various 
assets/services. The Company evaluates whether a contract 
contains a lease or not, in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 
116. This requires significant judgements including but not limited 
to, whether asset is implicitly identified, substantive substitution 
rights available with the supplier, decision making rights with respect 
to how the underlying asset will be used, economic substance of 
the arrangement, etc.

(d) Determining lease term (including extension and termination options)

The Company considers the lease term as the non-cancellable 

period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the 
lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. Assessment 
of extension/termination options is made on lease by lease basis, 
on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances. The lease term is 
reassessed if an option is actually exercised. In case of contracts, 
where the Company has the option to hire and de-hire the underlying 
asset on some circumstances (such as operational requirements), 
the lease term is considered to be initial contract period.

(e) Identifying lease payments for computation of lease liability

To identify fixed (including in-substance fixed) lease payments, 
the Company consider the non-operating day rate/standby as 
minimum fixed lease payments for the purpose of computation of 
lease liability and corresponding right of use asset.

(f) Low value leases

Ind AS 116 requires assessment of whether an underlying asset is of 
low value, if lessee opts for the option of not to apply the recognition 
and measurement requirements of Ind AS 116 to leases where the 
underlying asset is of low value. For the purpose of determining low 
value, the Company has considered nature of assets and concept 
of materiality as defined in Ind AS 1 and the conceptual framework 
of Ind AS which involve significant judgement.

(g) Evaluation of indicators for impairment of Oil and Gas Assets

The evaluation of applicability of indicators of impairment of assets 
requires assessment of external factors (significant decline in 
asset’s value, significant changes in the technological, market, 
economic or legal environment, market interest rates etc.) and 
internal factors (obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, 
poor economic performance of the asset etc.) which could result in 
significant change in recoverable amount of the Oil and Gas Assets.

(h) Oil & Gas Accounting

The determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural 
gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is 
usually made within one year of well completion, but can take 
longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure. 
Exploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil 
and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure 
(e.g. an offshore platform or a pipeline) would be required before 
production could begin, and where the economic viability of that 
major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion 
of further exploration work in the area, remain capitalized on the 
balance sheet as long as additional exploration or appraisal work is 
under way or firmly planned.

It is not unusual to have exploration wells and exploratory-type 
stratigraphic test wells remaining suspended on the balance sheet 
for several years while additional appraisal drilling and seismic 
work on the potential oil and natural gas field is performed or while 
the optimum development plans and timing are established. All 
such carried costs are subject to regular technical, commercial 
and management review on at least an annual basis to confirm 
the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value from 
the discovery. Where this is no longer the case, the costs are 
immediately expensed.

4.2. Assumptions and key sources of estimation uncertainty

Information about estimates and assumptions that have the 
significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses is provided below. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.



195

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

(a) Estimation of provision  for decommissioning 

The Company estimates provision for decommissioning as per 
the principles of Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets’ for the future decommissioning of Oil and 
Gas assets at the end of their economic lives. Most of these 
decommissioning activities would be in the future, the exact 
requirements that may have to be met when the removal events 
occur are uncertain. Technologies and costs for decommissioning 
are constantly changing. The timing and amounts of future cash 
flows are subject to significant uncertainty. 

The timing and amount of future expenditures are reviewed annually 
or when there is a material change, together with rate of inflation for 
escalation of current cost estimates and the interest rate used in 
discounting the cash flows.  The economic life of the Oil and Gas 
assets is estimated on the basis of long term production profile of 
the relevant Oil and Gas asset and  the management expects that 
the Mining Lease(s) expired will be extended before the end of the 
economic life of the related assets.

The long term average General Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
for inflation i.e. 4.67% (Previous year 4.47%) has been used for 
escalation of the current cost estimates and pre-tax discounting 
rate used to determine the balance sheet obligation as at the end 
of the year is long term average risk free government bond rate with 
10 year yield i.e. 6.92% (Previous year 7.05%).

(b) Determining discount rate for computation of lease liability

For computation of lease liability, Ind AS 116 requires lessee to use 
their incremental borrowing rate as discount rate if the rate implicit 
in the lease contract cannot be readily determined. 

For leases denominated in Company’s functional currency, the 
Company considers the incremental borrowing rate to be risk free 
rate of government bond as adjusted with applicable credit risk 
spread and other lease specific adjustments like relevant lease 
term. For leases denominated in foreign currency, the Company 
considers the incremental borrowing rate as risk free rate based 
on US treasury bills as adjusted with applicable credit risk spread 
and other lease specific adjustments like relevant lease term and 
currency of the obligation.

(c) Determination of cash generating unit (CGU)

The Company is engaged mainly in the business of oil and gas 
exploration and production in Onshore and Offshore. In case 
of onshore assets, the fields are using common production/
transportation facilities and are sufficiently economically 
interdependent to constitute a single cash generating unit (CGU). 
Accordingly, impairment test of all onshore fields is performed in 
aggregate of all those fields at the Asset Level. In case of Offshore 
Assets, a field is generally considered as CGU except for fields 
which are developed as a Cluster or group of Clusters, for which 
common facilities are used, in which case the impairment testing is 
performed in aggregate for all the fields included in the Cluster or 
group of Clusters.

(d) Impairment of assets

Determination as to whether, and by how much, a CGU is impaired 
involves Management estimates on uncertain matters such as 
future crude oil, natural gas and value added product (VAP) prices, 
the effects of inflation on operating expenses, discount rates, 
production profiles for crude oil, natural gas and value added  
products. For Oil and Gas assets, the expected future cash flows 
are estimated using Management’s best estimate of future crude oil 
and natural gas prices, production and reserves volumes. 

The present values of cash flows are determined by applying pre 
tax-discount rates of 14.74% (Previous year 14.29%) for Rupee 
transactions and 10.10% (Previous year 9.60%) for crude oil, natural 
gas and value added products revenue, which are measured in 
US$. Future cash inflows from sale of crude oil, natural gas and 
value added products are estimated using Management’s best 
estimate of future prices and its co-relations with benchmark crudes 
and other petroleum products. 

The discount rate used is based upon the cost of capital from an 
established model. 

The value in use of the producing/developing CGUs is determined 
under a multi-stage approach, wherein future cash flows are 
initially estimated based on Proved Developed Reserves. Under 
circumstances where the further development of the fields in 
the CGUs is under progress and where the carrying value of the 
CGUs is not likely to be recovered through exploitation of proved 
developed reserves alone, the Proved and probable reserves (2P) 
of the CGUs are also taken for the purpose of estimating future 
cash flows. In such cases, full estimate of the expected cost of 
evaluation/development is also considered while determining the 
value in use.

The discount rates applied in the assessment of impairment 
calculation are re-assessed each year. 

(e) Estimation of reserves

Management estimates reserves in relation to all the Oil and Gas 
Assets based on the policies and procedures determined by 
the Reserves Estimation Committee (REC) of the Company. The 
estimates so determined are used for the computation of depletion 
and impairment testing.

The year-end reserves of the Company are estimated by the 
REC which follows international reservoir engineering procedures 
consistently. For reporting its petroleum resources, company 
follows universally accepted Petroleum Resources Management 
System-PRMS (2018) sponsored by Society of Petroleum Engineers 
(SPE), World Petroleum Council (WPC), American Association of 
Petroleum Geologists (AAPG), Society of Petroleum Evaluation 
Engineers (SPEE), Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG), 
Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts (SPWLA) and 
European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers (EAGE). 

PRMS (2018) defines Proved Reserves under Reserves category as 
those quantities of petroleum that, by analysis of geoscience and 
engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be 
commercially recoverable from a given date forward from known 
reservoirs and under defined economic conditions, operating 
methods, and government regulations. Further it defines Developed 
Reserves as expected quantities to be recovered from existing 
wells and facilities and Undeveloped Reserves as the Quantities 
expected to be recovered through future significant investments. 

Volumetric estimation is the main procedure in estimation which 
uses reservoir rock and fluid properties to calculate hydrocarbons 
in-place and then estimate that portion which will be recovered 
from it. As the field gets matured and reasonably good production 
history is available, then performance methods such as material 
balance, simulation, decline curve analysis are applied to get more 
accurate assessments.

The annual revision of estimates is based on the yearly exploratory 
and development activities and results thereof. New In-place 
Volume and Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) are estimated 
for new discoveries. Revision of estimates are also due to Field 
growth which includes delineation/appraisal activities and field 
reassessment. Delineation/appraisal activities lead to revision in

estimates due to new sub-surface data. Similarly, reassessment 
is also carried out for existing fields due to necessity of revision 
in petro-physical parameters, new seismic input, updating of 
static and dynamic models and performance analysis leading to 
change in Reserves. Intervention of new technology, change in 
classifications and contractual provisions also necessitate revision 
in estimation of Reserves.

As per Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil 
and Gas Reserves Information (revised June 2019), approved by 
the SPE Board on 25 June 2019 

“The reliability of Reserves information is considerably affected by 
several factors. Initially, it should be noted that Reserves information 
is imprecise as a result of the inherent uncertainties in, and the 
limited nature of, the accumulation and interpretation of data 
upon which the estimating and auditing of Reserves information 
is predicated. Moreover, the methods and data used in estimating 
Reserves information are often necessarily indirect or analogical in 
character rather than direct or deductive...”

“The estimation of Reserves and other Reserves information is an 
imprecise science because of the many unknown geological and 
reservoir factors that can only be estimated through sampling 
techniques. Reserves are therefore only estimates, and they cannot 
be audited for the purpose of verifying exactness…”

The Company uses the services of third-party agencies for due 
diligence and it gets the reserves of its major fields audited by third 
party periodically by internationally reputed consultants who adopt 
latest industry practices for their evaluation.

(f) Defined benefit obligation (DBO) 

Management’s estimate of the DBO is based on a number of critical 
underlying assumptions such as standard rates of inflation, medical 
cost trends, mortality, discount rate and anticipation of future salary 
increases. Variation in these assumptions may significantly impact 
the DBO amount and the annual defined benefit expenses.

(g) Litigations

From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings 
and the ultimate outcome of each being always subject to many 
uncertainties inherent in litigation. A provision for litigation is made 
when it is considered probable that a payment will be made and 
the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant 
judgment is made when evaluating, among other factors, the 
probability of unfavourable outcome and the liability to make a 
reasonable estimate of the amount of potential loss. Provision for 
litigations are reviewed at the end of each accounting period and 
revisions made for the changes in facts and circumstances.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

5.1. The Company has elected to continue with the carrying value 
of its Oil and Gas Assets recognised as of April 1, 2015 (transition 
date) measured as per the Previous GAAP and used that carrying 
value as its deemed cost as on the transition date as per Para 
D7AA of Ind AS 101 except for decommissioning and restoration 
provision included in the cost of Oil and Gas Assets which have 
been adjusted in terms of para D21 of Ind AS 101 ‘First –time 
Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards’.

5.2. During the year 2016-17, Tapti A series facilities which were 
part of the assets of PMT Joint Operation (JO) and surrendered 
by the JO to the Government of India (GoI) as per the terms of JO 
agreement were transferred by GoI to the Company free of cost 
as its nominee and recorded as a non-monetary grant. During the 
year 2019-20, the Company opted to recognize the non-monetary 
government grant at nominal value and recorded the said facilities at 
nominal value, in line with amendment in Ind AS 20 ‘Accounting for 
Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance’ vide 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment 
Rules, 2018 (the ‘Rules’).   These assets were decapitalised / retired 
to the extent of the Company’s share in the Joint Operation. 

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India (GoI) 
vide letter dated May 31, 2019 assigned the Panna-Mukta fields 
w.e.f. December 22, 2019 on nomination basis to the Company 
on expiry of present PSC without any cost to ensure continuity of 
operation. Being a non-monetary grant, the Company has recorded 
these assets and grant at a nominal value.

Subsequent to assignment of Panna-Mukta field to the Company 
GoI has directed JV partners of the PMT (Panna Mukta & Tapti) field 
to transfer the existing SRF fund maintained for decommissioning 
obligation for Tapti Part A facility and Panna Mukta fields to the 
Company along with full financial and physical liability of site 
restoration and decommissioning of Panna Mukta fields and Tapti 
Part A facilities. Accordingly, in the year 2019-20 the Company 
received SRF fund of $ 33.81 million (`  2,402.18 million) for Tapti 
Part-A facilities and $ 598.24 million (` 42,506.87 million) for Panna 
Mukta fields from JV partners  (including the Company share of 40% 
in the fields) and acquired the corresponding decommissioning 
obligation with the conditions that Company will maintain separate 
dedicated SRF accounts under Site Restoration Fund scheme, 
1999 and extent guidelines of SRF, the Company will not utilise 
the fund of dedicated SRF fund of Panna- Mukta Fields and Tapti 
Part-A facilities for any other purpose, other than one defined under 
SRF scheme/guidelines. Company shall periodically carry out the 
re-estimation of cost of decommissioning of Panna- Mukta Fields 
and Tapti Part-A facilities as per existing Company policy and 
contribute to SRF account as per Company policy in nomination 
fields. In case, final actual cost of decommissioning of facilities 
of Panna-Mukta fields at the time of physical decommissioning is 
higher than approved decommissioning cost plus the accumulated 
amount, Company will contribute the additional amount required 
for decommissioning. However, in case the actual cost at the time 
of decommissioning is less than the accumulated amount, the 
balance amount will be transferred to the Government of India. 
The Company is mandated to pay Rupee one per annum as rental 
charges to Government of India for use of Tapti A facilities till its 
abandonment.

5.3. Union Cabinet, Government of India in its meeting held on 
February 19, 2019, on reforms in Exploration and Licensing Policy 
for enhancing domestic exploration and production of oil and gas, 
directed to bid out identified marginal nomination fields operated 
by National Oil Companies. In pursuance to decision of Union 
Cabinet, the Company offered 64 such marginal fields which are 
clustered geographically in 17 contract areas for bidding under the 
supervision of Directorate General of Hydrocarbons. The Company 
issued notice of award (NOA) for 49 marginal fields covering 13 
contract areas through the bidding process and signed contacts 
for production enhancement for 21 marginal fields and NOA of 28 
fields were cancelled due to non-submission of performance bank 
guarantee  by the successful bidders.

Out of 21 fields for which contracts have been signed, the company 
has handed over 19 fields to the contractors upto March 31, 2022 
and handing over of 2 fields is in progress. For bid out of balance 43

EXPLORING hidden depths

         ACHIEVING glorious heights

12.2 Generally, the Company enters into crude oil and gas sales 
arrangement with its customers. The normal credit period on sales 
of crude, gas and value added products is 7 - 30 days. No interest 
is charged during this credit period. Thereafter, interest on delayed 
payments is charged at SBI Base rate plus 4% - 6% per annum 
compounded each quarter on the outstanding balance.

Out of the gross trade receivables as at March 31, 2022, an amount 
of ` 101,672.40 million (as at March 31, 2021 ` 64,894.62 million) is 
due from Oil and Gas Marketing companies, the Company’s largest 
customers. There are no other customers who represent more than 
5% of total balance of trade receivables.

Accordingly, the Company assesses impairment loss on dues from 
Oil Marketing Companies on facts and circumstances relevant to 
each transaction. 

The Company has concentration of credit risk due to the fact 
that the Company has significant receivables from Oil and Gas 
Marketing Companies (refer Note No. 44.2.2, 44.3.2 & 45.4). 
However, these companies are reputed and creditworthy public 
sector undertakings (PSUs).

12.3 Includes an amount of ` 3,764.43 million (Previous year  
` 3,755.22 million) due towards Pipeline Transportation Charges for 
the period from November 20, 2008 to March 31,  2022 from GAIL 
India Limited (GAIL) on account of revised pipeline transportation 
tariff charges. 

In terms of Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) signed between GAIL and 
the Company, GAIL is to pay transportation charges in addition 
to the price of gas in case of Uran Trombay Natural Gas Pipe 
Line (UTNGPL) and were being paid by GAIL. Subsequent to the 
replacement of pipeline in 2008, the revised pipeline transportation 
tariff in respect of UTNGPL as approved by Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) is being invoiced to GAIL with 
effect from November 20, 2008. 

Maharashtra Gas Limited (MGL), one of the customers of GAIL, 
had filed a complaint with PNGRB on February 12, 2015 regarding 
applicability of tariff on supply of gas to GAIL. After hearing all 
parties, PNGRB vide order dated October 15, 2015 dismissed the 
complaint and gave a verdict in favour of the Company. Pursuant 
to appeal by MGL to the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL), 
the case was remanded back to PNGRB. Once again, PNGRB 
vide order dated March 18, 2020 had dismissed the complaint, 
authorized the pipeline as a Common Carrier Pipeline and directed 

both GAIL and MGL to pay the transportation tariff fixed by PNGRB 
from time to time for UTNGPL. MGL again filed an appeal with 
APTEL on April 04, 2020 against the order of PNGRB. APTEL vide 
order dated July 16, 2021 remanded the matter to PNGRB for fresh 
adjudication and passing final order within 3 months from the date 
of appointment of Member (Legal). Matter is presently pending with 
APTEL.

MGL has been paying the applicable tariff since July 2021.

Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd (RCF), another customer 
of GAIL, was paying revised tariff since February 2016 and the 
tariff from November 20, 2008 till January 31, 2016 was under 
dispute. The matter was  referred to Committee of Secretaries 
under Administrative Mechanism for Resolution of CPSEs Disputes 
(AMRCD) that met on June 17, 2021 and concluded that RCF would 
pay the transportation charges with effect from the date of order 
(i.e. December 30, 2013) of revised tariff rates of PNGRB.  The 
Company has requested clarification from the MoP&NG regarding 
the impact of AMRCD order on its receivable from GAIL.  However, 
in view of the conclusion of AMRCD, a provision of ` 446.43 million 
has been created against dues from GAIL on account of Pipeline 
Transportation Charges in respect of RCF for the period prior to 
December 30, 2013. 

The Company has been raising invoices on GAIL towards Pipeline 
Transportation Charges during the period from November 2008 to 
March 2022 amounting to ` 7,371.26 million, out of this an amount 
of  ` 3,606.83 million has since been received. 

In view of the above, the balance receivable (excluding provision ) 
of ̀   3,318.00  million as at March 31, 2022 (Previous year ̀  3755.22 
million) is considered good.

15.1 During the year 2010-11, the Oil Marketing Companies, 
nominees of the Government of India (GoI) recovered US$ 80.18 
million (Share of the Company US$ 32.07 million (equivalent to 
` 2,429.30 million)) as per directives of GoI in respect of Joint 
Operation - Panna Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts 
(PSCs).  Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal, the company’s 
share of US$ 32.07 million equivalent to ` 2,429.30 million (March 
31, 2021: ` 2,356.82 million) has been disclosed under the head 
‘Advance Recoverable in Cash’ (refer Note No. 48.1.1 (d)).

15.2  In Ravva Joint Operation, the demand towards additional profit 
petroleum raised by Government of India (GoI), due to differences 
in interpretation of the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract 
(PSC) in respect of computation of Post Tax Rate of Return (PTRR), 
based on the decision of the Malaysian High Court setting aside an 
earlier arbitral tribunal award in favor of operator, was disputed by 
the operator Vedanta Limited (erstwhile Cairn India Limited). The 
Company is not a party to the dispute but has agreed to abide by 
the decision applicable to the operator. The Company is carrying 
an amount of US$ 167.84 million (equivalent to ` 12,714.22 million) 
after adjustments for interest and exchange rate fluctuations which 
has been recovered by GoI, this includes interest amounting to US$ 
54.88 million (equivalent to ` 4,157.16 million). The Company has 
made impairment provision towards this recovery made by the GoI.

In subsequent legal proceedings, the Appellate Authority of the 
Honorable Malaysian High Court of Kuala Lumpur had set aside 
the decision of the Malaysian High Court and the earlier decision of 
arbitral tribunal in favour of operator was restored, against which the 
GoI has preferred an appeal before the Federal Court of Malaysia. 
The Federal Court of Malaysia, vide its order dated October 11, 
2011, has dismissed the said appeal of the GoI.

The Company has taken up the matter regarding refund of the 
recoveries made in view of the favorable judgment of the Federal 
Court of Malaysia with Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas 
(MoP&NG), GoI. However, according to a communication dated 
January 13, 2012, MoP&NG expressed the view that the Company’s 
proposal would be examined when the issue of carry in Ravva 
PSC is decided in its entirety by the Government along with other 
partners. 

In view of the perceived uncertainties in obtaining the refund at 
this stage, the impairment made in the books as above has been 
retained and netted off against the amount recoverable as above 
in the Financial Statements for the year ending March 31, 2022. 
(Figures in ` are restated).

15.3 The Ravva PSC stipulates Base Development Cost of Ravva JV 
to be at US$ 188.98 million with a cap of 5% increase. Accordingly 
the development cost stated in the PSC is US$ 198.43 million. 
However, actual cost incurred by JV is more than amount stipulated 
in the PSC. Director General of Hydrocarbons did not approve 

the increase in base development cost  for cost recovery and 
demanded additional profit petroleum vide letter dated August 8, 
2006 from the contractor / JV for an amount of  US$ 166 million 
as short paid on account of cost recovery of Development cost in 
excess of Base Development Cost. 

In August 2008 three JV partners excluding the company had 
invoked arbitration against Government of India (GoI) on the issue. 
The contention of claim as operator was that it should be allowed 
100% Cost recovery of the Base Development cost. The issue was 
argued at various levels including court of Appeals and Malaysian 
Federal Court. The decision of court was in favour of JV partners. 
After Federal court of Malaysia decision, the case was filed with 
Delhi High court for enforcement of award in India. Delhi High Court 
vide order dated February 19, 2020 allowed enforcement of the 
Arbitration Award including declaratory relief. GoI had filed an SLP 
in Honorable Supreme Court of India against the said order and 
the judgment dated September 16, 2020 was in favour JV partner.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), GoI vide letter 
dated October 10, 2018 issued a recovery notice to Oil Marketing 
companies (OMCs) for US$ 52 million plus applicable interest 
towards short payment of Government share of Profit Petroleum 
on account of dispute of Cost recovery of Base Development 
cost from the payments made to the Company towards the sales 
proceeds of Crude Oil and Natural Gas.  During the year OMCs 
deducted and deposited the sales proceeds of Crude Oil and 
Natural Gas to MoPNG and the entire amount of US$ 83 million 
(US$ 52 million along with interest of US$31 million) (equivalent to  
` 6,099.67 million) has been recovered. 

In view of the Supreme Court Judgment for enforcement of 
arbitration award in India, an amount of US$ 83 million (US $ 52 
million along with interest of US$31 million) has been adjusted 
from profit petroleum payable to GoI during the year 2020-21 and  
2021-22.

19.2 Matter of Dispute on Delivery Point of Panna-Mukta gas 
between Government of India (GoI) and BG Exploration and 
Production India Limited (BGEPIL) along with Reliance Industries 
Limited (RIL) and the Company (PMT JO Partners) arose due to 
differing interpretation of relevant PSC clauses. According to the 
PMT JO Partners, Delivery Point for Panna-Mukta gas is at Offshore, 
however, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoP&NG), GoI 
and GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL) maintained that the delivery point is 
onshore at Hazira. The gas produced from Panna-Mukta fields was 
transported through Company’s pipelines. Owing to the delivery 
point dispute neither the seller (PMT JO) nor the buyer of gas (GAIL) 
was paying any compensation to the Company for usage of its 
pipeline for gas transportation

Hon’ble Gujarat High Court decided that the Panna Mukta oil fields 
from where the movement of goods is occasioned fall within the 
customs frontiers of India. Consequently, the sale of goods cannot 
be said to have taken place in the course of import of goods into 
the territory of India. Accordingly the Hon’ble Gujarat High Court 
has determined that the Delivery Point for Panna-Mukta gas is at 
Offshore.  The State Government of Gujarat has filed a petition 
with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the decision of 
Hon’ble Gujarat High Court. Since the said matter of determination 
of delivery point is pending   with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India, an amount of US $51.90 million (Previous year US $ 51.37 
million) equivalent to ` 3,871.25 million (Previous year ` 3,752.80 
million) for the PMT JV including Company’s Share US $ 21.18 
million (Previous year US$ 20.74 million) equivalent to ` 1,556.87 
million (Previous year ̀  1,515.26 million) is maintained in the escrow 
account by the PMT JO Partners.

asset. The timing and amount of future expenditures are reviewed 
annually, together with rate of inflation for escalation of current cost 
estimates and the interest rate used in discounting the cash flows.

30.1 Sales revenue in respect of Crude Oil produced from 
nomination blocks is based on pricing formula provided in Crude 
Oil Sales Agreements (COSAs) signed with Buyer refineries. COSAs 
with Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum 
Corporation Limited (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited 
(BPCL), Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL) which were 
valid till March 31, 2018 and have been extended provisionally from 
time to time presently till March 31, 2022. COSA with Mangalore 
Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) has been signed and 
effective from April 01, 2018, is valid for 5 years.  

For Crude Oil produced in North East Region, Sales revenue 
in respect of Crude oil supplied to IOCL is based on the pricing 
formula provided in COSA signed with IOCL effective from April 01, 
2018, is valid for 5 years and to Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) 
is based on pricing formula provided by Ministry of Petroleum and 
Natural Gas (MoP&NG) respectively. 

30.2 Majority of Sales revenue in respect of Natural Gas is 
based on domestic gas price of US$ 1.79/mmbtu and US$  2.90/
mmbtu (on GCV basis) notified by GoI for the period April 01, 
2021 to September 30, 2021 and October 01, 2021 to March 31, 
2022 respectively in terms of “New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing 
Guidelines, 2014”. For consumers in North-East (upto Govt. 
allocation), consumer price is 60% of the domestic gas price and 
the difference between domestic gas price and consumer price is 

paid to the Company through GoI Budget and classified as ‘North-
East Gas Subsidy’.

30.3 LPG produced by the Company is presently being sold as per 
guideline issued by MoP&NG to PSU Oil Marketing Companies 
(OMCs), as per provision of Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) dated March 31, 2002 signed by the Company with OMCs 
which was valid for a period of 2 years or till the same is replaced 
by a bilateral agreement or on its termination.

Value Added Products other than LPG are sold to different 
customers at prices agreed in respective Term sheets / Agreements 
entered into between the parties.

30.4 The Company has assessed the possible impact of continuing 
COVID-19 on the basis of internal and external sources of information 
and expects no significant impact on the continuity of operations, 
useful life of Property Plant and Equipment, recoverability of assets, 
trade receivables etc., and the financial position of the Company on 
a long term basis. 

However, the revenue for the quarter and year ended March 31, 
2021 were impacted by low crude oil and natural gas prices due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic and volatile global crude oil and natural 
gas markets. Accordingly, the same are not comparable with those 
for the year ended March 31, 2022.

Trust. The PRMB fund is managed by Life Insurance Corporation 
of India. Accordingly, the PRMB liability and its plan assets are 
accounted for as per the requirements of Ind AS- 19 “Employee 
Benefits”.

42.5.5 Terminal Benefits 

At the time of superannuation, employees are entitled to settle at a 
place of their choice and they are eligible for Settlement Allowance. 

42.5.6 These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks 
such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary 
risk.

Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan 
liability is calculated using a discount rate which 
is determined by reference to market yields at 
the end of the reporting period on government 
bonds. When there is a deep market for such 
bonds; if the return on plan asset is below 
this rate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently, 
for these plans, investments are made in 
government securities, debt instruments, Short 
term debt instruments, Equity instruments and 
Asset Backed, Trust Structured securities as per 
notification of Ministry of Finance.

Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase 
the plan liability; however, this will be partially 
offset by an increase in the return on the plan’s 
investments.

Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan 
liability is calculated by reference to the best 
estimate of the mortality of plan participants 
both during and after their employment. An 
increase in the life expectancy of the plan 
participants will increase the plan’s liability.

Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan 
liability is calculated by reference to the future 
salaries of plan participants. As such, an 
increase in the salary of the plan participants 
will increase the plan’s liability.

No other post - retirement benefits are provided to these employees.

In respect of the above plans, the most recent actuarial valuation 
of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation were carried out as at March 31, 2022 by a member 
firm of the Institute of Actuaries of India. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and 
past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit 
method.

42.6 Other long term employee benefits

42.6.1 Brief Description: A general description of the type of Other 
long term employee benefits is as follows: 

All the employee benefit plans of the Company are run as 
Group administration plans (Single Employer Scheme) including 
employees of the Company seconded to ONGC Videsh Limited 
(OVL) 100% subsidiary, as well as employees directly appointed 
by OVL.

Further, the company accounts for the employee benefit liability of 
all Defined Benefit plans pertaining to OVL employees in its books 
of account and expenditure for the period is transferred to OVL’s 
books of account. This is done in compliance with the requirement 
for group administrative plan stated in para 38 of Ind AS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’. 

42.6.2 Earned Leave (EL) Benefit

Accrual – 30 days per year

Encashment while in service – 75% of Earned Leave balance 
subject to a maximum of 90 days per calendar year

Leave at their credit, subject to maximum of 90 days.

of every six months. The entire accumulation is permitted for 
encashment only at the time of retirement. DPE had clarified earlier

and Half Pay Leave (HPL) could be considered for encashment on 
retirement subject to the overall limit of 300 days. Consequently, 
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoP&NG), GOI had advised 
the company to comply with the DPE Guidelines. Subsequently, 
the matter has been dealt in 3rd PRC recommendations, which is 
effective January 1, 2017 and CPSEs have been allowed to frame 
their own leave rules considering operational necessities and 
subject to conditions set therein. Therefore, the requisite conditions 
are met by the company.

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely 
that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Sensitivity due to 
mortality & withdrawals are not material & hence impact of change not calculated. 

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation 
liability recognised in the balance sheet.

No funds have been advanced or loaned or invested (either from 
borrowed funds or share premium or any other sources or kind of 
funds) by the Company to or in any other person(s) or entity (ies), 
including foreign entities (“Intermediaries”) with the understanding, 
whether recorded in writing or otherwise, that the Intermediary shall 
lend or invest in party identified by or on behalf of the Company 
(Ultimate Beneficiaries). The Company has not received any fund 
from any party(s) (Funding Party) with the understanding that 
the Company shall whether, directly or indirectly lend or invest in 
other persons or entities identified by or on behalf of the Company 
(“Ultimate Beneficiaries”) or provide any guarantee, security or the 
like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries.”

45.3 Financial risk management objectives 

While ensuring liquidity is sufficient to meet Company’s operational 
requirements, the Company also monitors and manages key 
financial risks relating to the operations of the Company by 
analyzing exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks 
include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk (including currency 
risk and price risk).

During the year, the liquidity position of the Company was 
comfortable. The lines of Credit/short term loan available with 
various banks for meeting the short term working capital/ deficit 
requirements were sufficient for meeting the fund requirements. The 
Company has also an overall limit of ` 100,000 million for raising 
funds through Commercial Paper. Cash flow/ liquidity position is 
reviewed on continuous basis.

45.4 Credit risk management

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, investments 
carried at amortized cost and deposits with banks as well as 
customers including receivables. Credit risk management 
considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking 
information including indicators like external credit rating (as far 
as available), macro-economic information (such as regulatory 
changes, government directives, market interest rate).

Major customers, being public sector oil marketing companies 

(OMCs) and gas companies having highest credit ratings, carry 
negligible credit risk. Concentration of credit risk to any other 
counterparty did not exceed 7.88% (Previous year 5.67%) of total 
monetary assets at any time during the year.

Credit exposure is managed by counterparty limits for investment of 
surplus funds which is reviewed by the Management. Investments 
in liquid plan/schemes are with public sector Asset Management 
Companies having highest rating. For banks, only high rated banks 
are considered for placement of deposits. Bank balances are held 
with reputed and creditworthy banking institutions.

The Company is exposed to default risk in relation to financial 
guarantees given to banks / vendors on behalf of subsidiaries / joint 
venture companies for the estimated amount that would be payable 
to the third party for assuming the obligation. The Company’s 
maximum exposure in this regard on as at March 31, 2022 is  
` 389,094.14 million (As at March 31, 2021 ` 411,769.54 million).

45.5  Liquidity risk management

The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash 
and cash equivalents including bank deposits and availability of 
funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities 
to meet the obligations when due. Management monitors rolling 
forecasts of liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on 
the basis of expected cash flows. In addition, liquidity management 
also involves projecting cash flows considering level of liquid assets 
necessary to meet obligations by matching the maturity profiles of 
financial assets & liabilities and monitoring balance sheet liquidity 
ratios. 

The following tables detail the Company’s remaining contractual 
maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed 
repayment periods. The information included in the tables have 
been drawn up based on the cash flows of financial liabilities 
based on the earliest date on which the Company can be required 
to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. 
The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the 
Company may be required to pay.

45.6 Market Risk

Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market 
price movements and their impact on the future performance of 
a business. The major components of market risk are commodity 
price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.

The primary commodity price risks that the Company is exposed 
to international crude oil and gas prices that could adversely affect 

the value of the Company’s financial assets or expected future 
cash flows. Substantial or extended decline in international prices 
of crude oil and natural gas may have an adverse effect on the 
Company’s reported results.

The management has assessed the possible impact of continuing 
COVID-19 on the basis of internal and external sources of information 
and expects no significant impact on the continuity of operations, 
useful life of Property Plant and Equipment, recoverability of assets, 
trade receivables etc., and the financial position of the Company 
on a long term basis. The Company is constantly carrying out 
macro level analysis and keeping a vigilant eye on global reports & 
analysis being done by global analyst & firms.

45.7 Foreign currency risk management

Sale price of crude oil is denominated in United States dollar (US$) 
though billed and received in Indian Rupees (`). The Company 
is, therefore, exposed to foreign currency risk principally out of  
` appreciating against US$. Foreign currency risks on account 
of receipts / revenue and payments / expenses are managed by 
netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures through export 
earnings, wherever possible and carry unhedged exposures for the 
residual considering the natural hedge available to it from domestic 
sales.

The Company undertakes transactions denominated in different 
foreign currencies and consequently exposed to exchange 
rate fluctuations. Exchange rate exposures are managed within 
approved policy parameters. 

The Company has a Foreign exchange and Interest Risk 
Management Policy (RMP) with objective to ensure that foreign 
exchange exposures on both revenue and balance sheet accounts 
are properly computed, recorded and monitored, risks are limited 
to tolerable levels and an efficient process is created for reporting 
of risk and evaluation of risk management operations.

The primary objective of the RMP is limitation / reduction of 
risk and a Forex Risk Management Committee (FRMC) with 
appropriate authority and structured responsibility are in place for 
the management of foreign exchange risk. The FRMC identifies, 
assesses, monitor and manage / mitigate appropriately within the 
legal and regulatory framework. 

The Company has a Hedging policy so that exposures are identified 
and measured across the Company, accordingly, appropriate 
hedging can be done on net exposure basis. The Company has 
a structured risk management policy to hedge foreign exchange 
risk within acceptable risk limit. Hedging instrument includes 
plain vanilla forward (including plain vanilla swaps) and option 
contract. FRMC decides and take necessary decisions regarding

selection of hedging instruments based on market volatility, 
market conditions, legal framework, global events and other 
macro-economic situations. All the decisions and strategies 
are taken in line and within the approved Foreign exchange and 
Interest Risk Management Policy. Since the company is naturally 
hedged, hedging decisions are triggered in case of a Net Exposure 
exceeds US$ 500 million. During the year, no hedging decision was 

necessitated as net exposure of US$ 500 million was not breached.

The carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency 
denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of 
the reporting period are as under:

45.7.1 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis

The Company is principally exposed to risk against US$. Sensitivity 
of profit or loss arises mainly from US$ denominated receivables 
and payables. 

As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible changes 
in the exchange rate of (+/-) 5% between US$- ` currency pair, 
sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstanding US$ denominated 
monetary items at the period end is presented below:

In Company’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative 
of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the 
end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during 
the year. 

45.7.2 Forward foreign exchange contracts

During the year, the Company has not entered into any forward 
foreign exchange contracts.

45.8 Interest rate risk management

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk because the Company 
has borrowed funds benchmarked to overnight MCLR, Treasury 
Bills, debt (capital) market, Mibor, RBI Repo and US$ LIBOR. The 
Company’s exposure to interest rates are detailed in Note No. 27. 

The Company invests the surplus fund generated from operations in 
term deposits with banks and mutual funds. Bank deposits are made 
for a period of upto 12 months carry interest rate as per prevailing 
market interest rate. Considering these bank deposits are short term 
in nature, there is no significant interest rate risk. Average interest 
earned on term deposit and a mutual fund for the year ended March 
31, 2022 was 3.39% p.a. (Previous year 4.09% p.a.).

45.9 Price risks

The Company’s price risk arises from investments in equity shares 
(other than investment in group companies) held and classified in 
the balance sheet either at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI) or at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

Investment of short-term surplus funds of the Company in liquid 
schemes of mutual funds provides high level of liquidity from a 
portfolio of money market securities and high quality debt and 
categorized as ‘low risk’ product from liquidity and interest rate risk 
perspectives.

The revenue from operations of the company are also subject to 
price risk on account of change in prices of Crude Oil, Natural Gas 
& Value Added Products.

45.9.1 Price sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity of profit or loss in respect of investments in equity 
shares at the end of the reporting period for +/-5% change in price 
and net asset value is presented below:

Other comprehensive income for the year ended March 31, 2022 
would increase / decrease by ` 9,650.05 million (for the year ended 
March 31, 2021 would increase / decrease by ` 7,618.68 million) as 
a result of 5% changes in fair value of equity investments measured 
at FVTOCI.

46.1.3 In respect of 1 Pre NELP block (Previous year 1) which has 
expired as at March 31, 2022, the Company’s share of Unfinished 
Minimum Work Programme (MWP) amounting to ` 493.81 million 
(previous year ` 493.81 million) has not been provided for since 
the Company has already applied for further extension of period 
in these blocks as ‘excusable delay’/ special dispensations citing 
technical complexities, within the extension policy of NELP Blocks, 
which are under active consideration of GoI. The delays have 
occurred generally on account of pending statutory clearances 
from various Govt. authorities like Ministry of Defence, Ministry 
of Commerce & Industry, environmental clearances, State Govt. 
permissions etc. The MWP amount of ` 493.81 million (previous 
year ` 493.81 million) is included in MWP commitment under note 
no. 48.2.2 (i).

As per the Production Sharing Contracts signed by the Company 
with the GoI, the Company is required to complete Minimum 
Work Programme (MWP) within stipulated time. In case of delay 
in completion of the MWP, Liquidated Damages (LD) are payable 
for extension of time to complete MWP. Further, in case the 
Company does not complete MWP or surrender the block without 
completing the MWP, the estimated cost of completing balance 
work programme is required to be paid to the GoI. LD amounting to 
` 5.47 million [Previous year ` 100.09 million (net of reversal)] and 
cost of unfinished MWP amounting to Nil [Previous year ` 996.96 
million (net of reversal)], paid/payable to the GoI is included in 
survey and wells written off expenditure respectively.

46.1.4 Government of India has approved the relinquishment of 30% 
Participating Interest (PI) of ONGC in SGL Field with future interest 
in block RJ-ON/6 in Jaisalmer Basin Rajasthan and assignment of 
PI to Focus Energy Limited (Operator) and other JV partners on 
the condition that Focus Energy Limited (Operator) will pay towards 
100 % past royalty obligation, PEL/ML fees, other statutory levies 
(total amount  ` 2,290.22 million as on March 31, 2022) and waive 
off development/production cost payable by the Company in SGL 
Field of the block as well as take all future 100% royalty obligation 
of the Company as licensee. The process of entering into Farm-
out Agreement and amendment in Production Sharing Contract 

(PSC) is under progress. Pending the execution of agreements, no 
adjustment is made in the accounts in respect of relinquishment of 
block RJ-ON/6.

46.1.5 The Company is having 30% Participating interest in Block 
RJ-ON-90/1 along with Vedanta Limited (erstwhile Cairn India 
Limited)  (Operator) and Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited. There 
are certain unresolved issues including cost recovery and sharing 
in respect of exploration, development and production cost in the 
Block between the Company and Operator of the Block amounting 
to tentatively US$ 1,257.11 million (equivalent to ̀  95,225.95 million) 
as on March 31, 2021. The amount under dispute related to cost 
recovery and sharing for FY 2021-22 is yet to be finalized. 

The Company, as Government nominee under Article 13.2 is liable 
to contribute its share as per the PI, only for the development & 
production operations, and is not liable to share Exploration Cost.  
However, any recovery of exploration expenditure by Operator will 
impact on the share of Cost Oil/Gas available to ONGC. The Operator 
already took recovery of Exploration expenditure of US$ 388.37 
Million (incurred upto Exploration Phase), hence the Company’s 
liability upto Exploration phase is NIL. Further, the Operator has also 
claimed exploration cost (beyond exploration phase of PSC) of US$ 
167.08 million (equivalent to ` 12,656.35 million) being 30% of US$ 
556.93 million (equivalent to `42,187.82 million) from the Company 
upto FY 2020-21 (Previous year US$ 147.11 million and equivalent 
`10,810.91 million) from the Company, which in view of Company is 
not tenable. The Company has shown a sum of US$ 167.08 million 
(equivalent to ` 12,656.35 million) under Contingent Liabilities, as 
the issues are presently under Arbitration proceedings. 

Pending settlement of issues, an amount of US$ 134.49 million 
(equivalent to ` 10,187.80 million), which is 30% of US$ 448.31 
Million pertaining to development and production cost have been 
accounted for as per the participating interest of the Company. 

Royalty on production is being paid by the Company as licensee 
and the share of JV Partners of Royalty is recoverable through 
revenue from Sale of Crude Oil and Gas as per PSC.  Accordingly, 
an amount of ` 15,376.03 million outstanding from JV Partners has 
been included in the revenue upto March 31, 2022.

EXPLORING hidden depths

         ACHIEVING glorious heights

46.1.6 The primary period of twenty five years of the Production 
Sharing Contract (PSC) of the Block RJ-ON-90/1 expired on May 
14, 2020. The Contractors in the Block had applied for extension 
of the PSC for a period of 10 years, which was approved by 
Government in October 2018 under the pre-NELP Extension Policy 
as per notification dated April 7, 2017, subject to certain conditions. 
One of the conditions for extension, stipulated by Government 
relates to notification of certain audit exceptions raised for FY 2016-
17 as per PSC provisions and requires payment of Additional Profit 
Petroleum, in case these exceptions are accepted by Contractors. 
In connection with these audit exceptions, US$ 156.03 million  
(` 11,819.25 million) relating to the share of Company out of total 
US$ 520.10 million (`39,397.52 million) has been raised by DGH 
on May 12, 2020. Subsequently in December 2020, the amount of 
demand has been increased to US$ 654.83 million (Companies 
share US$ 196.45 million), based on audit exceptions for FY 2017-
18. The other Partners in the JV have disputed the demand with a 
Notice of Arbitration dated May 14, 2020 against the Government. 
The Company is not a Party to the Arbitration against Government 
and will pay the amount, once liability, if any, arises out of the Audit 
Exceptions is finalized for the Contractors. The Company share of 
US$ 196.45 million (`14,881.01 million) in the Audit Exceptions has 
already been shown under Contingent liabilities.

As all the conditions required for extension of PSC could not be 
complied with and the Addendum for extension of the PSC could 
not be signed by the Contractors and Government on or before May 
14, 2020, Government has allowed the Contractors to continue the 
Petroleum operations for a period of three months or signing of PSC 
amendment, whichever is earlier. The Government subsequently 
extended the period of Petroleum Operations from time to time and 
currently it is extended upto August 14, 2022.  It is expected that 
Govt. will further extend this period further and the Addendum for 
extension of the PSC will be signed by all Parties. Accordingly, the 
accounts of the Company’s share in the Block for FY 2021-22 has 
been prepared on a ‘going concern’ basis.

46.1.7 In respect of Jharia CBM Block, revised Feasibility Report 
(FR) has been approved in the 27th Steering Committee (SC) held 
on September 9, 2019. In light of better techno-economics, the 
Company has decided to implement the revised FR as phases 
in the light of overlap issue with Bharat Coking Coal Limited and 
early implementation and monetization. Therefore, Parbatpur and 
adjoining area was taken up in Phase-I under the approved FR and 
accordingly, implementation strategy for Stage-I has been approved 
by the Company on November 21, 2019 and 36th Operating 
Committee (OC) meeting for Jharia CBM Block held on December 
10, 2019. The same was communicated to the Partner, Coal India 
Limited (CIL) and was approved by the Board of Directors of CIL in 
its meeting held on January 10, 2020. As per Performa provided by 
DGH, all the formalities for enhancement of participating interest 
(PI) from 10% of CIL to 26% have been completed by both the 
Company (Assignor) and CIL (Assignee) and the signed documents 
were submitted to DGH for the approval of GoI on January 27, 
2020. However, GoI, on the basis of the application and supporting 
documents has granted enhancement of PI of CIL from 10% to 26% 
w.e.f January 25, 2021. This has been contested by the Company 
as the provision and timing of exercising the option of enhancing 
PI from 10% to 26% is very clearly defined in the JOA i.e. the option 
shall be exercised by CIL before the start of Development Phase. 
Accordingly, DGH and MoPNG has been requested to consider 
April 23, 2013 as the date of commencement of PI enhancement, 
as delay in PI enhancement is primarily due to late submission of 
requisite documents by CIL.  Considering the provisions of JOA 
and approval of Steering Committee, the cash calls amounting to 
` 707.95 million from CIL have been continued to be recognized at 
26% w.e.f. April 23, 2013 (which is the start date of development 

phase activity) upto January 24, 2021 as against ` 272.29 million of 
cash calls at the rate of 10% PI up to January 24, 2021.

46.1.8 In respect of Raniganj (N) CBM Block, the Feasibility Report 
(FR) is under process exploring different variants to optimize the 
cost. Work Program and Budget for RE 2021-22, BE 2022-23 
have been approved by the Operating Committee. The issue of 
connectivity of proposed locations in Raniganj with Urja Ganga 
Pipeline is being discussed with GAIL (India) Limited, Kolkata. 
Government of West Bengal has granted PML for 311.79 Sq. km 
including the BAPL overlap area on February 10, 2020 w.e.f. June 9, 
2019. Pending final decision on the Block, an impairment provision 
of ` 617.36 million has been provided in the books.

46.1.9 During the year 2017-18 the Company had acquired the 
entire 80% Participating Interest (PI) of Gujarat State Petroleum 
Corporation Limited (GSPC) along with operatorship rights, at 
a purchase consideration of US$ 995.26 million (equivalent to  
` 62,950.20 million) for Deen Dayal West (DDW) Field in the Block 
KG-OSN-2001/3. The revised PI in the block after above acquisition 
stands for the Company 80%, GSPC 10% and Jubilant Offshore 
Drilling Private Limited (JODPL) 10%.A farm-in Farm-out agreement 
(FIFO) was signed with GSPC on March 10, 2017 and the said 
consideration has been paid on August 04, 2017 being the closing 
date. In the current year 2021-22, accounting for the final closing 
adjustment (i.e., working capital and other adjustments) to sale 
consideration viz. transactions from the economic date up to 
the closing date has been provisionally carried out and a sum of  
` 946.71 million is net payable to GSPC as final settlement and the 
same is under deliberation. As per FIFO, the Company is entitled 
to receive sums as adjustments to the consideration already paid 
based on the actual gas production and the differential in agreed 
gas price. Pending executing mother wells and estimating future 
production, the contingent adjustment to consideration remains to 
be quantified. The Company has also paid part consideration of 
US$ 200 million (equivalent to ̀ 12,650.00 million) for six discoveries 
other than DDW Field in the Block KG-OSN-2001/3 to GSPC 
towards acquisition rights for these discoveries in the Block KG-
OSN-2001/3 to be adjusted against the valuation of such fields 
based on valuation parameters agreed between GSPC and the 
Company.

The JV partner JODPL is under liquidation since December 2017 
and has defaulted all the cash calls since acquisition of the block 
by the Company. The amount of outstanding cash call from JODPL 
as at March 31, 2022 is ` 1624.86 million (Previous year: ` 1,368.26 
million). The assignment of JODPL’s 10% PI in accordance with 
provisions of Production sharing Contract (PSC) is pending with 
Management Committee (MC).  As per provision of the Joint 
Operating Agreement (JOA), the receivable amount of ` 1,624.86 
million (Previous year: ` 1,368.26 million) after the acquisition of 
block is required to be contributed by the non-defaulting JV Partner 
in their ratio of participating interest. Pending decision of assignment 
of JODPL’s PI by MC a provision for an amount of ̀  1,444.32 million 
(Previous year: ` 1,216.23 million) has been made against the said 
cash call receivables from JODPL, being the company’s share as 
per PI ratio.

46.1.10 In case of Joint Venture Block CB-ONN-2004/3, the 
discovery well Uber#2 ceased to flow from June 23, 2020. ONGC 
in consultation with JV partner M/s GSPC has initiated a proposal 
for examination / surrendering the NELP block CB-ONN-2004/3 
and relinquishment of the development area of 10.78 sq. km. 
The Management Committee (MC) in March 2021 had advised 
that action plan be drawn up to revive the field, which can include 
drilling a new development well in a better part of the reservoir, so 
that fairly good quantity of gas, as approved in the FDP, is achieved 
at the earliest. Pending assessment of the same, an impairment 
loss of ` 370.95 million has been provided in the books.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

46.1.11 The designated currency, for the purpose of cost recovery 
under the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) is US$. Thus, the 
expenditure incurred in Indian Rupees (`) needs to be converted in 
US$ for the preparation of cost recovery statements. The Company 
has already submitted the draft Management Committee agendas 
for the corresponding blocks for adoption of State Bank of India 
(SBI) reference rate in place of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reference 
rate for preparation of cost recovery statements. 

The management committee (MC) of the block named VN-
ONN-2009/3 has recommended to the Government for approval 
of SBI reference rate in lieu of RBI reference rate for the conversion 
purpose between US$ and ` in modification of provision laid down 
under the PSC. The MC also recommended that the same may 
be extended to other similarly placed PSCs of the operator. MC 
further recommended that the above dispensation to opt for SBI 
exchange rate may be made available as one time measure also 
to other operators, should they opt to do so, provided they have 
adopted SBI exchange rate at the corporate level. 

Subsequently, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) which 
is PSC monitoring arm of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural 
Gas (MoPNG), Government of India, submitted the proposal for the 
approval of MoPNG for adoption of SBI reference rate in lieu of RBI 
reference rate for the block VN-ONN-2009/3 in May 2020 which is 
at present pending with MoPNG. 

The Company is following the SBI reference exchange rates on 
consistent basis for maintenance of accounts as the main banker 
of the Company is State Bank of India, and there is no impact on 
the Company financial statements due to adoption of SBI exchange 
rate, as the transactions of foreign currency in the Company are 
recorded at actual cost basis and foreign currency liabilities & 
assets at period end are also recognised as per SBI reference 
rate. The financial implication for adoption of SBI reference rate 
preparation of cost recovery statements with DGH, as against the 
RBI reference rate is immaterial.

47. Disclosure under Indian Accounting Standard 36 – Impairment of 
Assets

47.1 The Company is engaged mainly in the business of oil and 
gas exploration and production in Onshore and Offshore. In case 
of onshore, the fields are using common production/transportation 
facilities and are sufficiently economically interdependent to 
constitute a cash generating unit (CGU). Accordingly, impairment 
test of all onshore fields is performed in aggregate at the Asset 
Level. In case of Offshore, a field is generally considered as 
CGU except for fields which are developed as a Cluster or group 
of Clusters, for which common facilities are used, in which case 
the impairment testing is performed in aggregate for all the fields 
included in the cluster or group of Clusters.

47.2 The Value in Use of producing/developing CGUs is determined 
under a multi-stage approach, wherein future cash flows are initially 
estimated based on Proved Developed Reserves. Under the 
circumstances where further development of the fields in the CGUs 
are under progress and where the carrying value of the CGUs is 

not likely to be recovered through exploitation of proved developed 
reserves alone, the Proved and probable reserves (2P) of the CGUs 
are taken for the purpose of estimating future cash flows. In such 
cases, full estimate of the expected cost of future development is 
also considered while determining the value in use.

47.3 In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows from 
the continuing use of assets and from its disposal at the end of its 
useful life are discounted to their present value. The present value 
of cash flows has been determined by applying discount rates of 
14.74% (as at March 31, 2021: 14.29%) for Rupee transactions 
and 10.10% (as at March 31, 2021: 9.60%) for crude oil, natural 
gas and value added products revenue, which are measured in 
US$. Future cash inflows from sale of crude oil, natural gas and 
value added products have been computed using Management’s 
estimate of future crude oil, natural gas and value added products 
price, discounted applying the rate applicable to the cash flows 
measured in US$.

47.4 The Company has considered the prevailing business 
conditions to make an assessment of future crude oil and natural 
gas prices based on internal and external information / indicators 
of future economic conditions. Based on the assessment, the 
Company has recorded a net impairment reversal to the extent the 
value in use exceeds the carrying amount subject to accumulated 
impairment provision, amounting to  ` 11,904.07 million (Previous 
year: ` 11,135.08 million), this consist of net impairment reversal at 
Onshore CGUs amounting to  ` 14,746.95 million (Previous year: 
` 22,117.06 million) and net impairment loss at Offshore CGUs 
amounting to  ̀  2,842.88 million (Previous year  ̀  10,981.98 million). 

47.5 The following 2P reserves for respective CGU were considered 
as a basis for the impairment testing as at March 31, 2022:

Name of the CGU
Quantity of Reserves used for 
Impairment Assessment (In

Rajasthan Exploratory Asset 0.10

47.6 Impairment testing of assets under exploratory phase 
(Exploratory wells in progress) has been carried out as on March 
31, 2022 and a net impairment loss of  ` 20,830.40 million (Previous 
year:  ` 3,772.15 million) has been provided during the year (Note 
No. 10).

a. The Company’s pending litigations comprise claims against 
the Company and proceedings pending with Tax / Statutory/ 
Government Authorities. After review of all its pending litigations 
and proceedings, the Company has made adequate provisions, 
wherever required and disclosed the contingent liabilities, wherever 
applicable, in its financial statements. The Company does not 
expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material 
impact on its financial position. Future cash outflows in respect of 
the above are determinable only on receipt of judgments/ decisions 
pending with various forums/ authorities.

b. The Company had received demand orders from Service Tax 
Department at various work centres on account of Service Tax on 
Royalty in respect of Crude oil and Natural gas. Appeals against 
such orders have been filed before the Tribunals. The Ahmedabad 
Tribunal adjourned the matter sine-die vide order dated June 25, 
2019, against which the Company has filed writ petition before 
Gujarat High Court. In this matter, Hon’ble Gujarat High Court in the 
hearing held on 04.01.2021 directed the revenue authorities to file 
counter affidavit by 21.01.2021. The Central Government has filed 
counter affidavit on 20.01.2021. The next date of hearing before 

Hon’ble Gujarat High court is not scheduled as yet. The Company 
had also obtained legal opinion as per which the Service Tax/GST 
on Royalty in respect of Crude oil and Natural gas is not applicable. 
Meanwhile, the Company also received demand order dated 
January 01, 2019 on account of GST on Royalty in the State of 
Rajasthan against which the Company filed writ petition (4919/2019) 
before Hon’ble High Court of Rajasthan. The Hon’ble High Court of 
Rajasthan heard the matter on April 3, 2019 and issued notice to 
Department with a direction that no coercive action shall be taken 
against the Company. The final hearing has not yet taken place. The 
Company also filed writ of mandamus (9961/2019) before Hon’ble 
High Court of Madras seeking stay on the levy of GST on royalty. The 
Hon’ble High Court of Madras heard the matter on April 3, 2019 and 
issued notice to Central Government and State Government. The 
Central Government has filed their counter affidavit on August 26, 
2019. The Company has filed additional grounds to the writ petition 
and filed rejoinder to the counter of the Central Government before 
Hon. Madras High Court on January 24, 2020. The final hearing has

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

The total estimated amount (including penalty and interest up to 
March 31, 2022) works out towards Service Tax is ` 40,172.56 
million (upto March 31, 2021: ` 39,604.84 million) and GST is  
` 102,731.94 million (upto March 31, 2021: ` 77,173.72 million). 
Since the Company is contesting the matter, it has been considered 
as contingent liability. Further, as an abundant caution, the 
Company has deposited Service Tax and GST along-with interest 
under-protest amounting to ` 13,524.39 million (upto March 31, 
2021: ` 13,524.39 million) and ` 74,043.48 million (upto March 31, 
2021: ` 56,777.04 million) respectively.

c. There are certain unresolved issues including cost recovery and 
sharing in respect of exploration, development and production 
cost in the Block between the Company and Operator - Vedanta 
Limited (erstwhile Cairn India Limited) of the Block RJ-ON-90/1. 
Pending settlement of issues, the company has shown an amount 
of US$ 167.08 million - equivalent to ` 12,656.35 million (Previous 
year: US$ 147.11 million – equivalent to ` 10,810.91 million) under 
contingent liability as on March 31, 2022. For further details, please 
refer Note No. 46.1.5.

d. The Company, with 40% Participating Interest (PI), was a Joint 
Operator in Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti Fields along 
with Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and BG Exploration and 
Production India Limited (BGEPIL) each having 30% PI, (all three 
together referred to as “Contractors”) signed two Production 
sharing Contracts (PSCs) with Government of India (Union of India) 
on December 22, 1994 for a period of 25 years. The PSCs for Panna 
Mukta and Mid & South Tapti have expired on December 21, 2019. 
In terms of the Panna Mukta Field Asset Handover Agreement, the 
Contractors of PMT JV are liable for the pre-existing liability.

In December 2010, RIL & BGEPIL (JV Partners) invoked an 
international arbitration proceeding against the Union of India in 
respect of certain disputes, differences and claims arising out of 
and in connection with both the PSCs .The Ministry of Petroleum 
and Natural Gas (MoP&NG), vide their letter dated July 4, 2011, had 
directed the Company not to participate in the Arbitration initiated 
by the JV Partners (BGEPIL & RIL). MoP&NG has also stated that 
the Arbitral Award would be applicable to the Company also as a 
constituent of the Contractor for both the PSCs.

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), vide letters dated 
May 25, 2017 had informed the Company that on October 12, 
2016, a Final Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced by the Tribunal 
in the said arbitrations. As informed by BGEPIL additionally Audit 
Award on January 11, 2018, Agreement Case Award on October 
1, 2018 and Jurisdictional Award on March 12, 2019 wherein the 
principles relating to the aforesaid disputes were pronounced. 
However, the details of proceedings of the FPA and other Orders 
are not available with the Company. DGH, vide their letter dated 
May 25, 2017 and June 4, 2018, marked to the Contractors, had 
directed the payment of differential Government of India share of 
Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be payable by Contractors 
pursuant to Governments interpretation of the FPA (40% share of 
the Company amounting to US$ 1,624.05 million, including interest 
upto November 30, 2016) equivalent to  ` 123,021.60  million @  
` 75.75 i.e. closing rate as on March 31,2022 (March 31, 2021:  
` 119,351.43 million). In response to the letters of DGH, the JV 
partners (with a copy marked to all Joint Venture Partners) had stated 
that demand of DGH was premature as the FPA did not make any 
money award in favour of Government of India, since quantification 
of liabilities were to be determined during the final proceedings of 
the arbitration. Further the award had also been challenged before 
the English Commercial Court (London High Court). Based on 
the above facts, the Company had also responded to the letters 
of DGH stating that pending finality of the order, the amount due 
and payable by the Company was not quantifiable.  In view of the 
Company, if any changes are approved for increase in the Cost 
Recovery Limit (CRL) by the Arbitral Tribunal as per the terms of the 
PSCs the liability to DGH would potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final verdict on May 2, 2018 
following which the Arbitral Tribunal re-considered some of its earlier 
findings from the 2016 FPA (Revised Award).The Government of 
India and JV Partners have challenged parts of the Revised Award 
before English Court. On February 12, 2020, the English Court 

passed a verdict favoring the challenges made by BGEPIL and RIL 
and also remitted the matter in the Revised Award back to Arbitral 
Tribunal for reconsideration. Based on the information shared by 
BGEPIL in January 2021, the Tribunal issued a verdict favoring 
BGEPIL/RIL on the remitted matter, which has been challenged by 
the GOI before the English Court. 

Based on the information shared by one of the JV partners in the 
earlier periods, The GOI has also filed an execution petition before 
the Hon’ble Delhi High Court seeking enforcement and execution 
of the October 12, 2016 FPA. BGEIPL / RIL contend that GOI’s 
execution petition is not maintainable and have opposed the reliefs 
sought by the GOI under the said petition. The matter is pending 
before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court and no final orders on the 
reliefs sought by the GOI have been passed so far. In January 2018, 
the Company along with the JV partners has filed an application 
with MC for increase in CRL in terms of the PSCs.

The application has been rejected by MC. Pursuant to the rejection, 
the JV partners have filed a claim with Arbitral Tribunal. One of the 
JV partners has further informed the Company that the hearing 
before the Arbitral Tribunal has been partially heard in the quarter. 
Further the additional hearing are scheduled to be heard in the 
Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of the year 2022. 

DGH vide letter dated January 14, 2019 has advised the 
contractors to re-cast the accounts for Panna-Mukta and Mid and 
South Tapti Fields for the year 2017-18. Pending finalization of the 
decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, the JV partners and the Company 
had indicated in their letters to DGH that the final recasting of the 
accounts was premature and thus the issues raised by DGH may 
be kept in abeyance.

During the financial year 2010-11, the Oil Marketing Companies, 
nominees of the Government of India (GoI) recovered US$ 80.18 
million (Share of the Company US$ 32.07 million (equivalent to 
` 2,429.30 million)) as per directives of GoI in respect of Joint 
Operation - Panna Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts 
(PSCs). The recovery is towards certain observations raised by 
auditors appointed by the Director General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) 
under the two PSCs for the period 2002-03 to 2005-06 in respect of 
cost and profit petroleum share payable to GoI

Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal on various issues raised 
above, re-casting of the financial statements and final quantification 
of liabilities, no provision has been accounted in the financial 
statements. The demand raised by DGH, amounting to US$ 
1,624.05 million equivalent to ` 123,021.60 million@ ` 75.75 i.e. 
closing rate as on 31.03.2022 (March 31, 2021: ` 119,351.43 
million) has been considered as contingent liability. 

The Company’s share of US$ 32.07 Million ` 2,429.30 Million @  
` 75.75 i.e. closing rate as on 31.03.2022 (March 31, 2021:  
` 2,356.82 Million) recovered by Government of India has been 
disclosed under Note No.15 in the financial statements. 

e. The Company is operating Petroleum Mining Leases (PML) 
granted by the State Government (s) after initial clearance from the 
Government of India (GoI). The grant of oil mining lease is regulated 
and governed by the provisions of the Oilfields [Regulation 
and Development] Act 1948 (ORD Act). Once the lease order is 
granted, the lessee has to execute lease deeds with the respective 
State Government. The stamp duty on the executed lease deed 
is payable as per the Stamp Act of the respective States. Certain 
State Governments are of the view to include the amount of Royalty 
apart from other payments like Security Deposit, surface rent and 
dead rent etc. for the purpose of calculation of stamp duty under 
the Stamp Duty Act (s) applicable for such States.

However, the company is of the view that the royalty payable by the 
Company is not a rent to the State Government(s) but is payable 
under Rule 14 of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 1959 
(PNG Rules).  There is a distinction between the concept of rent 
and royalty. The word “royalty” signifies in mining lease that part 
of reddendum which is variable and depends upon the quantity of 
minerals gotten or the mineral worked out within a specified period. 
Whereas rent is the amount payable for use and occupation of 
land.  Hence, it could be reasonably assumed that for the purpose

         ACHIEVING glorious heights

of calculation of stamp duty, amount of royalty would not form part 
of the consideration value of lease deeds to be executed for PML 
granted. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of 
India communicated to the State Government of Tamil Nadu vide 
letter dated December, 31, 2014, that royalty should not be taken 
as a basis for fixation of Stamp Duty to the mining leases granted 
under the ORD Act read with PNG Rules.

The Solicitor General of India, through his opinion dated May 05, 
2007, had also opined that the distinction between royalty and 
rent is well settled. Rent would be payable regardless of whether 
the property is worked upon or not. On the other hand, royalty is 
a variable figure. It would depend upon the quantity of mineral 
obtained. If the mine is not worked upon, rent would nevertheless 
be payable. Hence, he opined that inclusion of royalty for the 
purpose of calculation of stamp duty is unjustified and not tenable. 
In absence of clarity on the issue the amount of firm liability or 
contingent liability is unascertainable.

48.1.2 A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from 
past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not wholly within the control of the entity. During the normal 
course of business, several unresolved claims are currently 
outstanding. The inflow of economic benefits, in respect of such 
claims cannot be measured due to uncertainties that surround the 
related events and circumstances.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 

To the Members of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited Report on 
the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  

1. Opinion 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (“the Holding 
Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its 
subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), joint ventures 
and associates, which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
as at March 31, 2022, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of 
Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to 
as “the consolidated  financial statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of 
reports of other auditors on separate financial statements and on 
the other financial information of the subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give 
the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity 
with the Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 
of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind AS”) and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of 
affairs of the Group, its joint ventures and associates as at March 
31, 2022 and its consolidated profit (including other comprehensive 
income), consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash 
flows for the year then ended.

2. Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of 
our report. We are independent of the Group, its joint ventures 
and associates in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act 
and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained, and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors 
in terms of their reports referred into Para 5 of the Other Matters 
paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

3. Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to the following matters in the notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, including the matters reported 
by the component auditors as per the requirement of Standard 
on Auditing (SA 600) on ‘Using the work of Another Auditor’, 
considering materiality:

i. Note No. 13.2, which explains that certain exploratory fields have 
been identified by DGH, MoPNG, GOI for bidding under DSF III, after 
considering the value of such fields as ‘Nil’. As these fields need 
to be handed over to the successful bidders, pending finalization 
of mechanism of recovery of carrying cost of these fields, an 

impairment provision of ` 12,549.06 million has been made during 
the year towards carrying value of the land and exploratory wells in 
these fields.

ii. Note No. 46.3, which states that pursuant to Section 115BAA 
of the Income Tax Act, 1961, during the current year, the Holding 
Company has decided to avail the option of lower tax rate with 
effect from the financial year 2020-21. Accordingly, the Holding 
Company has recognised provision for tax expenses in the financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 and re-measured its 
net Deferred Tax liabilities on the basis of the provision prescribed in 
the said section. The net impact due to availing the said option has 
resulted in decrease in deferred tax by ` 90,555.15 million (of which 
` (-) 1,382.25 million has been accounted in Other Comprehensive 
Income) and decrease in current tax by ` 28,019.77 million 
(including ` 1,639.72 million relating to earlier years). 

iii. Note No. 58.1.4, wherein it is stated that Directorate General of 
Hydrocarbons (DGH) had raised a demand on all the JV partners 
under the Production Sharing Contract with respect to Panna-
Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas (PMT JV), being BG 
Exploration and Production India Limited (BGEPIL) and Reliance 
Industries Limited (RIL) (together “the Claimants”) and the Holding 
Company (all three together referred to as “Contractors”), towards 
differential GOI share of Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be 
payable by contractors pursuant to Government’s interpretation 
of the Final Partial Award of Arbitral Tribunal (40% share of the 
Company amounting to USD 1,624.05 million equivalent to 
`123,022 million, including interest upto 30th November, 2016). 
Subsequent to Tribunal Orders dated October 12, 2016, DGH vide 
letter dated May 25, 2017, June 4, 2018 and January 14, 2019 had 
asked contractor for re-casting of accounts of the PMT JV and for 
remitting the respective PI share of balance dues including interest 
till the date of remittance. As the Holding Company is not a party 
to the arbitration, the details of the proceedings of arbitration and 
copy of the order of London High Court are not available with 
the Holding Company. The Holding Company has responded 
that The English high Court has delivered its final verdict on May 
2, 2018 following which the Arbitral Tribunal re-considered some 
of its earlier findings from the 2016 FPA (Revised Award); The 
Government of India and JV Partners have challenged parts of the 
Revised Award before English court. On February 12, 2020, the 
English Court passed a verdict favouring the challenges made by 
BGEPIL and RIL and also remitted the matter in the Revised Award 
back to Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. In January 2021, the 
Tribunal issued a verdict favouring BGEPIL/RIL on the remitted 
matter, which has been challenged by the GOI before the English 
Court. Pending finalization of the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, 
the Holding Company has indicated in their letters to DGH that the 
final recasting of the accounts is premature and the issues raised 
by DGH may be kept in abeyance and therefore no provision for the 
same has been considered necessary and has been considered as 
contingent liability. 

iv. Note No. 58.1.2, with respect to ongoing disputes/demands 
raised on various work centres of the Holding Company under 
Service Tax (ST) and Goods & Service Tax (GST) in respect of ST 
and GST on Royalty levied on Crude Oil and Natural Gas. Based on 
the legal opinion, the Holding Company has disputed such levies 
and contesting the same at various forums. The estimated amounts 
under disputes as worked out towards ST and GST (including 
interest and penalty upto March 31, 2022) of ̀  40,172.56 million and 
` 102,731.94 million respectively (Total ` 142,904.50 million), has 
been considered as contingent liability. As a measure of abundant 
caution, the Holding Company has deposited ST and GST along 
with interest under protest amounting to ` 13,524.39 million and 
 ` 74,043.48 million respectively (Total ` 87,567.87 million).

v. Note No. 49.1.1 which states that, with regard  to amalgamation 
of erstwhile subsidiary company of Mangalore Refinery 
and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) i.e. ONGC  Mangalore 
Petrochemicals  Limited (OMPL) with MRPL,  as   Human   
Resources  (HR)  integration  with   respect   to amalgamation  is   in  
progress,  the   Employee   Benefits  Expenses including Actuarial  
Valuation  in this regards have  been  considered separately  for 
both companies and possible impact of the changes  on account 
of Human Resources integration  could not be quantified and 
disclosed at this juncture.

vi. Note No. 33.5 which states that pursuant to the scheme  of 
Amalgamation  of erstwhile subsidiary company ONGC Mangalore 
Petrochemicals  Limited (OMPL)(‘Amalgamating  Company’)   
into   and   with   MRPL (‘Amalgamated Company’), the unused 
tax losses and  unused tax credits of the  amalgamating company  
becomes   unused  tax  losses and  unused  tax credits  of  the  
amalgamated company for  the  financial  year  2021-22 and hence 
MRPL has reassessed and recognised the Deferred Tax Assets 
on such unused tax losses and unused tax credits based on the 
probability of earning sufficient taxable profits in the future years in 
line with Ind As 12 – Income taxes. Accordingly, this has resulted in 
increase in the Deferred Tax Assets by ` 14,554.27 million for the 
year ended March 31, 2022. 

vii. Note No. 15.6 of Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statement 
regarding receivables from Government of Sudan amounting to ` 
29,164.39 million have been assessed for lifetime expected credit 
loss, an impairment loss of ` 933.46 million has been provided 
during the year. The total accumulated provision against these 

receivables stands at ` 4,399.38 million. There is a significant 
estimation uncertainty and future events can have a significant 
impact on the recoverability of the receivables.

viii. Note No. 5 of the Consolidated Ind AS financial statement 
regarding the management’s estimation/view and its impact on 
current and future performance of the group due to sanction and 
Russia & Ukraine war. 

Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements is not 
modified in respect of these matters.

4.  Key Audit Matters 

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 
2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters. For each matter below, description of how the matter 
was addressed in our audit is provided in that context. We have 
determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters 
to be communicated in our report. Considering the requirement 
of Standard on Auditing (SA 600) on ‘Using the work of Another 
Auditor’ including materiality, below Key Audit Matters have been 
reproduced from the Independent Auditors’ report on the audit of 
Standalone Financial Statements of the Holding Company and its

A.  Key Audit Matters for Holding Company

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the matter

Evaluation of adequacy of provision for impairment for tangible and 
intangible assets (Refer Note 57 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)

Management has assessed whether any provision needs to be 
recognised on account of impairment of tangible and intangible 
assets. 

The Holding Company reviews the carrying amount of its tangible 
and intangible assets (Oil and Gas Assets including Capital Work-
in-Progress (CWIP) & Development Wells in Progress (DWIP), 
Other Property, Plant & Equipment (including Capital Works-in-
Progress, Right of Use Assets) for the “Cash Generating Unit” 
(CGU) determined at the end of each reporting period to assess 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered any 
impairment loss. 

Oil and Gas price assumptions have a significant impact on CGU 
impairment assessments and are inherently uncertain. Furthermore, 
oil and gas prices are subject to increased uncertainty, given 
regulatory guidelines including notified gas prices, climate change 
and the global energy transition. 

The management’s assumptions for prices of oil and gas in future 
are highly judgemental and may not be reflective of above factors, 
leading to a risk of material misstatement. 

Given the long timeframes involved, certain recoverable amounts 
of assets are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Since the 
determination of appropriate discount rate is judgemental, there is 
a risk that discount rates may not reflect the return required by the 
market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted, 
which may lead to a material misstatement. 

A key input to impairment assessments and valuations is the 
production forecast, in turn closely related to the Company’s 
reserves estimates, production profile and field development 
assumptions with reference to Oil and Gas. 

The determination of recoverable amount, being the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value- in use is based on the factors 
as discussed above, necessitating judgement on the part of 
management.

In case of exploration and evaluation assets, based on management’s 
judgement, assessment for impairment is carried out when further 
exploration activities are not planned in near future or when sufficient 
data indicate that although a development is likely to proceed, the 
carrying amount of the exploration asset is unlikely to be recovered 
in full from successful development or by sale. Based on the above 
factors, we have considered the measurement of Impairment as Key 
Audit Matter.

Our audit procedures included the following: 

We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s identification 
of the CGUs and exploration and evaluation assets and tested the 
operating effectiveness of controls over the impairment assessment 
process, including indicators of impairment. 

We reviewed the reasonableness of the judgments and decisions 
made by the management regarding assumptions (including the 
relevant regulatory guidelines) for Oil and Gas prices in future to 
identify whether there are indicators of possible management bias 
and accordingly relied upon the management’s assumptions for Oil 
and Gas prices in future. 

We reviewed the appropriateness of discount rates used in the 
estimation. 

We relied on the technical assessment of the Management with 
regard to the Reserves and the Production profile of Oil and Gas, as 
shown to us by the management. 

We performed testing of the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow 
models and checked the appropriateness of the related disclosures. 
We evaluated management’s assessment and related calculations 
of impairment including comparison of the recoverable amount with 
the carrying amounts of respective CGUs in the books of accounts. 

We perused the future plans related to exploration activities. Further, 
we have relied upon management’s assessment that the Mining 
Lease (ML)/ Petroleum Mining Lease (PML) shall be re-granted, 
wherever expired/ is expiring in near future

Estimation of Decommissioning liability  (Refer Note 32 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements)

The Holding Company has an obligation to restore and rehabilitate 
the Asset/fields operated upon by the Holding Company at the end 
of their use. This decommissioning liability is recorded based on 
estimates of the costs required to fulfil this obligation. 

The provision is based upon current cost estimates and has 
been determined on a discounted basis with reference to current 
legal requirements and technology. At each reporting date the 
decommissioning liability is reviewed and re-measured in line with 
changes in observable assumptions, timing and the latest estimates 
of the costs to be incurred at reporting date. 

Our audit procedures included the following: 

Evaluated the approach adopted by the management in determining 
the expected costs of decommissioning.

Identified the cost assumptions used that have the most significant 
impact on the provisions and tested the appropriateness of these 
assumptions. 

Reviewed the appropriateness of discount and inflation rates used 
in the estimation. 

Verified the unwinding of interest as well as understanding if any 
restoration was undertaken during the year. 

We have relied upon the technical assessment with respect to the 
Production Profile as estimated by the management based on which 
the Terminal year of the Asset /fields for decommissioning has been 
estimated.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the matter

We have considered the measurement of decommissioning costs 
as Key Audit Matter as it requires significant management judgment, 
including accounting calculations and estimates that involves high 
estimation uncertainty.

We have relied upon management’s assessment that the Mining 
Lease (ML) / Petroleum Mining Lease (PML) would be regranted, 
till the terminal year of the field as estimated by the management. 

Relied on the judgments of the internal/ external experts for the 
purpose of technical /commercial evaluation. 

Assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the 
financial statements.

Litigations and Claims  (Refer Note 58 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements)

Litigation and claims are pending with multiple tax and regulatory 
authorities and there are claims from vendors/suppliers and 
employees which have not been acknowledged as debt by the 
Holding Company (including Joint Operations). 

In the normal course of business, financial exposures may arise 
from pending legal/regulatory proceedings and from above referred 
claims not acknowledged as debt by the Holding Company. 
Whether a claim needs to be recognized as liability or disclosed 
as a contingent liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements or 
is considered as remote, is dependent on a number of significant 
assumptions and judgments made by the management. The 
amounts involved are potentially significant and determining 
the amount, if any, to be recognized or disclosed in the financial 
statements, is inherently subjective. 

We have considered litigations and claims as Key Audit Matter 
because the estimates on which these amounts are based involve a 
significant degree of management judgment, including accounting 
estimates that involves high estimation uncertainty.

Our audit procedures included the following:

Understood Management’s internal instructions, process and control 
for determining and estimating the tax litigations, other litigations 
and claims and its appropriate accounting and/or disclosure. 

Tested key controls surrounding such litigations. 

Discussed pending matters with the Holding Company’s personnel 
with respect to status of cases of litigation and claims. 

Assessed management’s conclusions through understanding 
precedents set in similar cases, reviewed the recommendations 
of the internal committee specially formed by the management, 
placed reliance upon the expert opinions, wherever obtained by the 
management. 

We have assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of 
presentation and disclosure of the contingent liabilities in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Information Technology and General Controls

The Holding Company is dependent on its Information Technology 
(“IT”) systems for processing and recording its transactions, 
including financial reporting processes. 

Appropriate IT general controls and application controls are required 
to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data, as 
required, completely, accurately and consistently for reliable 
financial reporting. 

IT application controls are critical to ensure that changes to 
applications / files / information and underlying data are made in an 
appropriate manner and under controlled environment. Appropriate 
controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors 
as a result of changes to applications and data. 

MIS reports, relevant for financial reporting, have been developed 
and tested through internal and outsourced support arrangements 
and ultimately authenticated by the users.

On account of the pervasive use of its IT systems and related control 
environment on the Holding Company’s financial reporting process, 
the testing of the general computer controls of the IT systems used 
in financial reporting has been considered to be a Key Audit Matter.

In assessing the integrity of the IT systems relevant for financial 
reporting, we obtained an understanding of the IT infrastructure and 
IT systems relevant to the Holding Company’s financial reporting 
process for evaluation and testing of relevant IT general controls 
and IT application controls (‘SAP’), through inquiries with the 
management and review of the reports of the Information system 
control audits done by a third party.

Access rights were tested over applications, operating system, on 
a sample basis, which are relied upon for financial reporting. We 
further tested segregation of duties, including preventive controls 
to ensure that access to change applications, the operating system 
or databases in the production environment were granted only to 
authorized personnel.

Our audit included making necessary inquiries with the management, 
scrutiny of the report on ‘IT audit and security’ by a third-party 
expert, access security (including controls over privileged access), 
segregation of duties and delegation of authority. 

In response to the above IT requirements, enhancement of 
functionalities in IT System made during the year, we performed the 
following: 

- tested controls and performed additional substantive procedures 
of key general ledger account reconciliations.

- observed that training sessions are also provided to users, to 
enable full utilization of SAP functionalities.

We also tested key automated and manual business cycle controls 
and logic for the reports generated through the IT infrastructure 
including those relating to MIS, that were relevant for financial 
reporting or were used in the exercise of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statement, including testing of the 
compensating controls or alternate procedures to assess whether 
there were any unaddressed IT risks that would materiality impact 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

B. Key Audit Matters of Subsidiary Company - Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (‘HPCL”) as provided by the auditors of HPCL

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the matter

Property, plant and equipment and capital work in progress 

• The Holding Company is in the process of executing various 
projects like expansion of refineries, installation of new plants, 
depots, LPG bottling plants, terminals, pipelines, etc. Since 
these projects take a substantial period of time to get ready for 
intended use and due to their materiality in the context of the 
Balance Sheet of the holding Company, this is considered to 
be an area with significant effect on the overall audit strategy 
and allocation of resources in planning and completion of our 
audit;

• With regard to above capital projects, management has 
identified specific expenditure including employee costs and 
other overheads relating to each of the assets in the above 
capital projects and has applied judgement to assess if the 
costs incurred in relation to these assets meet the recognition 
criteria of Property, Plant and Equipment in accordance with 
Ind AS 16. This has been determined as a key audit matter 
due to the significance of the capital expenditure during the 
year and the risk that the elements of costs that are eligible for 
capitalisation are not appropriately capitalised in accordance 
with the recognition criteria provided in Ind AS 16.

Principal Audit Procedures Performed

• We performed an understanding and evaluation of the system 
of internal control process over the projects and those included 
in capital work in progress, with reference to identification and 
testing of key controls

• We assessed the progress of the project and the intention and 
ability of the management to carryforward and bring the asset 
to its state of intended use.

• Review of Board minutes relating to approvals of the projects 
and changes in estimates thereof.

• Understood, evaluated and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of key controls relating to capitalisation of various 
costs incurred;

• Tested the direct and indirect costs capitalised, on a sample 
basis, with the underlying supporting documents to ascertain 
nature of costs and basis for allocation, where applicable, and 
evaluated whether they meet the recognition criteria provided 
in the Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 16, Property, Plant 
and Equipment;

• Ensured adequacy of disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements.

Evaluation of uncertain indirect tax positions

The Holding Company has material uncertain indirect tax positions 
including matters under dispute which involves significant judgment 
to determine the possible outcome of these disputes. The Company 
has disputes pending at various levels of tax authorities over the 
past several years. 

Principal Audit Procedures Performed

• We have evaluated the appropriateness of the design and 
tested the operating effectiveness of the management’s 
controls over the tax litigation matters;

• Obtained from the management and perused details of 
completed tax assessments and demands for the year ended 
March 31, 2022;

• Reviewed the management’s underlying assumptions in 
estimating the tax provision, the possible outcome of the 
disputes, legal precedence and other rulings in evaluating 
management’s position on these uncertain tax positions

Relied upon the management judgements, industry level 
deliberations and estimates for possible outflow and opinion of 
internal experts of the Company in relation to such disputed tax 
positions.

Evaluation of disputed claims against the Holding Company under various 
non-tax matters and Recoverability of pre-deposits related thereto

• The Holding Company has disputed claims against it which 
are pending at various courts/forums and are at various stages 
in the judicial process. The holding company also have pre-
deposits related thereto with various adjudicating authorities 
that are pending for/relating to cases pending for more than 3 
years.  The management has exercised significant judgement 
in assessing the possible outflow in such matters.  

Principal Audit Procedures Performed

• Read and analysed select key correspondences, internal/
external legal opinions / consultations by management for key 
disputed non tax matters.

• Reviewed and verified other legal pronouncements wherever 
available in similar matters in the case of the company/other 
corporates.

• Discussed and reviewed the nature of the amounts recoverable 
vis-à-vis the underlying cases. We further discussed the 
sustainability of the cases on a sample basis and the likelihood 
of recoverability or otherwise upon final resolution from the 
respective authorities.

Assessed management’s estimate of the possible outcome of the 
disputed cases and relied on the management judgements in such 
cases.

C. Key Audit Matters of Subsidiary Company - ONGC Videsh Limited  (‘OVL”) as provided by the auditors of OVL

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the matter

Investments in Associates and Joint Venture

We considered this matter to be of most significance in our audit 
due to the materiality of the balances of such assets in the financial 
statements, their susceptibility to various external risks, including 
geopolitical risks, difficult economic situation in certain countries, 
where the Holding Company’s Associates and Joint Venture 
operate, the high level of subjectivity in assumptions underlying 
the impairment analysis and, also, the significant judgments and 
estimates made by management.

We have obtained and analyzed the latest available financial 
information and assessed their financial position, the presence of 
impairment indicators and liquidity position. We have obtained and 
analyzed the audited accounts (wherever available) by independent 
auditors/ operators/ Joint Venture partners, which support the 
intention and ability of third parties to recover the amounts invested 
by the Holding Company.

Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves and Resources, categorization of 
wells, impairments & depletion etc.:

We considered this matter to be one of most significant due to 
the fact that the basis of estimates and valuation of hydrocarbon 
reserves and resources which has a significant impact on the 
impairment test, depreciation, depletion, amortization and provision 
for decommissioning. 

The estimation of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Resources 
is a significant area of judgment due to the technical uncertainty 
in assessing quantities and complex contractual arrangements 
dictating the group’s share of reportable volumes. Reserves and 
resources are also a fundamental indicator of the future potential of 
the performance of the Group.

Categorization of wells as exploratory, development, producing 
and dry wells, allocation of cost incurred on them, depletion of 
oil and gas assets on the basis of Proved/ Proved Developed 
Hydrocarbon Reserves, provision for decommissioning, allocation 
of depreciation/amortization on tangible/ intangible assets and 
liabilities against agreed minimum work program.  

Information on the estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves and 
Resources is disclosed in the Consolidated Ind AS Financial 
Statements as part of significant accounting estimates.

However, we have relied for the same on the assessment made by 
the Reserve Estimation Committee (REC) of the parent Company 
(viz. ONGC) for the estimated volumes of oil and gas reserves and 
resources estimated by the Joint Operators. We further relied on 
the estimates used by the REC to the hydrocarbon production, 
operating costs, capital expenditures forecasts and other 
performance indicators, including for depletion, impairments etc.

We have placed reliance on technical/ commercial evaluation 
made by the management in respect of categorization of wells as 
exploratory, development, producing and dry wells, allocation of 
cost incurred on them, depletion/ impairment of oil and gas assets 
(on the basis of Proved/ Proved Developed Hydrocarbon Reserves 
as estimated by the Reserve Estimation Committee (REC) of the 
parent Company ONGC), provision for decommissioning, allocation 
of depreciation/ amortization on Tangible/ Intangible Assets and 
liabilities against agreed minimum work program are technical in 
nature hence, we have relied for estimate and assumption of the 
management made for the same.

Show Cause Cum Demand Notice(s) issued by Service Tax Department

We considered this matter to be of most significance in our audit due 
to the materiality of the show-cause cum demand notices issued by 
the Service Tax department for the period from 1st April, 2006 to 
30th June, 2017, amounting to ` 78,779.90 million on the Holding 
Company based on foreign currency expenditure reported in the 
Holding Company’s financial statements. Replies submitted by the 
Holding Company have not been adjudicated by the department 
till date. 

The Holding Company is of the view that the said service tax is 
not payable and contesting the same, hence the Holding Company 
has not recognized any contingent liability for this amount including 
interest and penalty, if any and made disclosure of the same in 
Notes to Accounts.

We have reviewed the Demand Cum Show Cause notices issued 
by the department and reply submitted by the Holding Company.

We observed that the show cause notices have not been adjudicated 
by the department for last several years. We have reviewed circular 
no. 35/9/2018 –GST dated March 05,2018 issued by Central Board 
of Excise and Customs (CBEC), where it is clarified that “If cash 
calls are merely transaction in money, then they are excluded from 
the definition of service provided in Section 65B(44) of The Finance 
Act 1994. Whether the cash call is merely a transaction in money 
and hence not in nature of consideration for taxable service, would 
depend on the terms of the Joint Venture agreement, which may 
vary from case to case.”

We have examined the independent legal opinion and the report 
of independent accountant obtained by the Holding Company on 
this issue. Both are of the opinion that the possibility of occurrence 
of liability is very low/ remote, and the Holding Company has very 
strong case to defend.

Further we have relied on the management judgment and estimate 
for possible outflow in relation to such disputed demand in show 
cause notice.

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the matter

Different basis for rates considered in the assessment of Expected Credit 
Loss and Impairment testing

We considered this matter to be one of most significant due to the 
fact that the rates considered for the basis of estimation of Expected 
Credit Loss and Impairment testing has a significant impact. 

In the consolidated Ind AS financial statement in respect of 
assessment testing of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) for which rate 
considered is based on “weighted average cost of borrowing” 
however, in the case of Impairment testing of assets/projects, rate 
considered is based on “weighted average cost of capital”.

We evaluated the approach adopted by the management in 
determining the rate for Expected credit loss and Weight average 
Cost of Capital and reasons for considering different rates and 
basis for ECL & Impairment.  

We have relied on the explanation given to us the facts disclosed 
in the notes to the financial statement for the assumptions and 
estimation as the management has considered the risk adjusted 
weighted average cost of borrowings as effective interest rate for 
discounting the cash flows against its receivables. However, for 
Impairment, country specific WACC is considered as a discounting 
factor. The present value of cash flows has been determined by 
applying discount rates that have been determined using the risk 
adjusted country specific weighted average cost of capital. The 
country specific WACC is determined based upon the weight 
assigned to cost of equity and cost of debt of the underlying 
information. 

D. Key Audit Matters of Subsidiary Company - Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (‘MRPL”) as provided by the auditors of MRPL

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the matter
Contingent Liabilities related to claims against the company/Disputed 
demands 

There are  several claims and litigations pending before   various  
forums  against  the company which have not been acknowledged 
as debt by the company and are disclosed as contingent Liabilities.

Whether a liability is recognised or disclosed as a contingent  
liability  in   the   financial statements is inherently   judgmental and 
dependent a number of significant assumptions and  assessments. 
The eventual outcome of these legal proceedings is dependent on 
the outcome of future events and unexpected adverse outcomes 
could significantly impact the company’s reported Profit and 
balance sheet position.

Considering the degree of management judgement in interpreting  
the various cases, including accounting estimates that involves 
high estimation uncertainty in relation  to the exposure arising out 
the claims against the company/disputed demand, this matter  has 
been  identified  as a key audit  matter  for the current year audit.

Our audit  procedure included, but was not limited to the following:

• Obtained an understanding of the management process for :
i Controls and identification of legal actions initiated in respect 
of claims and disputed amount against the company

ii Assessment of accounting treatment for each such litigation 
identified under Ind AS 37 and

iii Measurement of amounts involved.

• Obtained an understanding of the nature of litigations pending 
against the company and discussed the developments during 
the year for key litigations with the management and respective 
legal department of the company

• Assessed management’s conclusions through understanding 
precedents set in similar cases

• Evaluated the adequacy and completeness of disclosures 
made for their appropriateness in accordance with the 
applicable accounting standards.

Recognition and  Measurement  Deferred  Tax Assets 

As per IND AS 12, Deferred Tax Assets are the amount  of income 
tax recoverable in future periods    in    respect    of     (a)    deductible 
temporary  differences  (b)  the  carry  forward of unused tax losses 
and (c) the carry forward of unused tax credits.

A deferred tax asset shall be  recognised for the  carry  forward  of 
unused  tax losses and unused  tax  credits  to  the  extent  that  it  is 
probable that future taxable  profit will be available against which the 
unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised

Determination  of   probable  future   taxable profit is a matter 
of judgment based on convincing evidence. Considering the 
management’s   involvement    in   estimation and   judgment    of   
determining   the   future taxable  profits which  have a degree of 
uncertainty, this matter  has been  determined as a key audit matter.

Our audit procedure included, but was not limited to the following:

• Considered the company’s past and current years taxable  
profits, taxes paid  and the impact of the amalgamation of the 
erstwhile wholly owned subsidiary company ONGC Mangalore 
Petrochemicals Limited (OMPL) with the company, obtained 
details of carry forward losses under  income tax and  details of 
estimates of future taxable profits.

• Tested the period  over which  the deferred  tax  assets on  such 
unused tax losses and unused tax credits  including   the  tax  
losses and unused tax credits of the erstwhile wholly owned 
subsidiary company ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Limited 
(OMPL) which  amalgamated with the company would be 
recovered against future taxable income.

• Tested the management’s under lying assumptions and 
judgments in estimating the probable future taxable  profits and  
the existence of sufficient taxable temporary difference against 
which the unused tax losses or unused  tax credits can be 
utilised  by  the company.

• Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures 
in  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

6. Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
Auditor’s Report Thereon 

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the preparation of the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Board’s Report including 
Annexures to Board’s Report, Management Discussion and 
Analysis, Business Responsibility Report and Report on Corporate 
Governance but does not include the consolidated financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The above-referred 
information is expected to be made available to us after the date 
of this audit report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information, identified above 
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 

When we read the other information, if we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate 
actions necessitated by the circumstances and the applicable laws 
and regulations.

7. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance 
for the Consolidated Financial Statements 

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
financial position, consolidated financial performance, 
consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of 
the Group,  its joint ventures and associates in accordance with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 
133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group, its joint 
ventures and associates and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate  
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of 
the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view 
and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, its joint 
ventures and associates are responsible for assessing the ability 
of the Group, its joint ventures and associates to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group, its joint ventures and associates are also responsible for 
overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group, its joint 
ventures and associates. 

8. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Consolidated Financial 
Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also: 

•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 

•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also 
responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Group 
and its joint ventures and associates has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements in place 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management. 

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the 
going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related 
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group, its joint ventures and associates to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group, its joint ventures 
and associates to cease to continue as a going concern.

•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation. 

•  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group, its joint ventures and associates to express 
an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance 
of the audit of the consolidated financial statements of such 
entities included in the consolidated financial statements of 
which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements, which have

been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for 
our audit opinion. 

  Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and 
qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate 
the effect of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

  We communicate with those charged with governance of the 
Holding Company regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit. 

  We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.

  From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure - A to Independent Auditors’ Report on Consolidated Financial Statements

(Referred to in paragraph 9 (1) (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of 
our report of even date)

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the  
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit 
evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of the reports 
referred to in the “Other Matters” paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls system with reference to financial statements 
of the Holding Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates, which are companies incorporated in India. 

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements 

A Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management, override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, 
joint ventures and associates, which are companies incorporated 
in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and 
such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 
2022, based on the internal controls over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Holding Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

To the Members of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (herein after 
referred to as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 
March 31, 2022, we have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements of the Holding Company and its 
subsidiaries, Joint ventures and associates which are companies 
incorporated in India, as of that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Board of Directors of the Holding company, its 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates which are companies 
incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria  established by the Holding Company, 
its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates which are companies 
incorporated in India, considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to 
the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation 
of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding 
Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, which are 
companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) 
and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls 
and both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
was established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,

2. Application of new Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)

All the Indian Accounting Standards issued under section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 and notified by the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs (MCA) under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 (as amended) till the financial statements are approved 
have been considered in preparation of these Financial Statements.

2.1. Standards issued but not yet effective:

The MCA has notified the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards 
/ Ind AS) Amendment Rules, 2022 on March 23, 2022, whereby 
the amendments to various Indian Accounting Standards has been 
made applicable with effect from April 1, 2022 onwards.

The amendments made vide aforesaid  notification dated March 
23, 2022 has brought few additions and substitutions in Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) particularly in Ind AS 101- First-time 
Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards, Ind AS 103- Business 
Combinations, Ind AS 109- Financial Instruments, Ind AS 16- 
Property, plant and Equipment, Ind AS 37- Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets and Ind AS 41- Agriculture, the 
Company is evaluating the requirements of the same and its effect 
on the Financial Statements is not likely to be material.

3. Significant Group Accounting Policies

3.1. Statement of compliance

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with Ind AS notified under the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended), the Companies 
Act, 2013 and Guidance Note on Accounting for Oil and Gas 
Producing Activities (Ind AS) issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. 

3.2. Basis of preparation

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on 
going concern basis on the historical cost convention using accrual 
system of accounting except for certain assets and liabilities which 
are measured at fair value/amortised cost/Net present value at 
the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting 
policies below:

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

As the operating cycle cannot be identified in normal course due 
to the special nature of industry, the same has been assumed to 
have duration of 12 months. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities 
have been classified as current or non-current as per the operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in Ind AS-1 ‘Presentation of Financial 

Statements’ and Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Indian 
Rupees and all values are rounded off to the nearest two decimal 
million except otherwise stated.

 Fair value measurement

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date under current market 
conditions.

The Group categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
into one of the three levels depending on the ability to observe 
inputs employed in their measurement which are described as 
follows:

•  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities. 

•  Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or 
indirectly, other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the 
assets or liabilities. 

•  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
reflecting significant modifications to observable related 
market data or Group’s assumptions about pricing by market 
participants.

3.3. Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively 
referred as “the Group”). The Group has investments in associates 
and joint ventures which are accounted using equity method in 
these consolidated financial statements. Refer Note No. 3.7 for the 
accounting policy of investment in associates and joint ventures in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company 
controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights to variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities 
of the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their 
acquisition (except for Business Combinations under Common 
Control), being the date on which the Company obtains control and 
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.

The Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform 
accounting policies consistently for like transactions and other 
events in similar circumstances and are presented to the extent 
possible, in the same manner as the Company’s Standalone 
Financial Statements except otherwise stated. When necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries 
to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group’s Significant 
Accounting Policies.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared 
by combining the financial statements of  the company and its 
subsidiaries on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book 
values of like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash flow after eliminating in full intra-group assets, liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flow relating to intra-group 
transactions and unrealized profits. Unrealized losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred. Such unrealized profits/losses 
are fully attributed to the Company.

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income 
are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-
controlling interests. Total comprehensive income is attributed to the 
owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if 
this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that 
do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are 
accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the 
Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted 
to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. 
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid 
or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to the 
owners of the Company.

When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is 
recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and 
is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the 
fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any 
retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets 
(including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-
controlling interests. All amounts previously recognized in other 
comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted 
for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or 
liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss or transferred to another category of 
equity as specified/permitted by applicable Ind AS). The fair value 
of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when 
control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for 
subsequent accounting under Ind AS 109, or the cost on initial 
recognition as investment in an associate or a joint venture, when 
applicable.

3.4. Business Combination

Acquisitions of businesses (except for Business Combinations 
under Common Control) are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The consideration transferred in a business combination 
is measured at fair value which is calculated as the sum of the 
acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, 
liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree 
and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange of control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are generally recognized 
in consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value, except that:

-Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to 
employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in 
accordance with Ind AS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ and Ind AS 19 ‘Employee 
Benefits’ respectively;

-Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in 
accordance with Ind AS 105 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’ are measured in accordance with that 
Standard.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed.

In case of a bargain purchase, before recognising a gain in respect 
thereof, the Group determines whether there exists clear evidence 
of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination 
as a bargain purchase. Thereafter, the Group reassesses whether 
it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the 
liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities 
that are identified in that reassessment. The Group then reviews 
the procedures used to measure the amounts that Ind AS requires 
for the purposes of calculating the bargain purchase. If the gain 
remains after this reassessment and review, the Group recognises 

it in other comprehensive income and accumulates the same in 
equity as capital reserve. This gain is attributed to the acquirer. If 
there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for 
classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase, the 
Group recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing (as 
described above), directly in equity as capital reserve.

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business 
combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is 
measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of 
the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes 
in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as 
measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, 
with corresponding adjustments against goodwill or capital 
reserve, as the case may be. Measurement period adjustments 
are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained 
by the Group during the ‘measurement period’ about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Measurement 
period does not exceed one year from the acquisition date.

The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement 
period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration 
is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is 
not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration 
that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at fair value 
at subsequent reporting dates with the corresponding gain or loss 
being recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to 
its acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, 
is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition 
date that have previously been recognized in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were 
disposed of.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by 
the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, 
the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the 
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period recognising additional assets or 
liabilities (if any) to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, 
would have affected the amounts recognized at that date. 

Business Combination under Common control 

A business combination involving entities or businesses under common 
control is a business combination in which all of the combining entities 
or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both 
before and after the business combination and the control is not transitory. 
The transactions between entities under common control are specifically 
covered by Appendix C to Ind AS 103 and are accounted for using the 
pooling-of-interest method as follows:

• The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at the 
carrying amounts.

• No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognize new 
assets or liabilities. Adjustments are made to harmonize significant 
accounting policies.

• The financial information in the financial statements in respect 
of prior periods is restated as if the business combination 
has occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in 
the financial statements, irrespective of the actual date of the 
combination. 

The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the financial 
statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding 



329

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

balance appearing in the financial statements of the transferee. 
The identity of the reserves are preserved and the reserves of the 
transferor become the reserves of the transferee.

The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share 
capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash 
or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor 
is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from 
other capital reserves.  

3.5.  Non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests represent the proportion of income, other 
comprehensive income and net assets in subsidiaries that is not 
attributable to the Company’s shareholders.

Non-controlling interests are initially measured at the proportionate 
share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-
controlling interests is the amount of the interest at initial recognition 
plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in 
equity.

3.6.  Goodwill on consolidation

Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at 
cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business 
less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill arising on 
amalgamation of a business is carried at cost as established at the 
date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment 
losses, if any.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-
generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the combination.

A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is 
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is 
an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its 
carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss 
for goodwill is recognized directly in Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not 
reversed in subsequent periods.

On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the Profit 
and Loss. 

3.7.  Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures

An Associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not 
control or joint control over those policies. 

A Joint Venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have 
joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of 
control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about 
the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties 
sharing control.

The results, assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures 
are incorporated in the Consolidated Financial Statements using 
the equity method of accounting, except when the investment, or 
a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is 
accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 105 ‘Non-current Assets 

Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’. Under the equity 
method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially 
recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. Distributions 
received from an associate or a joint venture reduces the carrying 
amount of investment. When the Group’s share of losses of an 
associate or a joint venture exceeds the Group’s interest in that 
associate or joint venture (which includes any long term interests 
that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the 
associate or joint venture), the Group discontinues recognizing its 
share of further losses. Additional losses are recognized only to the 
extent that the Group has legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.

Loans advanced to Associate & Joint Venture and that have the 
characteristics of financing through equity are also included in the 
investment of the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. The Group’s 
share of amounts recognized directly in equity by Associate & Joint 
Venture is recognized in the Group’s consolidated statement of 
changes in equity.

Where the group is a sponsor in respect of Compulsory Convertible 
Debentures issued by joint ventures and is mandatorily required to 
purchase such debentures, a financial liability is recognized at fair 
value with a corresponding debit to deemed investment. Financial 
liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost. The deemed 
investment is added to the carrying amount of investment in joint 
ventures and carried at cost.

Unrealized gains on transactions between the group and its 
Associate & Joint Venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in Associate & Joint Venture. Unrealized losses are also 
eliminated to the extent of Group’s interest unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

If an associate or a joint venture uses accounting policies other than 
those of the Group accounting policies for like transactions and 
events in similar circumstances, adjustments are made to make 
the associate’s or joint venture’s financial statements confirm to the 
Group’s significant accounting policies before applying the equity 
method, unless, in case of an associate where it is impracticable 
do so.

An investment in an Associate or a Joint Venture is accounted 
for using the equity method from the date on which the investee 
becomes an Associate or a Joint Venture. On acquisition of the 
investment in an Associate or a Joint Venture, any excess of the 
cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value 
of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognized 
as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the 
investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of 
the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, 
after reassessment, is recognized directly in equity as capital 
reserve in the period in which the investment is acquired.

After application of the equity method of accounting, the Group 
determines whether there is any objective evidence of impairment 
as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the net investment in an associate or a joint venture 
and that event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future 
cash flows from the net investment that can be reliably estimated. If 
there exists such an objective evidence of impairment, then Group 
recognises impairment loss with respect to the Group’s investment 
in an associate or a joint venture. When necessary, the entire 
carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for 
impairment in accordance with Ind AS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ 
as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of 
value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying

amount, Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying 
amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is 
recognized in accordance with Ind AS 36 to the extent that the 
recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.

The Group discontinues the use of the equity method from the date 
when the investment ceases to be an associate or a joint venture, 
or when the investment is classified as held for sale. When the 
Group retains an interest in the former associate or joint venture 
and the retained interest is a financial asset, the Group measures 
the retained interest at fair value at that date and the fair value is 
regarded as its fair value on initial recognition in accordance with 
Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’. The difference between the 
carrying amount of the associate or joint venture at the date the 
equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained 
interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in 
the associate or joint venture is included in the determination of 
the gain or loss on disposal of the associate or joint venture. In 
addition, the Group accounts for all amounts previously recognized 
in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate or joint 
venture on the same basis as would be required if that associate 
or joint venture had directly disposed of the related assets or 
liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognized in other 
comprehensive income by that associate or joint venture would be 
reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss on the 
disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies 
the gain or loss from equity to the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when the equity method 
is discontinued.

The Group continues to use the equity method when an investment 
in an associate becomes an investment in a joint venture or 
an investment in a joint venture becomes an investment in an 
associate. There is no remeasurement to fair value upon such 
changes in ownership interests.

When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate or 
a joint venture but the Group continues to use the equity method, 
the Group reclassifies to the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been 
recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction 
in ownership interest as if that gain or loss would be reclassified to 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss on the disposal of the 
related assets or liabilities.

When a group entity transacts with an associate or a joint venture 
of the Group, profits and losses resulting from the transactions 
with the associate or joint venture are recognized in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in 
the associate or joint venture that are not related to the Group.

3.8. Interests in joint operations

A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that 
have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, 
and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. 
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The Group has Joint Operations in the nature of Production Sharing 
Contracts (PSC) and Revenue Sharing Contracts (RSC) with the 
Government of India/other countries and various body corporates 
for exploration, development and production activities.

The Group’s share in the assets and liabilities along with attributable 
income and expenditure of the Joint Operations is merged on line 

by line basis with the similar items in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and adjusted for leases, depreciation, overlift/ 
underlift, depletion, survey, dry wells, decommissioning provision, 
impairment and sidetracking in accordance with the accounting 
policies of the Group.

The hydrocarbon reserves in such areas are taken in proportion to 
the participating interest of the Group.

With respect to use of leased assets in the joint operations, the 
Group recognizes lease liability and corresponding right-of-use 
asset in accordance with the terms of related joint operating 
agreement/production sharing contracts.

Gain or loss on sale of interest in a joint operation, is recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except that no gain 
is recognized at the time of such sale if substantial uncertainty exists 
about the recovery of the costs applicable to the retained interest 
or if the Group has substantial obligation for future performance. 
The gain in such situation is treated as recovery of cost related to 
that block.

In case of joint operations outside India, the long term employee 
benefits are recognised in accordance with the laws of the their 
respective jurisdiction.

3.9. Non-current assets held for sale

Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.

Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for 
sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a 
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition 
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the 
asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for 
sales of such assets. Management must be committed to the sale, 
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed 
sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, 
and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate 
that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or 
that the plan will be withdrawn.

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and intangible assets are not 
depreciated or amortized once classified as held for sale.

3.10. Government Grant

Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable 
assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attached 
to them and that the grants will be received.

Monetary Government grants, whose primary condition is that the 
Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current 
assets and the grants are recognized and disclosed as ‘deferred 
income’ under non-current liability in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet and transferred to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the 
related assets. 

All Non-monetary grants received are recognized for both asset 
and grant at nominal value.

The benefit of a government loan at a rate below the market rate of 
interest is treated as a government grant, and is measured as the 
difference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan 
based on prevailing market interest rates.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

3.11. Property Plant and Equipment (other than Oil and Gas Assets) and   
Right of Use Assets

The Group (except for ONGC Videsh Ltd where due to change in 
functional currency, exemption as per para D7AA of Ind AS 101 is 
not available) has elected to continue with the carrying value of all 
of its Property Plant and Equipment  recognized as of April 1, 2015 
(transition date) measured as per the Previous GAAP and use that 
carrying value as its deemed cost as of the transition date except 
adjustment related to  decommissioning liabilities.

Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of 
goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in 
the Balance Sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Freehold land and land under perpetual 
lease are not depreciated. However, freehold land relating to 
overseas oil & gas operations are depreciated on straight line basis 
over the duration of the license period.

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) in the course of construction 
for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried 
at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. The cost of an 
asset comprises its purchase price or its construction cost (net 
of applicable tax credits), any cost directly attributable to bring 
the asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended by the Management 
and   decommissioning cost as per Note No. 3.17. It includes 
professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs 
capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Such 
properties are classified to the appropriate categories of PPE when 
completed and ready for intended use. Parts of an item of PPE 
having different useful lives and significant value and subsequent 
expenditure on Property, Plant and Equipment arising on account of 
capital improvement or other factors are accounted for as separate 
components. Expenditure on dry docking of rigs and vessels are 
accounted for as component of relevant assets. 

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation 
method are reviewed on an annual basis and if necessary, changes 
in estimates are accounted for prospectively.

Depreciation on subsequent expenditure on PPE arising on 
account of capital improvements or other factors is provided for 
prospectively over the remaining useful life. 

Depreciation on additions/deletions to PPE during the year 
is provided for on a pro-rata basis with reference to the date of 
additions/deletions except low value items not exceeding ` 5,000/- 
which are fully depreciated at the time of addition of Assets related to 
operations in India and items not exceeding US$ 100 which are fully 
depreciated at the time of addition of Assets related to operations 
outside India. In case of a subsidiary HPCL, depreciation is charged 
on additions / deletions on pro-rata monthly basis including the 
month of addition / deletion.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term or useful life of the underlying asset, whichever is less.

An item of PPE is de-recognized upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use 
of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement 
of an item of PPE is determined as the difference between the net 
sales/disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognized in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Depreciation of these PPE commences when the assets are ready 
for their intended use. 

The Group account for their depreciation on following basis:-

(a) Depreciation- PPE of Exploration & Production (E&P) (other than 
freehold land, Oil and Gas Assets and properties under construction)

Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE of E&P operations less 
their residual values, using the written down value method (except 
for components of dry docking capitalized) over the useful life of 
PPE as stated in the Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or 
based on technical assessment by the Company. In case of PPE 
pertaining to overseas blocks where the license period is less than 
the useful life of PPE, the company writes off the PPE in the financial 
year in which the license is expired or the block is surrendered, if 
no future economic benefits from the PPE are expected. Estimated 
useful lives of these assets are as under:

Description Useful life in 
years

Building & Bunk Houses 3 to 60

Plant & Equipment 2 to 40

Furniture and Fixtures 3 to 25

Vehicles, Ships and Boats 3 to 20

Office Equipment 2 to 20

Depreciation on refurbished/revamped PPE which are capitalized 
separately is provided for over the reassessed useful life which is 
not more than the life specified in Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013.

Depreciation on expenditure on dry docking of rigs and vessels 
capitalized as component of relevant rig / vessels is charged over 
the dry dock period on straight line basis.

Depreciation on PPE including support equipment and facilities 
used for exploratory/ development drilling is initially capitalised as 
part of drilling cost and expensed/depleted as per Note No. 3.15. 
Depreciation on equipment/ assets deployed for survey activities is 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

(b) Depreciation- PPE of Refining & Marketing,  Crude oil Transportation 
business (other than freehold land and properties under construction)

Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE less their residual 
values of asset associated with Refinery, Petrochemical, Crude oil 
Transportation, using Straight Line Method, over the useful life as 
specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, except in case 
of certain components of the Plant and Equipment whose useful 
lives are determined based on technical evaluation. Useful lives are 
as follows:- 

Asset categories Useful life in years

Buildings 1-60

Plant & Machinery 2-42

Furniture 3-10

Office equipment 3-15

Vehicles 4-15

Railway Siding 15

Roads 5-10

Plant and Machinery relating to Retail 
Outlets (other than Storage tanks and 
related equipment)

15

Cavern Structure 60

LPG cylinders & regulators (excluding 
cylinders held for sale)

In cases of LPG Cylinders & pressure regulators and Catalysts 
with nobel metal contents, with due consideration to expected 
realization, a higher residual value is considered.

Expenditure on overhaul and repairs on account of planned 
shutdown which are of significant value (5% of the value of particular 
assets) is capitalized as component of relevant items of PPE and is 
depreciated over the period till next shutdown on straight line basis. 
Catalyst whose life is more than one year is capitalised as property, 
plant and equipment and depreciated over the guaranteed useful 
life as specified by the supplier when the catalyst is put to use.

In respect of immovable assets constructed on leasehold land, 
useful life as per Schedule II or lease period of land (including 
renewable/likely renewable period) whichever is earlier is 
considered.

3.12.Intangible Assets

(i)  Intangible assets acquired separately

The Group (except for ONGC Videsh Ltd where due to change in 
functional currency exemption as per para D7AA of Ind AS 101 is 
not available) has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of 
its intangible assets recognized as of April 1, 2015 (transition date) 
measured as per the Previous GAAP and use that carrying value as 
its deemed cost as of the transition date except adjustment related 
to  decommissioning liabilities.

Intangible assets are carried at cost net of accumulated amortization 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated 
intangibles, excluding development costs, are not capitalised and 
the related expenditure is reflected in Statement of Profit and Loss 
in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. Development 
costs are capitalised if technical and commercial feasibility of the 
project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the 
Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the 
asset and the costs can be measured reliably.

In cases where, the Group has constructed assets and the Group 
has only a preferential right to use, these assets are classified as 
intangible assets and are amortised (after retaining the residual 
value, if applicable) over their useful life or the period of the 
agreement, whichever is lower.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately 
are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful life is reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period and the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted 
for prospectively and tested for impairment. 

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives such as ‘right of way’ are 
not subject to amortisation and are carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. The useful lives are reviewed at each 
period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to 
support an indefinite useful life assessment for that asset. 

An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or 
losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured 
as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset, and recognized in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss, when the asset is derecognized.

Technical know-how / license fee relating to production process 
and process design are recognized as Intangible Assets.

Estimated lives of intangible assets (acquired) are as follows:

• Software : 2 to 10 years

• Technical know-how/license fees : 2 to 10 years

• License and Franchise : 3 years

• Right to use-wind mills : 22 years

(ii) Intangible assets under development -  Exploratory Wells in Progress  

All exploration and evaluation costs incurred in drilling and 
equipping exploratory and appraisal wells, are initially capitalized 
as Intangible assets under development - Exploratory Wells in 
Progress till the time these are either transferred to Oil and Gas 
Assets on completion as per Note No. 3.15 or expensed as 
exploration and evaluation cost (including allocated depreciation) 
as and when determined to be dry or of no further use, as the case 
may be.

Cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic test wells are initially 
capitalized as Intangible assets under development - Exploratory 
Wells in Progress till the time these are either transferred to Oil 
and Gas Assets as per note no. 3.15 or expensed as exploration 
and evaluation cost (including allocated depreciation) as when 
determined to be dry or the petroleum exploration license/field/
project is surrendered. 

Costs of exploratory wells are not carried over unless it could be 
reasonably demonstrated that there are indications of sufficient 
quantity of reserves and sufficient progress has been made in 
assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability 
of the project. All such carried over costs are subject to review for 
impairment as per the policy of the Group.

3.13.Impairment of tangible, intangible assets (other than goodwill) and 
right-of-use assets

The Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible 
assets (Oil and Gas Assets, Development Wells in Progress 
(DWIP), Property, Plant and Equipment (including Capital Works 
in Progress) and Right–of use assets of a “Cash Generating Unit” 
(CGU) at the end of each reporting period to determine whether 
there is any significant indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate 
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives such as “Right of 
way” and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for 
impairment at least annually or whenever there is an indication that 
the asset may be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.



333

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

An assessment is made at the end of each reporting period to see if 
there are any indications that impairment losses recognized earlier 
may no longer exist or may have come down. The impairment loss 
is reversed, if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the previous 
impairment loss was recognized. If it is so, the carrying amount of 
the asset is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the 
carrying amount that have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior 
years. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future 
periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any 
residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. 
Reversals of Impairment loss are recognized in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

Exploration and Evaluation assets are tested for Impairment when 
further exploration activities are not planned in near future or when 
sufficient data exists to indicate that although a development is 
likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration asset is 
unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by 
sale. Impairment loss is reversed subsequently, to the extent that 
conditions for impairment are no longer present.

3.14.Exploration & Evaluation, Development and Production Costs 

(i)  Pre-acquisition cost

Expenditure incurred before obtaining the right(s) to explore, 
develop and produce oil and gas are expensed as and when 
incurred.

(ii) Acquisition cost

Acquisition costs of an Oil and Gas Asset are costs related to right 
to acquire mineral interest and are accounted as follows:-

Exploration and development stage

Acquisition cost relating to projects under exploration or 
development are initially accounted as Intangible Assets under 
development - exploratory wells in progress or Oil & Gas Assets under 
development - development wells in progress respectively. Such costs 
are capitalized by transferring to Oil and Gas Assets when a well is 
ready to commence commercial production.  In case of abandonment 
/ relinquishment of Intangible Assets under development - exploratory 
wells in progress, such costs are written off.

Production stage

Acquisition costs of a producing Oil and Gas Assets are capitalized 
as proved property acquisition cost under Oil and Gas Assets 
and amortized using the unit of production method over proved 
reserves of underlying assets.

(iii) Survey cost

Cost of Survey and prospecting activities conducted in the search 
of oil and gas are expensed as exploration cost in the year in which 
these are incurred.

(iv) Oil & Gas asset under development - Development Wells in Progress

All costs relating to Development Wells are initially capitalized as 
‘Development Wells in Progress’ and transferred to ‘Oil and Gas 
Assets’ on “completion”.

(v) Production costs

Production costs include pre-well head and post-well head 
expenses including depreciation and applicable operating costs of 
support equipment and facilities.

(vi) Impairment of Acquisition costs relating to participating rights

For the purposes of impairment testing, acquisition cost is allocated 
to each of the Group’s CGUs (or groups of CGUs) that is expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

A CGU to which acquisition cost has been allocated is tested for 
impairment annually when there is an indication that the unit may 
be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any acquisition cost allocated 
to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based 
on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment 
loss recognized for acquisition cost is not reversed in subsequent 
periods.

On disposal of the relevant CGU, the attributable carrying amount 
of acquisition cost is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal.

3.15.Oil and Gas Assets

The Group (except for ONGC Videsh Ltd where due to change 
in functional currency this exemption is not available  as per para 
D7AA of Ind AS 101 ) has elected to continue with the carrying 
value of all of its Oil and Gas assets recognized as of April 1, 2015 
(transition date) measured as per the Previous GAAP and use that 
carrying value as its deemed cost as of the transition date except 
adjustment related to decommissioning liabilities.

Oil and Gas Assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated 
depletion and impairment losses.  These are created in respect 
of an area / field having proved developed oil and gas reserves, 
when the well in the area / field is ready to commence commercial 
production.

Cost of temporary occupation of land, successful exploratory wells, 
all development wells (including service wells), allied facilities, 
depreciation on support equipment used for drilling and estimated 
future decommissioning costs are capitalised and classified as Oil 
and Gas Assets

Oil and Gas Assets are depleted using the “Unit of Production 
Method”.  The rate of depletion is computed with reference to an 
area covered by individual lease / license / asset /field /project / 
amortization base by considering the proved developed reserves 
and related capital costs incurred including estimated future 
decommissioning / abandonment costs net of salvage value. 
Acquisition cost of Oil and Gas Assets is depleted by considering 
the proved reserves. These reserves are estimated annually by the 
Reserve Estimates Committee of the Company, which follows the 
International Reservoir Engineering Procedures.

3.16.Side tracking

In the case of an exploratory well, cost of side-tracking is treated in 
the same manner as the cost incurred on a new exploratory well. 
The cost of abandoned portion of side tracked exploratory wells is 
expensed as ‘Exploration cost written off’.

In the case of development wells, the entire cost of abandoned 
portion and side tracking is capitalized.

In case of side tracking of producing wells and service wells which 
form part of the development schemes are treated as development 
wells and the cost incurred on the side tracking is capitalized.

In the case of side tracking of producing wells and service wells 
which do not form part of the development schemes and the side-
tracking results in additional proved developed oil and gas reserves 
or increases the future economic benefits therefrom beyond 
previously assessed standard of performance, the cost incurred on 
side tracking is capitalised, whereas the cost of abandoned portion 
of the well is depleted in the normal way. Otherwise, the cost of side 
tracking is expensed as ‘Work over Expenditure.’

3.17.Decommissioning costs

Decommissioning cost includes cost of restoration. Provision for 
decommissioning costs are recognized when the Group has a legal 
or constructive obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and 
remove a facility or an item of Property, Plant and Equipment and to 
restore the site on which it is located.  The full eventual estimated 
provision towards costs relating to dismantling, abandoning and 
restoring well sites and allied facilities are recognized in respective 
assets when the well is complete / facilities or Property, Plant and 
Equipment are installed.

The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future 
expenditure determined using existing technology at current prices 
and escalated using appropriate inflation rate till the expected date 
of decommissioning and discounted up to the reporting date using 
the appropriate risk free discount rate.

An amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is 
recognized along with the cost of exploratory well or Property, Plant 
and Equipment. The decommissioning cost in respect of dry well is 
expensed as exploratory well cost.

Any change in the present value of the estimated decommissioning 
provision other than the periodic unwinding of discount is adjusted 
to the decommissioning provision and the carrying value of the 
related asset. In case reversal of decommissioning provision 
exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset including WDV of 
the capitalised portion of decommissioning provision in the carrying 
amount of the related asset, the excess amount is recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The unwinding of 
discount on provision is charged in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss as finance cost.

Provision for decommissioning cost in respect of assets under Joint 
Operations is considered as per participating interest of the Group 
on the basis of estimate approved by the respective operating 
committee. Wherever the same are not approved by the respective 
operating committee abandonment cost estimates of the company 
are considered.

3.18.Inventories

(a) Raw material and Stock in Process –Refinery & Petrochemicals

Raw material (Crude oil ) is valued at cost on First in First Out (FIFO) 
basis or at net realisable value, whichever is lower. Raw materials 
other than Crude oil are valued at weighted average cost or at net 
realisable value, whichever is lower . Stock-in process is valued at 
raw material cost plus cost of conversion or at net realisable value, 
whichever is lower. Raw materials  are not written down below cost 
except in cases where their prices have declined subsequently and 
it is estimated that the cost of the finished goods will exceed their 
net realisable value

(b) Finished Goods and semi-finished :-

(i) Exploration and Production Operation (E&P) 

Finished goods (other than Sulphur and carbon credits) including 
inventories in pipelines / tanks are valued at cost or net realisable 
value whichever is lower. Cost of finished goods is determined on 

absorption costing method. Sulphur and carbon credits are valued 
at net realisable value. The value of inventories includes excise duty, 
royalty (wherever applicable) but excludes Cess.

Crude oil in semi-finished condition at Group Gathering Stations 
(GGS) is valued at cost on absorption costing method or net 
realisable value whichever is lower.

Crude oil in unfinished condition in flow lines up to GGS / platform 
is not valued as the same is not measurable. Natural Gas is not 
valued as it is not stored.

(ii) Refining & Petrochemicals

Finished products other than Lubricants are valued at cost (on FIFO 
basis month-wise) or at net realisable value, whichever is lower 
Cost of finished goods (other than lubricants) is determined based 
on raw material cost, conversion cost and excise duty.

Finished products (lubricants) are valued at weighted average cost 
or at net realisable value, whichever is lower.

Stock in trade are valued on weighted average cost basis.

Empty packages are valued at weighted average cost.

Cost of semi-finished goods is determined based on raw material 
cost and proportionate conversion cost. 

Customs duty on Raw materials/Finished goods lying in bonded 
warehouse are provided for at the applicable rates except where 
liability to pay duty is transferred to consignee.

Excise duty on finished stocks lying at manufacturing locations 
is provided for at the assessable value applicable at each of the 
locations based on applicable duty.

The net realizable value of finished goods and stock in trade 
are final selling prices for sales to oil marketing companies and 
depot prices applicable to the locations. For the purpose of stock 
valuation, the proportion of sales of oil marketing companies and 
consumer sales are determined on location wise and product wise 
sales of subsequent period.

(c) Store & Spares 

Inventory of stores and spare parts is valued at weighted average 
cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Wherever, weighted 
average cost or net realisable value is not available, the cost made 
available by the operator is considered for valuation of Stores 
and Spares. Provisions are made for obsolete and non-moving 
inventories.

In case of Refinery & Petrochemicals segment, surplus items, when 
transferred from completed projects are valued at cost/ estimated 
value, pending periodic assessment/ ascertainment of condition. 
Stores and Spares in-transit are valued at cost.

Unserviceable and scrap items, when determined, are valued at 
estimated net realisable value.

3.19. Revenue recognition 

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized at the point in 
time the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring 
control of a promised product or service to a customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled 
in exchange for the sale of products and service, net of discount, taxes 
or duties. The transfer of control on sale of crude oil, natural gas and 
value added products occurs at the point of delivery, where usually the 
title is passed and the customer takes physical possession, depending 
upon the contractual conditions. Any retrospective revision in prices is 
accounted for in the year of such revision.



335

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

Revenue from service is recognized in the accounting period in 
which the services are rendered at contractually agreed rates.

Sale of crude oil and natural gas (net of levies) produced from 
Intangible assets under development – Exploratory Wells in 
Progress / Oil and Gas assets under development – Development 
Wells in Progress is deducted from expenditure on such wells.

Any payment received in respect of contractual short lifted gas 
quantity for which an obligation exists to make-up such gas in 
subsequent periods is recognized as Contract Liabilities in the 
year of receipt. Revenue in respect of such contractual short lifted 
quantity of gas is recognized when such gas is actually supplied 
or when the customer’s right to make up is expired, whichever is 
earlier. 

Revenues from the production of crude oil and natural gas 
properties, in which the Group has an interest with other producers, 
are recognized based on actual quantity lifted over the period. Any 
difference as of the reporting date between the entitlement quantity 
minus the quantities lifted in respect of crude oil, if positive (i.e. 
under lift quantity) the proportionate production expenditure is 
treated as prepaid expenses and, if negative (i.e. over lift quantity), 
a liability for the best estimate of the Group’s proportionate share 
of production expenses as per the Joint Operating Agreement 
(JOA) / Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) is created in respect 
of the quantity of crude oil to be foregone in future period towards 
settlement of the overlift quantity of crude oil with corresponding 
charge to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Revenue is allocated between loyalty programs and other 
components of the sale. The amount allocated to the loyalty 
program is deferred, and is recognized as revenue when the Group 
has fulfilled its obligation to supply the products under the terms of 
the program or when it is no longer probable that the points under 
the program will be redeemed. Where the Group acts as an agent 
on behalf of a third party, the associated income is recognized on 
a net basis.

Revenue in respect of the following is recognized when collectability 
of the receivable is reasonably assured:

(i) Contractual short lifted quantity of gas with no obligation for 
make-up.

(ii) Interest on delayed realization from customers and cash calls 
from JV partners.

(iii) Liquidated damages from contractors/suppliers.

As per the Production Sharing Contracts for extracting the Oil 
and Gas Reserves with Government of India, out of the earnings 
from the exploitation of reserves after recovery of cost, a part of 
the revenue is paid to Government of India which is called Profit 
Petroleum.  It is reduced from the revenue from Sale of Products as 
Government of India’s Share in Profit Petroleum.

Dividend and interest income

Dividend income from investments is recognized when the 
shareholder’s right to receive payment is established and it became 
probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend 
will flow to the Group, and the amount of the dividend can be 
measured reliably.  

Interest income from financial assets is recognized, when it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is 
accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding 
and at the effective interest rate applicable on initial recognition. 

3.20. Leases

Effective  April 01, 2019, the Group adopted Ind AS 116 “Leases” 
using the modified prospective approach. The new standard defines 
a lease as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
The Group has exercised the option not to apply this standard to 
leases of intangible assets.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: 

(i)  the contract involves  use of an identified assets. 

(ii)  the Group obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from 
the use of the asset through out the period of the lease and 

(iii) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

Group as a lessee

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes 
a right-of-use asset (ROU asset) and a corresponding lease liability 
for all  hiring contracts / arrangements in which it is a lessee, except 
for lease with a term of twelve months or less (i.e. short term leases) 
and lease of  low value  assets.  For these short-term and low value 
leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments on straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.

Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or 
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised. 

The lease liability is initially measured at present value of the 
future lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. The 
lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in 
the lease. if it is not readily determinable, using the incremental 
borrowing rate. For leases with similar characteristics, the Group, 
on a lease by lease basis. applies either the incremental borrowing 
rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the 
portfolio as a whole. 

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which 
comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the inception 
date of the lease along with any initial direct costs, restoration 
obligations and lease incentives received 

Subsequently, the  right-of-use assets is measured at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line 
method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease 
term or useful life of right-of-use assets, however, in case the 
ownership of such right-of-use asset transfers to the lessee at 
the end of the lease term, such assets are depreciated over the 
useful life of the underlying asset. The Group applies Ind AS 36 to 
determine whether a ROU asset is impaired and accounts for any 
identified impairment loss as described in the accounting policy 
above on “Impairment of tangible. intangible assets and right-of-
use assets”. 

In the case of unincorporated joint operations, the operator 
recognizes the entire lease liability, as, by signing the contract, it 
has primary responsibility for the liability towards the third party 
supplier. Therefore, if, based on the contractual provisions and 
any other relevant facts and circumstances, the group has primary 
responsibility, it recognizes in the balance sheet: (i) the entire 
lease liability and (ii) the entire right-of-use asset, unless there is 
a sublease with the joint operators. On the other hand, if the lease 
contract is signed by all the partners of the venture, the group

recognises its share of the right-of-use asset and lease liability 
based on its working interest. If the group does not have primary 
responsibility for the lease liability, it does not recognise any right-
of-use asset or lease liability related to the lease contract.

The interest cost on lease Liability (computed using effective interest 
method). is expensed in the Consolidated statement of profit and 
loss unless eligible for capitalization as per accounting policy below 
on “Borrowing costs”. 

The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract 
as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract in 
accordance with Ind AS 116 and allocates the consideration in the 
contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-
alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone 
price of the non-lease components except in case of  subsidiary 
HPCL which has elected not to separate non-lease components 
in a contract and account as one unified lease contract covering 
all underlying assets by using the practical expedient prescribed in 
the Standard, and the same has immaterial impact on consolidated 
financial statements.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and lease payments have been 
classified as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows. 

Group as Lessor:

A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially 
all the risks and rewards incidental to  ownership of an underlying 
asset. In all other cases, it is treated as operating lease. 

3.21. Foreign Exchange Transactions

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian 
Rupees (`), which is the Company’s functional currency and the 
Group’s presentation currency.

Transactions in currencies other than the respective entities’ 
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates 
of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end 
of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated using mean exchange rate prevailing 
on the last day of the reporting period. Non-monetary items 
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value 
was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date of transaction.

Exchange differences on monetary items are recognized in the 
consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which 
they arise except for exchange differences on foreign currency 
borrowings relating to assets under construction for future 
productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets 
when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those 
foreign currency borrowings.

Exchange differences on monetary items are recognized in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which 
they arise except for exchange differences on monetary item that 
forms part of a Group’s net investment in a foreign operation are 
recognized initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified 
from equity to the consolidated statement of profit and loss on 
repayment of the monetary items.

Exchange difference arising in respect of long term foreign 
currency monetary items is recognized in the statement of profit 

and loss except for the exchange difference related to long term 
foreign currency monetary items recognized as at March 31, 2016, 
in so far as, these related to the acquisition of depreciable assets, 
are adjusted against the cost of such assets and depreciate the 
said adjustment, over the balance life of asset and in other cases 
amortised over the balance period of the long term foreign currency 
monetary assets or liabilities.

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the 
Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, a disposal involving 
loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, 
or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an 
associate that includes a foreign operation of which the retained 
interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences 
accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to 
the owners of the Company are reclassified to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.

In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that 
includes a foreign operation that does not result in the Group losing 
control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated 
exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests 
and are not recognized in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of 
associates or joint arrangements that do not result in the Group 
losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share 
of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments to identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed through acquisition of a foreign 
operation are treated as assets and liabilities of foreign operation 
and translated at rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each 
reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognized in 
other comprehensive income.

Entities with functional currency other than presentation currency 
are translated to the presentation currency in Indian Rupees (`). The 
Group has applied the following principles for translating its results 
and financial position from functional currency to presentation 
currency (`):-

• Assets and liabilities (excluding equity share capital and 
other equity) for each balance sheet presented (i.e. including 
comparatives) has been translated at the closing rate at the date 
of that balance sheet;

• Equity share capital including equity component of compound 
financial instruments have been translated at exchange rates at 
the dates of transaction. Capital reserve has been translated at 
exchange rate at the dates of transaction. Other reserves have 
been translated using average exchange rates of the period to 
which it relates;

• Income and expenses for each consolidated statement of profit 
and loss presented have been translated at exchange rates at the 
dates of transaction except for certain items average rate for the 
period is used;

• The joint-interest billing statement given by the operators under 
overseas joint operations has been translated at the monthly/
quarterly average rate, considering the transactions are occurring 
during the period

3.22. Employee Benefits

Employee benefits include salaries, wages, contributory provident 
fund, gratuity, leave encashment towards un-availed leave, 
compensated absences, post-retirement medical benefits and 
other terminal benefits.



337

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

All short term employee benefits are recognized at their undiscounted 
amount in the accounting period in which they are incurred.

Defined contribution plans

Employee Benefit under defined contribution plans comprising 
contributory provident fund, Post Retirement benefit scheme, 
Employee Pension Scheme - 1995, composite social security 
scheme etc. is recognized based on the undiscounted amount of 
obligations of the Group to contribute to the plan. The same is paid 
to a fund administered through a separate trust.

Defined benefit plans

Defined employee benefit plans comprising of gratuity, post-
retirement medical benefits and other terminal benefits, are 
recognized based on the present value of defined benefit obligation 
which is computed using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual 
reporting period. These are accounted either as current employee 
cost or included in cost of assets as permitted.

Net interest on the net defined liability is calculated by applying 
the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined 
benefit liability or asset and is recognized in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss except those included in cost of assets as permitted.

Remeasurement of defined retirement benefit plans except for 
leave encashment towards un-availed leave and compensated 
absences, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the 
changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan 
assets (excluding net interest as defined above), are recognized 
in other comprehensive income except those included in cost of 
assets as permitted in the period in which they occur and are not 
subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. 

The Group contributes all ascertained liabilities with respect to 
gratuity to the respective Gratuity Fund Trust. All ascertained 
liabilities for un-availed leave and post retirement medical benefits 
are funded with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) except 
in case of some subsidiaries. Other defined benefit schemes are 
unfunded.

The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements represents the actual deficit or surplus in 
the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this 
calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits 
available in the form of reductions in future contributions to the 
plans.

Other long term employee benefits

Other long term employee benefit comprises of leave encashment 
towards un-availed leave and compensated absences, these are 
recognized based on the present value of defined obligation which 
is computed using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting 
period. These are accounted for either as current employee cost or 
included in cost of assets as permitted.

Re-measurements of leave encashment towards un-availed leave 
and compensated absences are recognized in the Statement of 
profit and loss except those included in cost of assets as permitted 
in the period in which they occur.

3.23. Voluntary Retirement Scheme 

Expenditure on Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) is charged to 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred.

3.24. General Administrative Expenses

General administrative expenses which are directly attributable are 

allocated to activities and the balance is charged to Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

3.25. Insurance claims

Insurance claims are accounted for on the basis of claims admitted/
expected to be admitted to the extent that the amount recoverable 
can be measured reliably and it is virtually certain to expect ultimate 
collection.

3.26. Research and Development Expenditure

Expenditure of capital nature are capitalised and expenses of 
revenue nature are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss, as and when incurred.

3.27. Income Taxes

Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense 
and deferred tax.

(i) Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s current tax 
is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and any 
adjustment to tax payable in repect of previous year.

(ii) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognized using balance sheet method, providing 
for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally 
recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than 
in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. In 
addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled 
or the asset realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, 
and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the 
tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or 
settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented separately in 
Consolidated Balance sheet except where there is a right of set-off 
within fiscal jurisdictions and an intention to settle such balances 
on a net basis.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary 
differences associated with investment in subsidiaries and associate 
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences 
associated with such interests are recognized only to the extent 
that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against 
which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they 
are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in 
accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future 
economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future 
income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognized as deferred 
tax asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the asset can 
be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic 
benefit associated with asset will be realized.

(iii) Current and deferred tax for the year

Current and deferred tax expense is recognized in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items that 
are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, 
in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

3.28. Borrowing Costs

Borrowing costs including finance cost on lease liability specifically 
identified to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets or 
development wells or exploratory wells is capitalized as part of such 
assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial 
period of time to get ready for intended use. All other borrowing 
costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences arising from 
foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as 
an adjustment to interest costs i.e. equivalent to the extent to which 
the exchange loss does not exceed the difference between the cost 
of borrowing in functional currency (`) when compared to the cost 
of borrowing in a foreign currency.

When there is an unrealised exchange loss which is treated as 
an adjustment to interest and subsequently there is a realised or 
unrealised gain in respect of the settlement or translation of the 
same borrowing, the gain to the extent of the loss previously 
recognised as an adjustment is recognised as an adjustment to 
interest.

3.29. Rig Days Costs

Rig movement costs are booked to the next location drilled/planned 
for drilling. Abnormal Rig days’ costs are considered as un-allocable 
and charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

3.30. Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of 
the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the 
cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of 
the time value of money is material).

Contingent assets are disclosed in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements by way of notes to accounts when an inflow of economic 
benefits is probable.

Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements by way of notes to accounts, unless possibility of 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefit is remote. 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of 
the management/independent experts. These are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current 
management estimate.

3.31. Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at 
fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other 
than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the 
financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial 
recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition 
of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss. 

3.32. Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

(i) Classification as debt or equity instruments

Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified 
as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the 
substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a 
financial liability and an equity instrument.

(ii) Compound financial instruments

The component parts of compound financial instruments issued by 
the Group are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity 
in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. 
A conversion option that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed 
amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the 
Company’s own equity instruments is an equity instrument.

At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is 
estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-
convertible instruments. This amount is recognized as a liability 
on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method 
until extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument’s maturity 
date. The conversion option classified as equity is determined 
by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair 
value of the compound financial instrument as a whole. This is 
recognized and included in equity, net of income tax effects, and 
is not subsequently remeasured. In addition, the conversion option 
classified as equity will remain in equity until the conversion option 
is exercised, in which case, the balance recognized in equity will 
be transferred to other component of equity. When the conversion 
option remains unexercised at the maturity date of the convertible 
note, the balance recognized in equity will be transferred to retained 
earnings. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss upon 
conversion or expiration of the conversion option.

Transaction costs that relate to the issue of the convertible notes 
are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to 
the allocation of the gross proceeds. Transaction costs relating to 
the equity component are recognized directly in equity. Transaction 
costs relating to the liability component are included in the carrying 



339

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

amount of the liability component and are amortised over the lives 
of the convertible notes using the effective interest method.

3.33. Financial assets

(i) Cash and cash equivalents 

The Group considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject 
to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original 
maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase, to be 
cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances 
with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

(ii) Financial assets at amortised cost 

Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method if these financial assets are held 
within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.

(iii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a 
business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of 
the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.

The Group has made an irrevocable election to present in other 
comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of 
equity investments not held for trading.

(iv) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss 
unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income on initial recognition.

(v) Impairment of financial assets 

The Group assesses at each Consolidated Balance Sheet date 
whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. 
Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’ requires expected credit losses 
to be measured through a loss allowance. The Group recognises 
lifetime expected losses for trade receivables that do not constitute 
a financing transaction. For all other financial assets, expected credit 
losses are measured at an amount equal to 12 month expected 
credit losses or at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses, 
if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly 
since initial recognition.

(vi) Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the asset to another party. 

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety (except for equity 
instruments designated as FVTOCI), the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received 
and receivable is recognized in the Consolidated  Statement of 
Profit and Loss.

3.34. Financial liabilities 

(i) Financial liabilities 

Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.

(ii) Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, 
the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. 
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial 
liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

When an existing financial liability is exchanged with another 
financial liability, from the existing lender of the debt instrument 
on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
financial liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the original financial 
liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference 
in the respective carrying amount is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

3.35. Derivative financial instruments 

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments 
to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate 
risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts and interest 
rate swaps. 

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the 
derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. 
The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately 
unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging 
instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or 
loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the 
nature of the hedged item.

Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are 
not financial assets within the scope of Ind AS 109 ‘Financial 
Instruments’ are treated as separate derivatives when their risks 
and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host 
contracts and the host contracts are not measured at fair value 
through profit & Loss (FVTPL).

Derivatives Contracts designated as hedging instruments:

Wherever Hedge Accounting is undertaken, at the inception of a 
hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents a) 
the hedge relationship to which it wishes to apply hedge accounting 
and b) the risk management objective and strategy. In such cases, 
the derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value 
with due assessment to effectiveness of the hedge instrument. 
By following Cash Flow Hedges, the effective portion of changes 
in the fair value is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income 
(OCI) and accumulated under Cash Flow Hedge Reserve within 
Other Equity whereas the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized 
immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss and presented 
under Other Income or Other Expenses, as the case may be. The 
effective portion, previously recognized in OCI and accumulated 
as Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is reclassified to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the subsequent period, during which, the hedged 
expected future cash flows affect profit or loss and further guided 
to the same line item to which the underlying is accounted.  Further, 
in case of previously recognized forecasted transaction, upon the 
knowledge of its non-occurrence, the effective portion of cumulative 
gain or loss is forthwith recognized by transferring from Cash Flow 
Hedge Reserve to the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the amount 
accumulated in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is a loss and Corporation 
expects that all or a portion of that loss will not be recovered in one 
or more future period, the Corporation immediately reclassifies the 
amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as a 
reclassification adjustment. The hedge accounting is discontinued 
when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

Derivatives Contracts not designated as hedging instruments

The derivative financial instruments are accounted at fair value 
through Profit or Loss and presented under Other Income or Other 
Expenses, as the case may be. 

3.36. Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously.

3.37. Investment property

Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for 
capital appreciation. Investment properties are measured initially at 
cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment properties are measured in accordance with Ind AS 16 
requirements for cost model. Free hold Land and Properties under 
construction are not depreciated.

In case of a Subsidary Petronet MHB Ltd, building component of 
investment property is depreciated over 30 years from the date of 
original construction, based on the useful life prescribed in Schedule 
II to the Companies Act, 2013 using the straight-line method.  The 
management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic 
and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets 
are likely to be used.

An investment property is derecognized upon disposal or when 
the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and 
no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any 

gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the property (calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in 
which the property is derecognized.

3.38. Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the net 
profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is 
computed by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted average 
number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per 
share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that 
could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.

3.39. Statement of Cash Flows 

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit 
for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-
cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating 
cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses 
associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows 
are segregated into operating, investing and financing activities.

3.40. Segment Reporting

Operating segments are identified and reported taking into account 
the different risks and returns, the organization structure and 
the internal reporting systems. The geographical segments are 
based on assets as primary segments and business segments as 
secondary segments.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

24/3/2021-CL-III dated April 14, 2022, OMPL (ONGC Mangalore 
Petrochemicals Limited) has been amalgamated with MRPL 
(Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited) with effect from 
April 1, 2021 (‘the appointed date’). 

e)  The effective group holding in Joint Venture Mangalore SEZ  
has increased from 26.77% to 26.78% in the current year due 
to increase in shareholding in MRPL (refer Note No.(a) above). 
Similarly, the shareholding in MSEZ Power Ltd has increased from 
26.77% to 26.78% and Mangalore STP has increased from 18.74% 
to 18.75% in the current year. 

f)  Prize Petroleum Company Limited has wholly owned subsidiary 
namely Prize Petroleum International PTE Limited. HPCL – Mittal 
Energy Limited has a 100% subsidiary namely HPCL – Mittal 
Pipelines Limited. 

g)  HPCL Middle East FZCO, a 100% Subsidiary of HPCL was 
incorporated as a Free Zone Company under Dubai Airport Free 
Zone for Trading in Lubricants & Grease, Petrochemicals and 
Refined Oil Products in Middle East and Africa.

h)  Hindustan Colas Private Limited(HINCOL) having one joint venture 
namely Dust-A-Side Hincol Limited.

i)  As of 31st March 2014, Bhagyanagar Gas Limited (BGL) had a  
paid up equity capital of ` 0.05 million, in which HPCL and GAIL 
were holding 24.99% each and the balance 50.02% of shares were 
held by Kakinada Seaports Ltd (KSPL) on warehousing basis. 
In addition, HPCL and GAIL had paid ` 224.90 million each as 
Advance against Equity / Share application money (totaling to  
` 449.80 million). On 20th August 2014, BGL allotted 22,487,500 
shares on preferential basis to each of HPCL and GAIL towards 
the money paid earlier. Accordingly, HPCL’s shareholding in BGL 
had increased to 48.73%. KSPL challenged this in the Company 
Law Board (CLB), Chennai Bench which dismissed it on 14th 
September 2014. Against this, KSPL moved the High Court, 
Telangana, which did not stay the dismissal order of CLB. Pending 
adjudication of the appeal by KSPL before the High Court, in the 
preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) of HPCL, 
the shareholding was considered at 24.99% till 31st March 2020. 
However, taking all the facts into consideration, including receipt 
of dividend on the entire stake of 48.73% during financial year 
2020-21 and the Articles of Associations of BGL, the shareholding 
is being considered as at 48.73%, in the preparation of CFS of 
HPCL, effective financial year 2020-21. Had BGL continued to be 
consolidated at 24.99%, share of consolidated net profit from BGL 
for the financial year 2020-21 would have been lower by `230.10 
million.

j)   HPCL LNG Limited (HPLNG), [formerly known as HPCL Shapoorji 
Energy Private Limited (HSEPL)], was incorporated in October 
2013 as a  joint venture company of HPCL and SP Ports Private 
Limited to construct and operate a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) 
regasification terminal at greenfield port of Chhara, Gir Somnath 
District, Gujarat. On March 30,2021, HPCL had acquired the 
entire shares owned by SP Ports Private Limited and upon such 
acquisition, HPLNG became a wholly owned subsidiary of HPCL. 
In compliance with IndAS-103 “Business Combinations”, in the 
year 2020-21, a goodwill of ` 3,049.20 million was recognized and 
pursuant to fair valuation of existing held equity interest, a gain of

being a not-for-profit company.

5. Critical Accounting Judgments, Assumptions and Key Sources of 
Estimation Uncertainty 

Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies 
used in preparing the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements 
is the need for Management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes 
could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are 
affected.

Key source of judgments, assumptions and estimation uncertainty 
in the preparation of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements 
which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are in respect 
of functional currency, Oil and Gas reserves, impairment, useful 
lives of Property, Plant and Equipment, depletion of oil and gas 
assets, decommissioning provision, employee benefit obligations, 
provisions, provision for income tax,  measurement of deferred tax 
assets and contingent assets & liabilities.

5.1. Critical judgments in applying accounting policies 

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations (refer Note No. 5.2), that the Management have made 
in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and 
that have the significant effect on the amounts recognized in the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.

(a) Determination of functional currency 

Currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group’s 
entities operates (“the functional currency”) is Indian Rupee (`) in 
which the entities primarily generates and expends cash. However, 
primary economic environment in which OVL group (ONGC Videsh 
Ltd and its subsidiaries) is US Dollar which is the currency in which it 
primarily generates and expends cash and accordingly the functional 
currency of OVL group has been assessed as US Dollar.

(b) Classification of investment 

Judgement is required in assessing the level of control obtained in 
a transaction to acquire an interest in another entity; depending 
upon the facts and circumstances in each case, the Company may 
obtain control, joint control or significant influence over the entity 
or arrangement. Transactions which give the Company control of a 
business are business combinations. If the Company obtains joint 
control of an arrangement, judgement is also required to assess 
whether the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. If the 
Company has neither control nor joint control, it may be in a position 
to exercise significant influence over the entity, which is then classified 
as an associate.

(i) In ONGC Petro additions Limited as joint venture (OPaL)

The Company has 49.36% equity interest in OPaL. The Company has 
subscribed for 3,451.24 million (previous year 3,451.24 million) share

warrants as at March 31, 2022 entitling the Company to exchange 
each warrant with an equity share of face value of ` 10 each against 
which ` 9.75 has been paid. 

Further the Company has entered into an arrangement for backstopping 
support towards repayment of principal and coupon of Compulsory 
Convertible Debentures (CCDs) amounting to ` 77,780.00 million 
(previous year ` 77,780.00 million) issued by ONGC Petro additions 
Limited in three tranches. The outstanding interest accrued as at 
March 31, 2022 is ` 1,699.28 million (Previous year ` 1,926.75 million).

The Company has evaluated the interest in OPaL to be in the nature 
of joint venture as the shareholder agreement between OPaL and the 
Joint Venture partners, Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) and the 
company provides for sharing of control on the decisions relating to 
specified activities of OPaL by both the Joint Venture partners.

(ii) In associates despite participating share being less than 20%

Considering the power to participate in the financial and operating 
policy decisions of the investees exercised by the Group in 
accordance with the applicable agreements and /or otherwise, 
the following entities are considered associates of the Group 
despite the participating interest / shareholding percentage / right 
percentage being less than 20%:

• South East Asia Gas Pipeline (shareholding of the Group 8.347%)

• Petro Carabobo S.A., Venezuela (shareholding of the Group 11%)

The Company has 12.50% equity interest in PLL. It was classified as 
Joint Venture in Previous GAAP, however, in terms of Para 7 of Ind 
AS 111 “Joint Arrangements”, unanimous consent of all promoters 
is not required in relevant activities in PLL and therefore PLL is not 
classified as Joint Venture. The Company has significant influence 
on PLL by way of having right to appoint a director in PLL and 
participate in its business decisions, therefore the same has been 
classified as an Associate of the Company.

(c) In Joint venture despite participating share more than 50%

In case of HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd. (HRRL) wherein subsidiary 
company HPCL held majority voting rights  (74% stake), other 
JV partner has substantive participative rights through its right to 
affirmative vote items. Accordingly, being a company with joint 
control, HRRL have been considered as Joint Venture company for 
the purpose of consolidation of financial statement under Ind AS. 
However, for the purpose of Companies Act 2013, HRRL has been 
classified as subsidiary as defined under section 2 therein.

(d) Determining whether an arrangement contain leases and classification 
of leases 

The Group enters into hiring/service arrangements for various 
assets/services. The Group evaluates whether a contract contains 
a lease or not, in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 116. 
This requires significant judgements including but not limited to, 
whether asset is implicitly identified, substantive substitution rights 
available with the supplier, decision making rights with respect to 
how the underlying asset will be used, economic substance of the 
arrangement, etc. 

Determining lease term (including extension and termination options) 

The Group considers the lease term as the non-cancellable period 
of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the 
lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. Assessment 
of extension/termination options is made on lease by lease basis, 
on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances. The lease term is 
reassessed if an option is actually exercised. In case of contracts. 
where the Group has the option to hire and de-hire the underlying 
asset in some circumstances (such as operational requirements), 
the lease term is considered to be initial contract period. 

Identifying lease payments for computation of lease liability  

To identify fixed (including in-substance fixed) lease payments. the 
Group consider the non-operating day rate/standby as minimum 
fixed lease payments for the purpose of computation of lease 
liability and corresponding right of use asset. 

Low value leases 

Ind AS 116 requires assessment of whether an underlying asset is of 
low value. if lessee opts for the option of not to apply the recognition 
and measurement requirements of Ind AS 116 to leases where the 
underlying asset is of low value. For the purpose of determining low 
value, the Group has considered nature of assets and concept of 
materiality as defined in Ind AS 1 and the conceptual framework of 
Ind AS which involve significant judgement. 

(e) Evaluation of indicators for impairment of Oil and Gas Assets 

The evaluation of applicability of indicators of impairment of assets 
requires assessment of external factors (significant decline in 
asset’s value, significant changes in the technological, market, 
economic or legal environment, market interest rates etc.) and 
internal factors (obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, 
poor economic performance of the asset etc.) which could result in 
significant change in recoverable amount of the Oil and Gas Assets.

(f) Oil & Gas Accounting 

The determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural 
gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is 
usually made within one year of well completion, but can take 
longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure. 
Exploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil 
and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure 
(e.g. an offshore platform or a pipeline) would be required before 
production could begin, and where the economic viability of that 
major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion 
of further exploration work in the area, remain capitalized on the 
consolidated balance sheet as long as additional exploration or 
appraisal work is under way or firmly planned.

It is not unusual to have exploration wells and exploratory-type 
stratigraphic test wells remaining suspended on the consolidated 
balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling 
and seismic work on the potential oil and natural gas field is 
performed or while the optimum development plans and timing are 
established. All such carried costs are subject to regular technical, 
commercial and management review on at least an annual basis to 
confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value 
from, the discovery. Where this is no longer the case, the costs are 
immediately expensed. 

(g) Deferred tax liability / deferred tax asset in respect of undistributed 
profits/losses of subsidiaries, branches, investments in associates and 
joint ventures

The management exercises judgement in accounting for deferred 
tax liability / deferred tax asset in respect of Group’s investments 
in respect of undistributed profits/losses of subsidiaries, branches, 
investments in associates and joint ventures. In the judgement 
of the management, in respect of undistributed profits/losses 
of subsidiaries, branches, investments in joint ventures, the 
management is able to control the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences and the temporary differences will not be 
reversed in the foreseeable future.

Accordingly, the Group does not recognise a deferred tax liability 
for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in 
subsidiaries, branches and interests in joint ventures.

5.2. Assumptions and key sources of estimation uncertainty 

Information about estimates and assumptions that have the 
significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses is provided below. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.

(a) Estimation of provision  for decommissioning 

The Group estimates provision for decommissioning as per 
the principles of Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets’ for the future decommissioning of Oil 
& Gas assets at the end of their economic lives. Most of these 
decommissioning activities would be in the future, the exact 
requirements that may have to be met when the removal events occur 
involve uncertainty. Technologies and costs for decommissioning 
are constantly changing. The timing and amounts of future cash 
flows are subject to significant uncertainty. 

The timing and amount of future expenditures are reviewed annually 
or when there is a material change, together with rate of inflation 
for escalation of current cost estimates and the interest rate used 
in discounting the cash flows. The economic life of the Oil & Gas 
assets is estimated on the basis of long term production profile 
of the relevant Oil & Gas asset and the management expects that 
the Mining Lease(s) expired will be extended before the end of the 
economic life of the related assets.

(b) Determining discount rate for computation of lease liability 

For computation of lease liability. Ind AS 116 requires lessee to use 
their incremental borrowing rate as discount rate if the rate implicit 
in the lease contract cannot be readily determined. 

For leases denominated in Group functional currency, the group 
considers the  incremental  borrowing  rate to  be  risk  free  rate 
of government bond as adjusted with applicable credit risk spread 
and other lease  specific  adjustments  like  relevant  lease  term.  For 
leases denominated in foreign currency, the Group considers the 
incremental borrowing rate as risk free rate based on US treasury 
bills as adjusted with applicable credit risk spread and other lease 
specific adjustments like relevant lease term and currency of the 
obligation. 

(c) Determination of cash generating unit (CGU) 

The Group is engaged mainly in the business of oil and gas 
exploration and production in Onshore and Offshore. In case 
of onshore assets, the fields are using common production/
transportation facilities and are sufficiently economically 
interdependent to constitute a single cash generating unit (CGU). 
Accordingly, impairment test of all onshore fields in India is 
performed in aggregate of all those fields at the Asset Level. In case 
of Offshore Assets, a field is generally considered as CGU except 
for fields which are developed as a Cluster or group of Clusters, for 
which common facilities are used, in which case the impairment 
testing is performed in aggregate for all the fields included in the 
cluster or group of Clusters.

(d) Impairment of assets 

Determination as to whether, and by how much, a CGU is impaired 
involves Management estimates on uncertain matters such as 
future prices, the effects of inflation on operating expenses, discount 
rates, production profiles for crude oil, natural gas and value added  
products. For Oil & Gas assets, the expected future cash flows are 
estimated using Management’s best estimate of future crude oil 
and natural gas prices, production and reserves volumes. 

The present values of cash flows are determined by applying pre 
tax-discount rates for crude oil and value added products revenue, 
which are measured in US$.  Future cash inflows from sale of crude 

oil and value added products are estimated using Management’s 
best estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices and its co-
relations with benchmark crudes and other petroleum products. 

Future cash flows from sale of natural gas are also computed 
based on the expected future prices on the basis of the notification 
issued by the Government of India and discounted applying the 
rate applicable to the cash flows measured in US$ in view of the 
new pricing guidelines issued by GoI.  

Further, in respect of subsidiary company ONGC Videsh Ltd,  the 
present values of cash flows are determined by applying pre-tax 
discount rates that reflects current market assessments of time value 
of money and the risks specific to the liability in respect of each of 
the CGUs. Future cash inflows from sale of crude oil are computed 
using the future prices, on the basis of market-based forward prices 
of the Dated Brent crude oil as per assessment by Bloomberg or 
Brent crude oil forward/forecast prices by independent reputed 
third parties and its co-relations with benchmark crudes and other 
petroleum products. Future cash flows from sale of natural gas 
are also computed based on the expected future prices on the 
basis of the prices determined in accordance with the respective 
agreements and / or market forecast. In assessing the production 
profile the Company assesses its reserves through the full period, 
considering all contractually possible extensions, over which they 
are economically producible without restricting them to the term of 
license. 

The discount rate used is based upon the cost of capital from an 
established model. 

The Value in use of the producing/developing CGUs is determined 
under a multi-stage approach, wherein future cash flows are 
initially estimated based on Proved Developed Reserves. Under 
circumstances where the further development of the fields in 
the CGUs is under progress and where the carrying value of the 
CGUs is not likely to be recovered through exploitation of proved 
developed reserves alone, the Proved and probable reserves (2P) 
of the CGUs are also taken for the purpose of estimating future 
cash flows. In such cases, full estimate of the expected cost of 
evaluation/development is also considered while determining the 
value in use. In assessing the production profile the group assesses 
its reserves through the full period, considering all contractually 
possible extensions, over which they are economically producible 
without restricting them to the term of license. 

The discount rates applied in the assessment of impairment 
calculation are re-assessed each year. 

(e) Estimation of uncertainties relating to the special operations being 
carried out by Russia in Ukraine:

The Group has considered the possible effects that may result from 
the special operations, carried out by Russia in Ukraine, various 
sanctions have been imposed on Russia by several countries. 
These economic sanctions have a cascading effect on the 
economies globally. 

The Group has assessed the impact of these sanctions on its 
operations/assets in Russia. Subsidiary OVL has 3 assets in 
Russia, namely Sakhalin-1 (Joint arrangement – 20% Stake), 
Vankorneft (Associate – 26% Stake) and Imperial Energy (Wholly 
owned subsidiary).  

a. Sakhalin-1 project is operated by ENL, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil. 
With the current geo-political situation, further to the announcement 
by Exxon Mobil (Operator-ENL) to discontinue operations in the 
Sakhalin-1 project, the consortium is heading towards a transition 
of operatorship which is in progress. The temporary unavailability of 
International Group of Protection & Indemnity (IG P&I) insurance for

crude oil tankers hired by the project for delivery of its crude oil to 
international buyers has created a logistic constraint for evacuation 
of its production from May 22 thereby resulting in reduced output 
from the project. The situation is likely to improve with the efforts of 
the consortium to actively resolve the insurance issues.

b. JSC Vankorneft being an equity-accounted entity is entitled 
to dividend which was due till March 2022 has been received. 
Production from the field continues as per the Business Plan 2022. 

c. Imperial Energy’s operations are continuing as per the Business 
Plan except for the value of crude oil sales being affected due to 
prevailing discount. 

The Group has considered the above aspect in assessing the 
impairment of its CGUs in Russia under the consolidated financial 
statements.

(f) Estimation of reserves

Management estimates reserves in relation to all the Oil and Gas 
Assets based on the policies and procedures determined by 
the Reserves Estimation Committee of the Company (REC). The 
estimates so determined are used for the computation of depletion 
and impairment testing.

The year-end reserves of the Group are estimated by the REC which 
follows international reservoir engineering procedures consistently. For 
reporting its petroleum resources, group follows universally accepted 
Petroleum Resources Management System-PRMS (2018)) sponsored 
by Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), World Petroleum Council 
(WPC), American Association of Petroleum Geologists(AAPG), Society 
of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE), Society of Exploration 
Geophysicists (SEG), Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts 
(SPWLA) and European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers 
(EAGE). 

PRMS(2018) defines Proved Reserves under Reserves category 
as those quantities of petroleum that, by analysis of geoscience 
and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty 
to be commercially recoverable from a given date forward from 
known reservoirs and under defined economic conditions, operating 
methods, and government regulations. Further it defines Developed 
Reserves as expected quantities to be recovered from existing wells 
and facilities and Undeveloped Reserves as the Quantities expected 
to be recovered through future significant investments. 

Volumetric estimation is the main procedure in estimation which uses 
reservoir rock and fluid properties to calculate hydrocarbons in-place 
and then estimate that portion which will be recovered from it. As the 
field gets matured and reasonably good production history is available, 
then performance methods such as material balance, simulation, 
decline curve analysis are applied to get more accurate assessments.

The annual revision of estimates is based on the yearly exploratory 
and development activities and results thereof. New in-place 
Volume and Estimated Ultimatate Recovery(EUR) are estimated 

for new field discoveries or new pool discoveries in already 
discovered fields. Also, delineation/appraisal activities lead to 
revision in estimates due to new sub-surface data. Similarly, review 
/reinterpretation exercise is also carried out for old fields due to 
necessity of revision in petro-physical parameters, updating of 
static and dynamic models and performance analysis leading to 
change in reserves. Intervention of new technology, change in 
classifications and contractual provisions also necessitate revision 
in estimation of Reserves.

As per Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil 
and Gas Reserves Information (revised June 2019), approved by 
the SPE Board on June 25, 2019 

“The reliability of Reserves information is considerably affected by 
several factors. Initially, it should be noted that Reserves information 
is imprecise as a result of the inherent uncertainties in, and the 
limited nature of, the accumulation and interpretation of data 
upon which the estimating and auditing of Reserves information 
is predicated. Moreover, the methods and data used in estimating 
Reserves information are often necessarily indirect or analogical in 
character rather than direct or deductive...”

… “the estimation of Reserves and other Reserves information is 
an imprecise science because of the many unknown geological 
and reservoir factors that can only be estimated through sampling 
techniques. Reserves are therefore only estimates, and they cannot 
be audited for the purpose of verifying exactness…” 

The Group uses the services of third party agencies for due 
diligence and it gets the reserves of its assets audited periodically 
by third party internationally reputed consultants who adopt latest 
industry practices for their evaluation.

(g)  Defined benefit obligation (DBO) 

Management’s estimate of the DBO is based on a number of critical 
underlying assumptions such as standard rates of inflation, medical 
cost trends, mortality, discount rate and anticipation of future salary 
increases. Variation in these assumptions may significantly impact the 
DBO amount and the annual defined benefit expenses.

(h) Litigations

From time to time, the Group is subject to legal proceedings and the 
ultimate outcome of each being always subject to many uncertainties 
inherent in litigation. A provision for litigation is made when it is 
considered probable that a payment will be made and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgement is made 
when evaluating, among other factors, the probability of unfavourable 
outcome and the liability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount 
of potential loss. Provision for litigations  are reviewed at the end of 
each accounting period and revisions made for the changes in facts 
and circumstances.

6.1. Except for the subsidiary OVL, the Group has elected to continue 
with the carrying value of its Oil and Gas Assets recognized as of 
April 1, 2015 (transition date) measured as per the Previous GAAP 
and used that carrying value as its deemed cost as on the transition 
date as per Para D7AA of Ind AS 101  except for decommissioning 
and restoration provision included in the cost of Oil and Gas Assets 
which have been adjusted in terms of para D21 of Ind AS 101 ‘First 
–time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards’.

6.2. During the year 2016-17, Tapti A series facilities which were part 
of the assets of PMT Joint Operation (JO) and surrendered by the JO 
to the Government of India (GoI) as per the terms of JO agreement 
were transferred by GoI to the Company free of cost as its nominee 
and recorded as a non-monetary grant. During the year 2019-20, the 
Company opted to recognize the non-monetary government grant 
at nominal value and recorded the said facilities at nominal value, 
in line with amendment in Ind AS 20 ‘Accounting for Government 
Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance’ vide Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment Rules, 2018 
(the ‘Rules’). These assets were decapitalised / retired to the extent 
of the Company’s share in the Joint Operation. 

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India (GoI) 
vide letter dated May 31, 2019 assigned the Panna-Mukta fields 
w.e.f. December 22, 2019 on nomination basis to the Company 
on expiry of present PSC without any cost to ensure continuity of 
operation. Being a non-monetary grant, the Company has recorded 
these assets and grant at a nominal value.

Subsequent to assignment of Panna-Mukta field to the Company 
GoI has directed JV partners of the PMT (Panna Mukta & Tapti) field 
to transfer the existing SRF fund maintained for decommissioning 
obligation for Tapti Part A facility and Panna Mukta fields to the 

Company along with full financial and physical liability of site 
restoration and decommissioning of Panna Mukta fields and Tapti 
Part A facilities. Accordingly, in the year 2019-20 the Company 
received SRF fund of $ 33.81 million (` 2,402.18 million) for Tapti 
Part-A facilities and $ 598.24 million (` 42,506.87 million) for Panna 
Mukta fields from JV partners  (including the Company share of 40% 
in the fields) and acquired the corresponding decommissioning 
obligation with the conditions that Company will maintain separate 
dedicated SRF accounts under Site Restoration Fund scheme, 
1999 and extent guidelines of SRF, the Company will not utilise 
the fund of dedicated SRF fund of Panna- Mukta Fields and Tapti 
Part-A facilities for any other purpose, other than one defined under 
SRF scheme/guidelines. Company shall periodically carry out the 
re-estimation of cost of decommissioning of Panna- Mukta Fields 
and Tapti Part-A facilities as per existing Company policy and 
contribute to SRF account as per Company policy in nomination 
fields. In case, final actual cost of decommissioning of facilities 
of Panna-Mukta fields at the time of physical decommissioning is 
higher than approved decommissioning cost plus the accumulated 
amount, Company will contribute the additional amount required 
for decommissioning. However, in case the actual cost at the time 
of decommissioning is less than the accumulated amount, the 
balance amount will be transferred to the Government of India. 
The Company is mandated to pay Rupee one per annum as rental 
charges to Government of India for use of Tapti A facilities till its 
abandonment.

6.3. Union Cabinet, Government of India in its meeting held on 
February 19, 2019, on reforms in Exploration and Licensing Policy 
for enhancing domestic exploration and production of oil and gas, 
directed to bid out identified marginal nomination fields operated

by National Oil Companies. In pursuance to decision of Union 
Cabinet, the Company offered 64 such marginal fields which are 
clustered geographically in 17 contract areas for bidding under the 
supervision of Directorate General of Hydrocarbons. The Company 
issued notice of award (NOA) for 49 marginal fields covering 13 
contract areas through the bidding process and signed contacts 
for production enhancement for 21 marginal fields and NOA of 28 
fields were cancelled due to non-submission of performance bank 
guarantee  by the successful bidders.

Out of 21 fields for which contracts have been signed, the company 
has handed over 19 fields to the contractors upto March 31, 2022 
and handing over of 2 fields is in progress. For bid out of balance 43 
marginal nomination fields in 11 Contract Areas the company had 
issued notice inviting tenders for 2nd Bid round and the technical 
bids received for the same are under evaluation. The impact of the 
same on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 
2022 is immaterial.

6.4.Cyclone Tauktae hit Arabian Sea off the coast of Mumbai in the 
early hours of May 17, 2021 where the company’s major production 
installations and drilling rigs are situated/operating. The cyclone 
has caused some damages to offshore facilities/platforms like 
twisting/breakages in instrument air line systems, staircases from 
lower deck to spider deck, interconnecting bridges, boat landing 
facilities, fire water and produced water pipelines, tearing and 
flying off of Insulation on equipment/vessels/rigs, helideck net and 

peripheral safety nets, crane booms/operator cabins/crane rope, 
disorientation of process piping, solar panels, disengagement of 
various fire proof doors and frames etc.

The occurrence of incident was intimated to the Insurance Company 
under Offshore insurance Package policy and the surveyors/
Loss adjustors have been appointed by the insurance Company 
for the incident. Physical survey of facilities could not take place 
immediately after Cyclone Tauktae due to travel restrictions on 
account of Covid-19. After relaxing of the travel restrictions, the 
physical survey of the damages to facilities have commenced 
in April 2022. The estimation of loss/damage due to cyclone is 
currently under assessment and the impact of the same on the 
carrying value of oil and gas assets is not material. 

6.5.The subsidiary company OVL has determined its functional 
currency as US$. Above foreign exchange difference represents 
differences on account of translation of the consolidated financial 
statements of the ONGC Videsh Limited from US$ to Group’s 
presentation currency “`”. Refer Note No. 3.21 and 5.1 (a).

6.6. The Group has participating interest in Block XXIV, Syria. The 
operations of the project have been suspended since April 29, 2012 
resulting from the conflict situation in the country. Consequently, the 
Group had fully impaired its share of Oil and Gas assets with an 
accumulated impairment as at March 31, 2022 of ` 80.52 million 
(previous year ` 78.12 million).

7.1. Except for subsidiary OVL , the Group has elected to continue 
with the carrying value of its other Property Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) recognized as of April 1, 2015 (transition date) measured as 
per the Previous GAAP and used that carrying value as its deemed 
cost as on the transition date as per Para D7AA of Ind AS 101 
except for decommissioning provisions included in the cost of other 
PPE which has been adjusted in terms of para D21 of Ind AS 101 
‘First –time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards’. The deemed 
cost is further reduced for the unamortised transaction cost on 
borrowings as at April 1, 2015, which were earlier capitalised with 
PPE. 

7.2. In respect of the Company, 

7.2.1. Building includes cost of undivided interest in land.

7.2.2. During the year 2016-17, Tapti A facilities which were part of 
the assets of PMT Joint Operation (JO) and surrendered by the JO 
to the Government of India (GoI) as per the terms of JO agreement 
were transferred by GoI to the Company free of cost as its nominee. 
During the year 2019-20, the Company opted to recognize the non-
monetary government grant at nominal value and recorded the 
said facilities at nominal value, in line with amendment in Ind AS 20 
‘Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government 
Assistance’ vide Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Second Amendment Rules, 2018 (the ‘Rules’).  These assets were 
decapitalised / retired to the extent of the Company’s share in the 
Joint Operation.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India vide 
letter dated May 31, 2019 has assigned the Panna-Mukta fields 
w.e.f. December 22, 2019 on nomination basis to the Company 
on expiry of present PSC without any cost to ensure continuity of 
operation. Being a non-monetary grant, the Company has recorded 
these assets and grant at a nominal value (refer Note No. 6.2). 

7.2.3. Cyclone Tauktae hit Arabian Sea off the coast of Mumbai in the 
early hours of May 17, 2021 where the company’s major production 
installations and drilling rigs are situated/operating. The cyclone 
has caused some damages to offshore facilities/platforms like 
twisting/breakages in instrument air line systems, staircases from 
lower deck to spider deck, interconnecting bridges, boat landing 
facilities, fire water and produced water pipelines, tearing and 
flying off of Insulation on equipment/vessels/rigs, helideck net and 
peripheral safety nets, crane booms/operator cabins/crane rope, 
disorientation of process piping, solar panels, disengagement of 
various fire proof doors and frames etc.

The occurrence of incident was intimated to the Insurance Company 
under Offshore insurance Package policy and the surveyors/
Loss adjustors have been appointed by the insurance Company 
for the incident. Physical survey of facilities could not take place 
immediately after Cyclone Tauktae due to travel restrictions on 
account of Covid-19. After relaxing of the travel restrictions, the 
physical survey of the damages to facilities have commenced 
in April 2022. The estimation of loss/damage due to cyclone is 
currently under assessment and the impact of the same on the 
carrying value of property plant & equipment is not material.

7.3. In respect of subsidiary MRPL,

7.3.1. Secured External Commercial Borrowings are secured by first 
pari passu charge over immovable Property, Plant & Equipment 
and first ranking pari passu charge over movable Property, Plant 
& equipment (including but not limited to Plant and Machinery, 
Spares, Tools, Furniture, Fixture, Vehicles and all other Movable 
Property, Plant & Equipment) both present and future. Loan from 
OIDB is secured by way of first ranking pari passu charge by way 
of hypothecation / mortgage only on Property, Plant & Equipment 
/ projects financed out of loan proceeds of OIDB. Working capital 

borrowings from consortium banks are secured by way of first 
ranking pari passu charge by way of hypothecation of Company’s 
stocks of Raw Material, Finished Goods, Stock-in-Process, Stores, 
Spares, Components, Trade receivables, outstanding Money 
Receivables, Claims, Bills, Contract, Engagements, Securities both 
present and future and further secured by second ranking pari 
passu charge over companies movable and immovable property 
(all Property, Plant & Equipment) both present and future.

7.3.2. Additions/(adjustments) to Plant and Equipment includes  
` 58.61 million [Year ended March 31, 2021 ` (173.96) million] in 
relation to foreign exchange differences capitalised as per para 
D13AA of Ind AS 101

7.3.3. As per the requirement of Ind AS 16  (Property, Plant and 
Equipment), the residual value and the useful life of an asset shall 
be reviewed at least at each financial year-end. During the current 
financial year, the estimated useful lives of Property, Plant and 
Equipment have been reviewed and revised wherever expectations 
differ from previous estimate, which is different from the useful life 
as indicated in Part C of Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013. The 
impact on account of above change is decrease in depreciation by 
` 1,141.81 million during current financial year. Overall future impact 
on the Property, Plant and Equipment existing as on 31.03.2022 is 
not disclosed considering impracticability in assessing the effect 
of same.

7.3.4. The Company was eligible for certain economic benefits 
such as exemptions from entry tax, custom duty etc. on import/
local purchase of capital goods in earlier years. The Company 
had accounted benefits received for custom duty and entry tax 
on purchase of Property, Plant and Equipment as Government 
grants. The Company had adjusted the cost of Property, Plant and 
Equipment as at April 1, 2017 and credited deferred Government 
grant amounting to ` 3,618.21 million. The deferred Government 
grant is amortised over the remaining useful life of the Property, 
Plant and Equipment amounting to ` 159.02 million for the year 
ended March 31, 2022 (Year ended March 31, 2021 ` 159.02 
million).

7.3.5. Few assets under the property, plant and equipment which 
are constructed on lease hold lands and whose useful life is more 
than the leasehold period are depreciated based on their useful 
lives considering the likely renewal of the lease period.

7.4. In respect of subsidiary OVL, 

7.4.1. Subsidiary company ONGC Videsh Limited has determined 
its functional currency as US$. Adjustments includes net effect of 
exchange differences of ` 293.63 million (as at March 31, 2021: ` 
(301.30) million) on account of translation of the financial statements 
of the ONGC Videsh Limited from US$ to Group’s presentation 
currency “`”. Refer Note No. 3.21 and 5.1 (a).

7.4.2. The Group carries on its business in respect of exploration, 
development and production of hydrocarbons under agreements 
with host governments directly or in consortium with other partners 
(Consortium). Many such agreements, governing the Group’s 
activities, provide that the title to the property, plant and equipment 
and other ancillary installations shall pass on to the host Government 
or its nominated entities either upon acquisition/first use of such 
assets by the respective Operator(s) or upon 100% recovery of 
such costs through allocation of “Cost Oil” and “Cost Gas” or 
upon relinquishment of the relevant contract areas or termination 
of the relevant agreement. However, even where the title transfers, 
the Consortium and/or operator will continue to have custody 
of all such assets and are entitled to use, (without incurring any 
additional charge) all such assets for production related operations 
throughout the term of the agreement. The Consortium continues

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

to be responsible for the maintenance of such assets and bears 
the loss resulting from accidental loss and damage. The Group 
continues to recognise and present such assets in the financial 
statements till the expiry of the term of the agreement.

7.4.3. ONGC Videsh Atlantic Inc. (OVAI) uses straight line method to 
charge depreciation on its Property, Plant and Equipment. The total 
depreciation charge of OVAI for the year ended March 31, 2022 ` 
0.71 million (previous year ` 1.43 million) does not have material 
impact on financial statements.

7.4.4. The functional currency of the company is US Dollar. 
Hence, all items of Property, Plant & Equipment acquired by the 
company are recognised at historical cost at the rate on the date 
of acquisition of such assets, including assets acquired originally 
in Indian Rupees located in India. For the purpose of preparing 
these financial statements, the US Dollar values of these assets 
is translated from US Dollar to INR (presentation currency) at the 
reporting date exchange rate.

7.4.5. Assets classified as other Property, plant & equipment are 
items of Property, plant and equipment other than those assets 
that are directly related to oil and gas producing activities. The 
assets stated above include the company’s share of assets in 
joint operations.  Depreciation is provided on the cost of other PPE 
less their residual values, over the useful life of PPE as stated in 
the Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or based on technical 
assessment by the Company.

7.4.6. Freehold land relates entirely to the OVL Group’s share in 
overseas unincorporated Joint Ventures (oil and gas operations.)

7.5.1. The Company is still in the process of getting registered its 
acquisition of Land at six locations, acquired through KIADB for 
Sectionalized Valve Stations. Until registration of the ‘lease cum 
sale agreement’, amount paid towards acquisition is shown as

million) of erstwhile Kosan Gas Company that have not been 
handed over to the Corporation.  Though Kosan Gas Company was 
to give up their claim, in view of the tenancy right sought by third 
party, the matter is under litigation.

7.6.2. Includes ` 10,493.00 million (31.03.2021: ` 8,060.90 million 
) towards Land, Building, Plant & Equipment, Furniture & Fixtures, 
Transport equipments, Office Equipments, Pipelines, Railway

*In respect of the company, the identification of temporarily suspended projects and the projects with cost overrun/time overrun with 
the estimated period of completion is done on the basis of estimates made by technical executives of the Company involved in the 
implementation of the projects.

In respect of Subsidiary OVL, 

a) WIP in producing blocks pertains to activities carried out for sustaining the existing production levels and contribute to accelerated and 
improved oil & gas recovery. Accordingly, WIP in producing blocks is not covered under the definition of “Project” as per management 
assessment and is therefore, not assessed for time/cost overrun. In case of WIP arising out of any new field development (exploratory 
effort) within an already producing block, the same is considered as a “Project” and WIP arising out of such activity is  is assesed for time/
cost overrun.

b) Assessment of cost/time overrun for projects in progress is done at the overall project level and the activity wise physical progress is 
not considered for the purpose of the disclosure requirement under Sch-III. In case the total cost/timeline of a project has exceeded the 
original approved cost/timeline approved by the Board of Directors, the same is treated as cost/time overrun.

15.2 Generally, the Company enters into crude oil and gas sales 
arrangement with its customers. The normal credit period on sales 
of crude, gas and value added products is 7 - 30 days. No interest 
is charged during this credit period. Thereafter, interest on delayed 
payments is charged at SBI Base rate plus 4% - 6% per annum 
compounded each quarter on the outstanding balance.

Out of the gross trade receivables as at March 31, 2022, an amount 
of ` 101,672.40 million (as at March 31, 2021 ` 64,894.62 million) is 
due from Oil and Gas Marketing companies, the Company’s largest 
customers. There are no other customers who represent more than 
5% of total balance of trade receivables.

Accordingly, the Company assesses impairment loss on dues from 
Oil Marketing Companies on facts and circumstances relevant to 
each transaction. 

The Company has concentration of credit risk due to the fact 
that the Company has significant receivables from Oil and Gas 
Marketing Companies (refer Note No. 51.3.3 and 52.4). However, 
these companies are reputed and creditworthy public sector 
undertakings (PSUs). 

15.3 Includes an amount of ` 3,764.43 million (Previous year ` 
3,755.22 million) due towards Pipeline Transportation Charges for 
the period from November 20, 2008 to March 31,  2022 from GAIL 
India Limited (GAIL) on account of revised pipeline transportation 
tariff charges. 

In terms of Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) signed between GAIL and 
the Company, GAIL is to pay transportation charges in addition 
to the price of gas in case of Uran Trombay Natural Gas Pipe 
Line (UTNGPL) and were being paid by GAIL. Subsequent to the 
replacement of pipeline in 2008, the revised pipeline transportation 
tariff in respect of UTNGPL as approved by Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) is being invoiced to GAIL with 
effect from November 20, 2008. 

Maharashtra Gas Limited (MGL), one of the customers of GAIL, 
had filed a complaint with PNGRB on February 12, 2015 regarding 
applicability of tariff on supply of gas to GAIL. After hearing all 
parties, PNGRB vide order dated October 15, 2015 dismissed the 
complaint and gave a verdict in favour of the Company. Pursuant 
to appeal by MGL to the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL), 

the case was remanded back to PNGRB. Once again, PNGRB 
vide order dated March 18, 2020 had dismissed the complaint, 
authorized the pipeline as a Common Carrier Pipeline and directed 
both GAIL and MGL to pay the transportation tariff fixed by PNGRB 
from time to time for UTNGPL. MGL again filed an appeal with 
APTEL on April 04, 2020 against the order of PNGRB. APTEL vide 
order dated July 16, 2021 remanded the matter to PNGRB for fresh 
adjudication and passing final order within 3 months from the date 
of appointment of Member (Legal). Matter is presently pending with 
APTEL.

MGL has been paying the applicable tariff since July 2021.

Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd (RCF), another customer 
of GAIL, was paying revised tariff since February 2016 and the 
tariff from November 20, 2008 till January 31, 2016 was under 
dispute. The matter was  referred to Committee of Secretaries 
under Administrative Mechanism for Resolution of CPSEs Disputes 
(AMRCD) that met on June 17, 2021 and concluded that RCF would 
pay the transportation charges with effect from the date of order 
(i.e. December 30, 2013) of revised tariff rates of PNGRB.  The 
Company has requested clarification from the MoP&NG regarding 
the impact of AMRCD order on its receivable from GAIL.  However, 
in view of the conclusion of AMRCD, a provision of ` 446.43 million 
has been created against dues from GAIL on account of Pipeline 
Transportation Charges in respect of RCF for the period prior to 
December 30, 2013.

The Company has been raising invoices on GAIL towards Pipeline 
Transportation Charges during the period from November 2008 to 
March 2022 amounting to ` 7,371.26 million, out of this an amount 
of  ` 3,606.83 million has since been received. 

In view of the above, the balance receivable (excluding provision) of 
` 3,318.00  million as at March 31, 2022 ( Previous year ` 3,755.22 
million) is considered good.

15.4 In respect of subsidiary OVL, the company generally 
enters into crude oil sales contracts with reputed Oil Marketing 
Companies (OMCs) / International Oil Companies (IOCs) / National 
Oil Companies (NOCs) on the basis of tendering for each of its 
cargo’s. However, the Company has also entered into some long-
term sales arrangement with Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs)/

International Oil Companies (IOCs) / National Oil Companies 
(NOCs) for crude oil sales and supply of natural gas.

The Company generally sells its products on an average credit 
period of around 30 days. In respect of gas sales in some of 
the projects, the Company receives payments in advance in 
accordance with the respective sales contract. In respect of a long 
term gas sales contract with one of the national oil companies, 
a credit period of 40 days is allowed. Interest is not charged on 
trade receivables for the applicable credit period from the date of 
invoice. For delayed period of payments, interest is charged as per 
respective arrangements, which is generally determined as one 
month LIBOR + 2% per annum over the applicable Bank Rate on 
the outstanding balance.

The Company assesses impairment loss on trade receivables on 
the basis of facts and circumstances relevant to each customer. 
Usually, Company collects all its receivables within the contractually 
allowed credit periods.

The Company has concentration of credit risk due to the fact 
that the Company has significant receivables from Oil Marketing 
Companies and International Oil Companies (IOCs). However 
these are reputed National Oil Companies (NOCs) and the 
company does not expect any material loss on account of delay or 
non payment of dues.

15.6 In respect of subsidiary OVL, the company has assessed its 
trade receivables for expected credit loss (ECL) including dues 
from Govt of Sudan (GoS). These trade receivables have become 
overdue and therefore effectively incorporate a significant financing 
component. The Company is using the general model for lifetime 
ECL, under which recoverability of such receivables is estimated 
and expected cash flows are discounted by applying risk adjusted 
weighted average cost of borrowing. 

Accordingly, trade receivables in respect of Sudan amounting to 
` 29,164.39 million (previous year ` 29,006.06) million have been 
assessed for lifetime expected credit loss and an impairment loss 
of ` 933.46 million has been charged in the statement of profit and 
loss. The total outstanding provision against these receivables 
stands at ` 4,399.38 million (previous year ` 3,347.79 million).

15.7 In respect of subsidiary HPCL, impairment of doubtful 
receivables Includes loss allowance of ` 1,373.70 million 
(31.03.2021 : ` 3,036.20 million) on trade recievables of ` 1,373.70 
million (31.03.2021 : ` 9,691.30 million) for which the credit risk has 
been assessed on an individual basis.

15.8 In respect of subsidiary MRPL, the Company generally enters 
into long-term  sales arrangement with Oil Marketing Companies for 
domestic sales and short term arrangement with others. Besides, 
the export of products are undertaken through term contracts, 
spot international tenders, short term tender arrangements, B2B 
arrangements and supplies to SEZ customers. The average credit 
period on sales ranges from 7 to 45 days (Year ended March 31, 
2021 ranges from 7 to 45 days). Interest is not charged on trade 
receivables for the applicable credit period from the date of 
invoice. For delayed period of payments, interest is charged as per 
respective arrangements, which is upto 2 %  per annum (Year ended 
March 31, 2021 upto 2%  per annum) over the applicable bank 
rate on the outstanding balance. Usually, the Company collects all 
receivables from its customers within the applicable credit period. 
The Company assesses impairment on trade receivables from 
all the customers on facts and circumstances relevant to each 
transaction.

15.9 Secured Trade Receivables above includes ` 8,719.23 million

16.1 Loans to employees include an amount of ` 8.04 million (as at 
March 31, 2021 ` 11.11 million) outstanding from Key Managerial 
Personnel.

16.2 In respect of subsidiary HPCL, Non current loan to others 
includes Loan to Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) customers 
amounting to ` 5,624.20 million (as at March 31, 2021: ` 9,630.50 
million) before impairment and provision towards the same 
amounting to ` 1,023.80 million (as at March 31, 2021: ` 5,507.09 
million). Similarly, Current loan to others includes Loan given to 
Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) consumers of ` 896.50 
million (as at March 31, 2021: ` 1,178.00 million) before impairment 
and provision towards the same amounting to ` 163.20 million (as 
at March 31, 2021: ` 673.60 million).

16.3 In respect of Subsidiary HPCL, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala 
Yojana (PMUY) was launched in 2016 to provide LPG connections 
to women from below-poverty-line (BPL) households. The 
beneficiary is given an option to avail loan from the respective 
OMCs to meet the cost of the stove and first fill. This loan is to be 
recovered from the subsidy payable to the consumer on purchase 
of the refill cylinders. The loan has been provided to 17.60 million 
PMUY consumers for an amount aggregating to ` 29,623.30 million 
(31.03.2021: ` 29,630.10 million), and of this, ` 17,053.20 million 
(31.03.2021: ` 18,822.50 million) is outstanding at period end. 

The Loan is classified as ‘subsequently measured at amortized 
cost’ in the financial statements. Considering the decline in the 
average subsidy of LPG during the year at ` 29/- (2020-21: ` 
42/-) per cylinder and the consequential increase in loan tenure, 
the carrying value of loan outstanding as at Balance Sheet date 
is re-measured  based on revised estimates of future cash flows. 
Such re-measurement loss resulted in further reduction in gross 
carrying amount of outstanding loan, net of interest unwinding,  
by ` 2,518.50 million (2020-21: ` 2,731.10 million) during the year. 
Considering the cumulative re-measurement loss, net of interest 
unwinding, amounting to ` 5,249.60 million (31.03.2021: ` 2,731.10 
million) and accounting of Deferred Expense amounting to ` 
5,282.90 million (net balance after amortisation as of 31.03.2022 is ̀  
3,871.60 million), the outstanding loan at period end is carried in the 
books at ̀  6,520.70 million (31.3.2021: ` 10,808.50 million). Further, 
considering the consumption pattern of refills, level of subsidies 
and consequential impact on repayment of the loan, by following 
the principles of prudence and conservatism, net of reversal, if any, 
a cumulative provision of ` 1,187.00 million (31.03.2021: ` 6,180.70 
million) is estimated and recognized in books. The reversal of 
provision during the year amounted to ` 4,993.70 million (2020-21: 
a provision of ` 3,906.70 million) that arose primarily due to inactive 
consumer turning active, pursuant to focused initiatives taken in this 
regard. The expected credit loss estimate is reasonable.

19.1 During the year 2010-11, the Oil Marketing Companies, 
nominees of the Government of India (GoI) recovered US$ 80.18 
million (Share of the Company US$ 32.07 million (equivalent to 
` 2,429.30 million)) as per directives of GoI in respect of Joint 
Operation - Panna Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts 
(PSCs).  Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal, the company’s 
share of US$ 32.07 million equivalent to ` 2,429.30 million (March 
31, 2021: ` 2,356.82 million) has been disclosed under the head 
‘Advance Recoverable in Cash’ (refer Note No. 58.1.4).

19.2 In Ravva Joint Operation, the demand towards additional profit 
petroleum raised by Government of India (GoI), due to differences 
in interpretation of the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract 
(PSC) in respect of computation of Post Tax Rate of Return (PTRR), 
based on the decision of the Malaysian High Court setting aside an 
earlier arbitral tribunal award in favor of operator, was disputed by 
the operator Vedanta Limited (erstwhile Cairn India Limited). The 
Company is not a party to the dispute but has agreed to abide by 
the decision applicable to the operator. The Company is carrying an 
amount of US$ 167.84 million (equivalent to ` 12,714.224 million) 
after adjustments for interest and exchange rate fluctuations which 
has been recovered by GoI, this includes interest amounting to US$ 
54.88 million (equivalent to ` 4,157.16 million). The Company has 
made impairment provision towards this recovery made by the GoI.

In subsequent legal proceedings, the Appellate Authority of the 
Honorable Malaysian High Court of Kuala Lumpur had set aside 
the decision of the Malaysian High Court and the earlier decision of 
arbitral tribunal in favour of operator was restored, against which the 
GoI has preferred an appeal before the Federal Court of Malaysia. 
The Federal Court of Malaysia, vide its order dated October 11, 
2011, has dismissed the said appeal of the GoI.

The Company has taken up the matter regarding refund of the 
recoveries made in view of the favorable judgment of the Federal 
Court of Malaysia with Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas 
(MoP&NG), GoI. However, according to a communication dated 
January 13, 2012, MoP&NG expressed the view that the Company’s 
proposal would be examined when the issue of carry in Ravva 
PSC is decided in its entirety by the Government along with other 
partners. 

In view of the perceived uncertainties in obtaining the refund at 
this stage, the impairment made in the books as above has been 
retained and netted off against the amount recoverable as above 
in the Financial Statements for the year ending March 31, 2022. 
(Figures in ` are restated).

19.3 The Ravva PSC stipulates Base Development Cost of Ravva JV 
to be at US$ 188.98 million with a cap of 5% increase. Accordingly 
the development cost stated in the PSC is US$ 198.43 million. 
However, actual cost incurred by JV is more than amount stipulated 
in the PSC. Director General of Hydrocarbons did not approve 
the increase in base development cost  for cost recovery and 
demanded additional profit petroleum vide letter dated August 8, 

2006 from the contractor / JV for an amount of  US$ 166 million 
as short paid on account of cost recovery of Development cost in 
excess of Base Development Cost. 

In August 2008 three JV partners excluding the company had 
invoked arbitration against Government of India (GoI) on the issue. 
The contention of claim as operator was that it should be allowed 
100% Cost recovery of the Base Development cost. The issue was 
argued at various levels including court of Appeals and Malaysian 
Federal Court. The decision of court was in favour of JV partners. 
After Federal court of Malaysia decision, the case was filed with 
Delhi High court for enforcement of award in India. Delhi High Court 
vide order dated February 19, 2020 allowed enforcement of the 
Arbitration Award including declaratory relief. GoI had filed an SLP 
in Honorable Supreme Court of India against the said order and 
the judgment dated September 16, 2020 was in favour JV partner.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), GoI vide letter 
dated October 10, 2018 issued a recovery notice to Oil Marketing 
companies (OMCs) for US$ 52 million plus applicable interest 
towards short payment of Government share of Profit Petroleum 
on account of dispute of Cost recovery of Base Development 
cost from the payments made to the Company towards the sales 
proceeds of Crude Oil and Natural Gas.  During the year OMCs 
deducted and deposited the sales proceeds of Crude Oil and 
Natural Gas to MoPNG and the entire amount of US$ 83 million 
(US$ 52 million along with interest of US$31 million) (equivalent to ` 
6,099.67 million) has been recovered. 

In view of the Supreme Court Judgment for enforcement of arbitration 
award in India, an amount of US$ 83 million (US $ 52 million along with 
interest of US$31 million) has been adjusted from profit petroleum 
payable to GoI during the year 2020-21 and 2021-22.

24.2 Matter of Dispute on Delivery Point of Panna-Mukta gas 
between Government of India (GoI) and BG Exploration and 
Production India Limited (BGEPIL) along with Reliance Industries 
Limited (RIL) and the Company (PMT JO Partners) arose due to 
differing interpretation of relevant PSC clauses. According to the 
PMT JO Partners, Delivery Point for Panna-Mukta gas is at Offshore, 
however, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoP&NG), GoI 
and GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL) maintained that the delivery point is 
onshore at Hazira. The gas produced from Panna-Mukta fields was 
transported through Company’s pipelines. Owing to the delivery 
point dispute neither the seller (PMT JO) nor the buyer of gas (GAIL) 
was paying any compensation to the Company for usage of its 
pipeline for gas transportation

Hon’ble Gujarat High Court decided that the Panna Mukta oil fields 
from where the movement of goods is occasioned fall within the 
customs frontiers of India. Consequently, the sale of goods cannot 
be said to have taken place in the course of import of goods into 
the territory of India. Accordingly the Hon’ble Gujarat High Court 
has determined that the Delivery Point for Panna-Mukta gas is at 
Offshore.  The State Government of Gujarat has filed a petition 
with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the decision of 
Hon’ble Gujarat High Court. Since the said matter of determination 
of delivery point is pending   with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India, an amount of US $51.90 million (Previous year US $ 51.37 
million) equivalent to ` 3,871.25 million (Previous year ` 3,752.80 
million) for the PMT JV including Company’s Share US $ 21.18 
million (Previous year US$ 20.74 million) equivalent to ` 1,556.87 
million (Previous year ̀  1,515.26 million) is maintained in the escrow 
account by the PMT JO Partners.

associates, wherever it believes that it would avail the tax credit 
as per the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961. Taxable temporary 
differences associated with respect to unremitted earnings and 
associated foreign currency reserve is ` 629,176.69 million (as at 
March 31, 2021 ` 550,099.90 million). Distribution of the same is 
expected to attract tax in the range of nil to 25.168% depending on 
the tax rate applicable as of March 31, 2022 in the jurisdiction in 
which the respective group entity operates.

33.4 The group has recognized deferred tax assets with respect 
to consolidation adjustments of subsidiary, joint venture and 
associate. Deductible temporary differences associated with 
respect to consolidation adjustments of subsidiary, joint venture 
and associate has resulted in creation of  deferred tax assets (net)

OMPL (‘Amalgamating Company’) into and with the Company 

(‘Amalgamated Company’) effective from the appointed date

the year ended March 31, 2022 has been prepared giving effect 
to the amalgamation as per the requirements of the applicable 
Indian Accounting Standards. Pursuant to the amalgamation, the 
unused tax losses and unused tax credits of the amalgamating 
company becomes unused tax losses and unused tax credits of

year 2021-22 and the Company is entitled to carry forward such 
unused tax losses and unused tax credits in accordance with 
the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Hence, the Company 
has reassessed and recognised the Deferred Tax Assets on such 
unused tax losses and unused tax credits based on the probability 
of earning sufficient taxable profits in the future years as projected 
by the management for the amalgamated entity in line with Ind AS 
12 - Income Taxes. This has resulted in increase in the Deferred Tax 
Assets by ` 14,554.27 million for the year ended March 31, 2022

33.6.1 Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the unused tax losses or tax credits can be utilised. This involves 
an assessment of when those assets are likely to reverse, and a 
judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits 
available to offset the assets. This requires assumptions regarding 
future profitability, which is inherently uncertain.

31.03.2022 on which deferred taxes assets haven’t been recognised 
are given in the table below:

gas markets. Accordingly, the same are not comparable with those

Ukraine War, which is not significant on the carrying amounts of

Current Assets. The demand for Company’s products is expected 
to be lower in the short term which is not likely to have a continuing 
impact on the business operations of the Company. In the opinion 

of the management, the carrying amount of these assets will be 
recovered.

49.6.8 These plans typically expose the Group to actuarial risks 
such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary 
risk.

Investment risk The present value of the 
defined benefit plan liability is 
calculated using a discount 
rate which is determined by 
reference to market yields at 
the end of the reporting period 
on government bonds. When 
there is a deep market for such 
bonds; if the return on plan 
asset is below this rate, it will 
create a plan deficit. Currently, 
for these plans, investments 
are made in government 
securities, debt instruments, 
Short term debt instruments, 
Equity instruments and Asset 
Backed, Trust Structured 
securities as per notification of 
Ministry of Finance.

Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest 
rate will increase the plan 
liability; however, this will be 
partially offset by an increase 
in the return on the plan’s 
investments.

Longevity risk The present value of the 
defined benefit plan liability is 
calculated by reference to the 
best estimate of the mortality 
of plan participants both during 
and after their employment. An 
increase in the life expectancy 
of the plan participants will 
increase the plan’s liability.

Salary risk The present value of the 
defined benefit plan liability 
is calculated by reference 
to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an 
increase in the salary of the 
plan participants will increase 
the plan’s liability.

No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees.

In respect of the above plans, the most recent actuarial valuation 
of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation were carried out as at March 31, 2022 by a member 
firm of the Institute of Actuaries of India. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and 
past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit 
method.

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely 
that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Sensitivity due to 
mortality & withdrawals are not material & hence impact of change not calculated. 

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation 
liability recognized in the balance sheet.

52.1 Capital Management

The Group’s objective when managing capital is to:

• Safeguard its ability to continue as going concern so that the 
Group is able to provide maximum return to stakeholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; and

• Maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of

may adjust the amount of dividends to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

as detailed in Note No. 29 offset by cash and bank balances) and 
total equity (refer Note No. 26, 27 and 28). 

The Group’s financial management committees review the capital 
structure on a regular basis. As part of this review, the committee 
considers the cost of capital, risks associated with each class of 
capital requirements and maintenance of adequate liquidity.

52.3 Financial risk management objectives 
While ensuring liquidity is sufficient to meet Group operational 
requirements, the Group’s financial management committee also 
monitors and manages key financial risks relating to the operations 
of the Group by analysing exposures by degree and magnitude of 
risks. These risks include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk 
(including currency risk and price risk).
In respect of Company, during the year, the liquidity position of the 
Company was comfortable. The lines of Credit/short term loan 
available with various banks for meeting the short term working 
capital/ deficit requirements were sufficient for meeting the fund 
requirements. The Company has also an overall limit of ` 100,000 
million for raising funds through Commercial Paper. Cash flow/ 
liquidity position is reviewed on continuous basis.
In case of subsidiary OVL, the Company’s management seeks to 
minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial 
instruments to hedge risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives 
is governed by the company’s policies approved by the Board of 
Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange 
risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and 
non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess 
liquidity. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed 
by the internal auditors on a continuous basis. The Group does 
not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative 
financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
In case of subsidiary HPCL, the Corporation has established 
an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework under the 
Corporation’s Risk Management Charter and Policy 2007, which 
is embedded at the forefront of business strategies and focuses 
on the stronger, deeper and trust-based relationship with the 
stakeholders. It provides necessary support to the business to steer 
through the continuously evolving risk terrain through dynamic risk 
management approach that embraces disruption and enhances 
resiliency and trust.
The Risk Management Steering Committee (RMSC) receives 
regular insights on risk exposures faced by the Corporation, thereby 
enabling it to provide inputs on prompt actions to be taken as well 
as monitor the actions taken. The Board is also updated regularly 
on the risk assessment and mitigation procedures.
Technology has been enabled to support the Enterprise Risk 
Management processes with a focus on optimizing risk exposures 

and automating risk reporting across the organization.
In case of subsidiary MRPL, the Company’s  Risk Management 
Committee monitors and manages key financial risks relating to 
the operations of the Company by analysing exposures by degree 
and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including 
currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
52.4 Credit risk management
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, investments 
carried at amortized cost and deposits with banks as well as 
customers including receivables. Credit risk management 
considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking 
information including indicators like external credit rating (as far 
as available), macro-economic information (such as regulatory 
changes, government directives, market interest rate).
Credit exposure is managed by counterparty limits for investment of 
surplus funds which is reviewed by the Management. Investments 
in liquid plan/schemes are with public sector Asset Management 
Companies having highest rating. For banks, only high rated banks 
are considered for placement of deposits.Bank balances are held 
with reputed and creditworthy banking institutions.
In respect of Company,
Major customers, being public sector Oil Marketing Companies 
(OMCs) and gas companies having highest credit ratings, carry 
negligible credit risk. The Company is exposed to default risk in 
relation to financial guarantees given to banks / vendors on behalf 
of subsidiaries / joint venture companies for the estimated amount 
that would be payable to the third party for assuming the obligation. 
The Company’s maximum exposure in this regard on as at March 
31, 2022 is ` 389,094.14 million (As at March 31, 2021 ` 411,769.54 
million).
In respect of subsidiary company MRPL,
Major customers comprise of public sector undertakings (Oil 
Marketing Companies - OMCs) having highest credit ratings and 
carry negligible credit risk. Concentration of credit risk to any other 
counterparty did not exceed 10% of total monetary assets at any 
time during the year. Only high rated banks are considered for 
placement of deposits. Bank balances are held with reputed and 
creditworthy banking institutions.
In respect of subsidiary company OVL,
Major customers, of the Company are reputed Oil Marketing 
Companies (OMCs) / International Oil Companies (IOCs) / National 
Oil Companies (NOCs) which have highest credit ratings, carrying 
negligible credit risk.
In respect of subsidiary company HPCL, 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or 
counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual 
obligations. The risk arises principally from the Group’s Receivables 
from Customers and so also from Investment Securities. The risk 
is managed through credit approval, establishing credit limits 
and continuous monitoring of the creditworthiness of Customers 
to whom the Group extends credit terms in the normal course of 
business.

The maximum exposure to credit risk in case of all the financial instruments covered below is restricted to their respective carrying amount. 
Trade receivables:
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.

52.7.1 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis

The Group is principally exposed to foreign currency risk against 
currency other than functional currency. Sensitivity of profit or loss 
arises mainly against EURO, JPY and ` borrowings in case of OVL 
and from US$ denominated receivables and payables in other 
cases. 

In respect of the Company,

As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible 
changes in the exchange rate of +/- 5% between US$-` currency 
pair, sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstanding foreign currency 
denominated monetary items at the period end is presented below:

52.7.2 Forward foreign exchange contracts

The Company has not entered into any forward foreign exchange 
contracts during the reporting period.

The subsidiary company OVL generally enters into forward 
exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments 
and receipts to reduce foreign exchange fluctuation risk. In current 
year, the Company has entered certain forward contracts to cover 
exposure towards EURO bond.

In case of subsidiary company HPCL,

The Company is exposed to currency risk mainly on account of its 
borrowings and import payables in foreign currency. Our exposures 
are mainly denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company has used 
generic derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates in line with Company’s forex risk 
management policy. The Company has a Forex Risk Management 
Cell (FRMC) which actively review the forex and interest rate 
exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial 
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

52.8 Interest rate risk management

The Group has availed borrowings at fixed and floating interest 
rates, hence is exposed to interest rate risk. 

52.8.1 Interest rate sensitivity analysis

In respect of company,

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk because the Company 
has borrowed funds benchmarked to overnight MCLR, Treasury 
Bills, debt (capital) market, MIBOR, RBI Repo and US$ LIBOR. 
The Company’s exposure to interest rates on financial liabilities are 
detailed in note 29.1.

The Company invests the surplus fund generated from operations 
in term deposits with banks and mutual funds. Bank deposits are 

made for a period of upto 12 months carry interest rate as per 
prevailing market interest rate. Considering these bank deposits 
are short term in nature, there is no significant interest rate risk. 
Average interest earned on term deposit and a mutual fund for the 
year ended March 31, 2022 was 3.39% p.a. (Previous year 4.09% 
p.a.).

In respect of subsidiary company MRPL,

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on 
the exposure to interest rates at the end of the reporting period. 
For floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming the 
amount of the borrowings outstanding at the end of the reporting 
period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase 
or decrease is used for disclosing the sensitivity analysis.

If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other 
variables were held constant, the company’s profit for the year 
ended March 31, 2022 would decrease/increase by ̀  677.74 million 
(for the year ended March 31, 2021 : decrease/increase by ̀  728.98 
million). This is mainly attributable to the company’s exposure to 
interest rates on its variable rate borrowings (considered on closing 
balance of borrowings as at year end).

In respect of subsidiary company OVL,

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the 
exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
instruments at the end of the reporting year. For floating rate 
liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the 
liability outstanding at the end of the reporting year was outstanding 
for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease is used 
when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management 
personnel and represents management’s assessment of the 
reasonably possible change in interest rates.

If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other 
variables were held constant, the analysis is as under:

Interest rate swap contracts

The subsidiary company OVL is engaged in E&P business outside 
India. Its revenues of crude oil and natural gas are principally 
denominated in US$. Further, price benchmarks wherever 
applicable are also principally in US$. The Company has therefore 
swapped the coupon and the principal amount of 8.54 % Unsecured 
Redeemable Debenture (face value of ` 3,700.00 Million) into US$. 
These contracts matured during the year 2019-20.

In respect of subsidiary company HPCL,

The Corporation has long-term foreign currency syndicated loans 
with floating rate of interest, which exposes the Corporation to 
cash flow interest rate risk. The borrowings at floating rate are 
denominated in USD. The Corporation manages its cash flow 
interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. 
Under this, the Corporation agrees with other Parties to exchange 
at specified intervals (i.e. quarterly), the difference between fixed 
contract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by 
reference to the agreed notional principal amounts. The Corporation 
monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest 
rate risk, based on the Corporation’s Forex Risk Management 
Policy. The Corporation also has a Forex Risk Management Cell 
(FRMC) that  actively reviews the forex and interest rate exposures. 
The Corporation does not use derivative financial instruments for 
trading or speculative purposes.

The Corporation has exposure in the form of External Commercial 
Borrowings aggregating to USD 1250 million linked to LIBOR as at 
31.03.2022. In March 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), 
UK has confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be 
provided by any administrator or no longer be a representative in 
the following manner:

• Immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of all Sterling, 
Euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 1-week and 
2-month US dollar settings; and

• Immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining US 
dollar settings.

In this context, the afore-mentioned exposure shall be migrated 
from LIBOR to an Alternative Reference Rate (ARR). The impact of 
such migration is not ascertainable at present.

‘The Company’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised 
cost. They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined 
in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash 
flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates. 

Interest rate risk exposure

Company’s interest rate risk arises mainly from borrowings. The 
interest rate profile of the Company’s interest-bearing financial 
instruments as reported to the management of the Company is as 
follows:

A reasonably possible change of 25 basis points in interest rates 
at Reporting Date would have impacted profit or loss [increased 
/ (decreased)] by the amounts shown below. The indicative 25 
basis point (0.25%) movement is directional and does not reflect 
management forecast on interest rate movement. This analysis 
assumes that all other variables, in particular, foreign currency 
exchange rate remaining constant.

52.9 Commodity Risk  

In respect of subsidiary company HPCL,

The Company’s Profitability is exposed to the risk of fluctuation 
in prices of Crude Oil and Petroleum products in international 
markets. Company monitors and reduces the impact of the 
volatility in International Oil prices based on approved Oil Price Risk 
Management Policy by entering into derivative contracts in the OTC 
market. 

The Company also has Oil Price Risk Management Committee 
(OPRMC) which actively reviews and monitors risk management 
principles, policies and risk management activities.

Derivatives & Hedging       

The company enters into derivative contracts for hedging purpose, 
to mitigate the commodity price risk, on Highly probable forecast 
transactions as detailed above. Effective 01 January 2020, the 
Corporation has applied Hedge Accounting on commodity 
derivative transactions entered subsequent to 01 January 2020 
as per Ind AS 109 (Financial Instruments). Consequent to this a 
Mark to Market debit amounting to ` 1,853.10 million (Previous 
year ` 11.40 million)  has been accounted in Other Comprehensive 
Income which will be recycled to Statement of Profit and Loss in 
subsequent period on settlement of respective contracts.

All these hedges are accounted for as Cash Flow Hedges. 

Hedge Effectiveness:

The has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationship 
as the underlying risk of the commodity forward contracts are 
identical to the hedged risk component. Hedge item and the 
hedging instruments have economic relationship as the terms of 
the commodity forward contracts match with the terms of hedge 
items. Considering the economic relationship and characteristics 
of the hedging instrument being aligned to the hedged item, the fair 

value changes in the hedging instrument reasonably approximates 
the fair value changes in the hedged Item (in absolute amounts).

Source of Hedge Effectiveness:

The company has identified the following sources of hedge 
ineffectiveness which are not expected to be material: 

a. Counterparty Credit Risk impacting the fair value of the hedge 
instrument and hedge item.

b. Difference in the timing of the cash flows of the hedged items 
and the hedge instruments

c. Different indexes used to hedge risk of the hedged item.

d. Changes to forecasted amounts of cash flows of hedged items 
and hedging instruments.

Disclosures of effects of Cash Flow Hedge Accounting:

The company has applied Hedge Accounting prospectively for the 
highly probable forecast transactions as stated above, entered 
after 01 January 2020. Consequently, disclosure is made only for 
the transactions designated for Hedge Accounting.

income (FVTOCI) or at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

Investment of short-term surplus funds of the Company in liquid 
schemes of mutual funds provides high level of liquidity from a 
portfolio of money market securities and high quality debt and 
categorized as ‘low risk’ product from liquidity and interest rate risk 
perspectives.

The revenue from operations of the company are also subject to 
price risk on account of change in prices of Crude Oil, Natural Gas 
& Value Added Products.

Valuation techniques used to determine Fair Value

Type Valuation technique

Derivative instruments - forward exchange contracts Discounted cash flow i.e. fair value of foreign exchange forward 
contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the 
contractual forward price and the current forward price for the 
residual maturity of the contract.

Commodity derivatives Fair value of commodity derivative contracts is estimated by 
determining the difference between the contractual price and the 
current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract.

Derivative instruments - interest rate swap Discounted cash flows i.e. Present value of expected receipt/
payment.

Non current financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised 
cost

Discounted cash flows. The valuation model considers the present 
value of expected receipt/payment discounted using appropriate 
discounting rates.

53.1.3 In respect of 1 Pre NELP block (Previous year 1) which has 
expired as at March 31, 2022, the Company’s share of Unfinished 
Minimum Work Programme (MWP) amounting to ` 493.81 million 
(previous year ` 493.81 million) has not been provided for since 
the Company has already applied for further extension of period 
in these blocks as ‘excusable delay’/ special dispensations citing 
technical complexities, within the extension policy of NELP Blocks, 
which are under active consideration of GoI. The delays have 
occurred generally on account of pending statutory clearances 
from various Govt. authorities like Ministry of Defence, Ministry 
of Commerce & Industry, environmental clearances, State Govt. 
permissions etc. The MWP amount of ` 493.81 million (previous 
year ` 493.81 million) is included in MWP commitment under note 
no. 58.3.2 (a).

As per the Production Sharing Contracts signed by the Company 
with the GoI, the Company is required to complete Minimum 
Work Programme (MWP) within stipulated time. In case of delay 
in completion of the MWP, Liquidated Damages (LD) are payable 
for extension of time to complete MWP. Further, in case the 
Company does not complete MWP or surrender the block without 
completing the MWP, the estimated cost of completing balance 
work programme is required to be paid to the GoI. LD amounting to 
` 5.47 million [Previous year ` 100.09 million (net of reversal)] and 
cost of unfinished MWP amounting to Nil [Previous year ` 996.96 
million (net of reversal)], paid/payable to the GoI is included in 
survey and wells written off expenditure respectively.

53.1.4 Government of India has approved the relinquishment of 30% 
Participating Interest (PI) of ONGC in SGL Field with future interest 
in block RJ-ON/6 in Jaisalmer Basin Rajasthan and assignment of 
PI to Focus Energy Limited (Operator) and other JV partners on 
the condition that Focus Energy Limited (Operator) will pay towards 
100 % past royalty obligation, PEL/ML fees, other statutory levies 
(total amount  ` 2,290.22 million as on March 31, 2022) and waive 
off development/production cost payable by the Company in SGL 
Field of the block as well as take all future 100% royalty obligation 
of the Company as licensee. The process of entering into Farm-
out Agreement and amendment in Production Sharing Contract 
(PSC) is under progress. Pending the execution of agreements, no 
adjustment is made in the accounts in respect of relinquishment of 
block RJ-ON/6.

53.1.5 The Company is having 30% Participating interest in Block 
RJ-ON-90/1 along with Vedanta Limited (erstwhile Cairn India 
Limited)  (Operator) and Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited. There 
are certain unresolved issues including cost recovery and sharing 
in respect of exploration, development and production cost in the 
Block between the Company and Operator of the Block amounting 
to tentatively US$ 1,257.11 million (equivalent to ̀  95,225.95 million) 

as on March 31, 2021. The amount under dispute related to cost 
recovery and sharing for FY 2021-22 is yet to be finalized. 

The Company, as Government nominee under Article 13.2 is liable 
to contribute its share as per the PI, only for the development & 
production operations, and is not liable to share Exploration Cost.  
However, any recovery of exploration expenditure by Operator will 
impact on the share of Cost Oil/Gas available to ONGC. The Operator 
already took recovery of Exploration expenditure of US$ 388.37 
million (incurred upto Exploration Phase), hence the Company’s 
liability upto Exploration phase is NIL. Further, the Operator has also 
claimed exploration cost (beyond exploration phase of PSC) of US$ 
167.08 million (equivalent to ` 12,656.35 million) being 30% of US$ 
556.93 million (equivalent to `42,187.82 million) from the Company 
upto FY 2020-21 (Previous year US$ 147.11 million and equivalent 
`10,810.91 million) from the Company, which in view of Company is 
not tenable. The Company has shown a sum of US$ 167.08 million 
(equivalent to ` 12,656.35 million) under Contingent Liabilities, as 
the issues are presently under Arbitration proceedings. 

Pending settlement of issues, an amount of US$ 134.49 million 
(equivalent to ` 10,187.80 million), which is 30% of US$ 448.31 
Million pertaining to development and production cost have been 
accounted for as per the participating interest of the Company. 

Royalty on production is being paid by the Company as licensee 
and the share of JV Partners of Royalty is recoverable through 
revenue from Sale of Crude Oil and Gas as per PSC.  Accordingly, 
an amount of ` 15,376.03 million outstanding from JV Partners has 
been included in the revenue upto March 31, 2022.

53.1.6 The primary period of twenty five years of the Production 
Sharing Contract (PSC) of the Block RJ-ON-90/1 expired on May 
14, 2020. The Contractors in the Block had applied for extension 
of the PSC for a period of 10 years, which was approved by 
Government in October 2018 under the pre-NELP Extension Policy 
as per notification dated April 7, 2017, subject to certain conditions. 
One of the conditions for extension, stipulated by Government 
relates to notification of certain audit exceptions raised for FY 2016-
17 as per PSC provisions and requires payment of Additional Profit 
Petroleum, in case these exceptions are accepted by Contractors. 
In connection with these audit exceptions, US$ 156.03 million (` 
11,819.25 million) relating to the share of Company out of total 
US$ 520.10 million (`39397.52 million) has been raised by DGH 
on May 12, 2020. Subsequently in December 2020, the amount of 



473

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

demand has been increased to US$ 654.83 million (Companies 
share US$ 196.45 million), based on audit exceptions for FY 2017-
18. The other Partners in the JV have disputed the demand with a 
Notice of Arbitration dated May 14, 2020 against the Government. 
The Company is not a Party to the Arbitration against Government 
and will pay the amount, once liability, if any, arises out of the Audit 
Exceptions is finalized for the Contractors. The Company share of 
US$ 196.45 million (`14881.01 million) in the Audit Exceptions has 
already been shown under Contingent liabilities.

As all the conditions required for extension of PSC could not be 
complied with and the Addendum for extension of the PSC could 
not be signed by the Contractors and Government on or before May 
14, 2020, Government has allowed the Contractors to continue the 
Petroleum operations for a period of three months or signing of PSC 
amendment, whichever is earlier. The Government subsequently 
extended the period of Petroleum Operations from time to time and 
currently it is extended upto August 14, 2022.  It is expected that 
Govt. will further extend this period further and the Addendum for 
extension of the PSC will be signed by all Parties. Accordingly, the 
accounts of the Company’s share in the Block for FY 2021-22 has 
been prepared on a ‘going concern’ basis.

53.1.7 In respect of Jharia CBM Block, revised Feasibility Report 
(FR) has been approved in the 27th Steering Committee (SC) held 
on September 9, 2019. In light of better techno-economics, the 
Company has decided to implement the revised FR as phases 
in the light of overlap issue with Bharat Coking Coal Limited and 
early implementation and monetization. Therefore, Parbatpur and 
adjoining area was taken up in Phase-I under the approved FR and 
accordingly, implementation strategy for Stage-I has been approved 
by the Company on November 21, 2019 and 36th Operating 
Committee (OC) meeting for Jharia CBM Block held on December 
10, 2019. The same was communicated to the Partner, Coal India 
Limited (CIL) and was approved by the Board of Directors of CIL in 
its meeting held on January 10, 2020. As per Performa provided by 
DGH, all the formalities for enhancement of participating interest 
(PI) from 10% of CIL to 26% have been completed by both the 
Company (Assignor) and CIL (Assignee) and the signed documents 
were submitted to DGH for the approval of GoI on January 27, 
2020. However, GoI, on the basis of the application and supporting 
documents has granted enhancement of PI of CIL from 10% to 26% 
w.e.f January 25, 2021. This has been contested by the Company 
as the provision and timing of exercising the option of enhancing 
PI from 10% to 26% is very clearly defined in the JOA i.e. the option 
shall be exercised by CIL before the start of Development Phase. 
Accordingly, DGH and MoPNG has been requested to consider 
April 23, 2013 as the date of commencement of PI enhancement, 
as delay in PI enhancement is primarily due to late submission of 
requisite documents by CIL. Considering the provisions of JOA 
and approval of Steering Committee, the cash calls amounting to 
` 707.95 million from CIL have been continued to be recognized at 
26% w.e.f. April 23, 2013 (which is the start date of development 
phase activity) upto January 24, 2021 as against ` 272.29 million of 
cash calls at the rate of 10% PI up to January 24, 2021.

53.1.8 In respect of Raniganj (N) CBM Block, the Feasibility Report 
(FR) is under process exploring different variants to optimize the 
cost. Work Program and Budget for RE 2021-22, BE 2022-23 
have been approved by the Operating Committee. The issue of 
connectivity of proposed locations in Raniganj with Urja Ganga 
Pipeline is being discussed with GAIL (India) Limited, Kolkata. 
Government of West Bengal has granted PML for 311.79 Sq. km 
including the BAPL overlap area on February 10, 2020 w.e.f. June 9, 
2019. Pending final decision on the Block, an impairment provision 
of ` 617.36 million has been provided in the books.

53.1.9 During the year 2017-18 the Company had acquired the 

entire 80% Participating Interest (PI) of Gujarat State Petroleum 
Corporation Limited (GSPC) along with operatorship rights, at 
a purchase consideration of US$ 995.26 million (equivalent to ` 
62,950.20 million) for Deen Dayal West (DDW) Field in the Block 
KG-OSN-2001/3. The revised PI in the block after above acquisition 
stands for the Company 80%, GSPC 10% and Jubilant Offshore 
Drilling Private Limited (JODPL) 10%.A farm-in Farm-out agreement 
(FIFO) was signed with GSPC on March 10, 2017 and the said 
consideration has been paid on August 04, 2017 being the closing 
date. In the current year 2021-22, accounting for the final closing 
adjustment (i.e., working capital and other adjustments) to sale 
consideration viz. transactions from the economic date up to the 
closing date has been provisionally carried out and a sum of ` 
946.71 million is net payable to GSPC as final settlement and the 
same is under deliberation. As per FIFO, the Company is entitled 
to receive sums as adjustments to the consideration already paid 
based on the actual gas production and the differential in agreed 
gas price. Pending executing mother wells and estimating future 
production, the contingent adjustment to consideration remains to 
be quantified. The Company has also paid part consideration of 
US$ 200 million (equivalent to ̀ 12,650.00 million) for six discoveries 
other than DDW Field in the Block KG-OSN-2001/3 to GSPC 
towards acquisition rights for these discoveries in the Block KG-
OSN-2001/3 to be adjusted against the valuation of such fields 
based on valuation parameters agreed between GSPC and the 
Company.

The JV partner JODPL is under liquidation since December 2017 
and has defaulted all the cash calls since acquisition of the block 
by the Company. The amount of outstanding cash call from JODPL 
as at March 31, 2022 is ` 1624.86 million (Previous year: ` 1368.26 
million). The assignment of JODPL’s 10% PI in accordance with 
provisions of Production sharing Contract (PSC) is pending with 
Management Committee (MC).  As per provision of the Joint 
Operating Agreement (JOA), the receivable amount of ` 1,624.86 
million (Previous year: ` 1368.26 million) after the acquisition of 
block is required to be contributed by the non-defaulting JV Partner 
in their ratio of participating interest. Pending decision of assignment 
of JODPL’s PI by MC a provision for an amount of ̀  1,444.32 million 
(Previous year: ` 1,216.23 million) has been made against the said 
cash call receivables from JODPL, being the company’s share as 
per PI ratio.

53.1.10 In case of Joint Venture Block CB-ONN-2004/3, the 
discovery well Uber#2 ceased to flow from June 23, 2020. ONGC 
in consultation with JV partner M/s GSPC has initiated a proposal 
for examination / surrendering the NELP block CB-ONN-2004/3 
and relinquishment of the development area of 10.78 sq. km. 
The Management Committee (MC) in March 2021 had advised 
that action plan be drawn up to revive the field, which can include 
drilling a new development well in a better part of the reservoir, so 
that fairly good quantity of gas, as approved in the FDP, is achieved 
at the earliest. Pending assessment of the same, an impairment 
loss of ` 370.95 million has been provided in the books. 

53.1.11 The designated currency, for the purpose of cost recovery 
under the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) is US$. Thus, the 
expenditure incurred in Indian Rupees (`) needs to be converted in 
US$ for the preparation of cost recovery statements. The Company 
has already submitted the draft Management Committee agendas 
for the corresponding blocks for adoption of State Bank of India 
(SBI) reference rate in place of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reference 
rate for preparation of cost recovery statements. 

The management committee (MC) of the block named VN-
ONN-2009/3 has recommended to the Government for approval 
of SBI reference rate in lieu of RBI reference rate for the conversion 
purpose between US$ and ` in modification of provision laid down

under the PSC. The MC also recommended that the same may be extended to other similarly placed PSCs of the operator. MC further 
recommended that the above dispensation to opt for SBI exchange rate may be made available as one time measure also to other 
operators, should they opt to do so, provided they have adopted SBI exchange rate at the corporate level. 

Subsequently, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) which is PSC monitoring arm of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas 
(MoPNG), Government of India, submitted the proposal for the approval of MoPNG for adoption of SBI reference rate in lieu of RBI reference 
rate for the block VN-ONN-2009/3 in May 2020 which is at present pending with MoPNG. 

The Company is following the SBI reference exchange rates on consistent basis for maintenance of accounts as the main banker of the 
Company is State Bank of India, and there is no impact on the Company financial statements due to adoption of SBI exchange rate, as 
the transactions of foreign currency in the Company are recorded at actual cost basis and foreign currency liabilities & assets at period 
end are also recognised as per SBI reference rate. The financial implication for adoption of SBI reference rate preparation of cost recovery 
statements with DGH, as against the RBI reference rate is immaterial.

53.3.2.2 Sanganpur Field
The Company acquired 50% participating interest in Sanganpur 
field from M/s Hydrocarbon Development Company Pvt. Ltd. 
(HDCPL) effective 1st September, 2004. Accumulated amount 
prior to acquisition of Sanganpur field amounting `11,817,034/- 
have been included in Sanganpur field Assets. The Company has 
accounted its proportionate share in the Sanganpur field based on 
estimated un-Audited accounts as at 31st March, 2017.

In FY 2014-15 , the operator of the block M/s HDCPL has committed 
default in the payment to its contractor. The petition was filed by 
contractor ETA Star Golding limited for non-payment of its invoices 
by M/s HDCPL in their another asset wherein Bombay High Court 
vide order dated 14th Nov, 2014 in Company Petition 550 of 2013 had 
passed order for appointment of liquidator for assets and business 
of Company M/s HDCPL. However, as per Production Sharing 
contract (PSC), the ownership of underlying hydrocarbon lies with 
GoI, hence Sanganpur field was not attached and operations in 
the field were continued. Further,  MoP&NG vide its letter dated 
June 2, 2017 has terminated the PSC and all operations in the field 
were called off. Since the appointment of official liquidator, the bank 
account of HDCPL were seized, HDCPL has neither raised any 
invoice to IOCL for transfer of crude nor raised any cash call to 
PPCL for operation in the field. The payment of Royalty and Cess to 
concerned authorities are also pending since then.

Said order of Bombay High Court was challenged by HDCPL 
before its Division Bench and is still pending before the Court. In the 
meantime, HDCPL had initiated an arbitration proceeding against 
MoPNG for termination of PSC. However, PPCL is not a part of it. 
Under Section 9 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, Directorate 
General of hydrocarbon (DGH) on behalf of  MoP&NG has initiated 
proceeding for possession of the field.

MoP&NG vide its letter dated June 2, 2017 has terminated the 
PSC. Accordingly, Company had created a provision for write-off of 
Sanganpur Assets of ` 66.50 million in FY 2017-18. During current 
Financial Year 2021-22 amount of ` (1.20 million) transferred to

57 Disclosure under Indian Accounting Standard 36 – Impairment of 
Assets 

57.1 The Company is engaged mainly in the business of oil and 
gas exploration and production in Onshore and Offshore. In case 
of onshore, the fields are using common production/transportation 
facilities and are sufficiently economically interdependent to 
constitute a cash generating unit (CGU). Accordingly, impairment 
test of all onshore fields is performed in aggregate at the Asset 
Level. In case of Offshore, a field is generally considered as 
CGU except for fields which are developed as a Cluster or group 
of Clusters, for which common facilities are used, in which case 
the impairment testing is performed in aggregate for all the fields 
included in the cluster or group of Clusters.

57.2 The Value in Use of producing/developing CGUs is determined 
under a multi-stage approach, wherein future cash flows are 
initially estimated based on Proved Developed Reserves. Under 
the circumstances where further development of the fields in the 
CGUs are under progress and where the carrying value of the 
CGUs is not likely to be recovered through exploitation of proved 

developed reserves alone, the Proved and Probable Reserves (2P) 
of the CGUs are taken for the purpose of estimating future cash 
flows. In such cases, full estimate of the expected cost of future 
development is also considered while determining the value in use.

57.3 In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows from 
the continuing use of assets and from its disposal at the end of its 
useful life are discounted to their present value. The present value 
of cash flows has been determined by applying discount rates of 
14.74% (as at March 31, 2021: 14.29%) for Rupee transactions 
and 10.10% (as at March 31, 2021: 9.60%) for crude oil, natural 
gas and value added products revenue, which are measured in 
US$. Future cash inflows from sale of crude oil, natural gas and 
value added products have been computed using Management’s 
estimate of future crude oil, natural gas and value added products 
price, discounted applying the rate applicable to the cash flows 
measured in US$.

57.4 The Company has considered the prevailing business 
conditions to make an assessment of future crude oil and natural 
gas prices based on internal and external information / indicators 
of future economic conditions. Based on the assessment, the 
Company has recorded a net impairment reversal to the extent the 
value in use exceeds the carrying amount subject to accumulated 
impairment provision, amounting to  ` 11,904.07 million (Previous 
year: ` 11,135.08 million), this consist of net impairment reversal at 
Onshore CGUs amounting to  ` 14,746.95 million (Previous year: 
` 22,117.06 million) and net impairment loss at Offshore CGUs

The following 2P reserves of the respective CGUs have been 
considered for the impairment assessment:

No CGU Proved and Probable Reserves 
(MMTOE) as at March 31, 2021

1 Imperial, Russia 40.312

57.8 The subsidiary OVL has considered the equity share investment, 
preference share investment, loans given and interest accrued 
thereon, to its wholly owned subsidiary Imperial Energy Limited as 
carrying value of investment. The cash flows for assessing the value 

in use have been estimated based on the life of blocks till 2063. 
The existing validity period of licenses of various blocks are ranging 
from upto 2022 to till 2038 which are expected to be extended by 
the host government at the initiative of the Imperial energy in line 
with the provisions of the sub soil contract in view of the available 
reserves estimated up to 2063 as per GKG, the State commission 
for Mineral resources. 

The production for next five years have been estimated in alignment 
with the work program from 2021-22 to 2025-26 and thereafter as 
per the design documents approved by the regulator.

57.9 In respect of subsidiary HPCL, the future cash flows have 
been worked out based on the desired margins and impairment 
assessment has been carried out for all of the Cash Generating 
Units. Since there do not exist any indication of impairment of assets 
as at Balance Sheet date, no impairment has been considered 
necessary. In view of assumptions being technical, peculiar to the 
industry and Government policy, the auditors have relied on the 
same.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

58.1.1 The Company’s pending litigations comprise claims against 
the Company and proceedings pending with Tax / Statutory/ 
Government Authorities. After review of all its pending litigations 
and proceedings, the Company has made adequate provisions, 
wherever required and disclosed the contingent liabilities, wherever 
applicable, in its financial statements. The Company does not 
expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material 
impact on its financial position. Future cash outflows in respect of 
the above are determinable only on receipt of judgments/ decisions 
pending with various forums/ authorities.

58.1.2 The Company had received demand orders from Service Tax 
Department at various work centres on account of Service Tax on 
Royalty in respect of Crude oil and Natural gas. Appeals against 
such orders have been filed before the Tribunals. The Ahmedabad 
Tribunal adjourned the matter sine-die vide order dated June 25, 
2019, against which the Company has filed writ petition before 
Gujarat High Court. In this matter, Hon’ble Gujarat High Court in the 
hearing held on 04.01.2021 directed the revenue authorities to file 
counter affidavit by 21.01.2021. The Central Government has filed 
counter affidavit on 20.01.2021. The next date of hearing before 
Hon’ble Gujarat High court is not scheduled as yet. The Company 
had also obtained legal opinion as per which the Service Tax/GST 
on Royalty in respect of Crude oil and Natural gas is not applicable. 
Meanwhile, the Company also received demand order dated 
January 01, 2019 on account of GST on Royalty in the State of 
Rajasthan against which the Company filed writ petition (4919/2019) 
before Hon’ble High Court of Rajasthan. The Hon’ble High Court of 
Rajasthan heard the matter on April 3, 2019 and issued notice to 
Department with a direction that no coercive action shall be taken 
against the Company. The final hearing has not yet taken place. The 
Company also filed writ of mandamus (9961/2019) before Hon’ble 
High Court of Madras seeking stay on the levy of GST on royalty. The 
Hon’ble High Court of Madras heard the matter on April 3, 2019 and 
issued notice to Central Government and State Government. The 
Central Government has filed their counter affidavit on August 26, 
2019. The Company has filed additional grounds to the writ petition 
and filed rejoinder to the counter of the Central Government before 
Hon. Madras High Court on January 24, 2020. The final hearing has 
not yet taken place. Disputes are also pending at various forums for 
various work centres in respect to GST on Royalty. 

The total estimated amount (including penalty and interest up to 
March 31, 2022) works out towards Service Tax is ` 40,172.56 
million (upto March 31, 2021: ` 39,604.84 million) and GST is ` 
102,731.94 million (upto March 31, 2021: ̀  77,173.72 million). Since 
the Company is contesting the matter, it has been considered as 
contingent liability. Further, as an abundant caution, the Company 
has deposited Service Tax and GST along-with interest under-
protest amounting to ` 13,524.39 million (upto March 31, 2021: ` 
13,524.39 million) and ` 74,043.48 million (upto March 31, 2021: ` 
56,777.04 million) respectively.

58.1.3 There are certain unresolved issues including cost recovery 
and sharing in respect of exploration, development and production 
cost in the Block between the Company and Operator - Vedanta 
Limited (erstwhile Cairn India Limited) of the Block RJ-ON-90/1. 
Pending settlement of issues, the company has shown an amount 
of US$ 167.08 million - equivalent to ` 12,656.35 million (Previous 
year: US$ 147.11 million – equivalent to ` 10,810.91 million) under 
contingent liability as on March 31, 2022. For further details, please 
refer Note No. 53.1.5.

58.1.4 The Company, with 40% Participating Interest (PI), was a 
Joint Operator in Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti Fields 
along with Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and BG Exploration 
and Production India Limited (BGEPIL) each having 30% PI, (all 
three together referred to as “Contractors”) signed two Production 

sharing Contracts (PSCs) with Government of India (Union of India) 
on December 22, 1994 for a period of 25 years. The PSCs for Panna 
Mukta and Mid & South Tapti have expired on December 21, 2019. 
In terms of the Panna Mukta Field Asset Handover Agreement, the 
Contractors of PMT JV are liable for the pre-existing liability.

In December 2010, RIL & BGEPIL (JV Partners) invoked an 
international arbitration proceeding against the Union of India in 
respect of certain disputes, differences and claims arising out of 
and in connection with both the PSCs .The Ministry of Petroleum 
and Natural Gas (MoP&NG), vide their letter dated July 4, 2011, had 
directed the Company not to participate in the Arbitration initiated 
by the JV Partners (BGEPIL & RIL). MoP&NG has also stated that 
the Arbitral Award would be applicable to the Company also as a 
constituent of the Contractor for both the PSCs.

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), vide letters dated 
May 25, 2017 had informed the Company that on October 12, 
2016, a Final Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced by the Tribunal 
in the said arbitrations. As informed by BGEPIL additionally Audit 
Award on January 11, 2018, Agreement Case Award on October 
1, 2018 and Jurisdictional Award on March 12, 2019 wherein the 
principles relating to the aforesaid disputes were pronounced. 
However, the details of proceedings of the FPA and other Orders 
are not available with the Company. DGH, vide their letter dated 
May 25, 2017 and June 4, 2018, marked to the Contractors, had 
directed the payment of differential Government of India share of 
Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be payable by Contractors 
pursuant to Governments interpretation of the FPA (40% share of 
the Company amounting to US$ 1,624.05 million, including interest 
upto November 30, 2016) equivalent to  ` 123,022  million @ ` 
75.75 i.e. closing rate as on March 31,2022 (March 31, 2021: ` 
119,351.43 million). In response to the letters of DGH, the JV 
partners (with a copy marked to all Joint Venture Partners) had stated 
that demand of DGH was premature as the FPA did not make any 
money award in favour of Government of India, since quantification 
of liabilities were to be determined during the final proceedings of 
the arbitration. Further the award had also been challenged before 
the English Commercial Court (London High Court). Based on 
the above facts, the Company had also responded to the letters 
of DGH stating that pending finality of the order, the amount due 
and payable by the Company was not quantifiable.  In view of the 
Company, if any changes are approved for increase in the Cost 
Recovery Limit (CRL) by the Arbitral Tribunal as per the terms of the 
PSCs the liability to DGH would potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final verdict on May 2, 2018 
following which the Arbitral Tribunal re-considered some of its earlier 
findings from the 2016 FPA (Revised Award).The Government of 
India and JV Partners have challenged parts of the Revised Award 
before English Court. On February 12, 2020, the English Court 
passed a verdict favoring the challenges made by BGEPIL and RIL 
and also remitted the matter in the Revised Award back to Arbitral 
Tribunal for reconsideration. Based on the information shared by 
BGEPIL in January 2021, the Tribunal issued a verdict favoring 
BGEPIL/RIL on the remitted matter, which has been challenged by 
the GOI before the English Court. 

Based on the information shared by one of the JV partners in the 
earlier periods, The GOI has also filed an execution petition before 
the Hon’ble Delhi High Court seeking enforcement and execution 
of the October 12, 2016 FPA. BGEIPL / RIL contend that GOI’s 
execution petition is not maintainable and have opposed the reliefs 
sought by the GOI under the said petition. The matter is pending 
before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court and no final orders on the 
reliefs sought by the GOI have been passed so far. In January 2018, 
the Company along with the JV partners has filed an application 
with MC for increase in CRL in terms of the PSCs.

The application has been rejected by MC. Pursuant to the rejection, 
the JV partners have filed a claim with Arbitral Tribunal. One of the 
JV partners has further informed the Company that the hearing 
before the Arbitral Tribunal has been partially heard in the quarter. 
Further the additional hearing are scheduled to be heard in the 
Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of the year 2022. 

DGH vide letter dated January 14, 2019 has advised the 
contractors to re-cast the accounts for Panna-Mukta and Mid and 
South Tapti Fields for the year 2017-18. Pending finalization of the 
decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, the JV partners and the Company 
had indicated in their letters to DGH that the final recasting of the 
accounts was premature and thus the issues raised by DGH may 
be kept in abeyance.

During the financial year 2010-11, the Oil Marketing Companies, 
nominees of the Government of India (GoI) recovered US$ 80.18 
million (Share of the Company US$ 32.07 million (equivalent to 
` 2,429.30 million)) as per directives of GoI in respect of Joint 
Operation - Panna Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts 
(PSCs). The recovery is towards certain observations raised by 
auditors appointed by the Director General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) 
under the two PSCs for the period 2002-03 to 2005-06 in respect of 
cost and profit petroleum share payable to GoI

Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal on various issues raised 
above, re-casting of the financial statements and final quantification 
of liabilities, no provision has been accounted in the financial 
statements. The demand raised by DGH, amounting to US$ 
1,624.05 million equivalent to ` 123,021.60 million@ ` 75.75 i.e. 
closing rate as on 31.03.2022 (March 31, 2021: ` 119,351.43 
million) has been considered as contingent liability. 

The Company’s share of US$ 32.07 million ` 2,429.30 million @ ` 
75.75 i.e. closing rate as on 31.03.2022 (March 31, 2021: ̀  2,356.82 
million) recovered by Government of India has been disclosed 
under Note No.19.1 in the financial statements.

58.1.5 The Company is operating Petroleum Mining Leases (PML) 
granted by the State Government (s) after initial clearance from the 
Government of India (GoI). The grant of oil mining lease is regulated 
and governed by the provisions of the Oilfields [Regulation 
and Development] Act 1948 (ORD Act). Once the lease order is 
granted, the lessee has to execute lease deeds with the respective 
State Government. The stamp duty on the executed lease deed 
is payable as per the Stamp Act of the respective States. Certain 
State Governments are of the view to include the amount of Royalty 
apart from other payments like Security Deposit, surface rent and 
dead rent etc. for the purpose of calculation of stamp duty under 
the Stamp Duty Act (s) applicable for such States.

However, the company is of the view that the royalty payable by the 
Company is not a rent to the State Government(s) but is payable 
under Rule 14 of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 1959 
(PNG Rules).  There is a distinction between the concept of rent 
and royalty. The word “royalty” signifies in mining lease that part 
of reddendum which is variable and depends upon the quantity of 
minerals gotten or the mineral worked out within a specified period. 
Whereas rent is the amount payable for use and occupation of 
land.  Hence, it could be reasonably assumed that for the purpose 
of calculation of stamp duty, amount of royalty would not form part 
of the consideration value of lease deeds to be executed for PML 
granted. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of 
India communicated to the State Government of Tamil Nadu vide 
letter dated December, 31, 2014, that royalty should not be taken 
as a basis for fixation of Stamp Duty to the mining leases granted 
under the ORD Act read with PNG Rules.

The Solicitor General of India, through his opinion dated May 05, 
2007, had also opined that the distinction between royalty and 
rent is well settled. Rent would be payable regardless of whether 
the property is worked upon or not. On the other hand, royalty is 
a variable figure. It would depend upon the quantity of mineral 
obtained. If the mine is not worked upon, rent would nevertheless 
be payable. Hence, he opined that inclusion of royalty for the 
purpose of calculation of stamp duty is unjustified and not tenable. 
In absence of clarity on the issue the amount of firm liability or 
contingent liability is unascertainable.

58.1.6 In respect of subsidiary, OVL

The Service Tax Department had issued a demand cum show-
cause notice dated October 11, 2011 requiring the Company to 
show cause why service tax amounting to ` 28,163.14 million 
(including Education Cess and SHE cess), the interest on such 
amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from 
the Company. Service Tax Department has calculated these tax 
amounts based on foreign currency expenditure reported in the 
Company’s financial statements covering the reporting periods 
from April 1, 2006 to December 31, 2010 and contending that 
these expenses represent business auxiliary services rendered by 
the Company foreign branches and operator of the Joint Venture/ 
Consortium to the Company. Subsequently, five more demand-
cum-show cause notices have been issued based on similar 
contentions covering the period upto March 31, 2015 to show 
cause why service tax amounting to ` 32,863.61 million (including 
Education cess and SHE cess), the interest on such amount and 
penalty should not be demanded and recovered from the Company. 
A demand-cum-show cause notice has been issued based on 
similar contentions covering the period April 1, 2015 to March 31, 
2017 to show cause why service tax amounting to ` 15,633.22 
million (including Education cess and SHE cess), the interest on 
such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered 
from the Company.  Further, a demand-cum-show cause notice dt. 
10.02.2020 has been issued based on similar contentions covering 
the period April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 to show cause why service 
tax amounting to ` 2119.93 million (including Education cess and 
SHE cess), the interest on such amount and penalty should not 
be demanded and recovered from the Company.The Company is 
of the view that the said service tax is not payable and contesting 
the same. No provision is required to be made in the financial 
statements at this stage. In the assessment of the management 
based on independent and competent legal opinion obtained 
and other attendant factors including circular no. 35/9/2018-GST 
dated March 05, 2018 issued by Central Board of Excise and 
Customs, the possibility of the success of the Company’s position 
is extremely high and the possibility of the success of contentions 
of the Department is very low. Since the chances of payability of 
the service tax itself have been evaluated by the management as 
being remote/very low, the chances of assessment of interest and 
penalty are evaluated to be much lower. Accordingly, the amounts 
covered by the abovementioned show-cause notices (i.e. tax 
amount as well as potential interest and penalty thereon) are not 
considered as contingent liability in accordance with the applicable 
accounting standards. Further, according to the legal opinion 
obtained by the Company, a show-cause notice in itself does not 
qualify as a demand and the chance of the claim being payable by 
the Company is remote as the Company has a very good case to 
argue and succeed before the concerned authorities based on the 
legal position as on date.

58.1.7 In respect of subsidiary MRPL, there is a claim from the custom 
department for customs duty amounting to ` 2,121.14 million 
as at March 31,2022 (As at March 31, 2021 ` 2,121.14 million) 
along with applicable interest and penalties totally amounting to 



487

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

` 6,168.37 million as at March 31,2022 (As at March 31, 2021 ` 
6,168.37 million) in respect of classification of tariff of the reformate 
for the purpose of payment of import duty.  An appeal has been 
filed before the Appellate Authority contesting the entire demand. 
Pending outcome of the appeal proceedings, no provision for the 
said demand has been made in the books

58.1.8 In respect of subsidiary HPCL,

Guarantees given to others includes ̀  11,599.60 million (as at March 
31, 2021 ` 9,013.00 million) towards share of jointly controlled 
entities and associates and ̀  2,767.40 million (as at March 31, 2021 
` 2,669.40 million) towards share of jointly controlled operations.

The Group with a Participating Interest (PI) of 70% along with M/s 
M3nergy Sdn. Bhd (M/s M3nergy) (PI-30%) were awarded service 
contract in March, 2006 for development of ONGC’s offshore 
marginal oilfields of cluster-7. PPCL was the executing contractor. 
Parties provided necessary Bank Guarantees to ONGC. Since M/s 
M3nergy could not meet their contractual obligations, the contract 
was terminated by ONGC and Bank guarantees were forfeited. 
The Group demanded the refund of the monies forfeited towards 
encashment of Bank Guarantee along with other claims from 
M/s M3nergy. A counter claim of 42.60 Million USD was made by 
M3nergy on termination of such service contract. The matter was 
referred to Arbitration.

The Arbitral Tribunal passed 3 Awards (09.01.2014, 27.09.2017, 
15.06.2018 respectively), all were in favour of the Group. These 
Orders were to the effect that M3nergy had committed breach of 
the contract and hence their counter claims were disallowed and 
that the Group is entitled for damages with interest and costs of 
arbitration to be borne by M3nergy . All the 3 Awards were challenged 
by M/s M3nergy before the Bombay High Court.  However, there 
was no stay granted by Bombay High Court, hence, the Group filed 
applications for (a) Mareva Injunction and (b) Enforcement of the 
Award before the Courts in Malaysia since M/s M3nergy is located 
in Malaysia.

By Orders dated 10.01.2019 the Hon’ble Bombay High Court set 
aside all three Arbitration Awards. As the Awards were set aside (on 
the basis of which the enforcement application was filed by HPCL), 
on 28.02.2019 the Malaysian High Court at Kuala Lumpur allowed 
the application of M/s M3nergy to set aside the enforcement order 
with liberty to file fresh proceedings, if the Group succeed later. 
Meanwhile, the Group have filed Appeals against the setting aside 
order (of Single Judge Bombay High Court) before the Division 
Bench of the Bombay High Court. After hearing arguments of 
parties, on 16.10.2019, the Hon’ble Bombay High Court set aside 
the Single Judge’s Order and remanded all the 3 matters back to 
the Single Judge of the High Court, to decide the matter afresh 
on merits. This Order was challenged by M/s M3nergy before the 
Supreme Court by filing Special Leave Petition (SLP) which, after 
brief arguments, was dismissed as withdrawn (by M/s M3nergy) 
on 31.01.2020. As a result, the Single Judge of Bombay High Court 
will hear the matter afresh on merits. The matter was lastly  listed on 
18.01.2022, but could not be taken up.

As a result, Group’s share of the awarded amount which is 
approximately ` 4908.70 million towards loss of profit/damages/
costs and interest thereon has not been recognized on a 
conservative basis. Further, the claim raised by M3Energy to the 
extent of Group’s share i.e. approximately ` 2767.40 million (@ 
Exchange rate of 1 USD = ` 75.7975) , being considered remote is 
also not recognised.

In respect of PPCL

Company was awarded an Exploration block AA ONN 2010/1 
in Tripura under NELP IX in consortium with ABG Energy Ltd 

(ABG). The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) was signed with 
Government of India (GOI) by the consortium on August 30, 2012. 
Company has 20% Participating Interest (PI) and ABG 80% PI. As 
per the Joint Bidding agreement, ABG will carry Company during 
the exploration phase i.e. Company’s share of 20% expenditure 
during exploration phase shall be borne by ABG. In case of any 
discovery, 10% of Company’s share paid by ABG will be recovered 
by them out of profit and 10% will be paid by them anyway. As per 
discussions before signing of PSC and written confirmation, ABG 
was to submit back up guarantee to Company so that Company 
can submit bank guarantee to GOI for their share of 20%. The value 
of bank guarantee to be submitted by ABG to Company is USD 
1.801 Million. ABG did not submit bank guarantee of their 80% 
share by due date to GOI.  In addition, since back up guarantee 
was not submitted by ABG to Company, Company also could not 
submit the bank guarantee for their 20% share to GOI.

In view of non-submission of bank guarantee, GOI terminated the 
PSC vide letter dated 15th October 2013 and imposed liquidated 
damages of USD 9.143 Million vide letter dated 6thFeb 2015 as per 
Article 5.6 of PSC. Company has kept ABG on notice that it is their 
responsibility to pay the entire quantum of liquidated damages, 
including the share of Company. If Company is compelled to pay 
its share of liquidated damages by the GOI, and if such payment 
is made, then company will have to claim this money from ABG.

10th October 2016. After appointment of arbitrator on behalf of 
ABG by Delhi High Court Order dated 22nd September 2017, 
three-member tribunal had been constituted. The first sitting of the 
Arbitral Tribunal was held at New Delhi on 6th April 2018. Arbitral

58.1.10 In respect of Joint Venture ONGC Petro additions Limited (OPaL)

The Company has set up a Petrochemical Complex in Special 
Economic Zone (SEZ), situated at Dahej, State of Gujarat. In view 
of changes in market dynamics over the years, the demand for 
petrochemical products has increased in domestic market and 
India is now a net importer of polymers. Therefore, Company is 
selling its majority of products in Domestic Tariff Area (DTA), thereby 
substituting the imports and saving foreign exchange outflow of the 
country. However, Basic Custom Duty is applicable on the sale of 
products from SEZ to DTA which is directly impacting the margin of 
the company.  Therefore, Board of directors has accorded approval 
to make an application for voluntary exit from SEZ.

Development Commissioner, Dahej SEZ has conveyed in-principal 
approval for exit from SEZ subject to de-notification of the area; 
EPCG authorisation from Director General of Foreign Trade; 
payment of all applicable duties and taxes which may be finalised 
on the basis of the date of final exit and compliance of all the 
provisions of SEZ Act and other Rules. The unit is still under the SEZ 
and the proposal for approval of final exit will be considered subject 
to approval of de-notification from Board of Approvals, MoCI, New 
Delhi. 

SEZ Developer has to make an application for De-notification along 
with inter alia NOC from State Government, No due certificate 
from Specified Officer and demarcation of area from SEZ. These 
approvals/ activities are in process.  

SEZ exit is expected to bring significant improvement in the 
future margins along with one time cost. Based on the available 
information, the provisional estimated amount on account of 
SEZ exit is ` 27,344 Million (company’s share 13,497 million). 
This includes (i) Duty on capital goods ` 15,585 Million, which is 
permitted to be settled under EPCG scheme; (ii) Duty on inventory 
is ` 5,240 Million out of which ` 3,750 Million is eligible for Input 
Tax credit; (iii) Capital expenses of ` 1,936 Million on land and 
construction of infrastructure; (iv) Duty, taxes and charges payable 
to Developer & others ` 3,645 Million; (v) SEZ exit expenses of 
ONGC C2C3 plant ` 938 Million.  The above amount does not 
include provisional duty computed by Specified Officer, Dahej SEZ 
on immovable properties and provisional VAT amount estimated by 
State tax department. 

It is pertinent to mention that the duty amount and other estimates 
are provisional. Actual outflow on account of SEZ exit and its 
quantum is contingent upon the terms and conditions on which 
various approvals may be granted. 

As the exist is voluntary in nature, OPAL has requested for exit from 
SEZ considering economic benefits in future to the concerned 
authority. Since various NOC, approvals and duty assessment for 
SEZ exit are under consideration with the competent authorities, 
management believes that a final decision on exit can only be taken 
based on the terms and conditions mentioned in these approvals. 
In view of that management has considered that as on date OPaL 
has no liability to consider the books of accounts.

58.2 Contingent asset 

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events 
and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not 
wholly within the control of the entity. During the normal course of 
business, several unresolved claims are currently outstanding. The 
inflow of economic benefits, in respect of such claims cannot be 
measured due to uncertainties that surround the related events and 
circumstances.
