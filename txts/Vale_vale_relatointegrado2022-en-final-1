Letter from the  
Chairman of the Board

The world is on the threshold  
of a powerful energy transition.  
At the same time, companies  
and governments are faced with the 
task of overcoming the challenges 
posed by an increasingly complex 
world including geopolitical 
concerns, energy crises in Europe 
and in global supply chains, high 
levels of global inflation, and the 
slow recovery from the pandemic  
in some regions of the planet,  
to name a few. 

Vale, as a global company, is 
entrenched in this scenario and has 
been implementing its strategy not 
only to ensure effective operational 
performance, but also to create value 
for society, investors, employees, 
suppliers, communities, among  
other stakeholders.

Our business needs to respond 
both globally and within the mining 
industry. Climate change mitigation 
directs the world towards a necessary 
energy transition, but the pace of 
action may be affected in the long 
term by dependence on gas and other 
fossil fuels. Within our sector, the 
safety of people and our operations 
is an immediate imperative for risk 
management strategies.

Vale’s Board of Directors has the role 
of overseeing and supporting our 
journey towards a more sustainable 
and safer mining model, allowing 
for the development of low-carbon 
solutions, combined with the creation 
of value for society and a focus on 
business discipline. To exercise its role 
more efficiently and assertively, the 
Board underwent a reformulation 
process including the adoption of 
market best practices and electing 
independent officers, including the 
Chairman of the Board.

Vale’s by-laws, regulations and 
corporate governance today follow 
international standards, similar to 
those of our European peers. We 
consider ourselves a true corporation. 
However, Board composition can still 
be improved. We need to increase the 
diversity of Board members in terms 
of gender and race, in addition to 
having international participation. 

Another noteworthy advance 
has been in executive, variable 
compensation, which includes 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) metrics. In the short term, 
30% to 40% of collective targets are 
linked to non-financial indicators 
and ESG, while 35% are linked to 

financial targets. In the long term, 
the contribution of ESG metrics rose 
from 20% in 2020 to 25% in 2022. 
This demonstrates the company’s 
commitment to the future impact  
of our decisions today.

With regard to the governance of 
our dams and tailing facilities, the 
lesson learned from the Brumadinho 
tailings dam failure resulted in a 
complete transformation of our risk 
management processes, and the 
safety of Vale’s assets. Today, in order 
to ensure greater effectiveness and 
reliability of the overall  
risk-management process and 
company decision-making, the 
company operates according to a 
management model based on several 
layers of defense, that is subject 
to ongoing self-assessments and 
reviews carried out by third parties. 

Reports providing updates on 
the integrity of our geotechnical 
structures undertaken by 
independent experts are periodically 
reviewed by the Board of Directors 
and disclosed publicly. We have 
sought to implement the Global 
Industry Standard for Tailings 
Management (GISTM), as well as 
the leading tailings management 

GRI 2-22

standards and legislative 
amendments that have been 
introduced in Brazil and are in  
place in Canada. 

Our tailings dam management 
system is in line with the GISTM. Our 
goal is to reach 100% conformance 
of critical structures1 by August 
2023 and, by August 2025, we 
expect to bring the standard to all 
geotechnical structures we operate. 

Vale is committed to improving 
our performance and contributing 
to enhancing the lives of people 
in the areas where we operate. 
The company has invested in 
technological solutions to reduce 
its carbon emissions by carrying out 
tests with locomotives, trucks, and 
electrical equipment in Brazil as well 
as in its underground mine operations 
in Canada. Through the Vale Fund, 
it has sponsored forest recovery and 
protection, in addition to investing in 
research on biodiversity through the 
Vale Institute of Technology (ITV).

In the social field, in 2021 our 
Executive Committee announced 
the bold target to support the 
upliftment of half a million people 
out of extreme poverty by 2030. In 

2022, we developed a roadmap with 
targeted actions. A comprehensive 
international study was carried out, 
experts were consulted, and they 
corroborated our understanding that 
extreme poverty is multidimensional, 
and influenced by several factors, 
beyond those purely financial.

In order to reach this target, we will 
need to work with great managerial 
and mobilization capacity, aiming to 
build partnerships with the public and 
private sectors, in addition to working 
with competent organizations already 
working within this field, but that may 
lack the resources to scale actions to 
greater social transformation. 

José Luciano Penido 
Chairman of the Board  
of Directors at Vale

Vale’s Board of 
Directors has the 
role of overseeing 
and supporting our 
journey towards a 
more sustainable 
and safer mining 
model.

We want to contribute to 
the empowerment of local 
communities that may not have 
access to fundamental rights, 
enabling them to become resilient 
and leaders of their own future. 
This will also help in Vale’s own 
cultural transformation. 

We thank all our stakeholders 
and invite you to join us in our 
path towards sustainable mining 
aligning our progress to society’s 
needs and their expectations  
of our business.

Since the failure of the Mina do Córrego 
do Feijão dam, in Brumadinho, our 
primary commitment has been on 
compensation and reparation, always 
undertaken through dialogue and with 
respect. We have made significant 
progress, but we know that there is 
still much to be done, especially in 
continuing the search for the three 
people who have not yet been located. 
We will never forget Brumadinho and 
the lessons learned from the tragedy 
will stay with us forever.

In these last four years, we have 
publicly stated before a wide variety 
of stakeholders our commitment 
to act strategically to eliminate any 
risks associated with our operation, 
to remodel our business and, as a 
consequence of the lessons learned 
and of our operational discipline,  
to reposition the company before  
the market and other audiences. 

In 2022, we made important progress 
with respect to the decharacterization1 
of our tailings dams. To date, we 
have decharacterized 40% of our 
upstream structures and the B3/B4 
dam in Nova Lima, Minas Gerais, has 
been downgraded from the highest 
risk level2. This was made possible 
through the advancement of the 
decharacterization process, with the 

removal of more than 50% of the 
tailings originally held within that 
facility. We have spared no effort in 
this challenge, and we expect to have 
no dams at critical level by 2025.

Our main value is life first, and safety 
has become an obsession in our 
company. Part of this commitment is to 
the health and well-being not only of 
those who make up our company, but 
also to the communities with whom we 
interact. We achieved major advances 
last year and we are relentlessly 
pursuing progressively better results. 
The foundations of our management 
system, the Vale Production System 
(VPS), are already in place, but we need 
to ensure its adoption by all direct 
employees and contractors. 

Vale remains truly committed to 
promoting inclusion and valuing 
diversity, and we have achieved 
positive results. We ended 2022 with 
22.1% women in our workforce and 
22.6% in top leadership positions. Our 
goal is to double the representation of 
women in the company, from 13% to 
26%, by 2025. Today, we have about 
five thousand more women than in 
2019, when the target was announced. 
Vale has also set the goal that 40% of 
leadership positions (coordinators and 
above) in Brazil be occupied by black 

GRI 2-22Letter from the CEO
employees by 2026. We ended 2022 
with 32.1% of these positions occupied 
by self-declared black people. 

2022 was special for the company: 
we celebrated our 80th anniversary 
and are now looking ahead to the 
next 20 years. What type of company 
do we want Vale to be on its 100th 
anniversary? We are well positioned as 
a major player in the ongoing energy 
revolution. We have the capacity to 
meet the demand for metals essential 
for the electric vehicle industry, such 
as nickel, copper and cobalt.

Our core business, iron ore, is also 
transforming and offers solutions 
for the decarbonization of the steel 
industry. We have signed agreements 
with customers in the Middle East 
to create mega hubs, focused on 
low-carbon products such as green 
briquettes. Developed by Vale, 
this innovative product can reduce 
emissions in steel production by up to 
10%. We are building a briquette plant 
in Vitória, Espirito Santo, to meet 
market demand. We have entered into 
decarbonization partnerships with 
more than 30 customers, representing 
about 50% of our Scope 3 emissions. 
In the pelletizing area of our business, 
we are testing biocarbon to replace 
anthracite coal. 

The re-use of tailings generated in 
the iron ore production process as 
an alternative to riverbed or coastal 
sand mining is another line of action 
in the circular economy. The product 
has several commercial applications, 
such as concrete, mortar, artifacts, 
cement, and road pavement. Each 
ton of sand produced represents one 
less ton of tailings being disposed  
of in piles or tailings dams.

There has been a lot of talk about 
nature-based solutions, and we at 
Vale understand this concept of 
being a “nature-based business” 
because we see it as an opportunity. 
We have a range of initiatives, 
from science and research, through 
the Vale Institute of Technology, 
to actions that encourage the 
bioeconomy and forestry agenda, 
under the responsibility of the Vale 
Fund. During the UN Climate Change 
Conference (COP-27), we launched 
important initiatives to support this, 
such as “Biomas” (meaning Biomes), 
a joint venture with other companies 
that will contribute to the recovery 
and protection of forests in Brazil. 

In 2022, we also celebrated 40  
years of relations with the Xikrin  
do Cateté Indigenous People.  
We concluded an agreement, and to 

celebrate, I had the opportunity to 
visit the mother village of the Xikrin. 
A new chapter of this relationship 
is being built, based on trust and 
dialogue. This action is part of 
the goal of contributing to the 
indigenous communities neighboring 
our business in the pursuit of their 
rights, and is linked to our Social 
Ambition, launched at the end of 
2021 and formalized in 2022.

This Social Ambition includes the 
goal of contributing to lifting 
500,000 people out of extreme 
poverty by 2030. We understand 
that the fight against social 
inequality is crucial and must be 
tackled with the engagement of all 
sectors of society: public authorities, 
companies, and third-party entities. 

The milestones presented here 
– some of which have already 
produced concrete results – help 
build the future of the Vale we want: 
a company focused on promoting 
sustainable mining and developing 
low-carbon solutions, without losing 
sight of discipline in capital allocation.

In conclusion, I thank everyone who 
has dedicated their efforts and 
resources in helping us to honor 
our commitments. I invite you, the 
reader, to consider this report from 
the perspective that we are on a 
journey, guided by a single purpose: 
to improve life and transform the 
future together. 

In these last four 
years, we have publicly 
stated before a wide 
variety of stakeholders 
our commitment to 
act strategically to 
eliminate any risks 
associated with  
our operation.

active listening with our stakeholders. The 
material issues we have identified (see more 
in Materiality) guide the indicators we report 
on, our management approach, and our 
accountability on environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) matters.

The Brumadinho Reparation has been a 
driving force for change. Our commitment 

to ensuring that an event of this nature 
will never be repeated means we remain 
steadfast in our ambition to be a safer and 
more reliable company. The common thread 
throughout this year’s report is our purpose: 
“We exist to improve life and transform 
the future. Together.” It reinforces our 
transformation journey through dialogue, 
transparency and rapprochement between 
Vale and its stakeholders. 

Vale has reported in compliance with the 
GRI Standards for the period from December 
1 to December 31, 2022. In addition, the

In 2022, we reviewed our 
materiality matrix. This annual 
cycle included alignment with 
the approach to materiality 
embedded in the GRI Universal 
Standards 2021, and an initial 
evaluation of the concept of 
double materiality. 

We evaluated diverse impacts, 
risks and opportunities 
through two complementary 
perspectives:

Material Issues 
GRI 3-2Impact  

The relevance of our 
impacts on the economy, 
on the environment and 
on people, including 
human rights; and

Financial  
The potential impacts on 
the company’s financial 
performance and ability 
to create value.

Throughout the year, we systematically 
promoted listening and dialogue through 
existing engagement channels; feedback 
about the Integrated Report encouraged 
continuous improvement; our vision 
of the future and perspectives on the 
material topics were strengthened; 
and evaluation of the alignment of the 
company’s actions with our purpose was 
undertaken.

The materiality process was conducted 
between September and November 2022 
and divided into five phases:

The result was the 
maintenance of the 
current material topics, 
without significant 
changes in their scope.  
Our ESG Databook 
contains fact sheets 
with a detailed overview 
of each topic and how 
we engage with our 
stakeholders. Vale’s 10 
material issues consolidate 
the most relevant impacts, 
risks and opportunities 
for sustainable value 
generation. 

Cutting across all of them 
is innovation, which is

Evaluation of frameworks and external global trend reports related to the material 
topics. During this stage, we confirmed that the 10 material topics should be maintained 
and that they consider, in their scope, the relevant impacts, risks, and opportunities on 
the corporate and mining sector agenda.

 Incorporation of inputs from continuous stakeholder engagement and listening 
channels, and consultation of Vale’s publically available information.

A pilot process to understand the financial materiality of the topics addressed by 
assessing public disclosures and the corporate risk management process, in particular 
assessing the severity of the financial impact of business risks, including those related 
to the material topics.

A round of 26 individual interviews, with 15 of Vale’s top executives and the 
Sustainability Committee and 11 external specialists, on issues related to the material 
topics in order to calibrate the results.

Final consolidation of results and validation.

Founded on June 1, 1942, 
Vale S.A. is one of the 
world’s leading producers 
of iron ore and nickel. We 
produce and sell iron ore, 
iron ore pellets, nickel, 
copper, platinum group 
metals (PGMs), gold, silver, 
and cobalt as byproducts 
of nickel and copper. 

In addition to mining, we 
operate logistics systems, 
including railroads, marine 
terminals, and ports that are 
integrated with our mines. 
We run distribution centers 
to support iron ore delivery 
throughout the world. We also 
have investments in electric 
energy and steel businesses 
through affiliates and joint 
ventures. 

Vale’s headquarters are in Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil - but the 
company is present in many 
parts of the world. A publicly 
held company since 1970, Vale’s 
shares are traded on the Novo 
Mercado of the São Paulo 
Stock Exchange (B3) and on the 
New York (NYSE) and Madrid

Innovation oriented
Innovation is a material topic for us, 
which cuts across and connects with 
all the others. To reflect this vision, 
we have reported several innovation 
initiatives among the chapters. 

For 12 years, Vale has sponsored the 
Vale Technological Institutes, one 
focused on mining and the other on 
promoting sustainability. The latter is a 
pioneering initiative that contributes to 
the generation of scientific knowledge 
on the fauna and flora of the Amazon, 
among other lines of research.

With the goals of making innovation 
more sustainable and fostering a 
culture of innovation to leverage 
cultural transformation, Vale’s 
Innovation Hubs operate as a 
development and experimentation 
network to accelerate the adoption 
of culture and enhance its integration 
into our operations. We ended 2022 

with a total of 8 active internal 
innovation hubs.

We expanded our connection with 
external partners, such as Mining 
Hub, Fiemglab and Findeslab, of 
which Vale is a sponsor. Twenty-
one challenges were prioritized 
with external partners in 2022, five 
of which are the internal operation 
hubs. We undertake partnerships 
in a co-construction format, 
such as the Mining Hub, which is 
an example of collaboration for 
innovative solutions in the mining 
industry as a whole. Participants 
include 24 mining companies, 700 
startups and 15 large suppliers, 
with a reach of 22 countries. Ninety 
proofs of concept have been 
produced in recent years, with the 
signing of 20 contracts between 
mining companies and startups.

In another partnership, we worked 
with the Vale Fund and ITV to 
develop Colab Nature-based 
Solutions (NBS), a collaborative 
environment for generating 
innovative solutions linked to a 
science-based bioeconomy, with 
a focus on the Amazon region. 
Its purpose is to foster emerging 
opportunities for Vale’s future 
growth. The project seeks to produce 
a tested model and identify partners 
acting together, providing a basis for 
the development of new and future 
actions. Read more on Vale Fund  
and Vale Institute of Technology.

Our work in this area resulted 
in Vale being recognized as the 
second most innovative company 
in Brazil in 2022, by the Valor 
Econômico newspaper – the award 
covered not only innovation in 
mining, but also efforts preventing 
deforestation in the Amazon. 
We also received the award for 
Company of the Year 2022 in 
innovation and technology from 
Brasil Mineral magazine and 
was recognized as Fundação  
Dom Cabral (FDC) most  
innovative company of 2022.

planning, guided by the understanding 

that new ways of doing business 
will be required to build the Vale of 
the future: a company that aims to 
promote more sustainable mining, 
seeks low-carbon solutions and a focus 
on discipline in capital allocation.

During the process of reformulating our 
strategy in 2022, we sought to define a 
plan of action in line with our current 
businesses. This plan of action will be 
fundamental for our success over the 
next two decades – coinciding with 
Vale’s 100-year anniversary which will  
be celebrated in 2042:

• sustainable solutions for the  
steel industry;

• energy transition metals;

• development of circular mining;

• nature-based solutions.

To accomplish this strategy, groups of 
five-year goals were defined, allowing 
for revision and adjustment over time, 
according to the context in which we 
operate and society’s demands.

2 An upstream structure is a structure raised using the upstream raising method, in which the body of the structure is built using the thick tailings deposited in the reservoir, 

by successively layering them up and in the direction opposite to the water flow (upstream). This is the same construction method as the Brumadinho dam.

1 Base year 2017 Scopes 1 and 2 
emissions reduced from 13.5 
million tonnes of CO2e to 12.2 
million CO2e due to divestments 
in coal and ferroalloys assets, 
amanganese operations (except 
Simões Filho plant), in addition 
to the Centro-Oeste system 
and Vale Nickel (Dalian) Co., 
carried out in 2022. GRI 2-4

2 Scope 3 emissions for the base 
year of 2018 reduced from 585 
million tons of CO2e to 553 
million CO2e, due to the same 
divestments described in the 
previous note. GRI 2-4

3 Absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions reductions from 
scopes 1 and 2 (market based).

4 An increase in Vale’s Scope 3 
emissions is expected from 
sales volume growth due to the 
likelihood of increased demand 
for our products.

5 In 2021, the method for 
monitoring the renewable 
electricity target in Brazil was 
changed from % renewable 
self-production to % renewable 
consumption.

6 The percentage of renewable 
electricity varies from 
year to year depending on 
consumption, the volume of 
certificates obtained, and the 
electricity generation matrix  
of each country in which  
we operate.

7 In this indicator, the production 
volumes of Vale’s main 
products, such as pellets, coal, 
nickel and copper, are converted 
into ton of iron ore equivalent.

8 Until 2021, the Energy Intensity 
indicator considered the main 
energy sources in Vale’s matrix 
(coal/coke, fuel oil, natural gas 
and diesel). After 2022, this 
indicator will consider the sum 
of all energy consumption 
within the organization divided 
by the published production 
for the year, transformed 
into MFe-eq. In addition, 
divestments concluded in 2022 
were also reflected in the 2017 
target baseline. GRI 2-4

We recognize that our operation and 
value chain deal with sensitive social 
and environmental issues, which can 
have impacts and create the risk of 
human rights violations. Therefore, 
our commitment to human rights is 
directly connected to Vale’s strategic 
pillars and based on respect for 
people’s dignity and integrity. 

To guide our actions, Vale has a Global 
Human Rights Policy, which we have 
sought to align with international 
initiatives and standards such as the 
UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights, the UN Global 

Compact, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, the principles 
and guidelines of the ICMM and the 
International Finance Corporation 
(IFC) Performance Standards,  
among others.

Online human rights training is 
mandatory for all own employees 
and lasts 2 hours. In 2022, 14,000 
new employees were trained, 
totaling 28,000 hours of training. 
For new contractors, a training 
video is provided during onboarding, 
focusing on the main critical human 
rights issues. For corporate teams

What do 
stakeholders 
expect from Vale?

Vale’s commitments 
to human rights, 
and how these are 
shared with our 
value chain.

1.Human rights
responsible for Security, 223 of our 
own employees (100%) and 2,710 
contractors (97%) were trained in 
human rights. GRI 2-24 | 410-1

Vale has voluntary partnerships with 
institutions working on human rights. 
As part of the programs developed 
in 2022, with the support of BSR, 
the company evaluated the level 
of compensation of all Vale’s direct 
employees. The result showed that 
100% of employees receive a living 
wage, as per global benchmarks of 
‘living wage’ and according to  
BSR’s methodology.

The protection of human rights is entering the legislative 
agenda in several countries. There are initiatives in 
the European Union, and a number of countries are 
starting to develop their own legislation, that require 
companies to conduct due diligence to identify and 
mitigate negative impacts on human rights. In addition, 
companies that account for their human rights programs 
and impacts are increasingly expected to use hard data 
and indicators to demonstrate their performance. 
Maturity in the disclosure of ESG information and, above 
all, of human rights management, are going to be judged 
by this information and how it is presented.” 

Jonathan Drimmer, BSR Senior Advisor, in an interview as part 
of Vale’s Materiality Review, conducted in November 2022.

Human rights is part of our 
Integrated Risk Map, which is 
one of the tools in Vale’s risk 
management process. 

In addition, all our risks are 
assessed for their impact on the 
human rights dimension, which 
involves the analysis of critical 
issues such as poor working 
conditions and modern slavery, 
child labor and sexual exploitation 
of children and adolescents, labor 
relations violations, violations in 

communities, and large-scale  
human rights violations. 

Risks and opportunities are  
identified through risk and impact 
assessments conducted by operations 
and projects; technical visits by the 
Human Rights team; the results of 
independent verification (external 
due diligence) at our operations and 
those of our suppliers; the results of 
complaints through our grievance 
mechanisms (via the Audit process 
or the Whistleblower Channel); and 

Human rights risk management

the assessment of new ventures 
(mergers & acquisitions and  
joint ventures). 

Our operations update their 
assessments of the risk of human 
rights violations every year, and 
carry out monitoring as part of 
the company’s risk management 
process. They adopt prevention 
and mitigation control measures 
for these risks and perform 

periodic tests with the goal of 
ensuring their effectiveness. 

The probability of occurrence 
and severity of the impact are 
checked during the Human 
Rights assessment. From there, 
action plans are developed 
and implemented, along with 
monitoring, with the goal of 
reducing the exposure of people 
and the company to such risks.

We have committed to 
performing human rights due 
diligence at all our operations 
and critical projects in 
three-year cycles, with a 
methodology aligned to 
international standards  
on the subject. 

In 2022, 10 human rights due 
diligences were performed, 
contemplating a total of 
22 operations evaluated by 
a third party specialized in 
human rights, in operations 
in the Southeast and South 
corridors1. This concluded 
the external human rights 
due diligence process in 100% 
of Vale’s active operations 
in Brazil. The main results 
indicated salient issues related 
to impacts around working 
conditions, harassment, 
discrimination, and relations 
with communities. 

There were no incidents of 
child or forced labor occurring 
at or involving Vales’s 
operations and suppliers 
in the most recent due 

Due Diligence in human rights

diligence exercise. However, we 
recognize this risk as a salient 
issue and therefore act to 
prevent its occurrence in our 
operations and suppliers.  
GRI 408-1 | 409-1

Recommendations are made 
as a result of the due diligence 
process. Action plans are 
implemented with preventive 
and mitigatory controls 
and corrective measures 
complementary to those 
already adopted, with the  
goal of reducing the exposure 
of people or the company to

As part of the human rights 
due diligence process it is also 
important to evaluate our 
supply chain. For this reason,  
in 2019, Vale began a process  
to verify our supply chain  
to assess its level of 
commitment to respecting 
human rights.

In 2019, after the Brumadinho 
tailings dam failure, Vale began 
a profound journey intended to 
promote company culture as a 
catalyst for the business strategy. 

During this process we carried out 
a cultural diagnostic, defined our 
direction, engaged our employees, 

Vale respects the local minimum 
wage defined by legislation, and 
there is no significant difference2  
in basic salaries between women and 
men working in the same functions, 
as guided by the Human Resources 
Policy. Any variations are due to 
different levels of seniority and  
the experience of the employees  
in their functional category.

Deductions from or restrictions on 
compensation that could result in 
the employee becoming indebted to 
the company are also prohibited. 

Vale pays 100% of its employees a 
living wage3, aimed at establishing 
compensation standards necessary 
for the well-being of employees and 
their families.

Benefits  GRI 401-2

The following benefits, which 
vary according to each country’s 
legislation, are assured: medical and 
dental assistance; life insurance; 
private pension plan; personal 
accident insurance; transportation 
allowance; educational training; food 
allowance; and employee assistance 
program. In Brazil, the benefits are 
offered to all Vale’s direct employees, 
including those employed on a  
fixed-term (temporary) or part-time 
(4/6 hour shifts) basis.

Organizational culture Compensation 
GRI 202-1 | 405-2

reviewed our main systems and 
processes and made progress in 
measuring the results of this cultural 
transformation.

In 2020, we implemented Echoes 
Pulse, a survey that sought to assess 
employees’ perceptions of cultural 
transformation. In 2022, we expanded 

Collective bargaining   
GRI 3-3 

Collective bargaining is a 
continuous practice in most 
countries where we operate. Vale 
respects freedom of association 
and seek to establish healthy 
and constructive relationships 
with employee representatives. 
Our actions are guided by Vale’s 
Code of Conduct, on local 
labor legislation, on the eight 
Fundamental Conventions of the 
International Labor Organization 
(ILO) and on the guidelines of 
the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development 
(OECD). In the countries where 
we operate, when local legislation 
restricts this right, we strive to 
maintain dialogue with equivalent 
employee organizations.

Considering all the countries 
where Vale operates, 94% of own 
employees are covered by collective 
agreements. GRI 2-30 | 407-1 

Our direct employees in Brazil have 
not embarked on a strike since 
1989. In this time, we have favored 
negotiation and the resolution of 
collective conflicts through dialogue 
with the unions, and the training 
of the company’s leaders on labor 
relations issues. The conflicts have 
been reduced and so has the number 
of lawsuits involving Vale and unions. 
The number of employees voluntarily 
associated with unions has grown. 
In Brazil, 100% of employees are 
covered by collective bargaining 
involving 12 unions, and more than 
15,000 are voluntary members of the 
unions that represent them. GRI 2-30

In this new format, we began to

more than 24,000 employees (37.5%) 
were heard.

Since 2019, Vale’s Global Talent 
Review program has been used to 
continuously monitor the careers, 
development, and readiness of 
successors for critical positions  
(up to 112 people in 2022) – in the 
short, medium and long term,  
with the goal of contributing to 
the continuity of the business.  
GRI 404-2

In addition, diversity and inclusion 
are considered: among the  
112 critical positions mapped,  
72% have at least one woman  
and 46% have at least one  
non-white professional mapped 
out as successors, with the  
goal of ensuring a diverse 
leadership pipeline.

Valer, the company’s Corporate 
University, has a structured portfolio 
of Training and Development 
interventions, focused on technical, 
management, and leadership skills. 

The courses are geared toward 
crosscutting topics aligned to the 
company’s strategy, such as security, 
VPS, risk management  
and sustainability.

Because we believe that leadership 
plays a fundamental role in influencing 
our Cultural Transformation Journey, 
we have structured leadership training 
programs and on-demand courses 
available in the Leadership Academy 
portfolio that enable leaders to 
manage talent and be responsible for 
developing their subordinates. 

Vale has invested in attracting  
and developing talent, respecting 
and encouraging diversity. 

We strive to promote an equitable 
and inclusive work environment. 
In 2022, we expanded affirmative 
action for minority groups, 
generating value and development 
for the communities in the regions 
where Vale operates. 

Professional qualification programs, 
career development, and training 
focused on fighting harassment, 
discrimination, and prejudice were 
priorities in the diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI) strategy.

in the Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion Report.

Ethnic and racial equity

One of the commitments 
we have made to the ethnic 
and racial equity agenda is to 
have 40% of our leadership 
(coordinators and above) 
in Brazil made up of black 
employees by 2026. In 2022, we 
reached 32.1%, an advance of 
more than three percentage 
points over 2021. 

We strive every day to fight 
racism in all its forms as we 
recognize that our role in 
society goes far beyond mining. 
Among such initiatives, is the 
process of changing the name 
of the “Capitão do Mato”4 mine 
and dam, located in the Vargem 
Grande Complex, in Nova Lima, 
Minas Gerais. This is a name 
with racist connotation and the 
change reinforces our belief 
that fighting discrimination and 
promoting racial equity must 
happen in all environments and 
locations where we operate. 
“Horizontes” (Horizons) was  
the new name elected in a  
vote held among employees  
of the operation.

People with disabilities

As a result of the efforts made 
to increase the representation 
of people with disabilities 
(PWD) in our workforce, 
the Public Ministry of Labor 

recognized Vale for the 
achievement of a 5.4% 
quota of professionals 
with disabilities in the 
total workforce of Vale 
S/A, exceeding the quota 
established by law5, which has 
historically been a challenge 
for Brazilian companies. 

We also started the 
Accessibility Job Mapping 
Project to improve the 
inclusion and career 
experience of professionals 
with disabilities within the 
company. The pilot was 
conducted at the Brucutu 
and Exploration CDM units 
in Minas Gerais, and the 
Portos Sul units in Rio de 
Janeiro, where analyses and 
evaluations of functions, 
as well as an accessibility 
analysis of workstations, 
buildings, and surroundings 
were performed.

Gender equity

In line with our goal of doubling 
the representation of women 
in the workforce by 2025, Vale 
ended 2022 with over 5,000 
more women in the workforce 
compared to December 2019. 
Since we made our commitment 
to gender equity in 2019, the 
number of women in senior 
leadership positions has increased 
by 88%. Since 2020, the Global 
Trainee Program has contributed 
to training Vale’s future leaders 
and prioritizing talent diversity. 
Among the 113 trainees selected 
in 2022 in Brazil, 67% are women 
and 71% identified themselves as 
black or mixed race.

The data shows our evolution, 
which has been a constant 
challenge to reach a position 
where DEI is a mature,  
effective and central practice  
for our business.

character of the Brazilian colonial era, whose 
main function was to recapture enslaved 
people (several times, in the bush) with extreme 
violence. And its use, regardless of context, is still 
a racist term.

Our Health and Safety strategy is 
supported by the VPS and exemplifies 
our value of “Life comes first”. It is 
based on three pillars: prevention 
of injuries and chronic diseases; 
prevention of fatalities; and 
prevention of catastrophic accidents.

We strive to align our occupational 
health and safety goals with 
international standards, allowing 
us to monitor the evolution of this 
strategy and the search for market 
best practices and results. Our main 
objective is to keep people at the 
center of our decisions, promoting 
the physical and mental wellbeing 
of our employees and maintaining a 
healthy environment suitable for the 
development of our business.

Accidents and fatalities  
GRI 3-3 | 403-9 

In 2022, there were 19 events in 
our operations classified as under 
categories N1 – fatalities or changed 
lives (6) and N2 – lost time, restricted 
work or medical treatment cases 
resulting from high potential events 
(13). This is a 44% reduction compared 
to 2021, representing the third 
consecutive year of improvement in 
safety results. 

Despite this, regrettably, in 2022 there 
were five fatalities at our operations. 
Internal investigation processes were 

followed for all of these incidents, 
with independent executive 
leadership and the involvement of 
global experts on the topics as well 
as employee representatives. The 
processes also ensure that learnings 
are shared through global webcasts 
and, as the investigations progress, 
comprehensive preventative 
actions are defined with mandatory 
compliance by all areas.

All strategic actions aimed at the 
evolution of our safety system seek 
to prioritize the elimination of  
high potential events.

Occupational health and  
safety management  GRI 403-1 

Our strategy to reduce High Potential 
Accidents has shown significant 
results in the reduction of injuries  
and the rate of recordable accidents. 

As part of the VPS management

elements geared towards 
Occupational  
Health and Safety, comprising 
initiatives aimed preventing and 
mitigating risks, promoting the

Vale Production System 

The Vale Production System (VPS) 
management system is one of the 
levers which supports our aim to 
become a benchmark in safety, and 
the best and most reliable operator. 
The VPS seeks to strengthens  
Vale’s organizational culture 
through people development, 
standardization of best 
practices, operational discipline 
and routine compliance. Its 
application is mandatory for 
the whole of Vale, with global 
adoption in the operational and 
administrative areas. As a result 
of its implementation, we aim to 
achieve better safety rates, greater 
employee engagement and better 
reliability of critical assets.

Driven by the generation of 
sustainable results, the system 
provides for the implementation 
of management practices and 
methods that enable safer and 
more environmentally responsible 
operations, while also ensuring the 
integrity of company assets. 

The minimum compliance requirements for these 
dimensions and their elements are verified annually  
in formal assessments.

improvement of the management system and 
are monitored by Vale’s governance bodies, 
which includes the Executive Committee, the 
Sustainability Committee and the Board.

Health and safety goals 

• Zero fatalities.

• Reduce the number of 
exposures to health hazards 
in the workplace by 50% by 
2025. In 2019, we had 23,000 
occupational health and 
safety exposures and ended 
2022 with 13,000 - a reduction 
of 43%. The goal is to  
reach 11,500 exposures  
by 2025.

Key Health and Safety initiatives

Process Safety  
Management (PSM): 

we integrate process safety 
into our VPS management 
system and actively embedded 
this concept within the mining 
business through the guidance 
of Brazilian Mining Institute 
(IBRAM), the ICMM and the 
Center for Chemical Process 
Safety (CCPS). 

Technical Standards  
of Asset Integrity (PNR): 

mandatory normative standards 
applicable to the asset’s entire 
life cycle. The PNRs consider 
the requirements of the VPS, 
international standards, best 
practices, statistics, the product 
of HIRAs (Hazard Identification 
and Risk Assessment), lessons 
learned from accident histories, 
and external consultations by 
engineering and process safety 
companies, among others.

Safe Work  
Permit (SWP): 

the process encompasses 
the pre-planning, planning, 
scheduling, and execution stages 
of a given task through prior 
knowledge of the risks and 
definition of the controls. The 
SWP is being implemented across 
a wide variety of operations and 
projects, aiming to protect those 
performing tasks that involve 
high or very high risk. 

Critical Activity  
Requirements (CARs): 

CARs establish mandatory 
requirements that must be 
implemented by leaders in their 
respective areas of activity and 
processes, whether they are 
performed by Vale employees or 
service providers, on the following 
topics: working at height; light 
motor vehicles; operation of 
mobile equipment; blocking, 
identification and zero energy; 
load hoisting; confined space; 
machine protection; ground 
activities; explosives; working 
with electricity; and liquid metal.

Exposure to  
health risks: 

a global corporate guideline 
was established for the 
management and development 
of monitoring and control 
programs for employee 
occupational health, including 
quantitative objectives for 
the reduction of health risk 
scenarios in the medium term.

Prevention  
of disability: 

in 2022, we moved a step 
further toward preventing 
cases that lead to employee 
disability. Musculoskeletal, 
mental and behavioral disorders 
are the leading risks, both 
in Brazil and worldwide. The 
guidelines include a list of 
tools to conduct integrated, 
individual and collective health 
management, as well as to 
promote quality of life. More 
recently, a specific approach to 
the topic of emotional health has 
been incorporated to mitigate 
psychosocial risk factors.

In some situations, our operations may pose 
a physical risk to people living in the vicinity. 
To that end, from the moment an event is 
reported, we are committed to involving 
the communities in discussions about the 
implementation of actions to mitigate the risk 
of recurrence of these events. These events 
are safety events with social loss – that result 
in injuries to people not employed by Vale 
and which occur in areas for which Vale is 
responsible, or external areas (as long as they 
are in the course of production or provide 
activities that support production). 

These events are considered independently of 
the possible civil or criminal liability of those 
involved and are aimed at identifying the 
causes of the event and the actions needed 
to avoid their recurrence. These can be a wide 
range of events, from collisions between 
Vale vehicles and motorcyclists from the 
community, to railroad collisions.

The goal for 2022 was to reduce the number 
of events affecting community members by 

10%, and the result achieved was 8.7%. There 
was a 32% reduction in fatal injuries. In 2023, 
the goal is to reduce the occurrence of injury 
events affecting community members by 
10% compared to the 2022 result.

Among the actions that contributed to 
the reduction of events, we highlight the 
improvement of tools used for monitoring 
and recording occurrences and of the 
regulations related to the management 
of security events with communities. In 
addition, a more effective risk management 
process has been carried out through the 
Integrated Community Safety Plans, which 
have an integrated approach to all local 
operations present in an area.

The results obtained in relation to the 
safety target in communities have a direct 
bearing on the variable compensation of our 
executives, in an innovative and pioneering 
initiative to give concrete foundations to our 
value of life matters most.

established for the variable compensation target for 2022, 
which also refers to 2021, is 25 fatalities. The difference 
is explained by I) exclusion of the events that occurred 
in Coal (19), a business sold by Vale, and II) exclusion of 
suicides (5). It is important to stress that both fatalities 
resulting from suicide and those that occurred in Coal 
remain in the Events with Social Loss Monitoring base, 
and were excluded only for the purpose of accounting for 
the results related to the target. GRI 2-4

2 N2 events, according to Vale terminology.

Created in late 2020 for the purpose of accelerating 
health and safety outcomes through the use of 
technology, the Safety Transformation Program 
contributed positive results in 2022, by ensuring 
the technological adequacy of critical activity 
requirements in motor vehicles, mobile equipment 
and power blocking (CARs 2, 3 and 4) and by the 
practice of sensing and remote operation in Dams 
Self-Rescue Zones (ZAS)1. These results included:

• an approximately 55% reduction in high-potential 
events2 with motor vehicles (CAR 2), mobile 
equipment (CAR 3), and power interruption  
in 2 years (CAR 4);

• more than 50,000 people protected;

• more than 95% overall adherence to CARs 2 and 3 
(motor vehicles and mobile equipment);

In addition, the Program contributed to protecting more  
than 50,000 people with the following actions:

• 11,000 security devices installed in our equipment and/
or facilities;

• more than 400 electrical rooms were equipped with 
systems to allow identification and blocking of 
electrical arrays; 

• deployment of the world’s first remote silo operation 
at the Carajás operating dam promoting the removal 
of people from the Self-Rescue Zone (ZAS) and the 
maintenance of the operating license.

The Program still has many challenges to overcome by 
2025, such as continuing to accelerate the adaptation of 
the CARs, relocating 100% of fixed workstations in the 
ZAS and ensuring 100% visibility of people in risk areas.

Our risk management, which we 
believe is crucial to conducting 
our business and supporting the 
achievement of our strategic 
objectives, is based on the Risk 
Management Policy, revised 
in 2022, which determines the 
methodologies, guidelines, response 
strategy, governance,  
and responsibilities on the topic.

Our risk management is structured 
under the lines of defense model, 
which is aimed at ensuring robust 
governance and efficient controls. 
It is based on some of the main 
global standards, such as ISO 31000, 
ISO 55000, COSO-ERM and, for 
operational safety, the Risk Based 
Process Safety (RBPS) operational 
safety management system. Our 
risk management process considers 
the present risks (operational and 
non-operational), business risks, 
and emerging risks, whose concepts 
are contemplated in the company’s 
specific norms.

The Advisory Committees to Vale’s 
Board of Directors are charged 

Risk management GRI 2-16 | 2-23 | 2-25 | 403-2

with overseeing the scope 
and effectiveness of risk 
management. The Risk Executive 
Committees, whose creation is 
now the responsibility of Vale’s 
Executive Committee, act in a 
preventive manner and support 
the Executive Vice Presidents 
in monitoring risks and making 
necessary decisions. There are 
five Risk Executive Committees, 
with different scopes of 
action: (i) Operational Risks, (ii) 
Geotechnical Risks, (iii) Strategic, 
Financial and Cyber Risks, (iv) 
Compliance, Institutional and 
Communications Risks, and (v) 
Sustainability Risks GRI 2-12.

The Integrated Risk Map, a  
non-exhaustive instrument that 
contains the set of potential 
risk topics, was re-evaluated 
and approved by the Board 
of Directors in July 2022, on 
the recommendation of the 
Executive Committee, with 
the goal of contemplating risks 
that need to be assessed and 
monitored in all Vale units. 

Operational risk  
management program

We use the HIRA (Hazard 
Identification and Risk 
Assessment) program for 
operational risk management. 
HIRA is designed to map and 
analyze operational high 
severity or very high risk 
magnitude security risks, 
identify and define performance 
criteria, and establish the 
assurance of appropriate critical 
controls and mitigation plans.

In 2022, we started the second 
cycle of HIRA assessments 
(2022 to 2026), covering 
six operational sites and 
considering important 
operational interruption 
scenarios, which could 
cause significant financial 
losses in addition to having 
consequences for people safety 
and environmental impacts, 
already assessed since the first 
cycle. Over a period of up to 
four years, all our operations 
will be reassessed. 

Emerging risks

Vale seeks to map all of 
its emerging risks, which 
consist of new or previously 
known risks - under new or 
different conditions and/or 
circumstances - and those 
which have a high degree 
of uncertainty as to their 
tendency, severity and 
probability of occurrence.  
They are usually influenced  
by external factors, which 
makes them difficult to 
predict. We keep an updated 
list of these risks, validated 
with top management  
Vale administration.  
Examples include: 

 Risks of transition to  
a low-carbon economy:

• Product substitution  
due to new technologies 
and processes

• Changes in supply and 
demand, specifically for  
low carbon products

• Changes in policies, 
including carbon tax

• Climate-related litigations 
and reputational impacts

 Geopolitical tension and 
international sanctions.

Transition risks to a low-carbon economy

Transition risks are those related to technological, market, 
regulatory and legal or reputational aspects.

Product substitution due to new technologies and processes 
may result in the advent or discontinuation of some products  
in our portfolio; 

Alterations in demand, specifically for low carbon products,  
may impact our business, according to the scenario variation; 

Changes in public policies, including carbon taxation,  
may impose higher costs on emitters, which impacts the cost  
of our products;

Litigation may occur as a result of more restrictive laws 
and reputational impacts due to consumer and investor 
perceptions about Vale’s approach to the transition  
to a low carbon economy.

Geopolitical tensions and international sanctions

Geopolitical tensions could lead to a protectionist approach, 
disruption of international trade flows, extreme pricing, high 
volatility in the markets, with particular impact on the energy 
sector, and increase regulatory and contractual uncertainty.

They may also lead to a cooling off of the international 
sanctions scenario by imposing new restrictions on selling  
or purchasing products, or on conducting business with  
specific countries, companies and individuals, impacting  
our production chain.

GRI 3-3 | G4 MM34.Dams

After the tragic events that surrounded 
the failure of the tailings dams1 at Mariana 
and Brumadinho, tailings dams have 
become one of the biggest challenges 
of the mining sector and especially of 
Vale, due to the risks associated with its 
existence and the feeling of insecurity 
in the communities close to the mining 
operations. 

As a priority, we have adopted rigorous 
management standards, created 
since 2019, and have committed to 
decharacterizing all upstream tailings 
dams in Brazil by 2035, 40% of which have 
already been removed. We implemented 
the integrated Geotechnical Monitoring 
Center, which further contributed to a all 
dams, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

Tailings and dam 
management 
After the Brumadinho tailings 
dam failure, Vale moved from a 
management system based on 
periodic ratings of stability conditions 
of the structures - the Dam Stability 
Condition Statements (DCEs) - to 
a system based on continuous 
assessments conducted by third 
parties (Engineer of Record - EoR) 
throughout the year. 

In addition, there are multi-layer 
reviews, continuous monitoring  
and support by an updated 
management system based on best 
practices – the Vale Tailings and  
Dam Management System (TDMS),  
which was implemented in 2020. 
These management processes are 
fully aligned with the new Global 
Industry Standard on Tailings 
Management (GISTM).

The system was finalized in 2022 and 
our geotechnical teams were trained 
on its use. The TDMS includes the 
provision of external independent 
reviewers that augment the levels 
and layers of internal review: EORs, 
the Independent Tailings Review 
Board (ITRB) and Periodic Independent 
Dam Safety Reviews (RPSB) that 
support the internal processes of 

technical inspections, reviews and 
performance evaluations. All Vale’s 
dams in Minas Gerais continue to 
operate under an independent 
external auditor process as the result 
of the agreement signed in 2019 with 
the Public Prosecution Office of the 
State of Minas Gerais.

As part of the commitment to GISTM 
implementation and our work to 
eliminate the gaps identified in the 
2021 self-assessment, the GISTM 100 
Journey program was established 
in 2022. By December 2022, our 
internal assessment indicated we 
had achieved 90% conformance 
to the requirements of the GITSM, 
considering the assessed structures 
and their consequence ratings2. The 
goal is to achieve compliance for all 
our tailings storage facilities by 2025. 
For those classified as of ‘Extreme’ 
and ‘Very High’ consequence, the 
goal is August 2023. 

Global Industry Standard Tailings Management

The GISTM was created in 2020 from a United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) initiative with the Principles 
for Responsible Investment (PRI) and the ICMM, setting a new 
benchmark for tailings dam safety as the mining industry’s 
first global standard. The standard classifies tailings dams 
according to their potential for impact in the event of a failure.

Vale has 140 Dams and Tailings Storage 
Facilities (TSFs) registered with Brazil’s 
National Mining Agency (ANM) from its 
Brazilian Ferrous and South Atlantic Base 
Metals Units, of which: 

• 39 TSFs (37 in the Ferrous and 2 in South 
Atlantic Base Metals Operations) and;

• 101 tailing dams (82 at Ferrous and 19 at 
South Atlantic Base Metals Operations)

Of the total, 98 are covered by Brazil’s 
National Dam Safety Policy – 911 at our 
Ferrous operations and 7 at the South 
Atlantic Base Metals operations, and 
all are subject to the Regular Safety 
Inspection Report (RISR) on a  
twice-yearly basis.

1 Includes two drained stacks that receive the same legal treatment as dams and TSFs.
2 Resolution ANM 95/2022.
3 Emergency levels are categorized into 1, 2 or 3, determined by increasing risk to the safety of the structure.
4 Critical Safety Conditions.

In the North Atlantic Base Metals 
operations, there are 66 dams and TSFs 
located in Canada (Ontario, Manitoba, 
Newfoundland and Labrador), all of 
which have publicly reported their 
performance against the Canadian 
Mining Association’s Towards 
Sustainable Mining (TSM) program.

Vale has intensified preventive, 
corrective and monitoring actions for 
our structures. Since 2020, we have 
reduced by one third (from 35 to 23) 
the total number of structures at 
emergency level. The emergency level 
is a category established by Brazilian 
legislation2 to classify potential risks 
that could compromise dam safety.

In December 2022, Vale signed an agreement valued at BRL 500 
million for reparation work in the District of Macacos in Nova 
Lima. The parties to the agreement are the Public Prosecutor’s 
Office of Minas Gerais and the State Public Defender’s Office, 
with the participation of the City of Nova Lima and the Federal 
Public Prosecutor’s Office. The goal is to formalize and define the 
next steps in the reparation work for the community impacted 
by the evacuations that occurred in 2019 in the interests of the 
safety of the population, following the increase of emergency 
level classification for the B3/B4 dam at the Mar Azul Mine.

As agreed, the Integral Reparation and Compensation Plan 
focuses on income transfer, trade and tourism reskilling, 
strengthening municipal public services and responding to the 
demands of the affected communities. Since the increase in the 
dam level, Vale has already disbursed more than BRL 120 million 
in emergency payments to the community.

Among other measures, the agreement ensures that the 
emergency payment to directly affected people will continue for 
another 36 months, to the value of BRL 77.5 million. Work is also 
planned for the repair of urban infrastructure, with the recovery 
of sidewalks and public transportation, as well as support for 
entrepreneurs and local tourism. Education, security, health, 
social assistance, and environment will also be covered.

An independent technical audit will be contracted to monitor 
the results of the agreement, as well as independent technical 
advisory services to help the affected communities select, 
develop and present projects for funding.

As a result of this Agreement being put in place, addressing  
the demands related to collective damages, the Public Civil 
Action was closed.

By the end of 2022, the 
emergency level of the B3/
B4 dam in Nova Lima, Minas 
Gerais, was reduced from 3 to 2. 
This positive step was possible 
due to the progress of the 
decharacterization process with 
the removal of more than 50% 
of the tailings from the reservoir, 
improving the stability conditions 
of the structure. 

As a precautionary measure, the 
ANM’s Resolution 95 directs that 
the Self-Rescue Zone (ZAS) must 

be evacuated at emergency 
level 2 or higher. This means 
that the families who have 
been relocated from the area 
will not return to the site until 
it is downgraded to level 1. 

Tailings removal works will 
continue to be conducted by 
remotely operated equipment 
and the forecast is to complete 
the decharacterization of the 
structure by 2025, two years 
earlier than initially planned.

Technological solutions for dams

Investment in new technologies 
is one of the main paths aimed at 
increasing safety and reducing the 
use of tailings dams. 

Natural moisture processing

To replace wet processing and reduce 
the generation of tailings, Vale 
has implemented natural moisture 
processing, making progress in 
reducing dependence on dams.

Filtered tailings 

Tailings are filtered and disposed  
of in slurry piles to reduce the  
use of dams. 

Technologies for monitoring 
tailings dams and TSFs

Vale’s dams are monitored 24 hours 
a day, seven days a week. High-tech 
instruments are used to provide 
accurate data, such as video cameras 
with artificial intelligence, radar 
that detect millimetric movements, 
drones for inspection, piezometers 
(that measure water pressure) and 

geophones sensors (that measure 
induced and natural seismic wavest).

The data is collected in real time 
and forwarded to the Geotechnical 
Monitoring Centers (CMG), which 
are located in Minas Gerais 
(Itabira and Nova Lima) and in 
Pará (Parauapebas). Information 
is analyzed on a continuous basis 
by technicians. This enables us to 
check the condition of the structures 
and take preventive and corrective 
measures quickly and safely.

Unmanned equipment

The remote operation of vehicles 
from outside the risk area increases 
the safety of employees while 
performing decharacterization 
work on upstream dams. Trucks, 
excavators, and tractors equipped 
with driverless technology are 
used. The professional operates the 
equipment by remote control, in a 
room equipped with cameras, far 
away from the tailings dam’s risk area.

Remote Operations Center

An Operations Center has been 
set up in Belo Horizonte, which 
allows employees working on 
the decharacterization process 
to remotely control equipment 
kilometers away from the risk area of 
the most critical dams. Currently all 
the unmanned equipment used in the 
decharacterization of the B3/B4 dam, 
in Nova Lima, is remotely controlled 
from this center. Further use of the 
center for operations of other tailings 
dams is being studied.

Lifeline/Lift Line Spider

A monocable lifeline system is in place 
at the B3/B4 dams, at the Mar Azul 
Mine, and at Grupo, at the Fábrica 
Mine, as well as at the Forquilhas I 
and II. In an emergency, it is designed 
to rescue technicians working on 
structures by lifting them out of 
danger. The Lift Lines are controlled 
by an operator in a suspended cabin 
and use vertical cables to rescue 
employees if needed.

In Brazil, all dams classified with 
high associated potential damage 
(DPA) have a technical document 
that defines immediate actions 
that should take place in case of 
emergency1. The Emergency Action 
Plans for Mining Dams (PAEBM), 
developed according to legal criteria 
and filed with the Municipal and State 
Civil Defense bodies, determines 
that if emergency level 2 is reached, 
Vale should undertake preventive 
relocation of the population located 
in Self-Rescue Zones (ZAS) to safe 
areas outside the floodplain.

Emergency action plans  
for mining dams 

Deep Drive

The equipment performs seismic 
cone penetration testing (SCPTu) 
– the seismic wave measurement 
survey of dams – remotely. Deep 
Drive reaches a depth of up to 100 
meters and has a control cabin 
connected to a winch system. The 
solution allows us to remotely 
conduct the drilling required for 
decharacterization work, in tailings 
dams with restricted access.

Hydraulic driving of steel piles 
(Gyropress)

The technology was applied in the 
work of secondary containment 
(downstream containment 
structure - backup dams) of the 
Minervino and Cordão Nova Vista, 
in Itabira. In this method, the steep 
piles for the dams are installed by a 
low-vibration rotating embedding 
system, without removing existing 
underground structures, resulting 
in safer work operations and less 
risk on nearby communities. 

Vale has teams dedicated in 
implementing the PAEBMs. In 
order to ensure understanding of 
the actions outlined in the PAEBM 
and to clarify how to proceed in an 
emergency situation, Orientation 
Seminars/Public Meetings 
and emergency drills are held 
annually with the participation 
of communities located in the 
ZAS downstream of the dams, 
employees, civil defense agencies and 
municipalities. In 2022, 21 Orientation 
Seminars/Public Meetings and 17 
external emergency drills were held2.

1 At the state level in Minas Gerais, the Tailings Dam Safety Policy is more comprehensive determining all 
structures, independent of their DPA, must have PAEBMs issued.

The decharacterization of 
all tailings dams and similar 
geotechnical structures (such as 
dykes and drained stacks) built by 
the upstream method is a legal 
obligation in Brazil. 

Vale has already decharacterized  
12 out of a total of 30 upstream 
tailing dams, including five1 in 
2022, all in Minas Gerais, Brazil:

•  Baixo João Pereira Dam, at the 
Fábrica Mine in Congonhas;

•  Auxiliary dyke of dam 5,  
at the Águas Claras Mine  
in Nova Lima;

•  Dykes 3 and 4 in the Pontal 
System at the Cauê Mine  
in Itabira; 

•  Ipoema Dam at Mina  
do Meio in Itabira.

Schedule

Due to the technical complexity of dam 
decharacterization, we signed a Term 
of Commitment with the Government 
of Minas Gerais, regulatory agencies, 
and the State and Federal Public 
Prosecutor’s Offices to establish a new 
schedule to fulfill the commitment 
made to society. 

The agreement also foresees a 
contribution from Vale of USD 43.7 
million for investments in social  
and environmental projects, to  
be disbursed over eight years.

Geotechnical structures decharacterization forecast by year

The tailings removed during the 
decharacterization process have been 
deposited in depleted pits and in sterile 
and tailings piles. In addition, studies 
are underway to reuse the tailings from 
the company’s facilities, with the aim 
of providing the material a sustainable 
destination in strict compliance with the law. 
One place where this is already being done 
is the Vargem Grande dam, in Minas Gerais, 
which is in the process of decharacterization. 

The reuse of tailings seeks to reduce  
the environmental impact of the process  
by reducing the need for areas where  
we can safely dispose of the material 
removed from the reservoirs.  
Read more at: Circular Economy.

1 The decharacterization of these structures is awaiting formal validation by the competent bodies.
2 The term “de-characterization”, according to Brazilian legislation, means functionally reintegrating the structure and its contents into the environment, so that the 

structure no longer serves its primary purpose of acting as a tailings containment.
3 An upstream structure is a structure raised using the upstream raising method, in which the body of the structure is built using the thick tailings deposited in the reservoir, 

by successively layering them up and in the direction opposite to the water flow (upstream). This is the same construction method as the Brumadinho dam.
4 The ECJs were designed to meet the tailings containment requirements of the structures for which they are intended, and adaptations may be necessary. Vale monitors 

extreme weather events, and when they occur the technical teams are mobilized to evaluate and implement improvements necessary for the adjustment of the structures.
5 Structure with capacity to retain the tailings from the Forquilha I, II, III, IV and Group, in the case of a simultaneous rupture.
6 The emergency level is a category established by Brazilian legislation to classify potential risks that could compromise dam safety.

All the company’s geotechnical 
structures in this situation 
already have their respective 
containments completed. 
This is the case for the South 
Superior dam at the Gongo 
Soco mine in Barão de Cocais; 
for the B3/B4 dam at the Mar 
Azul mine in Nova Lima; and 
for the Forquilha III dam at the 
Fábrica mine in Itabirito. 

In 2022, Vale delivered the 
containment structure 
downstream of Coqueirinho, 
which is intended to 
enhance safety during the 
decharacterization activities at 
the Minervino and Cordão Nova 
Vista dykes, both in Itabira, 
and with the scheduled to be 
completed by 2029. In 2022, 
a total of four downstream 
containment structures had 
already been built. 

In addition, since work on 
tailings dams can result in 
increased risks, residents 
living in the flood areas 
- Self-Rescue Zones - of 
dams at more critical 
levels were evacuated to 
temporary residences. See 
additional information 
about involuntary 
resettlement below.

Vale also operates tailings 
dams in Canada, including 
upstream structures. 
However, these structures 
are not currently part 
of the decommissioning 
plan. Our dams in Canada 
are built to Canadian 
Dam Association (CDA) 
engineering standards. 
Any dams that predate 
these standards are being 
upgraded accordingly. 

For the dams at the most critical ‘emergency 
level’6, Vale built large containment structures, 
or back-up dams, that aim to protect the 
communities living nearby and to make  
safe working viable.

Evacuated territories

Communities in Self-Rescue 
Zones at emergency level 2 and 
3 were evacuated, and Vale built 
containment structures intended to 
protect people and the environment. 

In the territories where emergency 
evacuations (Barão de Cocais, Nova 
Lima and Itabirito) and preventive 
evacuations (Ouro Preto) have 
taken place, Compensation and 
Development Plans were developed, 
based on dialogue with the residents 
and public authorities of each 
municipality. Valued at a total 
of BRL 190 million, the plans are 
aimed at compensating residents 

and communities for the impacts 
caused by the safety improvements 
underway.

More than 1,200 entrepreneurs have 
been trained directly and indirectly 
in the evacuated municipalities 
through the Horizonte Project, which 
encourages innovative solutions to 
the problems faced by residents. 
Of these, 40 projects are being 
accelerated and received more 
than BRL 1.95 million in seed capital 
to begin work. These accelerated 
businesses have already earned more 
than BRL 5 million since the start of 
the project.

What do stakeholders expect from Vale?

Information about reparation measures in 
Brumadinho and evacuated areas in Mariana, 
and steps Vale is taking with the aim of 
preventing the recurrence of this type of event.

5.Reparation

Today, we can’t recognize our own 
community. The delay in the removal of the 
mud, because of the continued search for 
the unlocated victims, further delays the 
progress of infrastructure works, within what 
is considered the ‘hot zone’2. We know that 
there is still more to come, but the delays 
discourage residents and we are left with 
the feeling that we are not being remedied. 
Our Association is organized to engage with 
Vale and the public authorities and through 
the organization, we have achieved greater 
awareness of our causes. 

We were invited to participate in  
“Casa Criativa” (“Creative Household”), an 
economic development project. We hope 
that with Vale’s support through these 
projects and infrastructure work, especially 
paving, income generation opportunities and 
tourism will come to Parque da Cachoeira.”

By December 2022, a total of 58% of the Agreement had 
been implemented, which represents an amount of BRL 
23.7 billion, including implementation actions in 2019 and 
2020 to the amount of BRL 6.2 billion, considered under 
the Judicial Comprehensive Reparation Agreement. 

Vale has already executed 76% of the forecast 
obligations defined in the Agreement, corresponding to 
BRL16.69 billion (value adjusted by the IPCA50). The work 
is being undertaken as a priority, with around 5% of 
the planned actions (corresponding to BRL 691 million) 
having been completed, mainly on the Socioeconomic 
Reparation front. By the end of 2022, 24 projects were 
underway, nine of them in Brumadinho and 15 in the 
other 25 municipalities of the Paraopeba Basin, and 
about 300 initiatives in development. Vale is responsible 
for running the projects, which are monitored and 
inspected by the compliance enforcement agency 
with technical support from the Socioeconomic Audit 
Department of Fundação Getulio Vargas.

B1 dam failure – Brumadinho

Vale continues to prioritize fully 
repairing and compensating 
for the damage caused by the 
failure of dam B1 in Brumadinho, 
specifically by implementing 
the Judicial Comprehensive 
Reparation Agreement. 

We also have a series of other 
initiatives underway on the 
water supply, treatment, and 
monitoring fronts, along with 
social projects and support for 
those affected, the support of 
socioeconomic development, 
social works, and urban 
infrastructure.

The search for the victims of 
the dam failure, carried out by 

the Fire Department of Minas 
Gerais, continues with the 
participation of the Civil Police, 
through the Forensic Medical 
Institute, teams from Vale and 
family members of the victims. 
Of the 270 fatalities (including 
two pregnant women), three 
have yet to be located.

The extrajudicial individual 
civil and labor indemnifications 
reaffirm Vale’s commitment 
to quickly and definitively 
compensate all those who 
suffered damage. More 
than 13,600 people have 
already signed the indemnity 
agreement, which represents a 
value of BRL 3.1 billion.

Judicial Comprehensive 
Reparation Agreement

The progress of the actions and 
the financial payments of the 
Judicial Comprehensive Reparation 
Agreement continue according 
to the legal document signed 
between Vale, the State of Minas 
Gerais, the State and Federal 
Public Prosecutor’s Offices, and 
the Public Defender’s Office 
of Minas Gerais (compliance 
enforcement agency). With 
an estimated nominal value of 
BRL 37.7 billion, the Agreement 
defines the company’s obligations 
to both carry out and fund 
the socioeconomic, social and 
environmental reparations for the 
dam failure in Brumadinho. 

Initiatives for environmental 
recovery and compensation are 

envisaged on the Social and 
Environmental Reparation 
front. Within the scope of 
compensation, as defined by 
the compliance enforcement 
agency, priority was initially 
given to the sanitation project 
in the impacted municipalities, 
which is being developed by 
Vale and, after approval, will 
be executed by the company. 
Part of the recovery process, 
the Paraopeba River Basin 
Social and Environmental 
Reparation Plan has been under 
development, since 2019, by 
a specialized consulting firm 
hired by Vale, according to the 
specifications of the State 
Environmental System (Sisema).

Other reparation initiatives 

In addition to the Reparation Agreement, a number of other 
initiatives are underway, which began at the time of the emergency. 
These are focused on water supply, treatment and monitoring,  
social projects and support to those affected, socioeconomic 
development, and social and urban infrastructure works. 

These initiatives are guided by dialogue with stakeholders and 
public agencies focusing on the joint development of solutions  
that can effectively repair and compensate the impacts.

Fundão dam failure and the Renova Foundation

Indigenous peoples and 
quilombola communities

Still within the scope of the 
Brumadinho reparation process, 
an Agreement for Collective 
Full Reparation and Individual 
Indemnities was signed  
with the Pataxó and Pataxó  
Hã-Hã-Hãe indigenous peoples 
of the Katurãma Village and of 
the Dona Eline Pataxó group, 
with negotiations with the Naô 
Xohã Village and the Gervásio and 
Antônia groups still pending.

Vale continues to comply with 
the court injunction for the 
provisional relocation of the 
families from the Naô Xohã 
village that remained in the 
area affected by the failure of 
barragem da mina de Córrego do 
Feijão at Brumadinho.

With regard to the four 
quilombola communities affected 
by the Brumadinho dam failure, 
the Quilombola Component 
Studies for the Assessment of 
Impacts and discussions with the 
communities were initiated to 
establish reparation measures.

Nineteen people died and many had 
their livelihoods impacted due to 
the failure on November 5, 2015 of 
the Fundão dam in Mariana (Minas 
Gerais), owned by Samarco Mineração 
S.A. The dam was operated by 
Samarco, a joint venture with equal 
stakes owned by Vale and BHP (50/50).

The reparation of Mariana has been 
a complex and challenging mission, 
both due to the breadth of territories 
impacted by the failure of the Fundão 
dam and by the widely varying social, 
cultural, and economic characteristics 
of the region, which covers at least 
39 municipalities in two states (Minas 
Gerais and Espírito Santo).

Throughout this period, the 
Renova Foundation, created in 
2016 through the Transaction and 
Conduct Adjustment Agreement 
(TTAC), a Brazilian legal document, 
with oversight and support from 
Samarco, Vale and BHP, has been 
complying with the commitment 
to fully repair the damage caused 
to all those affected, including the 
environment, through the execution 

of 42 programs established with  
the competent public agencies  
and authorities.

In August 2018, the Governance 
Transaction and Conduct 
Agreement (TAC Gov) was signed, 
which changed the governance 
established in the TTAC to a more 
independent and participatory 
model, including the participation of 
local committees created to assist 
affected people in the indemnity 
negotiations and the discussion of 
solutions in the reparation process.

These two agreements (TTAC  
and TAC Gov) continue to guide the 
actions of the Renova Foundation. 
Vale continues to seek swift and 
comprehensive reparation through 
Renova’s governance bodies and 
is open to discussions that may 
accelerate these efforts. Vale 
is aware that the speed of the 
Mariana reparation does not  
meet society’s expectations and  
has been providing support for  
the Foundation with the goal of 
speeding up this process.

Access the Reparation Report and learn more about the work done 
by Vale in Brumadinho and the Paraopeba basin under the Judicial 
Comprehensive Reparation Agreement and other initiatives. 

Environmental recovery and 
compensation actions have been 
underway since immediately after 
the failure – including containment, 
removal and disposal of the tailings, 
recovery of the Ferro-Carvão 
stream and the Paraopeba River, 
environmental recovery of impacted 
areas and the rescue and care of 
affected animal life. 

The first step for environmental 
recovery to occur is the removal of the 
tailings, which is also a critical activity 
to support the ongoing search being 
conducted by the Fire Department. 
Only after the areas are cleared 
by CBMMG can the environmental 
recovery work begin, since the search 

for the missing people has been a top 
priority since the dam failure. About 
60% of the 12.41 million m³ that are 
object of removals in the Ferro-Carvão 
Stream and Paraopeba River have 
already been handled. 

So far, 42 hectares of land are 
undergoing environmental restoration, 
including part of the directly impacted 
area and surrounding protected 
areas - including the planting of 
approximately 55,000 native species 
seedlings in an area equivalent to 
42 soccer fields. In this recovery 
process, the environment is also being 
rehabilitated, including the recovery 
of water courses (streams and creeks) 
and impacted wetlands.

Relationship with the  
affected communities 

Vale has 25 community relations 
professionals dedicated to the 
Reparation of the Brumadinho dam 
failure. We have also made a toll-
free number available to provide 
general assistance to any individual 
who feels directly or indirectly 
affected by the Brumadinho 
dam failure or by preventive 
evacuations carried out in other 
territories served by the Special

Indemnities

Soon after the failure of the 
Fundão dam, affected people 
began to register for the payment 
of Emergency Financial Assistance 
(AFE), at that time by Samarco 
itself, and later taken over by the 
Renova Foundation. Since then, AFE 
has been paid to more than 14,000 
property title holders and about 
18,000 dependents, which means 
that the payment is made monthly 
to more than 32,000 people.

After the AFE, the Mediated 
Indemnity Program (PIM) was 
implemented by the Renova 
Foundation for the payment 
of individual compensation. 
While the PIM has succeeded in 
compensating more than 10,000 
people over its effective term, paying 
compensation to informal workers 
such as fishermen, cart drivers, 
washerwomen, and artisans who 
had no way of proving the damage 
caused by the dam breach has proven 
to be a significant challenge. 

Access by these informal categories 
of work to the compensation 
process was allowed through a 
court decision that implemented 
the Simplified Indemnity System 
(Novel) in July 2020, having been 
successively extended by increasing 
the list of categories and activities 

covered and further simplifying 
the proof required to prove impact. 
An appeals process was created, 
allowing claimants denied by Renova 
to submit their appeal and have 
their cases reanalyzed by the judicial 
review. By December 2022, 74,900 
people have been compensated by 
Novel - receiving about BRL 9.08 
billion. Considering compensation 
payments and aid, the Renova 
Foundation has already paid out BRL 
13.57 billion to about 409,400 people.

Indigenous peoples and  
traditional communities

The failure of the Fundão dam has 
impacted the Krenak indigenous 
people, in the municipality of 
Aimorés (in Minas Gerais), and the 
Tupiniquim and Guarani indigenous 
people, located in the Comboios, 
Caieiras Velhas II and Tupiniquim 
Indigenous Lands in the municipality 
of Aracruz (in Espírito Santo state). 
The quilombola community of 
Degredo, located in the municipality 
of Linhares, was also impacted after 
fishing was restricted along part of 
the coast of Espírito Santo. 

In 2021, comprehensive reparation 
agreements were signed, which had 
been compiled together with the 
Tupiniquim and Guarani indigenous 
peoples, respecting both the need 
for self-determination and the 

consultation process. They included 
the payment of compensation of 
the order of BRL 390 million to more 
than 1,600 families, the creation of a 
program to support the resumption 
of economic activities directed 
to eight indigenous associations 
in Espírito Santo, and a fund for 
compensating immaterial and 
collective damages, as well as 
detailing actions for the Indigenous 
Basic Environmental Plan (PBAI). 
In 2022, a negotiating forum was 
set up to settle disputes in the 
reparation process and advance the 
PBAI agenda. Also, during 2022, the 
Krenak people established their own 
technical advisory entity, which is in 
the final stages of registration and 
formalization. Vale hopes to begin 
a dialogue to negotiate a full and 
definitive reparation agreement 
with the Krenak people during 2023. 
During this period, the communities 
continue to be assisted with the 
payment of emergency aid, water 
supply, and other support to 
strengthen local supply chains and 
increase income generation.

The Degredo Quilombola Community, 
meanwhile, is awaiting court 
approval for the implementation, 
by the community itself through 
its Local Community Association, 
of the programs and actions of the 
Quilombola Basic Environmental 
Plan (PBAQ). The PBAQ was 

submitted to three rounds of public 
consultations with the community, 
which approved the 18 social and 
environmental programs proposed - 
self-implementation is an important 
step to guarantee the autonomy of 
the community in the reparations 
process for the impacts of the 
Fundão dam breach. 

Resettlement

The resettlement process relies on 
the active participation of more than 
500 families from the community and 
on other stakeholders including as 
justice institutions and government 
agencies. The process is unique 
globally, involving the construction 
of entire communities, with physical 
structures typical of a city. Parallel 
to the construction of houses, 
several initiatives to support micro 
and small businesses are underway, 
reaching about 160 families from the 
resettlements, in addition to school 
and cultural integration activities, 
guardianship and protection of 
rescued animals, among others. 
All these initiatives make up an 
integrated solution aimed at the 
right to housing and securing the 
livelihoods of these families. 

In 2022, an acceleration plan was 
implemented to speed up the 
delivery of houses. Engagement 
actions with affected families 

Results achieved by 2022

By December 2022, in cumulative 
numbers, 441 housing solutions were 
achieved in resettlements out of a 
total of 584 housing solutions planned.

and changes in the management 
structure the program at Renova 
have contributed to the evolution 
in the delivery of resettlement 
work. Work on the Bento Rodrigues 
collective resettlement has been at  
a peak in 2022. 

Another important factor that was 
essential to these advances was the 
implementation of policies for the 
restitution of the right to housing 
that focus on accelerating the 
processes and the autonomy of the 
people affected, such as the Cash 
Payments for Renovations and Cash 
Payments for Self-Management 
options. These actions are aimed at 
speeding up delivery with the goal 
of ensuring that a large number of 
families will move into their new 
homes in 2023.

Other environmental indicators

By December 2022 significant 
progress has been made in 
compensatory forest restoration, 
totaling 11,000 hectares of permanent 
preservation areas and 1,700 springs 
in the process of recovery. Renova has 
also made progress in the biodiversity 
focus area, starting to implement 
mitigating actions with the goal of 
conserving aquatic biodiversity. An 
integrated action plan will also be 
established, which is slated to include 
the evaluation of impacts on the 
terrestrial environment and on the 
protected areas defined in the TTAC.

In 2022, Samarco continued 
the restoration of the Risoleta 
Neves Hydroelectric (Candonga) 
Plant. Dredging has begun, with 
material being disposed of at 
“Fazenda Floresta” with all required 

environmental controls in 
place. By December 2022, about 
half a million cubic meters of 
material had been dredged 
from the reservoir, and its 
refilling began on December 
10. The reinforcement of the 
hydroelectric plant’s main 
dam was also completed, an 
important step to provide for the 
resumption of safe operation. 

On March 28th, 2023, the 
operations at the Risoleta Neves 
hydroelectric plant were resumed 
- power generation started in 
Generation Unit 2. Samarco has 
already restored Generating 
Unit 1, which must now just be 
commissioned in order to be able 
to operate. Generating unit 3 is 
currently in the restoration stage.

Disbursements
Between the failure of the Fundão 
dam and December 2022, a total 
of BRL 28.9 billion has been 
disbursed by Renova Foundation 
for reparation and compensation 
work, as well as for administrative 
and governance costs for TAC Gov. 

In order to comply with 
obligations, BRL 2.4 billion was 
paid directly by Samarco and the 
rest of the financial resources 
were contributed to Renova 
Foundation in equal shares by the 
three sponsors Samarco, Vale and 
BHP. The amounts contributed by 
Samarco to the Renova Foundation 
have become more significant in 
the last two years due to its return 
to operations and consequent cash 
generation capacity.

In 2022 Renova received BRL 
4.5 billion from Samarco and 
BRL 3.6 billion from Vale and 
BHP, spending a total of BRL 8.7 
billion on its activities (BRL 8.2 
billion on reparatory programs, 
BRL 0.31 billion on compensation 
programs, and BRL 0.25 billion on 
TAC Governance - administrative/
governance expenses).

Expected disbursements in 2023 are 
BRL 8.1 billion, with approximately 
BRL 6.3 billion1 more to follow until 
the end of the Foundation’s work.

The amounts 
spent in the last 
two years have 
intensified due to 
the acceleration 
of the reparation 
process, 
highlighting the 
compensation, 
resettlement, and 
environmental 
work, among 
others.

What do stakeholders expect  
from Vale?

Information on risk management and 
impacts on local communities, with 
an emphasis on the most vulnerable 
populations and the regional 
development agenda.

To be kept apprised of Vale’s 
commitments to human rights and how 
these are assigned across the value chain.

Information on biodiversity recovery, 
local economic impacts, and the risk  
of land invasion and misuse.

6.Social performance
We need to start thinking of other 
paths that are no longer linked  
to the idea of mining associated 
with devastation, degradation, 
and violation of rights (...).  
It is about nothing more than 
respecting human rights, the 
rights of indigenous peoples to 
consultation and dialogue, in an 
open, frank and honest manner.” 

Gersem Baniwa, philosopher, 
anthropologist and associate 
professor at the University of Brasília 
(UNB) and the Federal University of 
Amazonas (UFAM), in an interview 
as part of Vale’s Materiality Review, 
conducted in November 2022.

Local communities GRI 3-3 | 413-1 | 413-2

Vale’s priority is to establish relationships 
based on respect and trust with the 
communities impacted by our operations. 
In 2022, we mapped 1,532 local 
relationship communities. In Brazil, 165 
of these communities are considered an 
engagement priority. Currently, 78% of 
these communities have a Relationship 
Plan in place. Our aim is to cover 100% of 
these communities by 2026. 

In 2022, to gather input on local 
communities beyond traditional listening 
channels, we carried out our first 

“Community Perception Survey”, covering 
all of Vale’s Brazilian areas of operation.  
The survey sought to identify the level 
of trust in the company, as well as 
expectations regarding Vale’s presence in 
the region. The results will be consolidated 
in 2023 and will support the social strategies 
for the areas where we operate.

Water quality 

On the environmental front, water quality monitoring 
continues to be conducted in the Doce, Gualaxo do Norte 
and Carmo rivers, in addition to other tributaries of the 
Doce River and the coastal and estuarine zones of Espírito 
Santo. The results indicate a return to the conditions that 
existed before the dam breach, meaning that the water 
in the Doce River can be consumed after being treated 
without risk to the health of the population. 

The process required to make the Doce river water drinkable 
is the same as would be used to make water from any  
river in Brazil or around the world safe to use. 

1 In March 2023, a court decision determined a judicial deposit in the amount of BRL 10.3 billion, equally divided between Vale and BHP Brasil. 
The Company will opportunely manifest itself in the process about the decision, against which an appeal is pending.

Risk management 

To map the risks resulting 
from our operations, we use 
methodologies, standards 
and systems in accordance 
with Vale’s risk management 
process and industry best 
practice. These tools are 
designed to assist in the 
identification, evaluation, 
mitigation and monitoring 
of risks. The most common, 
given our industry, are 
those related to community 
safety, conflicts arising from 
involuntary resettlement 
and land use, inconvenience 
to communities (mainly 

related to noise, dust and 
vibration), disputes over 
natural resources, and 
damage to roads, highways, 
and access.

Grievance mechanism  
GRI 2-16 | 2-25

Vale’s Grievance Mechanism 
comprises various listening 
channels, which are the 
structures responsible for 
the process of managing 
complaints. They offer 
a variety of ways for 
stakeholders to interact with 
the company: Alô Ferrovia, 
Reparation Service Center, 

1 For the purposes of this report, the reports registered in the system until January 2, 2023 are being considered. Complaints requested in 2022, but registered after the mentioned 
cut-off date, will be covered in the report of the next cycle. Furthermore, in the year 2022, 111 manifestations requested in 2021 were registered. Figures do not consider 
complaints and requests exclusive to the Humanitarian Assistance Brumadinho mentioned earlier.

2 Annually, communities’ ‘priority’ is updated based on risk, impact and other socioeconomic data. Therefore, the number of Relationship Plans may be different from the number 
of prioritized communities. In any given year, a community that previously did not have a Relationship Plan may be prioritized and thus require a Plan to be developed.

3 Community consultation instrument relative to the decision-making process (free, prior, informed consent – FPIC).

Our relationship with Indigenous 
Peoples and Traditional 
Communities is based on respect 
and adherence to our Human 
Rights Policy and international 
standards such as the United 
Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
(UNDRIP). We acknowledge 
cultural differences and recognize 
them as opportunities for 
mutual growth. Our team, which 
includes more than 20 specialists 
in issues affecting traditional 
peoples, receives further external 
support from indigenist and 
anthropological consultancies. 
No violation of the rights of 
indigenous peoples was recorded.

Indigenous peoples

In Pará, Brazil, we carried out 
initiatives and agreements 
that made it possible to end 
legal disputes with the Xikrin 
do Cateté, Kayapó and Gavião 
(Parkatêjê, Kyikatêjê and 
Akrãtikatêjê) peoples, and 
strengthened Vale’s relationships 
with these peoples. 

In Maranhão, Brazil, we 
maintained our relationship 
with the Guajajara, Awá and 
Ka’apor peoples through the 
implementation of the Basic 
Environmental Plan (PBA). 
A highlight included the 
construction of two Indigenous 

Basic Health Units in the Januária 
and Novo Planeta Villages, in the 
Rio Pindaré Indigenous Land. 
These new units are intended to 
integrate the Indigenous Peoples’ 
Health Care Subsystem (SASISUS) 
network, strengthening the 
health and protection of a 
population of about 1,700 
indigenous Guajajara people. 
The initiative was a voluntary 
social investment by Vale, in 
partnership with the Special 
Indigenous Health District (DSEI-
MA), with support from Brazil 
Development Bank  
(BNDES) Social.

In Minas Gerais and Espírito 
Santo, Brazil, maintaining our 
relationship with the Krenak, 
Tupiniquim and Guaraní peoples 
saw the implementation of 
agreements and/or Basic 
Environmental Plans, as well as 
the ongoing reparation process 
with the Pataxó and Pataxó Hã-
Hã-Hãe peoples, impacted by the 
Brumadinho tailings dam failure.

In Canada, we have relationships 
with nine indigenous peoples in 
the regions of Ontario, Manitoba, 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
We maintained mutual benefit 
agreements including an Impact 
Benefit Agreement (IBA) with 
the Innu Nation and Nunatsiavut 
Government in the Voisey’s Bay 
operation and other relationship 

processes and formalized 
agreements with different 
communities in Sudbury and 
Thompson.

As part of Vale’s Social Ambition 
of collaborating with the 
indigenous communities 
neighboring all of our 
operations in the preparation 
and execution of their plans in 
pursuit of the rights provided 
for in the UN Declaration of the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
(UNDRIP), the Kayapó are the 
first people to hold a formalized 
commitment related to the 
development of a Consultation 
Protocol3. 

We continued the Indigenous 
Program for Opportunities 
and Permanence at University 
(PIPOU), which was created 
in partnership with the 
Society, Population and Nature 
Institute (ISPN) – specialists in 
indigenous higher education 
and representatives of the 
indigenous social movement.  
In 2021, 50 indigenous 
people (36 women and 14 
men) received financial and 
infrastructure support. 

This year, we launched 
a new grant to select an 
additional 55 indigenous 
students. The selection 
process is ongoing.

Involuntary resettlement  
GRI G4 MM9

Vale avoids involuntary resettlement in 
the first instance, If unavoidable, we are 
committed to our goal of ensuring that 
when involuntary resettlement occurs 
as a result of our projects or operations 
(including work resulting from the 
decharacterization of tailings dams), 
livelihoods are restored to conditions 
equivalent to, or better than, those  
prior to the families’ relocation. 

This requires measures such as the 
replacement of impacted land, housing, 
and economic activities, according 
to guidelines from international 
organizations such as the Performance 
Standard 5 regarding land acquisition 
and resettlement standard from the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), 
the World Bank, the United Nations (UN), 
and the ICMM.

In 2022, 1,465 families were involved in 
involuntary resettlement processes in 
Brazil and Indonesia. Of this total, 462 
families are already in final housing and 
another 356 are in temporary housing, 
with all the expenses necessary for 
adequate housing covered under the 
company’s remit. Socio-economic survey 
was conducted to subsidize project 
alternatives to avoid and/or minimize 
future involuntary resettlement  
of 647 families.

The relationship with the Xikrin do Cateté people is intertwined with 
Vale’s history in Carajás (Pará State). In 2022, the indigenous peoples and 
Vale marked the 40-year anniversary of this relationship at a celebration 
in the Xikrin do Cateté Indigenous Land, with the participation of 
Vale’s CEO, Eduardo Bartolomeo, and vice presidents and directors of 
neighboring operations. 

After the visit to the Indigenous Land, the indigenous people were also 
invited to another celebration in Carajás, which once again included 
the leaders of the Xikrin do Cateté people and Vale. These were special 
encounters, which reflected the importance of this relationship for both 
parties. The signing of the Xikrin Global Agreement was fundamental in 
achieving this result, as it made it possible to conclude the lawsuits that 
marked previous turbulent periods in this relationship.

Traditional communities

In 2022, we developed 
initiatives with 22 coconut-
breaking, quilombola, and 
riverside communities 
alongside the Carajás 
Railroad (EFC) in Maranhão, 
which benefited from 
management training 
for social organizations; 
digital inclusion; public 
policy workshops; and 
strengthening of production 
chains, among other 
initiatives. About 3,500 
families were impacted by 
these actions.

Some of our projects and operations 
are located in regions that experience 
land use conflicts. The most significant 
conflicts occur as a result of the 
dependence on company land by third 
parties, either for housing by local 
communities or for access to natural 
resources, and are found in the state 
of Pará, in northern Brazil. 

In the municipality of Canaã dos 
Carajás, the surrounding areas of 
the Southeast Pará Railroad require 
the regularization of land property 
rights in exchange for the release of 
650 families from the domain strip on 
seven of Vale’s properties. Negotiations 
are also underway with 554 families 
who occupy company properties 
reserved for the implementation 
of the Cristalino Project, focused 
on copper and gold extraction in 
southeastern Pará. During the year, 
an intervention to remove third-
party illegal miners in the project 
area, who were responsible for the 
contamination of water resources 
and causing other environmental 
damage, was undertaken by the police 
and coordinated by environmental 
agencies.

In Minas Gerais, part of the Xukuru-
Kariri indigenous group living in areas 
granted by the federal government in 

Brazil for the municipalities of Caldas 
and Presidente Olegário occupied a 
Vale property in Brumadinho, called 
Fazenda Bruma, with approximately 
50 indigenous people distributed in 
16 families. This is an area acquired by 
Vale for environmental compensation 
purposes, where a lagoon has been set 
aside as a mechanism for protecting 
exotic fish species. This area requires 
monitoring and daily maintenance and 
poses risks if the proper inspections 
are not performed, especially during 
the rainy season. The monitoring of

To meet our long-term goal of 
helping 500,000 people escape 
extreme poverty by 2030, 
after a broad consultation and 
research exercise, we developed 
a methodology based on the 
familial unit (instead of individuals), 
with a special focus on children. 
We consider poverty as a 
multidimensional concept, which 
goes beyond income generation to 
include other variables that ensure 
fundamental rights necessary for 
basic dignity and family subsistence. 

Families are at the centre of the 
proposed approach. An action plan 
is drawn up, together with each 
family unit, around the dimensions 

of education, income, health and 
nutrition, and infrastructure. The 
plan also recognizes the level of 
deprivation experienced within 
the context of urban, rural and 
forest environments. Once the 
plan is developed, the process for 
multidimensional family monitoring 
begins, which guides the family 
unit to local public policies and 
social programs, and monitors the 
program impact on the daily life and 
collective evolution of the unit.

The Fight Against Poverty Program 
is intended to be implemented in 
partnership with governments,  
civil society institutions and  
other corporations, aiming for 

Fighting poverty
the creation of joint initiatives, 
the promotion of institutions 
that already work with their 
own methodologies and the 
development of common goals for 
the strengthening of public policies 
to fight extreme poverty.

The first pilots of the Program’s 
concept will be carried out in 2023, 
starting the Multidimensional  
Family Monitoring process with 
around 30,000 people – 5% of the 
target - in areas where Vale has a 
significant presence, such as Pará, 
Maranhão and the Amazon region. 
These pilots are a fundamental 
to further advance the Program’s 
strategic vision and methodology.

Vale is committed 
to embedding 
sustainability into its 
business, aiming to 
contribute to positive 
economic,social and 
environmental legacy.

The Foundation works with 
municipal departments, social 
institutions, and implementing 
and investing partners for the 
improvement of public health and 
education. The strategy requires 
the presence of hubs in neighboring 
municipalities for at least the 
medium-term and intersectoral 
engagement with public policy, 
for the development of a common 
agenda between health, social 
assistance, and education. The 
Vale Foundation also maintains 
five Knowledge Stations, which are 
equipped to provide educational, 
cultural and sports activities after 
school hours. 

Education and Health Program

Through the Vale Foundation, 
Vale is looking to expand access 
to the rights to education, health 
and social assistance, aiming to 
improve municipal indicators and 
expand access to those who are 
in situations of greater social 
vulnerability and exclusion. In 
education, the Program focuses  
on Primary Education, especially  
in the area of literacy development 
- a crucial stage in school life - 
and on work to combat school 
exclusion, understanding that  
the right to education is 
fundamental for the development 
of resilient communities. 

In health, the Foundation focuses 
on primary care and social 
assistance, which is considered 
the “gateway” for most of the 
population to access broader 
healthcare systems. Primary 
care provides disease prevention 
education, treats injuries and 
illnesses, and directs more serious 
cases to higher levels of care. The 
Foundation is also considering 
work to strengthen municipal 
social assistance networks.

Genomics for Biodiversity 
Studies and Monitoring
Genetic studies allow us to better understand 
species’ biology and implement targeted and 
effective conservation measures to protect 
them. To that end, ITV researchers have 
produced genetic references for more than 
13,000 plants and animals, with a focus on the 
Carajás region. 

Genetic references are DNA barcodes that can 
be used to evaluate a species by comparison 
with a taxonomically validated specimen 
deposited in a scientific collection. The 
reference library allows the development 
of biodiversity monitoring tools using 
environmental DNA or eDNA. The results of 
the project have already been used to inform 
decision-making and in the conservation of 
endemic and threatened species. 

In 2023, in partnership with the Chico  
Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation 
(ICMBio), this scientific knowledge was 
expanded to other protected areas in 
the Amazon, enhancing management 
and conservation actions for endangered 
species and those of special interest to the 
bioeconomy. The project was launched at 
the COP 15: Biodiversity Conference held in 
Montreal, Canada.

Highlights include the development of 
more controlled methods of ore extraction 
- which not only give better protection 
to the communities surrounding our 
operations, but also ensure greater 
energy and economic efficiency; and 
ships equipped with rotating sails and 
air lubrication technologies (reducing 
the resistance between a ship’s hull and 
seawater using air bubbles), increasing 
efficiency and reducing fuel consumption 
and emissions.

In 2022, the Vale Volunteer Network 
included more than 6,600 volunteers, 
who joined forces in at least 500 
initiatives involving about 48,000 
people from various communities in 
the regions where Vale operates.

Several campaigns, such as 
‘Christmas Without Hunger’ 
combined the efforts of volunteers 
and partner companies in the 
distribution of around 25,000 food 
baskets, valued at around USD 213 
thousand. The ‘Donate Blood, Donate 
Life’ campaign mobilized over 1,000 
donors, ultimately benefiting more 
than 4,000 people. 

The Network also promoted reading 
through the Reading Experiences 
campaign, working with writers 
Conceição Evaristo and Cláudia 
Werneck to raise awareness and train 
volunteers, and to collaboratively 
write a practical guide to the creation 
reading projects. 

More than 450 books  
were collected during the 
campaign and audiobooks  
of popular stories 
were recorded by the 
volunteers.

and communities to achieve this. 
It is important to minimize risks 
and enhance future opportunities 
to generate value for the areas 
populations where the mines  
are located, especially when it 
comes to possible future uses  
of these areas. 

That is why 100% Vale’s operations 
have closure plans that are in line 
with the best practices adopted by 
the ICMM and legislation. At the 
same time, we monitor all mine 
closure actions and Progressive 
Rehabilitation initiatives, ensuring 
that resources are used correctly 
and that all social, economic, 
and environmental impacts are 
considered. In 2022, Vale spent 
approximately USD 101 million on a 
range of closure activities and has 
a provision of USD 3.5 billion1 to 
undertake future closure activities.

Another important 2022 result  
was the dissemination of 
information on mine closure 
planning, including the community 
engagement process.

1 Every year, we review the estimated cost for decommissioning assets - called Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) - with disclosure in the accounting reports and meeting 
the requirements defined by International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37 and Technical Pronouncement CPC 25. The internal controls related to this review of ARO 
estimates are part of the flows defined by the company to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

The mine of the future has to be 
intensely linked to land planning, which 
must incorporate mining and set limits 
to it. The challenge is to bring the 
externalities into this planning and to 
execute it in a participatory manner.”

Igarapé Bahia Mine
Vale invests in strategies to conserve 
natural environments and rehabilitate 
mined areas - the Igarapé Bahia mine 
is a successful example of this work. 

Part of the Carajás National Forest, 
in the municipality of Parauapebas 
in Pará, the mine was closed in 2002 
after 10 years of operation. A new 
copper project (the ‘Alemão’ Project) 
is under development at the site 
and is intended to use some existing 
infrastructure. However, the rest of 
the site is undergoing closure and 
environmental restoration.

Currently around 200 hectares are 
under rehabilitation, and another 
6.72 hectares is considered to be fully 
recovered, with standing forest - 
proving that it is possible to reconcile 
mining with nature conservation. 

Most of the seeds used in the area’s 
restoration were collected from 
species native to the region, including 
over 60 tree species. Native orchids 
and bromeliads have also been 
reintroduced. With the flora in the 
process of recovering, the native fauna 
is also returning to the area.

Acquired by Vale, the Águas Claras 
Mine (MAC), in Minas Gerais, 
belonged to MBR, which operated 
this asset for almost 30 years. Used 
as an administrative area since 
2008, it is undergoing mine closure 
and geotechnical stabilization 
work, as well as studies on the 
potential for future uses. 

In 2022, after the alleviation of 
Covid-19 restrictions, Vale held 
two “A Leisure Day at the MAC” 
events, providing opportunities 
for the community to get to know 
the MAC and contribute to the 
development of the project that 
is intended to transform the area 
into a legacy for society. 

The MAC is also open for technical visits 
from universities, public agencies, and 
institutions to learn about the work we 
are doing there. In 2022, four technical 
workshops were held on environmental 
conservation, cultural heritage and 
tourism, social and economic development, 
and urban planning and mobility.

These workshops generated two 
important documents for future use 
planning, looking at both the possible 
opportunities available in the area and 
how they could be brought to fruition. 
Further work – including business 
modelling – is underway to assess the 
feasibility and likely impact of the 
proposed projects, which expected to be 
concluded in 2023.

Future use strategy
Vale’s future use strategy aims to redefine the use of rehabilitated 
post-mining spaces, creating opportunities for local employment and 
the generation of shared value. In 2022, Vale established the Future 
Use Management department within the VP Sustainability’s portfolio, 
reaffirming our commitment to this issue. We are prioritizing priority 
regions for the development of post-mining use in alignment with 
Vale’s business strategy. It is important that the development of 
plans for the future use of rehabilitated areas should be done in 
coordination with wider society and stakeholders in these areas. 

Learn more on the ESG Portal.

The process of planning the closure 
of a mine or other asset involves 
multidisciplinary teams and must be 
in place before the beginning of the 
operation, and Vale must work in 
partnership with the public authorities

In 2022, 4,175 species were 
recorded in habitats impacted 
by Vale’s operations or located 
near these operations. Of these, 
78 are considered threatened 
according to the IUCN 
categories: Critically Endangered 
(5), Endangered (20), and 
Vulnerable (53). GRI 304-4

Operations that generate 
significant impacts in areas 
of high value for biodiversity 
require Biodiversity 
Management Plans, whether 
based on legal obligations or 
voluntary commitments.  
Of all our operational units 
assessed in 2022, 47 (88.7%) 
required the preparation of 
biodiversity management plans 
(GRI G4 MM2). Of these, 80.9% 
already have Management  
Plans in place, and the  
rest have plans under 
implementation or planned. 

In the last two years we have 
also reported on biodiversity-
related impacts, risks and 
opportunities for operations 
which are considered to 
be a priority as a result of 
their location and interface 
with nature, as well as our 
management strategies,  
under the CDP Forests  
– Minerals and Metals 1.

We believe scientific research 
and innovation are essential 
in developing more effective 
methods to manage our impacts, 
reclaim post-mining areas,  
restore habitats, and conserve  
or maintain habitats and  
species. Find out more at  
Vale Institute of Technology. 

The restoration of mining-
impacted areas covers all phases 
of an operations’ life cycle, from 
prospecting to closure. Since 
some project impacts often 
cannot be avoided, the post-
mining rehabilitation process 
is among the most important 
measures to restore and 
compensate these impacts.  
Read more in the Databook.

We protect in our own areas 
and in partnership with third 
parties, in voluntary actions and 
in compliance with the legislation, 
around 965,000 hectares2 of 
natural environments in areas 
of high biodiversity value (GRI 
304-3). This means that for every 
hectare altered or impacted by our 
operations, we protect 11 hectares.

In addition, Vale has been 
studying new protection 
strategies as part of initiatives 
aimed at achieving our Forestry 
Goal 2030, focusing on learning 

and innovation. In 2022 a REDD+ 
project became part  
of this set, contributing to  
the protection of about  
50,000 more hectares. Read 
more in Forestry Goal.

In the Amazon, in the region 
of Carajás, we have been 
working in partnership with 
ICMBio for more than 30 years, 
supporting the conservation 
of approximately 800,000 
hectares. In the Atlantic Forest, 
we support the conservation of 
approximately 180,000 hectares, 
in our own areas and through 
partnerships. This total includes 
the Vale Natural Reserve (RNV), 
which is a Vale property set aside 
for conservation and research, 
as well as the Sooretama 
Biological Reserve, which is a 
protected area managed by 
ICMBio. Together they form 
the largest remaining block of 
the Atlantic Forest of Espírito 
Santo, protecting around 
50,000 hectares and harboring 
endangered and endemic species.

Commitments 
GRI 2-23

Vale is committed to preventing 
and neutralizing significant 
impacts from new projects and 
expansions in areas of high 
biodiversity value, aiming for no 
net loss and, whenever possible, 
generating positive impacts. 

Vale adheres to the ICMM’s 
Mining Principles, including 
Principle 7 and its performance 
expectations focused on  
the conservation of biodiversity, 
and to the Brazilian Business 
Commitment to Biodiversity  
of the Brazilian Business 
Council for Sustainable 
Development (CEBDS).

In 2021 we announced our 
decision not to operate in 
UNESCO3 Natural World Heritage 
Sites. This commitment is part 
of our internal Biodiversity 
Management Guidelines and 
Processes. It is important 
to highlight that we do not 
have projects or operations in 

these areas, and we help to 
protect an important site - the 
Discovery Coast Atlantic Forest 
Reserve - which comprises the 
Vale Natural Reserve (RNV) 
and the Sooretama Biological 
Reserve (ReBio Sooretama). 

2030 Forestry goal

By 2030, Vale will reclaim and 
protect 500,000 hectares 
outside our fence lines, 
ensuring positive outcomes 
for nature, people and our 
climate change strategy. The 
target is broken down into 
two objectives. The first is 
to recover 100,000 hectares 
through the development 
and support of businesses 

with social and environmental 
impact, making room for 
developing partnerships, 
testing new models, and 
business scalability. The second 
is to protect 400,000 hectares 
through partnerships to 
support public protected areas 
and initiatives such as REDD+ 
projects.  
Read more in Progress on  
long-term commitments.

Through the Vale Fund, 
we undertook several 
initiatives that contributed 
to the forestry target in 
2022. Highlights include 
the Acceleration Program, 
in partnership with CERTI 
Foundation, Darwin Startups,

Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is a 
framework that aims to develop nature-related risk disclosure guidelines 
to provide transparency to global financial flows related  
to the loss or regeneration of nature. 

In 2022, Vale took part in public consultations by the TNFD, joined its 
discussion forum, committed ourselves to piloting the applicability of the 
TNFD’s guidelines, with sectorial alignment coordinated by the ICMM, 
and joined the Brazilian consultative group coordinated by CEBDS. Results 
so far indicate that we have partially met the guidelines, and that more 
work will be needed in 2023 for Vale to develop further in this regard.

Vale’s forestry goal serves to foster the development of an ecosystem 
of agroforestry businesses and forest restoration and protection that 
will, in addition to protecting and restoring 500,000 hectares, stimulate 
and accelerate the creation of a set of new businesses that will drive 
a restoration journey to contribute to Brazil’s climate goals and to the 
promotion of a new sustainable and inclusive rural development model.” 

Valmir Ortega, founder and CEO of Belterra Agroflorestas, a social and 
environmental impact business developed as an outcome of Vale’s forestry goal, 
which seeks partnerships with small and medium farmers to create productive 
forests in degraded areas, improving the lives of family farmers, rehabilitating 
areas and promoting the implementation of agroforestry systems.

Biomes

During the COP27 Climate Change conference, Itaú 
Unibanco, Marfrig, Santander, Suzano, Rabobank and 
Vale announced the creation of a new company - 
Biomas. The goal is to restore and protect an area of 
4 million hectares of native forests (equivalent to the 
territory of Switzerland or the state of Rio de Janeiro) 
in biomes such as the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and 
Cerrado over 20 years. This work should result in the 
removal or prevention of around 900 million tons of 
carbon equivalent emissions over two decades. 

Read more at https://www.wearebiomas.com/

Listen here to the podcast in which Belterra’s CEO explains 
how the model works, the potential of this market in Brazil, 
and the challenges for large-scale implementation.

About 60% of Vale’s production 
comes from the Amazon. In this 
biome, in partnership with ICMBio, 
we support the conservation of 
almost 800,000 hectares in the 
Carajás Mosaic of Conservation 
Units, where our operations 
occupy about 2% of the total  
area (only in units where our 
activity is permitted). In addition, 
we oversee projects that protect 
ecosystems, provide education, 
create partnerships for local 
development, and strengthen 
sustainable businesses. This is in 
addition to the solid support and 
production of scientific research 
through the ITV. This work 
accounted for an approximate 
contribution of USD 500 million 
in voluntary socioenvironmental 
investments between 2019  
and 2021 alone. 

Vale understands that it can 
and should do more for the 
sustainability of the biome.  
That is why, in 2022, we conducted 
a broad consultation with a range 
of stakeholders and specialists 
in the region to understand 
the current challenges, and 
opportunities. The company 
designed a strategy to expand our 
voluntary action fronts and has 
started some initiatives, with  
co-financing and execution 
partners, in a broad coalition of 
efforts to leverage positive results.

Startup platform to boost  
the Amazon bioeconomy

In partnership with Bradesco, Itaú 
Unibanco and Santander Brasil, the 
Vale Fund has announced investments 
in the Jornada Amazônia platform, 
which aims to stimulate innovative 
companies in forest-related 
production chains. The project will 
train people in entrepreneurship 
for bioeconomy-related businesses 
in the Amazon, improve operating 
conditions, and provide support to 
strategic organizations that foster 
startups. The goal is to train up  
to 3,000 people and create 200 
startups over the next three years. 
The first public tenders should be 
launched in 2023.

Networks in the Amazon

Vale has been helping strengthen 
civil society networks and coalitions 
related to the Amazon, such 
as the creation of Latimpacto’s 
Panamazonian Agenda, via the Vale 
Fund, which aims to bring together 
Latin American institutions that 
finance impact businesses for the 
conservation of the biome. We also 
participated in the Working Group 
for the Amazon Concertation, in the 
Brazil Coalition on Climate, Forests 
and Agriculture and in the Amazon 
Working Group of the Brazilian 
Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (CEBDS).

Garante Amazônia  
and Juntos pela Saúde

At COP 27, Vale and the Brazilian 
Development Bank (BNDES) 
announced the signing of two 
protocols of intent focused on 
the North and Northeast regions 
of the country: the Garante 
Amazônia (Amazon Bioeconomy 
Loan Guarantee Program) and the 
Juntos pela Saúde (Together for 
Health) initiative. The two companies 
will invest USD 20.9 million in the 

protocols, which focus on the 
promotion of primary healthcare 
and the stimulation of sustainable 
economies in these regions. Vale is 
the first partner to join the actions 
and will contribute USD 3.9 million 
to Garante Amazônia and USD 6.6 
million to Juntos pela Saúde, with 
a matching amount from the bank.
The announcement took place during 
an event at the UN Conference on 
Climate Change, COP 27, in Sharm El 
Sheikh, Egypt.

GRI 303-1 | 303-2

Our activities depend on water 
resources. This means we have 
an important role to play in the 
quest for responsible water use. 
We understand that Vale must 
also contribute to the shared 
management of these resources 
with other users in the 
watersheds where we operate. 

In 2021, Vale achieved its New 
Water specific use reduction 
target (10% reduction), 
launched in 2018. We will 
release the new target in 
2023, with a horizon of 2030. 
The new goal will broaden 
the scope beyond specific 
internal uses and consider local 
aspects related to availability, 
quality, access to water, 
and the ecological health of 
the watersheds where we 
operate. For this, we adopted 
Indicator 6.4.2 of the United 
Nations 2030 Agenda as a base 
point. This indicator shows 
whether water stress exists 
in the analyzed watershed. It 
is calculated1 from the ratio 
between the total freshwater 
withdrawn in the watershed 
and the total water resources 
available for use. 

Vale analyzed our 
entire area of influence 
– into the sub-basins 
where we operate. 
The outcomes of this 
analysis were then used 
to implemented specific 
regional operations. 

Read more in the 
Databook.

Significant progress has been 
made in the integration and 
automation of monitoring 
systems, facilitating the 
monitoring of water 
resource and effluent 
management through 
iterative dashboards, in 
addition to continuous 
improvement of field 
instrumentation, with the 
installation of more than  
600 new flow meters.

Level of water stress in the watersheds where we operate
What do stakeholders expect from Vale?

Measures that minimize impacts, such as water 
availability and air pollution.

There is a set of actions from the inside out and 
from the outside in, and I recognize that Vale does 
both. Within its perimeter, loss control, efficient use, 
consumption reduction, and water recirculation. 
And, from the inside out, Vale’s concern reaches 
beyond its perimeter, to the watershed and to its 
neighbors, because it doesn’t make sense for Vale to 
have water for its operation and have a community 
next to it without water.

One role that Vale is already playing is to get 
closer to the populations that are in the vicinity 
of its operations and work in partnership with the 
government so that there is no shortage of water. 
Even if this responsibility does not lie with the 
company, what it can do in the sense of collaborating 
in preservation, in controlling springs, in purification 
and treating erosion, is a very important path. 

Access to water is not a fight of good against evil, 
what we have to have are partnerships. What 
we want in Brazil are pacts for good water use, 
efficiency, and cooperation. This is being built day  
by day, because Brazil is very diverse and unequal, 
and you have to capture this in the solutions.”

Valmir Pedrosa, professor at the Federal University of  
Alagoas and consultant for the National Water and Basic 
Sanitation Agency (ANA), in an interview as part of Vale’s 
Materiality Review, conducted in November 2022.

Our water management model is based on four pillars:

• Governance: Processes and responsibilities.

• Monitoring and Control: Strategic water quality monitoring 
network units in water-stressed regions with the greatest 
contribution to reducing specific use.

• Community Engagement: Support to priority communities for 
water improvement in the watersheds where we operate.

• Water Risk Management: Water risks mapped and managed.

Mitigation of impacts related  
to water resources

The ITV conducts research to improve 
planning for water risks in the basins where 
the company operates. We evaluate how 
landscape changes and climate changes can 
impact the availability of water resources 
and identify how these water risks impact 
watersheds and the communities within 
them. Some examples of these research 
results are:

• Estimates of flow (maximums and 
water availability) and water production 
(evapotranspiration) in the Itacaiúnas river 
basin and the basins along the Carajás 
Railroad, using hydrological modeling  
and remote sensing techniques;

• Calculation of extreme precipitation 
indices in the Mearim river basin;

• Developing a database for intensity, 
duration and frequency of heavy rains  
in the Itacaiúnas river basin;

• Environmental quality assessment of 
headwater basins and springs in the 
Itacaiúnas river basin; and 

• Mapping areas susceptible to flooding 
around the cities of Parauapebas,  
Marabá and Eldorado dos Carajás.

Read more in Climate-related  
risks and opportunities and  
Vale Institute of Technology.

The atmospheric emissions from 
our operations consist mostly of 
particulate matter (PM), sulfur 
oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides 
(NOx), which influence the air quality 
in surrounding regions. Our main 
emission sources are Pelletizing and 
Base Metals plants and the use of 
fuel in equipment and vehicles. 

Reduction of emissions:

16% in Particulate 
Matter emissions

16% in Sulfur Oxide 
emissions

10% of Nitrogen Oxide 
emissions 

Read more in Progress on  
long-term commitments.

These emissions are managed 
through a number of tools, 
atmospheric dispersion studies,  
and continuous monitoring, 
which guide us in the continuous 
improvement of our operational 
controls - ultimately aiming to 
eliminate, or when not possible,  
to mitigate environmental impacts. 

As an example of our continuous 
monitoring, we have Environmental 
Control Centers (CCAs) at our main 
operations, which operate 24 hours 
a day, collecting data that allow us 
to extract the maximum efficiency 
from our installed controls. Inputs 
include environmental monitoring, 
and operational and neighboring 
community information. 

In 2021, we set our global emissions 
reduction targets, to be reached  
by 2030. They include:

To address the risks of the 
production process, minimize 
the social and environmental 
impacts of our operations, 
and respond to the various 
demands of our stakeholders, 
we base our strategy and 
environmental management 
approach on the VPS. We 
also take into account 
international best practices, 
standards and benchmarks, 
such as ISO 14001:20152. 
Both the Health, Safety and 
Operational Risks and the 
environmental disciplines at 
Vale are structured on the 
concept of lines of defense 
for risk management. 

In this approach, the first line 
of defense is the operational 
area itself, the second line 
is the corporate area of 
Environmental Management, 
and the third line is the 
Internal Audit function. In 
line with this approach, we 
continue to invest in new 
technologies, undertake 
research, and structure our 
actions to efficiently manage 
our risks. In 2022, we initiated 
a series of studies with 
our main operational units 
to discuss the production 
process in depth, seeking 

greater operational efficiency, 
and consequently less 
environmental impact at the 
“end of the pipeline”. Based 
on these studies, agreements 
on operational indicators 
were reached, between the 
operational units and the local 
environmental discipline, and 
which are monitored on a 
monthly basis. 

More generally, recent 
environmental advances include:

• several decarbonization 
initiatives at our operations 
and in the production chain;

• operational improvements 
that reduce the impacts of 
atmospheric emissions on 
water bodies, and from noise 
and vibrations;

• actions for biodiversity 
conservation and 
rehabilitation of degraded 
areas, both within and 
outside the company’s 
boundaries.

Vale also seeks to 
strictly comply with the 
multidisciplinary social and 
environmental programs 
and plans arising from the 
environmental licenses for  
our operations.

1 Wind Fences or wind barriers are metallic structures with screens installed 
around the product storage yards with the objective of reducing wind speed and, 
consequently, minimize wind drag.

2 75% of our operations are ISO 14001:2015 certified and we are committed to certify 
100% of our operations by the end of 2024.

3 Environmental incidents: unplanned event that resulted in an adverse environmental 
impact. Environmental impact: Any change in the physical, chemical and biological 
properties of the environment, caused by any form of matter or energy resulting 
from human activities that, directly or indirectly, affect the health and safety of the 
population, social and economic activities, biota and/or the aesthetic and sanitary 
conditions of the environment.

Despite all our efforts to 
improve environmental 
management and controls, 
Vale still experienced 
environmental incidents 
in 2022. When these 
incidents occur, we apply 
global premises of incident 
management:

• initial communication 
(internal and external), 

• adoption of immediate and 
control actions, 

• root cause investigation, 
implementation of corrective 
actions,

• scope analysis, and 

• the recording of lessons 
learned with the aim of 
avoiding recurrence, whether 
at the same location or at any 
other operational unit.

Tubarão Unit

Particulate material emissions 
from the chimneys of the Tubarão 
Unit currently account for around 
14% of Vale’s total. In addition, 
there are other sources of diffuse 
emissions in material handling 
operations. Aiming to reduce 
the impacts of atmospheric 
emissions, CVRD has been making 
major environmental investments 
every year, through the Tubarão 
Environmental Master Plan (PDA). 
The PDA includes all the actions 
to control atmospheric emissions 
established in the Environmental 
Commitment Term that Vale signed 
with the public authorities in 2018.

We are making progress in 
minimizing the impacts of 
atmospheric emissions from 
our local operations. Of the 
131 planned projects, 41% are 
concluded, 44% are in the 
implementation phase and 6% are 
in the contracting phase, totaling 
about 91% of the total. Highlights 
for 2022 include the enclosure 
of 32 belt transfer houses, the 
closing of the coal loading silo, 
the deployment of 10 new wheel 
washers, the adaptation of 234 
belt chutes, and the start of work 
on new Wind Fence1.

What do 
stakeholders 
expect from Vale?

Mitigation and 
adaptation 
measures in relation 
to climate change, 
alignment of targets 
with those of the 
Paris Agreement, 
transparency in the 
annual evolution 
of intermediate 
targets, in the 
trajectory of 
emissions, and in 
the demonstration 
of the capacity 
to deliver on the 
commitments made. 
In addition, they 
want information 
about the financial 
impacts of  
this work.

Climate change, as has been 
pointed out in the World 
Economic Forum’s Global Risks 
Report for almost a decade, 
is among the top global risks 
for society and global supply 
chains. This is also reflected in 
Vale’s stakeholder concerns and 
material issues. In this sense, 
it is our priority to promote 
low-carbon mining, which 
contributes to the entire value 
chain, making our business 
resilient to the effects of 
climate change and allowing  
us to contribute to the  
just transition. 

To accelerate the decarbonization 
agenda, Vale, supported by our 
global policy on climate change, 
Vale has a robust low-carbon 
governance, maintaining, since 
2019, a held regular discussion 
forum consisting of members 
of our executive committee and 
senior leadership; and we link 
emissions reduction targets to 
the variable compensation of 
our senior management team.

In 2017, Vale aligned with the 
Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
guidelines to understand, 
assess, govern and report on 
the impacts of the transition 
to a low-carbon economy and 
the physical impacts of climate 
change on our operations, and 
we continue to participate in 
existing major assessments. In 
2022, we received an A-rating 
in the CDP Climate Change1 
assessment for the third year 
in a row, an above average 

score for the mining sector. 
The CDP has updated its 
scoring methodology and 
added new questions to 
the document, which has 
made the assessment more 
rigorous as compared to 
previous years.

We publish Vale’s climate 
change strategy and our 
updated progress, including 
the decarbonization 
roadmap, annually. In 
addition to the CDP,

Strategies that support  
integrated climate management
To manage the risks and opportunities issues related 
to our decarbonization initiatives, Vale has built a 
plan, with clear milestones, to meet our greenhouse 
gas (GHG) reduction goals. Our current portfolio of 
initiatives comprises more than 40 projects, prioritizing 
the most cost-competitive ones in an effort to meet 
the 2030 target, based on a Marginal Abatement Cost 
(MAC) curve. All investment decisions are evaluated 
against a scenario of a USD 50 per ton of CO2 equivalent3. 
This practice not only encourages investments in the 
reduction of GHG emissions, but also prepares Vale for a 
scenario of more restrictive regulations.

The key word for the private sector is transition. We can no 
longer produce, consume, and pollute as before, since this 
model has led to the depletion of a wide variety of planetary 
limits. From a climate perspective, we need to achieve dramatic 
emissions reductions by 2030 and this can only be achieved if 
companies direct concrete efforts from now on in reallocating 
financial, material, and human resources in a just transition  
to an economy that works for people and the planet.”

In 2022, our direct emissions 
including fuels, industrial 
processes and other minor 
sources (Scope 1) and indirect 
market-based emissions 
regarding electricity purchase 
(Scope 2) totaled 8.9 MtCO₂e, a 
reduction of 27% when compared 
to 2017 baseline8. This reduction 
is mainly due to the decrease in 
production volumes compared 
to 2017.

Roadmap for reductions in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions1

Our goal of a 33% reduction of 
Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 
is intended to be aligned with the 
Paris Agreement goal of limiting 
global warming to less than 2°C 
and is based on 2017 emissions, 
which totaled 12.2 MtCO₂e. 
The target was established 
according to a science-based 
methodology2 and we aim not to 
use carbon credits to achieve the 
commitment.

Our decarbonization roadmap 
includes renewable energy 
initiatives that would allow us to 
meet 100% of Vale’s electricity 
consumption from renewable 

sources, which is reflected in 
our goals of reducing our Scope 
2 emissions to zero in Brazil by 
2025 and in other countries by 
2030. In this sense, having reached 
almost 100% renewable electricity 
consumption in Brazil by 2022 is a 
relevant intermediate milestone 
in relation to our decarbonization 
commitments.

In the medium and long term, we 
will aim to reduce GHG emissions 
at our operations seeking to 
increase the energy efficiency of 
processes and develop solutions 
based on the replacement 
of fossil energy sources by 

renewable alternatives. These 
may include the use of electricity 
and alternative fuels in trucks 
and locomotives, as well as the 
replacement of coal and other 
fossil fuels by renewable or  
low-carbon fuels in pelletizing  
and in our metallurgical 
processing. As part of this 
strategy, in 2022 we continued 
pilots for the use of biocarbon3 
and bio-oil4 for pellet production 
and 72-ton electric trucks in 
mines, among other initiatives. 

See the Scope 3 emissions  
results in Reduction of  
carbon in the value chain.

As we strive to achieve our goals 
for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, we expect to invest 
between USD 4 and USD 6 billion 
in our operations by 2030. Since 
2020, our expenditures on climate 
change have totaled USD 810 
million, of which USD 543 million 
in this last year.

increase in emissions, given the current 
correlation between production volume 
and emissions. In the medium term, a 
drop in emissions is expected, in line with 
decarbonization efforts, which is related 
to the implementation of low carbon 
initiatives by the PowerShift program.

Changes to the truck fleet

In 2022, we started the pilot tests of 
two 72-ton battery-powered off-
highway trucks. The first to be used by 
a global mining company, the vehicles 
emit no CO2 during operation, as they 
replace diesel with electricity, and also 
reduce noise, minimizing the impact on 
neighboring communities. Emissions 
from off-highway diesel trucks 
currently account for about 9% of our 
total Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.

We carried out a test at the Vargem 
Grande pelletizing plant to replace up 
to 50% of anthracite consumption with 
biochar. More industrial tests for the total 
replacement of coal are already scheduled 
for 2023. Pelletizing emissions from the 
use of anthracite alone account for about 
14% of our total Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.

In 2022, Vale signed a contract 
for the use of natural gas at the 
São Luís Pelletizing Plant. With 
the conversion, scheduled to take 
place in 2024, Vale aims for all of its 
pelletizing plants to use gas instead

In 2022, electricity accounted for 30.2% of our energy 
consumption, with 86.67% coming from renewable 
sources. This percentage is even higher in Brazil, with 
99.95% of our energy consumption from renewable 
sources, being met by concession contracts for our own 
assets, as well as by our power purchase agreements. 
This contracted renewable energy has been assured by 
certificates or statements from energy suppliers and has 
been audited by a third party.

In Canada, we recently signed a power purchase 
agreement (PPA) with Indigenous partners to provide 
wind power to our Voisey’s Bay operations, thus partially 
replacing diesel oil consumption with renewable 
electricity. Commercial operation of the wind project is 
planned for 2026 and we are aimed at reducing emissions 
by 34,602 tCO2e annually - equivalent to 16% of the 
emissions from Voisey’s Bay operations.

Our portfolio of generated electricity is 98.6% renewable 
and contributes directly to our overall target. Vale’s 
installed capacity in 2022 was 2.7 GW, mostly related to 
hydroelectric and wind generation assets, directly and 
indirectly owned, located in Brazil, Canada, and Indonesia, 
and our new solar project, Sol do Cerrado. These plants 
meet on average 61% of our global electricity consumption 
and 72% of consumption in Brazil, in addition to 
contributing to our goal to renewable energy1.

Renewable energy  
in Brazil and worldwide

In November 2022, the Sol Cerrado project, in the 
municipality of Jaíba in Minas Gerais, began to 
generate renewable energy. The enterprise is one 
of the largest solar energy parks in Latin America, 
with an installed capacity of 766 Megawatts-
peak. The project includes a substation and 
a 15 kilometer-long transmission line, with a 
voltage of 230,000 volts, connecting the Coletora 
Sol do Cerrado and Jaíba substations, from 
where the energy is delivered to the National 
Interconnected System.

The Sol do Cerrado Project, with investments 
totaling about USD 590 million, aims to 
generate renewable energy to meet 16%  
of Vale’s estimated consumption by 2025, 
reducing our emissions by 134,000 tCO2e/year, 
the equivalent emissions of approximately  
100,000 compact cars. 

In line with Vale’s commitment to promote a fair 
energy transition, a partnership was established 
involving the Jaíba city hall and the municipality’s 
community, which enabled the construction of a 
Local Development Agenda (ADL). Among its key 
deliverables are the consolidation of a permanent 
diverse and representative participation forum; 
the development of an integrated vision  
and shared oversight; short, medium and  
long-term strategic planning; and investments  
in education and broad participation.

The goal of achieving 100% renewable 
electricity in Brazil (2025) and globally 
(2030) is directly linked to our ability to 
transform our energy matrix to meet 
our expected demand.

Vale Climate Forecast

“Vale Climate Forecast” is a methodology, developed 
in conjunction with the ITV, that is intended to 
enable us to analyze and monitor the short- and 
long-term physical impacts caused by climate issues, 
such as changes in rainfall patterns and volumes, 
temperature variation, lightning incidence and storm 
occurrence for all the company’s operations. 

Long-term analyses have already been performed 
for the base metals operations in Canada and all 
operations in Pará and Maranhão, Brazil - including 
mines and railroads and the Ponta da Madeira 
Maritime Terminal. In the latter, in addition to the 
long-term analyses, it is already possible to make 
daily rainfall forecasts, which help in decision-
making for the shipping and distribution operations 
of iron ore and other products, optimizing planning 
and minimizing risks.

Just Transition

The risks arising from climate change have a 
significant impact on local communities, especially 
the most vulnerable ones, thus affecting their 
rights. In addition to the responsibility of ensuring 
the just transition associated with our assets and 
value chain, we recognize that Vale has a role in 
supporting these communities in adapting to and 
mitigating the impacts of climate change, while 
respecting human rights and promoting a positive 
social legacy.

Learn more in  
our Climate  
Change Report.

Climate-related risks 
and opportunities 

Guided by the TCFD, we use a risk matrix 
that considers the severity and likelihood 
of occurrence of risk events. In the case 
of risks related to climate change, Vale’s 
analysis methodologies are divided into 
the impacts resulting from transition 
risks (regulatory, legal, technological, 
market and reputational changes) and 
physical risks (acute and chronic).

Net zero goal

In addition to the absolute reduction 
of emissions through initiatives such 
as PowerShift, Vale’s commitment to 
net zero Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 
2050 is based on the neutralization 
of residual emissions through 
initiatives that remove carbon from 
the atmosphere such as Nature-based 
Solutions (NbS) and qualified carbon 
credits aligned with best practices.

Transition risks

• Changes in public policies, including 
carbon taxation.

• Company reputation.

• Climate-related litigation.

• Changes in demand, favoring

An energy matrix that is 
predominantly renewable, 
becomes a competitive 
advantage in delivering 
ore that is aligned with 
new requirements.

In a world of increasingly rapid 
transformation and instability, 
mining continues to be challenged 
to deliver the materials required 
not only to meet global needs, 
but also to contribute to the 
decarbonization of the economy. 
This takes place in the context of 
the evolution of industry practices 
in search of a sustainable model.

Future trends for mining can 
be grouped into five categories 
that influence the strategy and 
attractiveness of companies: 
demographics, geopolitics, 
supply, energy transition and 
decarbonization, and mining  
of the future.

The first three talk to supply 
challenges in a world experiencing 

11.The role of mining
growing demand at the same time 
as geopolitical and national policy 
constraints, inflationary pressure, 
climate change, energy security 
and the disruption of supply 
chains as a result of the pandemic. 

The other two (energy transition 
and decarbonization), on the 
other hand, are the challenges 
and opportunities linked to the 
transformation of practices, 
portfolio management, and the 
relationship of the mining sector 
with its stakeholders. They include 
low-carbon mining, a circular 
economy, data-driven mining, 
the carbon market and new 
sustainable steel  
production routes.

Decarbonization

The mineral production chain is at 
the beginning of a long and complex 
value chain, which will be critical 
in the transition to a low-carbon 
economy (demand for steel and 
base metals for renewable energies, 
batteries, etc.). However, it is also 
an industry, with great mobilization 
capacity, which can lead global 
decarbonization efforts.

In an increasingly capital-intensive 
sector, decarbonization is an 
opportunity to generate revenue 
– with the sale of raw materials 
needed for the energy transition 
and with low-carbon products – if 
a potential reduction in the cost 
of capital through access to new 
financing formats is anchored in 
sustainability. 

As the European Union nears the 
implementation of the Carbon 
Border Adjustment Mechanism 
(CBAM), of the Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), 
which will tax imported goods based 
on direct and indirect emissions 
resulting from their production, 
industries including mining must 
comply with new demands. 

The mining sector will have to focus 
on decarbonization initiatives that 
also address Scope 3 emissions, i.e. 

beyond those not as a result of direct 
activities. Helping to reduce these 
emissions may well have a greater 
impact, compared to reducing our 
own emissions (Scopes 1 and 2), given 
that, according to the Transition 
Pathway Initiative, they are 
responsible for more than 90% of the 
total emissions of the main mining 
companies. 

Proper carbon tracking is likely to be 
an essential condition to participate 
in this new context, to the extent 
that a product’s carbon footprint 
is likely to become an important 
element in the pricing of the ores 
available on the market.

Technologies for climate 
transition

There are three important 
transitions to consider for mining 
in a low-carbon world. The first 
is the shift in energy source from 
diesel to electricity or alternative 
fuels. Second, digitalization, which 
results in higher productivity and 
more sustainable use of resources, 
while reducing the cost of inputs. 
Digital transformation is likely to 
be an essential factor for acquiring 
and keeping our license to operate. 
In digital mining, operations will 
be connected, improving safety, 
productivity, and efficiency. The 
third is automation, which is also 

likely to increase productivity and 
change work patterns. 

Pact with society

The creation of real value sharing, 
benefiting the communities 
surrounding mining projects, is 
an essential requirement for the 
success of new ventures. Securing 
and maintaining a social license to 
operate from local communities 
continues to be a challenge for 
the mining industry. This requires 
building relationships that 
include free, prior, and informed 
consent before the deployment of 
projects; rehabilitation initiatives 
and considered future uses 
of closed mines; and offering 
employment opportunities and 
local development.

In this sense, a commitment  
to and respect for human rights, 

besides supporting a just and 
inclusive transition, becomes 
a condition for the industry’s 
sustainability.

Strategy 

Vale has developed a strategy 
based on three pillars, which is 
aimed at addressing and preparing 
the company to address this 
objective: sustainable mining, 
the development of low-carbon 
solutions and maintaining discipline 
in resource allocation.

These are solutions that focus 
on safety, reparation, cultural 
transformation, fighting poverty, 
positive environmental impact, 
and climate change mitigation and 
adaptation. They are applied to 
Vale’s portfolio of iron ore and base 
metals (especially those aimed at 
the energy transition).

12.Low-carbon solutions
The global context of 
decarbonization is spurring 
Vale to develop low-carbon 
solutions both to reduce 
the volume of our Scope 3 
emissions, ensuring access 
to markets that will assess 
carbon footprint in product 
pricing, and to enable 
our customers to reduce 
their own Scopes 1 and 2 
emissions. 

In relation to our iron-ore 
business, for example, 
customers and investors 
expect us to contribute 
to the development of 
sustainable ore and steel 
markets through meeting 
the demand for high-
quality products and 
greater efficiency through 
a portfolio with more 
solutions and by improving 
our operational flexibility to 
deliver quality products.

To this end, we have increased 
the production of materials 
with higher added value, such 
as pellets and briquettes; in 
building partnerships for the 
development of low-carbon 
solutions; in creating solutions 
to increase the iron ore content 
of our products; in circular 
mining strategies for the better 
utilization of tailings from 
operations; and in reviewing 
our production process with the 
goal of ensuring more flexibility, 
efficiency and alignment 
with new global production 
standards. 

What do stakeholders 
expect from Vale?

Mitigation and 
adaptation measures 
to address climate 
change, alignment of 
goals with those of 
the Paris Agreement, 
transparency in annual 
performance and 
the development of 
intermediate goals to 
reduce emissions, and 
in the demonstration  
of the capacity 
to deliver on the 
commitments made.

Scope 3 GHG emissions   
GRI 305-3 
(In MtCO2e)

1 Base year 2018 Scope 3 emissions reduced from 585 million tons of CO2e to 553 million CO2e, due to divestments in coal and ferroalloys assets,  
manganese operations (except Simões Filho plant), Centro-Oeste System and Vale Nickel (Dalian) Co., carried out in 2022. GRI 2-4

2 Method for achieving a linear absolute reduction in GHG emissions in the target year relative to the base year. 
3 Calculation methodology: SBTi - TWG-INF-002 | Version 4.2 April 2021.
4 As it foresees the use of carbon credits to achieve the commitment, the SBTi has formalized that it will not proceed with validating our Scope 3 

target, nor will it separately validate the goal of Scopes 1 and 2 target.
5 Vale’s 2022 GHG inventory results were audited by a third party.
6 An increase in Vale’s Scope 3 emissions is expected due to the growth in sales volume, due to a perspective of increased demand for our products.

GRI 3-3 | 201-2

The global context of decarbonization 
requires Vale to develop low-carbon 
solutions both to reduce the volume of 
our Scope 3 emissions, ensuring access to 
markets that will assess carbon footprint 
in product pricing.

553.11

482.8 491.6 477.8

2018 2020 2021 2022

Some sectors in our value chain 
are hard-to-abate sectors, such 
as steelmaking and shipping, 
which together account for 93% 
of our Scope 3 emissions. 

Our goal of a 15% reduction in 
Scope 3 net emissions was set 
using the absolute shrinkage 
approach2, a science-based 
methodology3, and aligned with 
the 2ºC temperature increase 
scenario. In working to achieve 
our commitments, we intend 
to rely on three main pillars: a 
high-quality product portfolio, 
partnerships with customers 
and suppliers, and the limited 
use of high-integrity carbon 
credits4, following principles such 
as additionality, permanence, 
transparency, and contribution 
to sustainable development. The 
use of carbon credits will be a 
maximum of 20% of the absolute 
reduction of Scope 3 emissions 
by 2035, equivalent to 17 MtCO₂e. 
Due to low-carbon technologies 
and climate policy uncertainties, 
we intend for our targets to be 
reviewed in 2025 and every  
five years.

Reduction of GHG in the value chain

Scope 3 emissions totaled, in 
2022, 477.8 million tons of CO2e

5, 
representing a reduction of 3% 
compared to 2021, and a decrease 
of 14% compared to the 2018 
base year6. This variation in 
emissions is mainly due to the 
reduction in the sales volume of 
our products, especially pellets, 
by 41%, and iron ore, by 12%, 
compared to 2018. GRI 305-3 

Scope 3 emissions, represent 
around 98% of Vale’s total 
emissions, about 97% of 
Vale’s Scope 3 emissions are 
downstream in its value chain, 
mainly in steelmaking, from 
processing, transportation and 
use of the products we supply. 
Upstream, on the other hand, 
emissions are associated with 
suppliers of raw materials, 
products and services, as well  
as their transportation, and 
totaled about 3% of Scope 
3 emissions in 2022. Read 
more about our suppliers in 
Responsible Sourcing.

In base metals, there is a 
relevant opportunity to boost 
the energy transition through 
products such as copper - 
aligned with practices strongly 
anchored in ESG performance, 
low carbon emissions, and 
quality relationships with the 
communities surrounding our 
operations. As such, Vale is 
investing in the growth of our 
North Atlantic projects and 
the stabilization of our South 
Atlantic projects, through a 
consistent project pipeline 
that are aimed at enabling 
production growth.

Iron ore

Vale aims to supply approximately 
100 million tons of agglomerated 
products over the next 15 to 20 
years, split between agglomerates 
for blast furnaces and for direct 
reduction. The production of 
these agglomerated products 
are expected to see lower fossil 
fuel consumption, particulate 
emissions, and water use.

In 2023, start-up is planned for 
two briquette plants that are 
under construction in Tubarão, 
with a total expected capacity of 
six million tons per year. Another 
seven are under evaluation, 
including co-located plants.

High-quality product portfolio

Base metals

Demand for base metals in the 
coming decades is likely to be 
driven by decarbonization and 
the energy transition. There is 
likely be growth in the electric 
vehicle industry, where battery 
components are made from 
nickel and copper. The trend 
towards electrification based 
on renewable energy sources is 
likely provide for the expansion 
of solar and wind projects, 
which are copper-intensive.

Our products are low-carbon 
certified and more than 
86% of the electricity used 
in our production processes 

comes from clean sources, 
contributing significantly to 
the energy transition and to 
a sustainable economy.

In 2022, we signed long-term 
agreements with General 
Motors Co., Northvolt, 
and Tesla Inc to supply 
nickel from Vale’s Canadian 
operations. These initiatives 
are in line with our strategy 
to broaden our exposure to 
the electric vehicle industry, 
leveraging our market 
leadership as the largest 
producer of refined nickel in 
North America. 

Partnerships with customers and suppliers

The products of Dillinger and Saarstahl are already part 
of today’s energy and mobility transition. Together with 
strong partners like Vale, we will continue pursuing the 
path to climate-neutral production. By working together 
to develop solutions for decarbonization in steelmaking, 
we can pool our expertise and achieve the next 
milestones on the road to our green transformation.”

Dr. Karl-Ulrich Köhler, Chairman of the Board of Management  
of SHS – Stahl-Holding-Saar and CEO of Dillinger and Saarstahl

As a global steelmaker, 
transitioning to the 
production of low carbon 
emissions steel in accordance 
with the Paris Agreement is 
of fundamental importance 
to ArcelorMittal. We must 
achieve this in a just and 
responsible manner providing 
safe, decent and inclusive 
environments throughout the 
value chain for both workers 
and affected communities. 
We see third party certified 
multi-stakeholder standards 
like ResponsibleSteel™ and 
the Initiative for Responsible 
Mining Assurance (IRMA) as 
key enablers, and we seek 
to work with likeminded 
partners.”

James Streater, Head of 
Sustainable Development for  
the ArcelorMittal Group

As steelmaking is a hard-to-
abate sector, it will require our 
leadership in developing low-
carbon solutions through a 
customer-centered approach, 
the rapid development of 
high-quality products, and 
customized business models. 
We have invested in innovation 
and technology with the aim of 
offering solutions for the steel 
industry, seeking an increasingly 
sustainable future for mining.

In order to strengthen our 
partnerships, we signed 
Memoranda of Understanding 
with relevant steel customers 
in 2022:

• German steelmaker Stahl-
Holding-Saar GmbH & 
Co. KGaA (SHS), to jointly 
explore initiatives focused 
on the carbon-neutral steel 
production process, such 
as the use of Vale’s iron 

ore briquette and direct 
reduction pellets in the steel 
mill; a briquette plant located 
close to SHS’s facilities; and 
Tecnored’s technology. 

• Nippon Steel Corporation 
(“Nippon Steel”), which is 
Japan’s largest integrated 
steel producer and one of 
the world’s leading steel 
solutions providers focused 
on the carbon-neutral steel 
production process. Vale 
and Nippon Steel intend to 
jointly explore solutions for 
the use of metallics such as 
direct reduction of iron ore 
(DRI) and pig iron produced 
by Tecnored technology; and 
the use of our briquettes in 
the manufacturing process of 
iron and other lower carbon 
footprint products.

Our products are low-carbon 
certified and more than 
90% of the electricity used 
in our production processes 
comes from clean sources, 
contributing significantly to 
the energy transition and  
to a sustainable economy.

Carbon Footprint

In 2022, we progressed in measuring the 
carbon footprints of Vale’s products. The 
quantification and reporting of products’ 
carbon footprints are based on the ISO 14067 
Carbon Footprint of Products and Product 
Lifecycle Accounting and Reporting Standard 
of the GHG Protocol. The cradle-to-gate 
approach was used, covering emissions 
generated from mineral extraction, 
processing and internal transport, pelletizing 
(where applicable), as well as emissions from 
the production of inputs (Scope 3 Upstream).

• Carbon footprints have been calculated 
and verified by third parties for 100% of 
our Class 1 nickel products, and for 75% 
of nickel, copper and cobalt products;

• 40% of the volume of ferrous products 
sold in 2021 have carbon footprints 
calculated, of which approximately 
35% have had their footprints verified 
by a third party. It is expected that we 
will have 70% of products covered and 
verified by the end of 2023.

Expanding Low-Carbon 
Solutions in the Middle East

In 2022, we signed agreements to 
establish mega hubs in Saudi Arabia, 
the United Arab Emirates, and 
Oman with the goal of developing 
low-carbon products for the steel 
industry, especially Hot Briquetted 
Iron (HBI) and steel products to 
supply local and transoceanic 
markets, with a significant reduction 
in CO2e emissions. 

HBI production using natural gas 
emits approximately 60% less 
CO2e when compared to pig iron 
production. In the future, the 
replacement of natural gas with 
hydrogen and the use of renewable 
energy may reduce these emissions 
considerably.

Under the agreements, Vale will build 
and operate iron ore concentration 
and briquetting plants at the 
hubs, which are intended to help 
ensure the supply of high-quality 
agglomerated products. The 
partners, in turn, will provide the 
necessary logistical infrastructure. 
The mega hubs should supply 
different markets around the 
world, further supporting the 
decarbonization of the steel 
industry.

13.Responsible sourcing GRI 2-6

By the end of 2022, Vale’s supplier base was 
made up of about 18,000 suppliers, including 
consumer goods companies, materials and 
service providers, and consulting firms. 
Supplying quality products and agile services 
is strategically key to our business. We 
believe our value chain has a direct influence 
on the impacts we have on nature, on 
communities, and on the economy. That is 
why we must manage risks and opportunities 
to help ensure responsible practices aim 
to that guarantee the continuity and 
competitiveness of our business. 

Before starting a business relationship with 
Vale, all our suppliers undergo a Due Diligence 
process, where a reputational assessment is 
undertaken based on public information, an 
established risk matrix, and the scope of work 
to be performed. Suppliers and contractors 
that have their own Code of Conduct aligned 
to the United Nations Global Compact 
Principles may commit to act in accordance 
with their own document. Those suppliers 
that do not have their own Code of Conduct 
must agree to commit to Vale’s Principles 
of Conduct for Contractors. In addition, 
we request the submission of supporting 
documents on good practices for suppliers 
that have identified warning signs or for 
those belonging to certain risk categories. 

We select suppliers considering objective 
technical, safety, and economic criteria in 
accordance with legislation and internal 

standards. Based on these criteria, 
suppliers are periodically monitored on 
their social, environmental and human 
rights performance, as well as relationships 
with government.

Vale is committed to helping develop 
the areas where we operate. In 2022, 
procurement spending with local 
suppliers accounted for 56% of our total 
procurement spending in the period, which 
stood at USD 11.1 billion. 

In 2022, we developed a Supply Chain 
Criticality Matrix, prepared in alignment  
with the ISO 20400 Sustainable 
Procurement guidelines and based on the 
segmentation of our active supplier base in 
Brazil, considered the following:

1. Grouping suppliers into 54 macro-groups, 
considering categories with similar 
production processes and/or labor profiles; 

2. Analysis of ESG impacts and risks for each 
macro-group considering 22 hotspots 
including risks related to the intensity 
of GHG emissions, business ethics, or 
exposure to slave labor; 

3. Plotting of each macro-group of supply 
categories and hotspots according to  
(1) level of severity and likelihood of 
ESG impact and (2) level of mutual 
responsibility for any impact  
(reputational, legal etc.).

are required.

Navigation

We are committed to 
supporting the shipping 
industry in meeting the goals 
of the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO), which 
include reducing member 
countries’ emissions intensity 
by 40% by 2030 and absolute 
emissions by 50% by 2050, 
when compared to 2008 levels.

In 2022, Vale achieved a major 
milestone for the adoption 
of alternative, lower carbon 
emission fuels for shipping. 
The multi-fuel tanks initiative 
is part of the Ecoshipping 
program, developed by Vale for 
the use of new technologies 
and modernization of the 
fleet. The emissions reduction 
from ships in the Guaibamax 
category1 is estimated at 
between 40% and 80% when 
powered by methanol and 
ammonia, or up to 23%  
when using liquefied  
natural gas (LNG). 

In addition to incorporating 
alternative fuels, Vale has 
developed innovative energy 
efficiency technologies. In 2021, 
we launched the first ore carrier 
equipped with rotating sails 
and the first Guaibamax ship to 
use air lubrication system.

High-integrity carbon credits 

Vale, through the Vale Fund, and 
the Algar Group, through Algar 
Farming, signed an agreement 
to purchase high-integrity 
forest carbon credits.

It is the first REDD+ project 
to integrate the Forestry Goal 
2030 and is equivalent to 
133,000 credits (approximately 
50,000 hectares of forest)2. 
The intention in 2023 is to 
strengthen the partnership 
with the implementation of 
social and environmental impact 
actions in addition to carbon 
reduction initiatives. 

The project, which started 
in 2017, takes place at Algar 
Farming’s Fazenda Pacajá in 
northern Pará and aims to 
protect an area of more than 
140,000 hectares of native 
forest in the Amazon biome.  
It is estimated that over the 
30-year duration of the project, 
it will be possible to avoid the 
emission of approximately  
40 million tons of CO2 into  
the atmosphere.

Engagement Rating appearing among the  
15% of the leading companies in the “Metallic 
Mineral Mining Group” and 8% best rated  
for supplier engagement on Climate Change.

Evaluation and 
monitoring
Supplier management is 
guided by adherence to 
compliance standards, which 
include health and safety, 
social and environmental 
issues, ethics and integrity, 
and human rights. It covers 
regulations and processes for 
risk monitoring and mitigation, 
and is incorporated into our 
management system, the VPS.

Before start a relationship 
commercial with Vale, all our 
suppliers pass by due diligence, 
in that an assessment is made 
based on public information 
and the scope of work to 
be played. This process 
verification is part of our 
Ethics & Compliance Program

 

Partilhar Program 
In 2020, the “Partilhar” (meaning 
Share) program was launched 
to foster greater socioeconomic 
development in the regions 
where Vale operates, joining 
forces with our supply chain. Its 
methodology and concepts were 
incorporated into Vale’s supplier 
contracting process, added to the 
technical and commercial aspects, 
in addition to safety. As a result 
of the program, participating 
suppliers invested more than USD 
1.7 million in 2022 in local social 
actions that benefited the areas 
where Vale operates.

Ethics and Compliance: Vale 
wants to work with suppliers 
who are committed to operating 
their business in a responsible and 
ethical manner, in compliance with 
our anti-corruption principles. 
The Principles of Conduct for 
Contractors, published in 2022, 
allows us to share our values and 
ethical principles with suppliers 
and other third parties who work 
with us. This document reinforces 
that the Whistleblower Channel can 
be accessed by anyone, inside or 
outside Vale, who wants to report a 
suspected violation of our  
Code of Conduct.

Climate Change: We are committed 
to engaging our suppliers on climate 
change and on the improvement of 
their emissions management. Since 
2011, we have encouraged suppliers 
to pursue emissions management 
through a contractual clause and 
completion of an annual GHG 
questionnaire. Since 2020, Vale 
suppliers considered key in terms 
of emissions in the supply chain are 
invited annually to participate in 
the CDP Supply Chain Program. 

In 2022, 492 suppliers were 
selected, with an 84% response 

rate (412 suppliers). This result is 
10% higher than the previous cycle, 
reflecting greater engagement by 
our suppliers with climate change 
issues. Of these respondents, 192 
participated in all three cycles of 
the CDP, which allows us to show 
their continuous commitment to 
managing the topic. In 2022, about 
28% of the suppliers evaluated were 
classified as leaders or as having 
good management on the subject. 
Vale improved its ranking in the 
CDP Supplier Engagement Rating 
appearing with A-list Companies, 
and being among the 15% of the 
leading companies in the “Metallic 
Mineral Mining Group” and among

Human Rights: Before starting a 
business relationship with Vale, all 
our suppliers are subjected to a due 
diligence, assessment, based on 
public information and the scope of 
work to be performed. 

This verification process is part 
of our Ethics and Compliance 
Program. This includes human 
rights due diligence. The process 
starts during the registration stage 
and continues through to supplier 

contract management. Risk 
assessment, application of a 
self-diagnosis questionnaire, 
document and field 
inspections, and monitoring of 
supplier action plans are some 
of the practices intensified  
over the past three years.  
In 2022, 432 suppliers in Brazil 
were classified as high risk in 
respect of human rights due 
to the characteristics of their 
contract with Vale. Of these 
suppliers, 118 had their risk  
level reduced based on the  
self-diagnostic questionnaire, 
71 of them underwent training 
and 80 underwent human 
rights inspections.

The main results of the 
inspections pointed to 
weaknesses in the fight against 
the sexual exploitation of 
children and adolescents, the 
dissemination and operation 
of whistleblower channels, and 
problems in labor relations and 
working conditions. Suppliers 
with identified vulnerabilities 
were asked to draw up an action 
plan and must periodically 
report progress to Vale.

Risk Management in the Base Metals Supply Chain 

Vale Base Metals is committed 
to responsibly producing and 
sourcing minerals and metals 
feeds, including nickel, copper, 
cobalt, platinum, palladium, 
ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, 
gold, and silver, and that all 
leaders, employees, suppliers, 
and contractors uphold this 
commitment. To this end, the 
Company has implemented 
due diligence processes to 
assess and manage the risks 
outlined in Annex II of the OECD 
Due Diligence Guidance for 
Responsible Supply Chains of 
Minerals from Conflict-Affected 
and High-Risk Areas OECD 
Guidance91 (OECD Responsible 
Sourcing Requirements) and 
upheld by the Base Metals  
Policy Statement on Responsible 
Sourcing of Minerals and 
Metals. These processes 
incorporate third-party and 
supplier risk assessments, 
red flag identification, and 
implementation of risk 
management strategies to 
mitigate identified risks, 
including financing of 

conflict, human rights abuses, 
bribery, and fraudulent 
misrepresentation of the origin 
of minerals, money laundering, 
and public or private security 
forces. We have an independent 
audit process that includes a 
review of management systems 
related to responsible sourcing, 
as well as an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s 
efforts to mitigate risks in 
the supply chain. Several Base 
Metals refineries are in the 
process of obtaining third-
party certification in line with 
OECD Responsible Sourcing 
Requirements. 

In 2022, Vale Base Metals 
conducted third-party 
CopperMark Joint Due Diligence 
Standard (JDDS) assessments 
at three of our North Atlantic 
refineries: Copper Cliff Nickel 
Refinery (Ontario), Long 
Harbour Processing Plant 
(Newfoundland), and Clydach 
Nickel Refinery (Wales). The 
results of these assessments are 
publicly available for review.

Through our risk mitigation 
approach, Vale Base Metals 
strives to ensure responsible 
sourcing practices throughout 
our supply chain. We achieve 
this by collaborating with our 
suppliers, actively monitoring their 
performance, and maintaining 
a zero-tolerance policy towards 
human rights violations and support 
of non-state armed groups.  
Our responsible sourcing practices 
have yielded data that has 
strengthened our due diligence 
efforts, identifying feeds that are 
higher risk and prompting us to take 
enhanced due diligence measures  
to mitigate those risks. 

Vale is a member of the Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative 
(EITI) and is committed to disclosing 
its due diligence processes in its 
EITI reports. We also disclose 
information on payments made 
to governments in line with the 
EITI criteria and principles. We 
are committed to continuously 
improving our responsible 
sourcing practices and maintaining 
transparency in our operations.

Vale is committed to responsibly 
producing and sourcing minerals and 
metals feed sand requires all leaders, 
employees, suppliers, and contractors 
to uphold this commitment. To this 
end, the Company has implemented  
due diligence processes.

The circular economy is replacing 
the current linear model of extract, 
produce, and discard, which is 
reaching its physical limits. It is an 
alternative model based on a new 
type of relationship with natural 
resources and their use by society. It 
is based on the practice of recycling 
products that reach the end of their 
useful life. But this is only one part 
of a much broader concept, which 
involves rethinking the way products 
are designed, manufactured and 
marketed so that they generate  
less waste in manufacturing  
and throughout their life cycle,  
are more durable, and can be  
reused for other purposes.

14.Circular mining and new business
Thus, the circular economy has 
become a key focus in solving critical 
problems such as global warming, 
material scarcity, and the correct 
disposal of tailings. 

In this sense, Vale has been 
exploring initiatives that contribute 
to circular mining, such as 
reprocessing waste generated 
(tailings) from iron ore production 
process to create ore-sand, a 
byproduct alternative to riverbed 
or coastal sand mining. In 2021, we 
will begin marketing Brucutu sand, 
with quality certified by specialized 
laboratories, with 225,000 tons 
available to be used in applications 
such as concrete, mortar, precast, 

artifacts, cement and road paving. 
Each ton of sand produced 
represents one ton less of tailings 
being disposed of in piles or dams.

In 2022, we expanded sand 
operations, allocating 530,000 
tons from mines such as Brucutu 
and Viga and internal applications 
such as the Cauê Test Track, 
to commercialization for civil 
construction uses, resulting in 
several commercial sand contracts. 
We also contributed to a study 
carried out by the University of 
Queensland and University of 
Geneva, and presented at UNEA1, 
which reinforces the potential of 
sand from the iron ore production 

process as a sustainable alternative to 
the predatory extraction of sand from 
river beds.

In 2022, advances were also made 
in relation to circular mining in Base 
Metals operations, such as:

• Use of 360 t of nickel from  
waste ores

• Reprocessing 5 kt of copper 
contained in Thompson precipitates

• 2 kt of recycled nickel in slags.

The circular economy is replacing 
the current linear model of extract, 
produce, and discard, which is reaching 
its physical limits. It is an alternative 
model based on a new type of 
relationship with natural resources and 
their use by society.

15.Governance

What do stakeholders 
expect from Vale?

From early 2023, we will have a new design for the 
Executive Committee, linked to the Vale presidency 
(see organization chart on next page). 

In the new configuration, four executive vice-
presidencies have been appointed: Iron Ore Solutions, 
Operations, Projects, and Technical. The functions of 
the former executive vice-presidencies of Strategy 
and Business Transformation, Global Business 
Solutions, and Security and Operational Excellence 
have been incorporated into this new structure.

The changes are intended to provide greater focus 
on our core assets, ensuring agile improvement 
and innovation in the development of products 
and solutions for the global energy transition. The 
new design is the result of the strategic initiative 
to simplify our portfolio, which is now focused 
exclusively on businesses and geographies in which we 
have clear competitive advantages. 

 Changes in the By-laws 21

 In 2022, Vale’s Board

In 2022, to focus the Board of Directors’ activities 
on Vale’s strategic direction, the Board’s duties 
were revised, including a broad review of the 
Delegation Policy. The statutory advisory committees 
were reduced from seven to five: the Innovation 
Committee became non-permanent and non-
statutory; the duties of the former Operational

The advisory committees now comprise only 
members of the Board of Directors.

Board of Directors

The Board of Directors is 
responsible for overseeing Vale’s 
guidelines and strategic plans, 
monitoring and evaluating 
our economic and financial 
performance, appointing and 
evaluating the members of 
the Executive Committee, and 
deliberating on corporate policies, 
among other duties. Its mission 
is to protect Vale’s assets and 
maximize, in the long term, 
the return on shareholders’ 
investment, acting within the 
highest ethical principles, in 
order to maintain the company’s 
longevity in line with Vale’s 
purpose. GRI 2-12 | 2-13

The Board comprises 13 members, 
eight of whom are independent, 
including the Chairman of the 
Board, and most of whom have 
expertise in mining (or related 
industry), ESG, finance, and 
cultural transformation. Of the 
13 current members of the Board 
(term of office 2021-2023), one 
is an employees representative, 
and the others are elected by 
nomination from the Nominating 
and Governance Committee 
(at that time still called the 
Nominating Committee). GRI 2-10

good corporate governance. Our 
Board conducts annual performance 
assessments – with the support of the 
Nominating and Governance Committee 
for analysis and recommendation of the 
evaluation methodology. Based on the 
results, a development plan is created 
for the Board, aimed at continuous 
improvement and focused on the 
evolution of our governance.

In 2022, the performance assessment 
process for the Board of Directors 
and the Advisory Committees 
was supported by the Personnel, 
Compensation and Governance 
Committe3, and covered, among other 
aspects, for each Advisory Committee: 

(a)  its composition and structure;

(b)  its dynamics;

(c) its processes and support
structures; and 

(d)  its contributions to the execution 
of the Company’s objectives, 
in addition to highlighting 
opportunities for improvement and
providing feedback to members.

This process included not only 
the evaluation of the Advisory 
Committees as a whole, but also 
individual self-assessments by board 
members. This was in addition to 
peer evaluations, considering aspects 
such as contribution, participation 
and engagement, competencies, and 
personal profile. The Board assessment 
also included the participation of the 
Executive Directors (360º evaluation).

Currently, our committees are:

• Capital Allocation and Projects 
Committee 

• Sustainability Committee 

• People and Compensation 
Committee

• Audit and Risk Committee 

• Nominating and Governance 
Committee

• Innovation Committee (non-

The Advisory Committees assist the 
Board of Directors on specific topics 
in order to provide greater efficiency

Each year, the Advisory Committees 
define their work plan for priority 
topics. Requests for discussions and

compensation
GRI 2-19 | 2-20

As detailed in Vale’s By-laws, 
the overall annual compensation 
of the members of the Board of 
Directors, Executive Committee, 
Fiscal Council and Advisory 
Committees is established at the 
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The 
Board of Directors, with the support 
of the People and Compensation 
Committee, is responsible for 
distributing the compensation 
approved by the Shareholders’ 
Meeting among the members of the 
Executive Committee.

The variable compensation of the 
members of the Executive Committee 
includes, among others, metrics 
focused on ESG issues, both in short-
term and long-term compensation. 

Short term

• In 2022, the performance targets 
were established in the following 
proportion, respectively: 65%-75% 
collective targets and 25%-35% 
individual targets, according to the 
scope of each area. 

• We seek, through a model focused 
on collective goals, to stimulate 
mutual collaboration based 
on the key behavior “Sense of 
Ownership”. In this context, focus 

and relevance were given to critical 
objectives related to safety, risk 
and sustainability, EBITDA, and the 
strategic objectives for achieving  
the company’s ambitions. 

• In the collective component, 30%-
40% of the targets are tied to non-
financial indicators and ESG topics, 
and 35% are tied to financial targets. 

• Since 2020, the Health, Safety, 
Geotechnics, Reparation and 
Compliance areas do not have 
financial and production results in 
their target dashboard, representing 
Vale’s focus on Risk Management  
as a priority.

• For 2023, targets related to capital 
allocation, process-related safety 
events, indicators of black people 
in leadership positions, and volume 
guidance are slated to be included, 
in addition to the maintenance of 
costs, among other KPIs aligned to 
the achievement of the company’s 
objectives.

Long term

• The long-term compensation  
plans offered by Vale are VSP  
and Matching.

• In 2020, indicators related to ESG 
topics were included in the VSP,  
with 20% weight. Since 2022, this 
has risen to 25%, placing more focus 
on these issues.

• Since 2021, the VSP compensates 
its executives in common shares 
of the Company (substituting 
cash payment linked to the share 
price) and includes the payment, 
at the end of each cycle, of “virtual 
dividends”.

• From 2023, the VSP will no longer 
have a trigger linked to Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR), which 
means even more focus and 
relevance for ESG-related KPIs. In 
addition, in 2023 it was decided to 
include ROIC (return on invested 
capital) metrics in the 2024 VSP with 
25% weight, as an internal value 
creation goal, for greater alignment 
with investors and Vale’s strategic 
objectives.

• Matching follows as a retention 
program and works as a partial 
deferral of the bonus in the form 
of shares issued by Vale. Executives 
must acquire shares in the Company 
using their own resources, and in 
doing so, receives the right to a 
share premium at the end of the  
3-year cycle.

• The Matching program also includes 
the payment of “virtual dividends”, 
which are paid by the company 
immediately after the distribution  
of dividends and/or IOC by Vale to 
the shareholders.

The consolidated results of the 
assessments were submitted to 
the Board of Directors while the 
individual results were shared 
with the Chairman of the Board of 
Directors for further feedback to 
each board member. 

Fiscal Council 
The Fiscal Council is a permanent 
body, which performs independent 
oversight of the Executive 
Committee and the Board of 
Directors and seeks, through the 
principles of transparency, equity, 
and accountability, to contribute to 
Vale’s best possible performance. Its 
duties include the supervision of the

management reports and financial 
statements and maintaining a direct 
communication channel with the

Executive Committee 
Vale’s Executive Committee is 
responsible for executing the 
business strategy defined by the 
Board of Directors, developing 
plans and projects and ensuring the 
company’s efficient operational and 
financial performance. The Board  
of Directors appoints the members 
of the Executive Committee,  
and the President is responsible  
for submitting the candidates for 

the positions of Vice President  
to the Board. GRI 2-13

After changes made in early 2023, 
the Executive Committee comprises 
the President and nine Executive 
Vice Presidents, eight of whom are 
statutory.

to reflect on each person’s role 
in this process. This initiative 
involved more than 50,000 
employees and more than 20,000 
contractors. Another initiative 
was a new course on ethics for 
contractors working at Vale. 
There were also communications 
related to conflict of interest; 
rules about gifts, meals, and 
entertainment; and about the 
Whistleblower Channel. 

We hosted 38 Ethics Talks with 
a focus on the Whistleblower 
Channel which gathered more 
than 3,000 employees in Brazil, 
Malaysia, Oman and the United 
Arab Emirates. During the 
December edition of Talk 360, 
which was attended by more 
than 42,000 people, actors from 
a theater company interpreted 
three ethical dilemmas, showing 
the importance of open and 
transparent dialogue, one of the 
key behaviors expected from 
employees. 

Vale has zero tolerance for 
corruption and bribery. Our 
anti-corruption rules ensure 
compliance with all applicable 

anti-corruption laws, including 
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act (FCPA), the Brazilian  
Anti-Corruption Law (Law No. 
12.846/2013), and local laws in 
each country in which we operate. 
Three actions on the topic stood 
out in 2022: (1) the launch of an 
anti-corruption online course; (2) 
customized training sessions for 
more than 1,300 employees of 
areas classified as priority groups 
due to exposure to the risk of 
corruption and (3) the Movement 
for Ethics, an action aimed at 
employees and contractors, where 
one of the dilemmas presented 
promoted reflection  
on anti-corruption behavior. 
In total, more than 60,000 
employees were trained, 
representing 93% of Vale’s 
workforce.

Detection

In the Risks and Monitoring 
element, we closely monitor 
adherence to the guidelines of the 
Ethics and Compliance Program 
through tests, controls and 
continuous monitoring activities. 

Vale’s Ethics and Compliance 
Program is structured to 
promote a culture of ethics and 
integrity through six elements 
focused on three different 
functions: prevention, detection 
and correction of misconduct. 

Prevention

Governance is structured with 
the aim of allowing the program 
to have the autonomy and 
independence necessary to 
help ensure the commitment 
of the entire organization to 
our ethical principles. The Audit 
and Compliance Department 
is responsible for the program 
with direct reporting to 
the Board of Directors, 
supervised by the Audit and 
Risk Committee and works in 
partnership with the Conduct 
and Integrity Committee. In 
2022, an external audit was 
requested by the Audit and 
Risk Committee to verify the 
effectiveness of the program’s 
processes. This external audit 
will be carried out every 
two years by a specialized 
independent consultancy firm. 

One of the main references 
for our ethics and compliance 
culture is Vale’s Code of 
Conduct, which translates our 
values into ethical principles 
that are expected to guide all 
our decisions. Employees and 
members of top management 
are required to comply with our 
ethical principles when they join 
the company. 

We also rely on other regulatory 
documents such as our Global 
Anti-Corruption Policy, our 
internal Global Anti-Corruption 
Manual, our Anti-Corruption 
Guide for suppliers and other 
third parties, our Global Conflicts 
of Interest Guidelines, our 
Principles of Conduct for Third 
Parties, and our Consequence 
Management Policy.

Under the Communication and 
Training element of our work, 
we held an “Ethics Week” in 2022 
which included the “Movement 
for Ethics”, a global mobilization 
where leaders discussed three 
ethical dilemmas with their 
teams and had the opportunity 

• Seventeen controls are part  
of our risk matrix and foster  
the management of risk  
of corruption at Vale.

• Six of these controls  
are considered key and are 
related to socio-environmental 
and institutional external 
expenditure, suppliers, hiring 
of public agents and training 
attendance.

• 120 control tests were 
performed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of these controls.

• 95% of the transactions tested 
in 2022 were in compliance 
with the Program’s guidelines. 
All identified non-compliant 
transactions were addressed and 
no deviations were identified.

What steps did we take 
in our efforts to manage  
the risk of corruption  
in 2022?

Created in 2006, this channel 
can be accessed by anyone, 
inside or outside Vale, to 
report suspected cases or 
breaches of conduct with 
guaranteed confidentiality 
and non-retaliation for the 
whistleblower.

Another important mechanism 
for detecting misconduct at Vale 
is the Whistleblower Channel. 
Created in 2006, this channel can 
be accessed by anyone, inside or 
outside Vale, to report suspected 
cases or breaches of conduct 
with guaranteed confidentiality 
and non-retaliation for the 
whistleblower. Reports can be 
made by phone, electronically,  
or even by letter, and are received 
by an external, independent 
company generating a tracking 
protocol number.

Investigations are conducted by 
Vale’s Whistleblower Channel 

team, which reports to the Audit 
and Compliance Department. The 
process – audited by an external 
company – is designed to perform 
in an objective and impartial 
manner, guided by the company’s 
Code of Conduct and Consequence 
Management Policy. Allegations 
of Corruption are investigated by 
Corporate Integrity.

In 2022, 6,736 reports were 
registered, and 6,600 registrations 
were closed. Of these 6,600, 60.3% 
were classified as allegations1, 
27% as complaints2, and 13% as 
queries or out of scope reports or 
with insufficient information. In 

The Whistleblower Channel 
is an important tool for the 
company to act preventively 
in promoting a culture  
of integrity.

relation to confirmed allegations, 
62% were related to ‘interpersonal 
relations’, mostly linked to the 
inadequate management of people 
and inappropriate employee 
behavior. Sexual harassment, 
harassment and discrimination are 
also included in the ‘interpersonal 
relations’ category. These 
confirmed allegations included 
36 cases of sexual harassment, 
eight cases of discrimination (four 
related to gender, two which were 
ethnic and racial, one related to 
sexual orientation and one to 
gender and disability) and 34  
cases of harassment. 

 

In 2022, Vale launched a 
new telephone channel for 
employees and contractors 
in Brazil to report sexual 
harassment or discrimination 
and receive empathetic 
support. 

The channel is provided by 
specialized professionals from an 
external company. If the victim 
chooses to register an allegation, 
which can be done anonymously, 
the investigation is carried out 
by the Whistleblower Channel 
team. With this approach, which 
seeks to make the victim more 
comfortable, there has been an 
increase in the number of reports 
and an increase in the quality of 
the information and evidence 
shared by whistleblowers, thus 
speeding up the investigation 
process and also the conclusion, 
with the application of disciplinary 
measures established in the 
Consequence Management Policy. 

Learn more link.

New Channel
All confirmed cases of sexual 
harassment and discrimination 
were classified as being of high and 
very high severity, according to 
Vale’s Consequence Management 
Policy, resulting in the termination 
of employment. The confirmed 
cases of harassment generated 
action plans including training, 
coaching, feedback, suspensions, 
warnings and, in the majority of 
cases, termination of employment. 
The cases involving contractors led 
to the companies being notified 
and the termination of the 
contracts of the people working 
with Vale. 

1 Allegations are reports that represent potential violations of the 
Code of Conduct or non-compliance with policies and procedures 
or legislation or situations that may generate risk to the health and 
safety of employees, the community, and the environment in the 
regions where our company operates. Allegations are investigated 
by Vale’s Whistleblower Channel.

2 Complaints are reports that do not represent violations of the Code 
of Conduct or non-compliance with policies and procedures or 
legislation. They do not require investigation and may be directed 
to the responsible areas for an appropriate response.

Correction
The Consequence Management 
element allows the application of 
disciplinary measures for misconduct 
confirmed by the Whistleblower 
Channel or identified by leadership 
in the day-to-day work routine. 

All violations confirmed by the 
Whistleblower Channel triggered 
corrective plans. A total of 2,941 
corrective actions and disciplinary 
measures were undertaken, 
including 171 terminations of 
employment. In addition, we 
had termination of contractors, 
feedback, warnings and 
suspensions, process improvements, 
and other measures. 

In addition to identifying and 
addressing violations of Vale’s Code 
of Conduct, the Whistleblower 
Channel is an important tool 
for helping the company to act 
preventatively in promoting a 
culture of integrity and continuous 
improvement of our processes.  
In 2022, for example, 111 processes 
were improved based on 
opportunities identified through 
the Channel, and 171 training and 
retraining actions were promoted. 
More information on Vale’s 
Whistleblower Channel and actions 
to promote a culture of ethics and 
integrity are found in the Ethics and 
Compliance Program Report, which 
is available on our website.

Proceedings  
in the CGU
In August 2022, the Brazilian 
Government’s Office of the 
Comptroller General (CGU) published 
a decision on administrative 
accountability proceedings in 
which it concluded that Vale failed 
to submit reliable information in 
the National Mining Agency (ANM) 
system regarding the Brumadinho 
Dam I and that it issued a positive 
Declaration of Stability Condition 
for the structure in the period from 
June to September 2018, when, in 
the control agency’s understanding, 
it should have been negative.

The CGU acknowledged that 
there was no corruption by Vale 
executives and that there was 
no involvement or tolerance 
by senior management in the 
situation. However, considering 
that by hindering ANM’s inspection, 
the occurrence constituted 
an act harmful to the Public 
Administration the CGU set the fine 
at approximately USD 16.7 million, 
the minimum level established by 
law. Vale has appealed the decision 
and the outcome is pending.

Compliance with laws and regulations GRI 2-27

In 2022, Vale received 18 fines and six  
non-monetary sanctions related to significant1 cases of 
non-compliance with laws and regulations. In the same 

1 For information about the concept considered for the term “significant”, as well as other legal areas covered in the reporting, considered in the column “Others”, see the Databook in tab “Glossary  
- Basis of Preparation”.

2 In 2022, the Company received 13 fines and 5 non-monetary sanctions for significant cases of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations related to its operations in Brazil, which refer 
to issues such as alleged non-compliance with conditions, performance of activities without prior authorization from the environmental agency, damage to natural resources, natural or cultural 
heritage and/or human health, among others. Of the 5 non-monetary sanctions reported, 4 refer to lawsuits that are essentially civil in nature, but deal, in an accessory/indirect manner, with 
environmental issues and/or have environmental issues as their origin. These lawsuits deal with the repair of damage due to dam bursting and/or impacts associated with the decharacterization 
of such structures and emergency evacuations and preventive relocations due to changes in their safety level, and had decisions handed down in 2022, which will bring an environmental scope, 
which is why they are being reported in the item Environment. It is emphasized, finally, that the information provided in the table above is based on information extracted from the database of the 
Company’s administrative and judicial proceedings system.

3 In 2022, the Company received 5 fines and 1 non-monetary sanction for significant cases of non-compliance with civil laws and regulations related to its operations in Brazil, which refer to the alleged 
practice of acts harmful to the public administration and the alleged non-compliance with resolutions and clauses of the Term of Transaction and Adjustment of Conduct signed within the scope of 
the Mariana/MG reparation. The information provided in the table above is based on data extracted from the internal monitoring system of the Company’s administrative and judicial proceedings, 
as well as from the notifications sent by the Interfederative Committee “CIF”, an external agent of the governance of the Renova Foundation in the Mariana/MG reparation process. With this, we 
highlight that the fines, which resemble those of a contractual nature, are applied directly to the Renova Foundation and/or Samarco and forwarded to Vale and BHP in a subsidiarity manner.

Unfair competition and 
conflicts of interest
GRI 2-15 | 206-1

The absence of conflicts of interest  
is one of the ethical principles of the 
new edition of Vale’s Code of Conduct.  
The company repudiates and rejects  
any action, influence or decision 
motivated by interests contrary  
to Vale’s ethical standards.

In 2022, there were no lawsuits  
brought against Vale for  
anti-competitive behavior, ntitrust  
and monopoly practices.

Data privacy
Vale’s data privacy guidelines were set 
out in a Global Policy, published in 2020, 
which presents the minimum conditions 
for Vale and other group companies to 
handle personal data. The company also 
has a direct communication channel 
with the privacy team and with the 
executive manager of the area, so that 
data subjects can make requests or 
submit complaints or suggestions.  
The communication channel, as well  
as the external privacy notice, are 
available on Vale’s website.

16.Economic performance
In 2022, Vale’s adjusted EBITDA1 
from continuing operations was 
USD 19.8 billion. This result is 37% 
lower than in 2021. This variation 
was mainly due to the 23.6% lower 
iron ore fines realized prices. The 
reduction in EBITDA resulted in a 
decrease in Free Cash Flow from 
Operations: USD 5.7 billion in 2022 
vs. USD 20.0 billion in 2021.

Capital expenditures in 2022, 
however, were 8% higher than the 
previous year, reaching USD 5.4 
billion. This increase was mainly 
due to the Sol do Cerrado solar 
farm, Serra Sul 120, Capanema and 
Tubarão Briquette iron ore projects.

Gross debt and leases of USD 12.7 
billion as of December 31, 2022 
largely due to lower free cash 
flow from operations and further 
execution of the share buyback 
program. Expanded Net Debt, 

meanwhile, is USD 14.1 billion,  
in line with the targeted leverage  
of USD 10 to 20 billion.

Distribution of value
We paid USD 12.6 billion in dividends, 
interest on capital and share 
repurchases in 2022. Since 2020, 
Vale has returned USD 35 billion to 
shareholders, representing around 
46% of our market capitalization2. 
Another USD 1.6 billion in dividends 
will be paid in March 2023, referring 
to our 2H22 results.

By early 2023, we had completed 
43% of our third share repurchase 
program, with a disbursement of 
USD 6 billion to repurchase 357 
million shares. Considering the  
three programs, the concentration 
of proceeds per share has increased 
by 15% since April 2021.

Vale constantly invests in 
the continuous evolution 
of systems for controlling 
and monitoring the 
impacts associated with 
our activities, and that any 
fines and non-monetary 
sanctions imposed on the 
Company are discussed in 
the respective processes, 
through the presentation of 
the appropriate defenses and 
appeals, based on  
the pertinent matters  
of fact and law.

Socio-environmental 
expenditure GRI 3-3 | 203-1

In 2022, Vale contributed USD 2.4 
billion in socio-environmental 
and institutional expenditure, 
including those related to 
Brumadinho, which represented 
a 83% increase compared to 2021. 
Social expenditures totaled USD 
1.6 billion, dedicated to social 
and institutional initiatives, of 
which 94% are from our own 
resources and 6% are investments 
from incentive-based funds. 
Environmental expenditures 
totaled USD 766.9 million, with 
main expenses in environmental 
liabilities, water resource 
management and atmospheric 
emissions abatement. Vale makes 
socioeconomic investments in 
the areas where we operate. 
In 2022, USD 140.5 million was 
earmarked in voluntary social, 
environmental and institutional 
expenditures funded through our 
own resources, including those 
related to Brumadinho. The main 
activities were in infrastructure 
and transport, social protection 
and health, among others. 

Incentive-based 
Funds
Vale also allocated USD 94.3 million 
in incentive-based funds through 
contributions to Rights Funds and 
support to civil society projects 
under four federal tax incentive 
laws: Childhood and Adolescence 
Fund; Senior Citizens Fund; 
Brazilian Sports Incentive Law; and 
Brazilian Culture Incentive Law.

Resources allocated to Funds are 
managed by separate Councils to 
strengthen municipal public policies 
benefiting children, teenagers and 
the elderly. The sporting projects 
sponsored by Vale benefited more 
than 111,000 people, mostly children 
and youth. The work of the Vale 
Cultural Institute served more than 
eight million people, generating 
around 5,300 permanent and 
temporary jobs. 

Production and sales highlights

Iron ore production totaled 308 million 
tons in 2022, down 2% from the 
previous year, mainly due to licensing 
delays at Serra Norte and jaspillite 
waste rock processing and operating 
performance at the S11D mine. These 
setbacks were offset by the continued 
ramp-up of production at Vargem 
Grande, higher production via dry 
processing at Brucutu, and increased 
purchases from third parties.

Pellet production totaled 32 million 
tons in 2022, up 1% year-on-year, with 
a better mix of direct reduction pellets 
(49% of total production versus 41% 
 in 2021), leveraged by higher quality 
feed and taking advantage of higher 
market premiums. 

Nickel production grew 6% in 2022 
to 179kt, mainly explained by the 
stabilization of operations after 
the work stoppage at Sudbury 
in 2021, as well as the consistent 
strong performance at Onça Puma. 
This was partially offset by lower 
feed availability due to furnace 
refurbishment at PTVI (Indonesia) and 
delayed ramp-up at Voisey’s Bay. 

Copper production decreased by 15% 
to 253kt in 2022 due to extended 
maintenance at the Sossego mill during 
the first half of the year, and additional 
maintenance required at both Sossego 

and Salobo. These events were 
partially offset by higher production 
in Canada due to the stabilization of 
the Sudbury mines and the recovery 
of copper from structures containing 
copper precipitates at Thompson, 
reducing waste as part of our 
approach aligned to circular mining.

Vale has joined the Pará 
Structure, a program 
introduced by the Pará State 
Government to encourage 
companies in the mining sector 
to carry out infrastructure 
work in the state. 

The total amount invested in 
the works can be deducted, up 
to the limit of 50%, from the 
amount owed by the company 
for the Tax on Control, 
Monitoring and Inspection of 
Activities of Research, Mining, 
Exploration and Use of Mining 
Resources (TFRM). The debt is 
the result of the retroactive 
collection of this tax, the 
constitutionality of which was 
evaluated by the courts for 
almost a decade.

The works selected by the 
company will be confirmed 
by the State Government and 
published in a public notice. 
The Pará Structure should 
contribute to accelerating 
the delivery and reducing 
the costs of improving Pará’s 
infrastructure.

ESG Gaps
In 2022, we closed three gaps  
in our ESG action plan, namely: 

• Expand the periodic supplier 
evaluation process to those  
mapped as critical and  
high-risk for Sustainability. 
Read more in:  
Responsible Sourcing.

• Conduct a global employee 
engagement survey.  
Read more on the page  
Our People.

• Disseminate information about 
mine closure planning, including 
community involvement process.  
Read more in: Mine closure  
and future use. 

Another gap identified for 2022, 
the certification of the energy 
management system, has been 
de-prioritized after an internal 
reassessment. The search for efficient 
and sustainable energy management 
continues to be a priority for the 
Energy Efficiency Program, whose 
principles are based on the ISO 50001 
standard.

As a result, PTVI, our nickel 
operation in Indonesia, obtained  
ISO 50001 certification in 2022.

This action plan was prepared 
in 2019 and revised in 2020, 
considering analysis of the main 
ESG assessments, aiming to align 
Vale’s management with the 
best environmental, social and 
governance practices required  
by the market and society. 

Of the total 63 gaps mapped,  
57 have already been resolved, 
corresponding to 90% of  
the action plan.

Integrated Report Vale 2022  80



Eighty years ago, societal and market rules operated differently. The responsibility of capital over 
impacts of economic activity was not up for debate and climate change was not part of the plot of 
dystopian fiction, much less considered in scientific journals. On its 80th anniversary emblematic 
publication of its Integrated Report, Vale inhabits a world that could not be more different than 
the one in 1942, when it was founded.

Climate change is an undeniable reality, social inequality is no longer tolerated as a natural 
consequence of capitalism, and structural racism and misogyny are struggles that everyone must 
engage in. As investors, we watch with special attention the ability of companies to capture the 
zeitgeist of the new normal in 2023 as they seek to translate it into concrete actions and bold, 
accountable plans. From the fiduciary exercise of monitoring invested assets, Vale received special 
attention because of its scale, the impact of its industry, and its past controversies. In the year 
Vale was founded, the world of 1942 experienced a divide between the world pre and post WWII, 
the Brumadinho and Mariana accidents were milestones delineating our responsibility as investors 
over the management of risks and impacts by companies in which we allocate our capital.

Vale’s Social and Environmental Ambition

We experience serious structural deficiencies in Brazil, and companies that operate in the country 
have the responsibility to address historically inequalities in order to earn their social license to 
operate. In this context, we observe distinguish Vale’s social goal to lift 500 thousand people out of 
extreme poverty, and its internal diversity, equity and inclusion goals to increase the participation 
of women in the workforce and in leadership positions.

By establishing voluntary targets for increasing the representativeness of minority groups, we 
highlight the target of achieving 40% of black leadership in Brazil by 2026. Another highlight that 
promotes a more inclusive society is the benefit offered to LGBTQIAP+ professionals of coverage 
for sexual reassignment surgeries. In a country like ours, a recurrent record-breaker in trans 
homicide, initiatives like this are transformational and show Vale’s true support for the cause. 
However, we strongly recommend that the scope of the diversity goals be broadened to include 
Board of Director composition.

Returning to the company’s most controversial issue - the accidents in Mariana and Brumadinho - 
we believe that the challenge is more than a purely physical feat, with the urgent need to complete 
reparations to families and communities affected by these disasters that should never have occurred, 
the decharacterization of upstream dams, and the reduction dam emergency levels. The most 
challenging of the obstacles to be overcome by Vale will be to rebuild the perception of the affected 
communities in relation to Vale, as well as of investors and national and international public opinion. 
In order for these relationships not to be further deteriorated, it is essential that the company 
complies with the delivery of housing and full compensation, anticipating the schedule whenever 
possible especially in cases with worrisome delays. We hope that the obsession, outlined as one of the 
company’s values, be converted into increased celerity not only in the reparation schedules, but also in 
the decharacterization plan, bringing forward the deadline currently set for 2035.

In the environmental sphere, the goal of recovering and protecting 500,000 hectares of forests 
demonstrates Vale’s commitment to leverage positive results beyond its fence lines. Helping the 
company to be a vehicle for value generation, not only for greenhouse gas mitigation, but also for 
fostering economically, sustainable socio-environmental impact. The company’s constant technological 
development and commitment to decarbonizing its value chains with customers downstream are 
positive indications that the company has assimilated its role in the global green transition and 
understands this to be a relevant, competitive factor for its business.

Finally, we urge Vale to deepen discussions regarding its presence in in the Amazon biome operating 
close to sensitive territories, providing more clear guidance on adopted positions for its operations 
that may negatively affect the environment, greater detail of engagement actions and actions 
undertaken to protect traditional peoples directly and indirectly affected by the company’s activity.

What do we expect for its 100th anniversary

Celebrating a century of life is an achievement especially in an economy as young and volatile as 
Brazil’s, but it’s a milestone that Vale could reach in two decades. However, the next 20 years will 
demand more agility and a change of attitude that was not required by the previous eight decades 
of its existence. The speed of technological transformation in the world, the climate urgency and the 

Peer Reviewers 

Integrated Report Vale 2022  81

Assurance GRI CreditsPresentation About Vale Discipline in capital allocation32 Solutions for the value chainSustainable Mining1 Peer Reviewers



increase in global awareness about planetary limits and social foundations are foundations 
for a desirable economy and will pose challenges urging companies born prior to green 
capitalism to adapt.

Vale resides in a complex ambivalence of having its main economic activity based on a sector 
with a high socio-environmental impact, but also highly necessary for making the transition 
to a green economy possible. This duality will demand coordination of efforts, technologies, 
policies and organizational culture above what is expected from other industries, whilst 
preserving a transition carried out with the least possible impact on current and future 
societies and on the ecosystems directly or indirectly affected by Vale’s activities.

What do we expect in the first centenary

Celebrating a century of life is a feat for companies in an economy as young and volatile as 
Brazil’s, but this is the destiny that Vale could reach in two decades. The next 20 years will, 
however, be much more agile and demand a change of attitude than the previous eight 
decades of its existence. The speed of technological transformation in the world, the climate 
urgency and the increase in global awareness about planetary limits and social foundations 
as protections of a desirable economy will pose challenges for the adaptation of companies 
born in the cycle prior to that of green capitalism.

What will Vale’s 2043 Integrated Report look like? Possibly it will be the one that investors and 
the company build together. The fiduciary duty presupposes the sharing of responsibilities 
between the financial market and the real economy, including the construction of futures for 
companies such as Vale and its representativeness for the global green economy. We hope 
that Vale will be able to overcome the challenges that are still present in the company today 
and that should be prioritized in the coming years: the recovery of trust from society and the 
financial market regarding the company’s ability to responsibly manage its operations, the 
capacity to serve its customers with adequate solutions to the demands of low carbon and 
high socio-environmental efficiency and the transition from a more isolated culture to an 
open organizational culture, connected to the stakeholders in its entirety.

Peer Reviewers 
R&A Strategic Communications was asked by Vale to support the company in by reviewing: the 
English translation of the report to ensure the understanding and applicability of language; and as 
a ‘peer’, tone, substance and structure of the Integrated Report.

In our review we considered Vale’s 2022 Integrated Annual Report against the guiding principles of 
the Integrated Reporting Framework, now part of the IFRS Foundation, as well as the principles of 
the GRI Reporting Framework (GRI Standards). 

Our foremost observation is that Vale has sought to develop a report that is both comprehensive 
and balanced and reports on the company’s performance today, as well as its future intentions. 
The report is concise and accessible.

That Vale has adopted integrated reporting is a clear reflection of its desire to account for its value 
creation journey and should be commended. In its adoption of double materiality Vale accounts to 
society on a broad range of environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts.

The report’s structure is aligned with the company’s strategy and demonstrates the integration of 
ESG in the business.

The role and perceptions of the company’s primary stakeholders have been considered in the 
materiality assessment: why and how engagements took place, stakeholders’ main concerns are 
documented, and there is a consistent reference to stakeholders’ interests and expectations 
throughout the report.

A great deal of focus is placed on the company’s accountability for and actions following the 
tailings dam failures at Bento Rodrigues and Brumadinho. This reporting is strikingly reflective 
and compassionate, with a focus on reparations to the people and communities affected by 
these tragedies, the environmental ‘clean up’, and efforts by the company to instill best practice 
risk management and governance in tailings management, to ensure that these events are never 
repeated.

Also notable is the reporting on Vale’s approach to climate change, and how the opportunities 
offered by the transition to a low carbon business will ensure its long-term sustainability. The 

Integrated Report Vale 2022  82

Assurance GRI CreditsPresentation About Vale Discipline in capital allocation32 Solutions for the value chainSustainable Mining1 Peer Reviewers



company recognizes that its operations are located in areas of high biodiversity value,  
and that it needs to earn and maintain its social license to operate. 

Finally, the review of certain reporting parameters by an independent auditor points  
to the reliability of the information and data.

Our assessment is that Vale has broadly met the principles of both integrated and  
sustainability reporting. 

Considerations for the future

Our recommendations for future reporting are: 

• Greater focus (as the primary report to shareholders/stakeholders) on what Vale does, why 
it does it, how it does it, and who is driving what it does, as well as the context in which it 
operates. This would be well supported by the inclusion of a value-added statement.

• Vale provides a clear picture up front of the scale and footprint of the business and its value 
chain, in addition to a detailed business model that clearly demonstrates the value creation 
journey, including inputs, outputs and impacts. Setting the scene up front helps to illustrate the 
connectivity of information, which could be further supported by clear sign-posting throughout 
the report to the capitals, material issues and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 

• Demonstrating the external operating environment faced by the company and how the 
company has responded – including an assessment of primary markets and products. 

• Elaborating on Board composition (including committees), member roles, accountabilities  
and executive remuneration, as well as some of the key decisions taken by the board pertaining 
to value creation, preservation and erosion. 

• Including more details about executive leadership – who they are, what they do, their 
competencies and how they fulfill their roles.

• In addition to the business model, elaborating on all of the capitals throughout this report. 
This report intentionally concentrates on human capital, social and relationship capital and 

natural capital, but as an integrated report we believe that matters relating to the financial, 
manufactured and intellectual capitals should be incorporated to ensure the report is complete .

• Also, indicating of the trade-offs made between the capitals.

• The materiality process appears to be thorough and valuable. It would help to include more 
detail on each issue, and how and why it presents a risk or opportunity throughout the report 
with some level of prioritization of material matters as the basis of its approach . 

• Further disclosure regarding the risk management process and principal risks and opportunities 
would add value.

• The company’s approach and contribution to the UN SDGs could be better highlighted

Other observations:

• Vale has an opportunity to provide more information on all the jurisdictions in which it operates, 
most notably Canada and Indonesia. 

• While the company’s focus on its decarbonization strategy is clear, we would recommend 
additional focus on how the company is addressing climate change resilience and adaptation, 
including for communities.

• The report would benefit from a clearer identification of targets and goals and performance 
against them, particularly a demonstration of trends through the addition of graphs.

Assurance report

Introduction 
We have been engaged by Vale S.A. (“Company” or “Vale”) to present our limited assurance report on 
the non-financial information included in the 2022 Integrated Report of Vale and certain selected 
information from the attachment Databook ESG 2022 (hereinafter collectively referred to as “2022 
Integrated Report”) for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Our limited assurance does not cover prior-period information, or any other information disclosed 
together with the 2022 Integrated Report, including any images, audio files or videos. 

Responsibility of Vale’s management 
The management of Vale is responsible for: 

• selecting or establishing adequate criteria for the preparation and presentation of the information 
included in the 2022 Integrated Report;

• preparing the information in accordance with the criteria and guidelines of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI - Standards), with the basis of preparation developed by the Company, and with 
Guidance CPC 09 - Integrated Reporting, issued by the Federal Accounting Council (CFC), equivalent 
to the Basic Conceptual Framework for Integrated Reporting, prepared by the International 
Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC); and

• designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over the significant information for the 
preparation of the information included in the 2022 Integrated Report, which is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Independent auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the non-financial information included in the 2022 
Integrated Report and certain selected information from the attachment Databook ESG, based  
on our limited assurance engagement carried out in accordance with the Technical Communication 
CTO 01, “Issuance of an Assurance Report related to Sustainability and Social Responsibility”, issued 
by the Federal Accounting Council (CFC), based on the Brazilian standard NBC TO 3000, “Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audit and Review”, also issued by the CFC, which is equivalent to the 
international standard ISAE 3000, “Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical 
financial information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). 
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements, including independence 
requirements, and other responsibilities of these standards, including those regarding the 
application of the Brazilian Quality Control Standard (NBC PA 01) and, therefore, the maintenance  
of a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures on  
the compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and relevant legal and  
regulatory requirements. 

Moreover, the aforementioned standards require that the work be planned and performed to  
obtain limited assurance that the non-financial information included in the 2022 Integrated Report, 
taken as a whole, is free from material misstatement. 

A limited assurance engagement conducted in accordance with the Brazilian standard NBC TO 3000 
and ISAE 3000 mainly consists of making inquiries of management and other professionals of Vale 
involved in the preparation of the information, as well as applying analytical procedures to obtain 
evidence that allows us to issue a limited assurance conclusion on the information, taken as a whole. 
A limited assurance engagement also requires the performance of additional procedures when 
the independent auditor becomes aware of matters that lead him to believe that the information 
disclosed in the Integrated Report taken as a whole might present significant misstatements. 

The procedures selected are based on our understanding of the aspects related to the compilation, 
materiality, and presentation of the information included in the 2022 Integrated Report, other 
circumstances of the engagement and our analysis of the activities and processes associated 
with the significant information disclosed in the 2022 Integrated Report in which significant 
misstatements might exist. The procedures comprised, among others:

(a) planning the work, taking into consideration the materiality and the volume of quantitative 
and qualitative information and the operating and internal control systems that were used  
to prepare the information included in the 2022 Integrated Report;

(b) understanding the calculation methodology and the procedures adopted for the compilation 
of indicators through inquiries of the managers responsible for the preparation of the 
information; 

(c) applying analytical procedures to quantitative information and making inquiries regarding  
the qualitative information and its correlation with the indicators disclosed in the 2022 
Integrated Report; and 

(d) when non-financial data relate to financial indicators, comparing these indicators with  
the financial statements and/or accounting records. 

The limited assurance engagement also included the analysis of the compliance with the guidelines 
and criteria 1) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI - Standards); 2) the provisions established in 
the basis of preparation developed by the Company; 3) the principles for the Integrated Reporting, 
pursuant to Guidance CPC 09 - Integrated Reporting, related to the Basic Conceptual Framework for 
Integrated Reporting, prepared by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) applicable in 
the preparation of the information included in the 2022 Integrated Report.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
limited assurance conclusion. 

Scope and limitations 
The procedures applied in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing, and are less 
detailed than those applied in a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of 
assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the level that 
would be obtained in a reasonable assurance engagement. If we had performed a reasonable 
assurance engagement, we might have identified other matters and possible misstatements  
in the information included in the 2022 Integrated Report. Therefore, we do not express an  
opinion on this information. 

Non-financial data are subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, due to the nature 
and diversity of the methods used to determine, calculate and estimate these data. Qualitative 
interpretations of the relevance, materiality, and accuracy of the data are subject to individual 
assumptions and judgments. Furthermore, we did not consider in our engagement the data reported 
for prior periods, nor future projections and goals.

The preparation and presentation of non-financial information and indicators followed the definitions 
of the basis of preparation developed by the Company and the guidelines of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI - Standards) and, therefore, the information included in the 2022 Integrated Report 
does not the objective of providing assurance with regard to the compliance with social, economic, 
environmental or engineering laws and regulations. However, the aforementioned standards establish 
the presentation and disclosure of possible cases of non-compliance with such regulations when 
sanctions or significant fines are applied. Our assurance report should be read and understood in this 
context, inherent to the criteria selected and previously mentioned in this paragraph. 

Conclusion 
Based on the procedures described above and on evidence obtained, no matter has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the non-financial information included in the Integrated 
Report for the year ended December 31, 2022 of Vale S.A. has not been prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the criteria and guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
(GRI-Standards), with the basis of preparation developed by the Company, and with the Guidance  
CPC 09 - Integrated Reporting
