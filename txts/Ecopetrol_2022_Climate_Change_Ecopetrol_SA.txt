Ecopetrol S.A. - Climate Change 2022

C0. Introduction

C0.1

(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.

Ecopetrol Group is the largest company in Colombia and one of the most relevant integrated energy companies in Latin America, that participates in all segments of the
hydrocarbon chain (exploration, production, midstream, downstream, and commercialization) and in the linear infrastructure, both in energy transmission as well as toll road
concessions, with the prospect of potentially continuing to diversify into businesses that allow to continue reducing its carbon footprint. 

Ecopetrol has presence primarily in Colombia and activities in the U.S. (U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Permian Basin), Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Chile and Bolivia. In Colombia, it is
responsible for more than 60% of the hydrocarbon production, transportation, logistics, and hydrocarbon refining systems, and hold a leading position in the petrochemicals
and gas distribution segment. In 2021 Ecopetrol acquired Interconexión Eléctrica S.A. ESP, the leading energy transition group in the Western Hemisphere, effectively
diversifying its EBITDA from the hydrocarbon sector. Through ISA Ecopetrol also has operations in the electricity transmission, road concessions and information
communications technology business in Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Central America.

Ecopetrol’s shares are listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange (BVC) and its ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Ecopetrol S.A. is a public limited company. The Republic of Colombia is the majority shareholder, with an 88.49% interest in the company.

Ecopetrol’s Colombian operation includes two refineries, one in Barrancabermeja and one in Cartagena, four ports for the export and import of fuels and crude oil in Coveñas,
Cartagena and Santa Marta, on the Caribbean Sea, and in Tumaco on the Pacific Ocean. The company also owns most of the country’s pipelines and polyducts that connect
production systems with large consumption centers and maritime terminals.

The significant colombian subsidiaries are Refinería de Cartagena S.A.S. (Reficar or Cartagena Refinery), Cenit Transporte y Logística de Hidrocarburos S.A.S. (Cenit),
Oleoducto Central S.A. (Ocensa) and Interconexión Eléctrica S.A. E.S.P (ISA).  

Ecopetrol’s 2040 Corporate Strategy has four pillars:

1. Growing with the energy transition - This sets the stage for growth and value generation in Ecopetrol Group in line with the new demands of the energy transition and of the
environment. The two (2) purposes of this pillar are to maximize reserves and the production value while diversifying the Group's portfolio in energy and low emission
businesses, aligning itself with the Company’s climate efforts. 

2. Generating value with TESG (technology, environment, social, and governance) - This responds to socio-environmental challenges and the need to achieve sustainable
operations while recognizing and working hand in hand with stakeholders. The Company’s material issues are a key component of this pillar, including Climate Change, which
has been identified as an exceptional issue in the Company’s materiality exercise. 

3. Competitive returns - This ensures the growth and value generation of Ecopetrol Group, even in low price environments, by focusing on the hydrocarbons’ core and
sustainable businesses.

4. Cutting-edge knowledge - This includes all efforts to attract, develop, and retain talent, as well as the development of a comprehensive science, technology, and innovation
(CT+I) strategy. In a cross-cutting way, it also adapts the organization of Ecopetrol Group by implementing digitization processes and adopting agility and innovation. The
Company’s efforts to minimize the potential impact of the decarbonization of its operations on its workforce are included in this pillar.

The Board is responsible for monitoring and approving the Corporate Strategy. In 2021, the Board approved the 2040 Strategy and the 2022-2024 Business Plan (BP). The
Strategy has four (4) pillars, the first two (2) are growing with the energy transition and generating value with TESG. These provide the necessary elements to face the risks
and opportunities related to climate change. Topics related to the energy transition and decarbonization were included as part of the annual planning and budgeting, the
BP, and performance objectives. The BP now includes the cost of GHG emissions, by using an internal carbon price currently set at USD 20 per tonne of CO2 to evaluate
new projects. Nearly 63 MUSD will be invested in Ecopetrol’s decarbonization agenda in 2022, including energy efficiency, new competitive renewable energy and gas
utilization projects that are part of the Roadmap to advance towards the goal of reducing 25% of CO2e emissions generated by the operations by 2030 and becoming a
net-zero emissions company by 2050 for Scopes 1 and 2. The BP also includes investments of more than 200 MUSD in water management projects, nearly 30 MUSD in
fuel quality improvement projects, and 6 MUSD in the development of pilot projects and green and blue hydrogen studies.

On the other hand, the Risk and Audit Committee oversees the company's risks, including matters related to climate change. It met 12 times in 2021, with a regulated
minimum of eight (8) meetings a year. The current Business Risk Map includes "Inadequate management of climate change and water".

As for performance objectives, the BoD also reviewed and approved the Group’s 2022-2024 Balanced Scorecard (TBG) and monitored performance of the 2020-2022 and
2021-2023 TBGs. The TBG is used to set and monitor performance in relation to the Company's targets and it has an impact on variable compensation of employees. The
2021 TBG provided a 55% relevance weight to sustainability metrics. Moreover, the BoD monitors and oversees progress against goals to address climate-related issues
through its Committees: (i) Corporate Governance and Sustainability: it supports the analysis and decision-making related to the adoption of best practices on sustainability.
It held 7 sessions during 2021. (ii) HSE: it monitors the Company's decarbonization plan, which includes the approval of specific strategies to meet emission reduction goals.
It met 3 times during 2021 and analyzed matters such as neutrality carbon emissions and circular economy. (iii) Technology and Innovation: it held 3 sessions, reviewed the
advances on the technology and innovation program, including the technology roadmap for decarbonization. (iv) Compensation, Nomination and Culture: it held 8 sessions,
some of which were focused on monitoring performance of the TBG and the variable compensation of employees, which is partly determined by the TBG.

implement cost-effective opportunities to contribute to the GHG emission reduction goals.

Medium-
term

4 10 The medium-term horizon is used to review both the GHG emission reduction and offset targets for 2030, in accordance with the company's Decarbonization Plan. This horizon also
allows the identification of emerging risks that will impact the company in the next 5 years.

Long-
term

10 The long-term horizon is used to review market trends, policy and regulatory changes, and emerging technology developments that may impact the company's climate ambition and long-
term business strategy (2040).

C2.1b

(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?

  

The definition of a substantial financial or strategic impact for the company is determined by the level of risk or materiality of the element with impact on Ecopetrol and its
value chain. In relation to the level of risk, the Company applies the business risk cycle based on the COSO 2017 ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) framework to identify,
assess, and manage its business risks. In 2021 the Corporate Risk Map was updated, identifying 15 corporate risks (for detailed information: i) see page 169 of the 2021
Integrated Sustainable Management Report, and ii) Ecopetrol´s webpage: https://saaeuecpprdpecp.blob.core.windows.net/web/esp/cargas/business-risk-map.pdf) which was
approved by the Board of Directors. The climate-related risk was defined as "Inadequate management of climate change and water". 

Risks are evaluated in terms of their probability of occurrence and their impact dimensions, in accordance with the procedure established in the company's risk assessment
matrix (RAM). The dimensions of the impact are measured in terms of the level of impact on the following components:

The health of people, the environment, economic resources, reputation, and customers. The impact assessment levels can be: Insignificant (1), Minor (2), Moderate (3),
Major (4), and Catastrophic (5), which are determined through specific impact conditions in each component assessed. From the perspective of the strategic impact, the
following dimensions are considered: health of people, impact on the environment, reputation, and customers, and from the financial impact perspective, the following levels
are considered, valued at losses for the company: Catastrophic (> US$150M), Major (US$50M - US$150M), Moderate (US$10M-US$50M) Minor (US$1M-US$10M), and
Insignificant (<US$1M).

In 2021, the risk “Inadequate management of climate change and water” assessed the following scenarios to determine the strategic and financial impact level:

Scenario 1 (strategic impact by reputation dimension): Failure to implement the Decarbonization Plan that fails to reduce the goal set for 2030 (25% of scopes 1 and 2),
resulting in the company’s image and brand damage, lack of credibility by stakeholders, and loss of share value.

Scenario 2 (financial impact): Production is affected by water discharge restrictions in the Castilla, Apiay, and Suria production fields for 30 days per year, due to a decrease
in water flows in the dry season, with a financial impact between US$50 – 150 M, calculated of barrels of oil deferred.

Scenario 3 (financial impact): Water is limited for refineries operation (freshwater), with a financial impact between US$50 - 150 M.

These results have allowed establishing short and medium-term actions to reduce impacts on the company.

Description of process
The process for identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related risks is part of our Integrated Risk Management System (IRMS). Risk management, monitoring,
and assurance are carried out permanently to keep the risks within the defined tolerance and acceptance levels. This information is reported to the Executive Committee
and to the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee. Under the leadership of the Vice-Presidency of Compliance, in 2021 Ecopetrol continued to strengthen its IRMS based on
the international technical standard ISO 31000 and COSO ERM 2017 framework.
This establishes a set of principles, reference frame, and process that allow the organization to manage the effects of uncertainty on meeting objectives, to maximize
opportunities, and to assist in establishing strategies and making informed decisions. Three of the most important tools within the risk management approach are: i) the risk
assessment methodology to define the risk levels based on the impact and probability of occurrence; ii) mitigation plans to reduce the exposure levels; and (iii) monitoring
Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to provide early signals of increased risk exposure. Ecopetrol’s risks can be classified as:
-Business Risks: Directly associated with the Company's strategic business plan and are systematically monitored by the Executive Committee. For Ecopetrol, these can
divert the company from achieving its strategy and strategic objectives. These risks are identified through the Business Risk Management Cycle, which include the following
stages: Plan, Identify, Assess, Treat, Communicate and Consult, Monitor and Review, and Record and Report. The construction and updating of this risk map is done
collectively, based on the analysis of the internal and external environments, considering market trends, specific risks of Ecopetrol’s Group of companies, business
standards, benchmarks and industry risks that are normally subject to analysis and review of sustainability indexes and radars. In the definition of these risks, an analysis of
the internal and external environments is performed to determine the issues and trends that may have a potential or real impact on the Company’s strategy.
-Emerging risks are selected from these trends, confirmed by the Executive Committee, and presented to the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, which
reviews them and recommends their approval to the Board. The evaluation of emerging risks allows Ecopetrol to prioritize them and determine the appropriate risk treatment
plans. Ecopetrol evaluates each potential risk and defines the treatment plan for each emerging risks which include the following: i) New business risk; ii) Incorporation into
existing business risk; iii) Continuous monitoring of emerging risks; or iv) Abandonment of emerging risk. For 2021 the top two emerging risks were selected based on the
criteria of potential impact and speed of emergence: i) Acceleration in the race to Net-Zero and ii) Technology-enabled Natural Capital Solutions (see:
https://www.ecopetrol.com.co/wps/portal/Home/en/Ourcompany/about-us/risk-management.)
-Processes Risks: Risks related to potential failures in the activities regarding the core and support business processes that drive Ecopetrol to achieve its objectives.
-Operational Risks: Risks that are at an operational scale and occur in Ecopetrol’s day-to-day activities and tasks. The risks are also identified through the business Risk
management cycle.
The risks are identified through the Business Risk management cycle, which includes the stages of Planning, Identification, Evaluation, Treatment, Communication and
consultation, Monitoring and review, and Registration and Reporting. In 2021, Ecopetrol updated the scenarios of Business risk “Inadequate management of climate change
and water”. In relation to its treatment, monitoring, and reporting, Ecopetrol established 12 treatment actions, 10 controls, and 5 KRI to reduce the materialization probability.
Related to physical risk scenarios, Ecopetrol assesses the following case study using the STAR methodology: 
Situation: the “El Niño” phenomenon occurred, which implies less precipitation, this phenomenon coincided with the country's dry season, increasing the risk of water
shortages that could affect operations. This climate variability phenomenon is more frequent and intense.
Task: Within the framework of the business risk "Inadequate management against climate change and water" the potential scenario was evaluated, resulting in a high
financial impact.
Action: A treatment action was established to reduce the risk of operational interruption associated with water management.
Result: if the action to mitigate the risk is not implemented, its materialization could cost around USM 150.
For the process of identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related opportunities, as part of the company strategy process, Ecopetrol keeps track and assesses the
energy market and business environment. After identifying meaningful changes in that environment, the group updates its Energy Transition Scenarios and, in that analysis,
lines of actions are defined including opportunities and implications for Ecopetrol and a roadmap to run in-deep analysis of the opportunities. The steps for the process are:
1. Energy Transition scenarios are updated with the current global and local trends (ex. Industry, macroeconomic, and technology trends). As a result, the variables (ex.
Primary energy demand, oil and gas demand, emissions projection) for each scenario are updated.
2. Ecopetrol identifies and analyses the driver that is showing a positive trend or perspective in the updated scenarios for the short, medium, and long-term. With this
analysis a set of potential opportunities are identified.
3. Ecopetrol calculates the size of the market or the opportunity establishing the capabilities or competitive position of the Company with the interest to capture and the
construction of a business plan to evaluate the feasibility.
4. Finally, the roadmap to develop the feasible opportunities is constructed based on the previous Energy transition Scenarios. Ecopetrol is currently analyzing 3 types of
diversification opportunities: within the Oil & Gas value chain, in the electricity value chain, and in low-emission businesses (Hydrogen, Carbon Capture, Use & Storage, and
Natural Climate Solutions).
Related to opportunity transition, Ecopetrol assesses the following case study using the STAR methodology: 
Situation: Derived from the update of the investment portfolio for decarbonization, the development of hydrogen was identified as an opportunity.
Task: this opportunity had a rigorous analysis of technical and economic feasibility.
Action: the economic and financial evaluation of the opportunity was carried out.
Result: structuring of hydrogen roadmap implementation, which resulted in a low-carbon business opportunity, with an EBIDTA of USD 2,4 billion accumulated by 2030.

Current
regulation

Relevant,
always
included

Risk: regulatory changes or restrictive regulatory measures derived from legislation related to climate change.
Our operations might be affected by rising climate change and energy transition regulatory developments. The increase in global temperature due to the substantial increase of GHG
emissions is a concern worldwide. The Paris Agreement calls for immediate and forceful actions to be taken to limit the increase of global temperature below 1.5°C. In response,
government agendas have increasingly been defining normative and regulatory frameworks that determine local actions related to climate change. As a result, companies are increasingly
subject to regulatory risks and public policy changes related to climate change.
Colombia has binding regulatory measures that address air and fuel quality. Also, Ecopetrol has identified the following current regulatory changes, which may have a financial or strategic
impact on the company:
- Mitigation and adaptation information requirements in current and future licensing processes, by the National Environmental Licensing Authority (ANLA, for its Spanish acronym), which
may limit obtaining environmental licenses for the company.
- Increased monitoring on the implementation of actions for compliance with regulations related to the management of fugitive emissions and venting, to contribute to compliance with
national, sectoral, and corporate goals.
- Modifications to the regulations associated with the carbon tax and the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification System for mitigation actions carried out by the company, which establish
new requirements for the validation and verification of reduction projects and their registration in the National Registry of GHG Emission Reductions (RENARE, for its Spanish acronym).
- New regulations for the detection and repair of leaks, exploitation, flaring and venting of natural gas during hydrocarbon exploration and production activities, which establish requirements
for the company. 
- In December 2021, the Financial Superintendency of Colombia (SFC, for its Spanish acronym) issued instructions to the Legal Representatives and Statutory Auditors of Issuers
regarding the disclosure of information on social and environmental matters, including climate issues. The above, with the purpose of standardizing and improving the relevance of the
information on sustainability practices for investors and strengthening its disclosure by issuers, under a perspective of financial materiality.

Emerging
regulation

Relevant,
always
included

Risk: Limited capacity or availability of data for Ecopetrol to adequately respond to or anticipate new regulations that impose GHG emissions or climate-related requirements.

The Company's Climate Action Plan includes a component related to Participation in Public Policies and Regulatory Processes, in which regulatory changes associated with climate change
are permanently monitored. We participate in open discussions of public policies and regulations, mainly with the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and the Ministry of
Mines and Energy.
As a result of this monitoring process, Ecopetrol has identified the following emerging regulations:
- Implementation of the National Cap & Trade System (PNCTE, for its Spanish acronym), similar to an Emissions Trading System, in which emission rights would be assigned. This
program is in the design and development phase of the regulatory framework and is expected to start in 2025, with full implementation in 2030. Ecopetrol's inclusion in the program would
have a significant financial impact, which will require aligning the company's current climate ambition.
- Possible restrictions on voluntary offsetting of GHG emissions for exploration, upstream and downstream activities, to promote and accelerate the development of mitigation actions in the
company's value chain.
- New rules proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for publicly traded companies to disclose specific information on their financial exposure to climate risk and
strategies to address it in their registration statements and periodic publications.
- Article 221 Law 1819 /2016: Adjustment in terms of tariffs and fossil fuels taxed under the carbon tax.

Technology Relevant,
always
included

Ecopetrol’s future performance depends on the successful selection, development, and deployment of new technologies and the necessary capabilities to operate, maintain, and improve
them.
Technology, knowledge, and innovation are essential to its business, especially for the addition of reserves in complex settings, for reducing operational costs, for reducing the carbon
footprint and for adapting to the energy transition in general. If Ecopetrol does not develop or secure access to the right technology, or if it fails to deploy it or obtain the expertise to operate
it, the attainment of the company´s corporate goals, profitability, and earnings can be jeopardized. Furthermore, as Ecopetrol transitions to a new low carbon economy and addresses
climate change related issues, it faces the risk of affecting key financial indicators due to high cost of low-carbon technologies.
In addition, the company’s performance could be negatively affected by the lack of workforce with the skills needed to execute the business strategy. As the oil and gas industry faces an
increasing number of challenges, the ability to react quickly to these challenges has become a key factor in achieving efficiency, profitability, growth, and sustainability. This situation poses
a risk if Ecopetrol is unable to timely strengthen its workforce capacities at all levels of the organization and develop the skills needed to find the solutions and implement climate-resilient
initiatives and achieve the decarbonization goals.

Legal Relevant,
always
included

Risk: Inability to react in a timely manner to the demands and requirements of interested parties derived from climate change issues.

Our operations could be affected by reactions of labour unions, social organizations, communities and contractors to Colombia’s political and social context, environmental and climate
change concerns, and organizational changes. Due to Colombia’s political and social context, emerging environmental and climate change concerns and organizational changes, social
organizations in the communities in the areas of operation, communities in general, contractors and unions, may react and make additional demands that can potentially affect the
Company's operations and financial condition.
However, the Company has a permanent interaction scheme with its stakeholders, which allows it to meet the requirements in a timely manner. Likewise, issues related to climate change
are publicly disclosed on the website and in the Annual Integrated Report available to the public, among other public platforms, to ensure that we continuously communicate our efforts on
climate change to a wide range of stakeholders.
In relation to other requirements derived from current legislation related to local licenses and permits, Ecopetrol uses the Environmental Legal Compliance System (SICLASST), a SAP
module, which allows the Company to manage all environmental requirements, including those related to climate change.

Market Relevant,
always
included

Risk: preference in the use of low-carbon products in the framework of the energy transition

The company constantly monitors the evolution and trends of the market in relation to the performance and use of low-carbon products, considering, among other variables, the progress in
defining the country's carbon neutrality strategy for 2050, which implies the analysis and market behaviour in relation to the trend in energy use. Here one of the key issues is the
participation of natural gas, especially to meet the needs of domestic demand.

The foregoing is considered for the evaluation of the Company's energy transition scenarios, which seek to define the diversification portfolio in the medium and long terms, identifying new
opportunities in the electricity value chain, specifically in the transmission lines markets. Also, in other potential low-carbon businesses such as green hydrogen and carbon capture, use
and storage (CCUS).

However, while a market for cost-effective low-carbon products is consolidating, the energy transition advances considering energy sources with less carbon intensity. In this context,
Ecopetrol considers natural gas as a transition energy source nationwide, with an expansion strategy aligned with the carbon neutrality of the country and the Company.

In 2021, Ecopetrol acquired 51.4% of the outstanding shares of ISA from the Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público (Ministry of the Treasury and Public Credit, MHCP for its Spanish
acronym), through which it is expected to reposition the company along the energy value chain by offering services such as electricity transmission and aligning it with the market trends
towards decarbonization and electrification.

Likewise, the Company is moving towards a low-carbon operation, with the development of a portfolio in renewable energies, energy efficiency, and the evaluation of technological options
such as Hydrogen, in line with the company's energy transition plan and long-term corporate strategy (2040).

Reputation Relevant,
always
included

Risk: Increased pressure from investors to set ambitious goals on climate change.

Ecopetrol constantly conducts benchmarking analysis to compare and challenge its own objectives, action plans and general ambitions against the frontrunners in the industry and other
sectors as well, in order to avoid falling behind in this area in the face of reputational risk.
In 2021, the company made progress in updating its ambition of reducing emissions in the medium and long terms. To ensure compliance with GHG emissions targets and avoid a
reputational risk, Ecopetrol closely monitors progress on its Decarbonization Plan, the GHG emissions inventory is permanently updated as well as the portfolio of reduction and
compensation projects.
Likewise, Ecopetrol is part of leading global initiatives that promote structural changes in the oil and gas sector related to GHG emissions reductions, such as the Clean Air and Climate
Coalition a UN led initiative and the Zero Routine Flaring initiative (ZRF) of the World Bank, which helps the Company align with the highest international standards.

Acute
physical

Relevant,
always
included

Risk: Increased intensity and frequency of climate variability (water shortages, floods, forest fires, storms and hurricanes, and mass movements).

Ecopetrol has a KPI to monitor the probability of occurrence of extreme weather events based on monthly alerts, which are issued by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and
Environmental Studies of Colombia (IDEAM for its Spanish acronym). As previously mentioned in this report, this KPI is one of the 15 Company risks included in Ecopetrol’s 2021 Business
Risk Map.

These monthly alerts are related to the possible occurrence of El Niño and La Niña phenomena, which trigger the implementation of an action plan when an occurrence probability exceeds
80%.

This risk could result in fatalities, property damage, project delays, production deferrals, loss of revenue, pollution, and harm to the environment, damaged roads as well as
temporary disruptions to Ecopetrol’s services, among others. If any of these occur, the Company may be exposed to economic sanctions, damages, fines, or penalties in
addition to the negative effects these events may have on our operations and the costs required to repair or remediate the related damage. These costs, fines and penalties
may adversely affect Ecopetrol’s financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.
For the management of physical risks associated with variability and climate change in Ecopetrol, the Company defined the risk of “Inadequate management of climate
change and water” as part of the business risk map. Attention to this risk includes monitoring the probability of occurrence of extreme climatic events from the monthly alerts
issued by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia (IDEAM), on the possible presence of the “El Niño” and “La Niña” climatic
variability phenomena, activating an action plan at the company level in the event of a probability of occurrence greater than 80% of any climatic phenomenon. Additionally,

Explain why your organization does not have a transition plan that aligns with a 1.5°C world and any plans to develop one in the future
Since 2018, Ecopetrol Group has been developing energy transition scenarios as an input to the Company’s business strategy. In 2020, the company developed two (2)
scenarios and two (2) sensitivities, in which it considered the following: i) Reference scenario: Includes technological expectations (proved and the ones with the highest
development investment), demand (observable and foreseeable trends) and regulatory patterns (existent and those necessary to stimulate technological adoption) ii)
Accelerated transition scenario: highest energy efficiency and penetration of renewable energy due to tighter regulation in terms of emissions and cost reduction in parallel
with greener consumption patterns and new technological developments. iii) Decelerated sensitivity: considers a slower transition due to economic issues which translates
in reprioritization of policies and regulations towards more economy-driven measures vs emissions. iv) 2°C sensitivity: considers radical changes in consumption,
regulation, and technology to achieve decarbonization and global warming goal of 2°C.

In 2022 Ecopetrol is updating its scenario analysis taking the 1.5°C scenario as a reference, to better understand the alignment between the current decarbonization plan
and the 2040 corporate strategy with a 1.5°C world. If needed, the Company expects to make the necessary adjustments to its climate targets as part of the five-year review
cycle announced when the net zero ambition was launched.

Ecopetrol carried out a physical risk analysis that considered a RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) 6.0 scenario in accordance with the Colombian
Energy and Mines sector plan and the Third National Communication on Climate Change. The third communication uses a reference scenario based on the period
1976 and 2005, considering the CMIP5 global model, temperature variables (minimum, average, and maximum), precipitation on a monthly scale, and data from the
country’s meteorological stations. Considering that the temperature changes measured between the 4 RCPs are similar, the country developed a multi-model
ensemble to generate a future climate scenario, which was used for Ecopetrol’s analysis.
According to the results of the multi-model ensemble, Colombia’s average temperatures, between 2011 and 2040, are expected to increase in 1.0ºC approximately
for the 4 RCPs. The periods 2041-2070, and 2071-2100 were not considered for this sensitivity analysis, considering that the information is based on the 4RCPs
multi-model ensemble, and the differences are not substantial. Besides, Ecopetrol’s long-term period has been defined as 2040.
Ecopetrol bases its physical risks analysis on the RCP 6.0 scenario and considers all the areas where there is current and future operation. Additionally, the
Company incorporates the following variables, to identify the impact on the infrastructure and operations in the long term: Natural threats (floods, mass movements,
forest fires, and water scarcity) that can increase climate risk in a 2040 horizon and increase the assets adaptation costs, production level, and water required for
production.

Transition
scenarios

Bespoke
transition
scenario

Country/area 2.1ºC - 3ºC Ecopetrol Group has been developing energy transition scenarios as an input to the Company’s corporate strategy. In 2020, the company developed two (2)
scenarios and two (2) sensitivities in which it considered the following: (i) Reference Scenario: Included technological expectations (proved as well as those with the
highest development investment), demand (observable and foreseeable trends), and regulatory patterns (existent and those necessary to stimulate technological
adoption), (ii) Accelerated Transition Scenario: Highest energy efficiency and penetration of renewable energy due to tighter regulation in terms of emissions and
cost reduction in parallel with greener consumption patterns and new technological developments, (iii) Decelerated Sensitivity: Considers a slower transition due to
economic issues which translate into a reprioritization of policies and regulations towards more economic-driven measures shifting away from prioritizing emissions,
and (iv) 2°C Sensitivity: Considers radical changes in consumption, regulation, and technology to achieve decarbonization and the global warming goal of 2°C.
Trends from those scenarios and sensitivities were translated into business scenarios in 2021, which were used as an input for the development of Ecopetrol
Group’s long-term (2040) business strategy published in the 2022 first quarter. The three business scenarios that resulted are: (i) Reference Scenario: Considers the
same trends identified under the Reference Scenario of Energy Transition, which is also the base scenario for the Company´s 2040 corporate strategy, (ii) High-Price
Scenario: Linked to the Decelerated Sensitivity trends, and (iii) Stress Test Scenario: reflects the trends of the Accelerated Transition Scenario and some evolutions
of the 2°C Sensitivity.
To define its 2040 corporate strategy, Ecopetrol used its scenarios and applied some sensitivity variables to them. These sensitivities included i) Ecopetrol’s GHG
emissions projection, ii) national demand energy, and iii) global demand energy. The scenario analysis resulted in a long-term strategy focused on growing with the
energy transition, with a robust decarbonization roadmap, and TESG (technology at the heart of sustainability) as some of its key drivers.

C3.2b

(C3.2b) Provide details of the focal questions your organization seeks to address by using climate-related scenario analysis, and summarize the results with
respect to these questions.

Row 1

Focal questions
What climate-related forces and developments have the greatest ability to shape our future performance? What is their likely timing and potential impact?
What variables are needed to support decision-making?
Which variables have the greatest impact in our current business model?
What new opportunities do climate-related forces and developments come with?
Having two scenarios and two sensitivities allowed us to better understand the different levels of energy transition, which in turn gave Ecopetrol Group a broad vision on
what where the key variables on each scenario and how each variable could react.

Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
As a result of the scenarios and sensitivities of the energy transition, Ecopetrol Group established a clear course of action to build resilience. The six (6) prioritized fronts
were: i) define a strategy for decarbonization, energy efficiency, and fuel quality, ii) ensure the competitiveness of the traditional oil and gas business to avoid stranded
assets, iii) formulate a comprehensive vision of gas, iv) capture opportunities in the energy markets, v) review the petrochemical business and vi) explore diversification
options in other businesses.
Likewise, the trends of the scenarios and sensitivities were translated into business scenarios in 2021, which served as input for the development of the long-term corporate
strategy (2040) of Ecopetrol Group published in the first quarter of 2022. The three (3) business scenarios that resulted are:
(i) Reference Scenario: Considers the same trends identified in the Energy Transition Reference Scenario, which is also the base scenario of the Company's 2040
corporate strategy.
(ii) High Price Scenario: Linked to Decelerating Sensitivity trends.
(iii) Stress Test Scenario: reflects the trends of the Accelerated Transition Scenario and some evolutions of the 2°C Sensitivity.
To define its 2040 corporate strategy, Ecopetrol used its scenarios and applied some sensitivity variables to them. These sensitivities included i) Ecopetrol's GHG emissions
projection, ii) national energy demand, and iii) global energy demand. The scenario analysis resulted in a long-term strategy focused on growing with the energy transition,
with a strong decarbonisation roadmap and TESG (technology at the heart of sustainability) as some of its key drivers. Similarly, the physical climate scenarios used by the
company to identify risks and opportunities have made it possible to establish the exposure and vulnerability of assets to threats arising from changes in extreme weather,
establishing adaptation measures to increase the response capacity, and minimize the impacts derived from climate change.
However, the company is aware of the need to elevate these analyses with scenarios validated by science, which consider related climate-change variables and allow for an
update of its own scenarios, in order to have a better understanding and alignment of Ecopetrol's climate ambition with the Paris Agreement.

Yes The evolution in the transition scenarios analysis developed by Ecopetrol contributed to establishing a long-term strategy focused on growing with the energy transition, with a
decarbonization plan and TESG (technology at the heart of sustainability) as some of its key drivers. The Company will invest in low-carbon technologies and align its activities with
global trends to mitigate climate change and ultimately achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 (scopes 1 and 2). These activities include low-carbon hydrogen production as an
energy source, Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS), and Natural Climate Solutions (NCS). Also, in 2021 Ecopetrol acquired a 51% stake in ISA a company that has
participation in energy transmission, roads, and telecommunications across Latin America. The value proposition includes the diversification into low-emissions business models that will
represent between 30% and 50% of Ecopetrol Group´s EBITDA by 2040.
Also, Ecopetrol Group continues to improve its fuel quality program, which supplies better quality diesel and gasoline to Colombia (known as Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel). Additionally, the
diesel sold by Ecopetrol S.A. has a percentage of Biodiesel (Biofuel produced from palm oil). The mixture sold by Ecopetrol from the Barrancabermeja Refinery is known as B2E Diesel
(98% Fossil Diesel and 2% Biodiesel). Wholesale distributors mix B2E with an additional 8% Biodiesel, generating a B10 mix (90% Fossil Diesel and 10% Biodiesel), which is what is
consumed in the Colombian market. Ecodiesel, one of the subsidiaries of the Ecopetrol Group, has a biodiesel production plant in Barrancabermeja with a production capacity of up to
125 thousand tons per year.

Evaluation in
progress

Ecopetrol identified scope 3 emissions for first time in 2020, using 2019 data. During 2021, Ecopetrol advanced the definition of other criteria that may establish a different relevance to
that associated with the participation of emissions to drive climate change management strategies with key suppliers. Also, in 2021 Ecopetrol announced 25% scope 1 and 2 emissions
reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions scope 1 and 2 and 50% emissions reduction scope 3 by 2050. Our midstream segment, represented by CENIT, was certified carbon neutral
in 2021 by the Colombian Technical Standards and Certification Institute – Icontec.

Investment
in R&D

Yes The Technology and Innovation Committee of the Board of Directors was created in 2019 to review Ecopetrol’s Technology Strategy, which includes a major component called "Towards
energy transition and carbon neutrality". This component addresses the following topics: 1. Energy diversification (solar, geothermal, wind and green hydrogen); 2. Optimization of water
use (reuse, agro-industrial use, optimal quality); 3. Decreasing fugitive emissions, zero flaring, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (asphalt binders, charcoal fossils, carbon
fibers graphene); and 4. Stable and profitable production of ethanol and biodiesel among other biofuels. Ecopetrol´s Vicepresidency of Innovation and Technology leads and supports
research and development efforts on these fields.
In the recently announced Ecopetrol 2040 strategy, one of its pillars is enabling the strategy with cutting-edge knowledge which includes technology and innovation as its main growth
lever. The Technology and Strategy teams have defined a digital agenda which established a map of solutions that contribute towards our energy transition and decarbonizing goal.
The proposed solutions have been grouped into clusters for each Energy Transition goal. Each cluster will serve as an enabler that supports the completion and accomplishment of the
goals through science, technology, and innovation. Energy Transition roadmap and its proposed clusters: 1. Decarbonization: Clean energy and new technologies to decarbonize
operations 2. Increase competitiveness to avoid stranded assets: new technologies to improve resilience in assets, replace reserves to assure our core business competitiveness,
optimization in strategic processes 3. Technology, Environment, Social and Governance (TESG) agenda: enable by technology Ecopetrol’s water management strategy; assure
participation in the modernization of territories; technology for ESG reporting and management 4. Diversification: develop technology that supports new businesses. The implementation
of this agenda has an estimate impact of 20 – 30 billion dollars of accumulated EBITDA until 2040.

Operations Evaluation in
progress

In response to climate change-related risks Ecopetrol defined its decarbonization plan to reduce emissions through energy efficiency projects, renewables, reduction of routine flaring
and reduction of fugitive emissions and vents. All these projects have been so far cost-effective, but as the Company continues to achieve operational efficiencies to drive emissions
down, in parallel it must put together an abatement curve to identify additional opportunities, determine additional cost-effective projects and the potential of implementing new
technologies (e.g. CCUS).

In 2020, Ecopetrol set an internal carbon price at USD 20 tonCO2 in 2021, USD 30 tonCO2 from 2025 and USD 40 ton CO2 from 2030. This criterion is analysed periodically, and it is used to
assess and evaluate investment opportunities, with the aim of encouraging clean technologies, and renewable energy projects and low carbon solutions across our operations. To achieve
environmentally responsible, safe and efficient operations there are five (5) strategic lines: (i) build and generate value through an efficient, clean and safe production, (ii) accelerate and
prioritize decarbonization and efficiency energy, (iii) ensure circular water management, (iv) support the local development of territories where the Company operates and (v) generate trust in
the social environment with proactive dialogue and improvement of the quality of life, with a focus on the inclusion and revitalization of local economies.
In line with the TESG objectives, the 22 - 24 Plan (without ISA) includes investments for more than USD 1,400 million in circular water management projects, decarbonization, energy efficiency,
use of energy and alternative sources, improvement in the quality of fuels, and studies and pilots of green and blue hydrogen for applications in refineries and mobility. Ecopetrol Group will
increase its self-generation capacity with renewable energies in a range between 400-450MW by 2023.
On the other hand, Ecopetrol is evaluating different sustainable financing alternatives to leverage energy transition projects aimed at meeting the goal of being carbon neutral by 2050.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
In March 2021, Ecopetrol announced its commitment to reduce its emissions by 25% compared to what was emitted in 2019 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050
(scopes 1 and 2). Additionally, Ecopetrol seeks to reduce 50% of its total emissions by 2050 (scopes 1, 2 and 3).
The established goals by 2030 cover scope 1 and 2 emissions generated by the Ecopetrol Group, which were estimated for 2019 at 13.5 MtCO2e. This amount includes an
initial estimate of 2MtCO2e additional to those emitted directly by Ecopetrol that correspond to emissions related to the different subsidiaries and equity stakes of the group.
In order to better consolidate and report total emissions for the Ecopetrol group as of 2024, this additional estimate is being reviewed for each of the subsidiaries, and for
the assets not directly operated by the company, to standardize the calculation methodologies and to incorporate the emissions of the entire group in the information
management tool currently used by Ecopetrol (SIGEA - SAP EC).

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
The achievement of this target is part of the net-zero roadmap, which establishes the development of a portfolio for emission reduction projects that levers on the reduction
of fugitive emissions and venting, the reduction of gas flaring, and the incorporation of renewable energy projects focused mainly on solar farms, as well as various
initiatives to achieve energy efficiency.
Annually, the company establishes a goal that considers the contribution of specific projects in different segments of the company. In 2021, the goal reached through new

CDP Page  of 7719



project implementation was 293,594 tons of CO2e (tCO2e), exceeding the original goal of 235,262 tCO2e. The accumulated GHG emissions reduction between 2020-2021
was 493,441 tCO2e. This accumulated reduction is part of Ecopetrol's short-term reduction target, which is to reduce 1.6 million tons of CO2e in the 2020-2024 period.

The target covers renewable energy production (self-generation) company-wide. Currently, the self-generated energy matrix has three sources: gas, liquid fossil fuels, and
renewable energies (mainly, solar). The target is to increase the share of renewable energies in the self-generated matrix. Self-generated electricity capacity with fossil
fuels (gas and liquid) may vary, and even increase, in the future because these sources will be viewed as a backup. 
This target refers only to self-generation energy production. Therefore, electricity purchases from the national electrical grid are not included.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
The target includes renewable energy production from wind, solar and geothermal sources. In 2021, two (2) solar projects were inaugurated: i) San Fernando Solar
Ecopark initiated operations, with an installed capacity of 61 MWp, and ii) six (6) of Cenit’s small solar plants were inaugurated with an installed capacity of 0.46 MWp.

The target covers reduction of upstream flaring. It does not cover downstream flaring.
Regarding upstream flaring, the target covers all production facilities where Ecopetrol has operational control.
Although the target is limited to routine flaring, the reported flaring data in the reporting year and in the base year correspond to the overall gas flaring due to the company's
operations, because, to date, Ecopetrol does not have the information segregated into routine and non-routine flaring. The first corporate report made to the World Bank,
which was made in 2022, is in line with the reporting conditions allowed by the World Bank within the ZRF initiative as the first corporate report. Currently, Ecopetrol is
making progress in characterizing which flaring activities are routine and non-routine to present them from the second report.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
This target will be achieved through evaluation and implementation of projects for usage of gas that is currently flared and through process optimization. These are the main
actions to reduce routine flaring : 
- Convert associated gas to electrical power: Gas turbines can convert gases that would otherwise be flared into electricity. The electricity can be used on-site to power

CDP Page  of 7722



equipment.
- Recover associated gases using vapor recovery units: Vapor recovery units can capture flash gas from tanks and compress it in the gas line so that it can be sold rather
than released or flared.
- Associated gas recovery: It can be treated to remove water, sulphur and carbon dioxide and then compressed on-site to produce compressed natural gas (CNG) and a
natural gas liquids (NGL) product.

In 2021, Ecopetrol implemented nine (9) projects that allowed the reduction of 45,135 tCO2e.

Also, Ecopetrol participated in the construction of a national regulation (Resolution 40066 of 2022 of the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Colombia) which aims to reduce
exploration and production routine flaring when it is economically possible. This national regulation is aligned with the Zero Routine Flaring (ZRF) initiative.

The target is company-wide, it covers all activities in facilities where Ecopetrol has operational control. 
In line with its commitment to mitigate climate change, advance with the energy transition and its TESG agenda, the Ecopetrol Group announced its goal of having net zero
emissions by 2050 for scopes 1 and 2. Under this goal, the company ratifies its responsibility with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and with the Paris
Agreement’s purpose of curtailing global warming.
The 2050 objective has intermediate goals and a short, medium and long-term portfolio, with some projects already implemented or in a research stage. By 2030, the
Ecopetrol Group seeks to reduce its CO2e emissions by 25% (scopes 1 and 2) compared to a 2019 baseline. According to the estimated emissions projected by 2030, this
reduction represented an initial estimate of between 5 and 6 million tons of CO2e reductions in this decade. 
In addition, Ecopetrol seeks to reduce 50% of its total emissions by 2050 (scopes 1, 2 and 3). 
In March 2022, SBTi published a Fossil Fuels Policy, which indicates the following premises: (i) pauses the validation of fossil fuel sector targets, (ii) will not accept new
commitments from companies or subsidiaries according to the defined categories, and (iii) removal of previous commitments by oil and gas sector companies immediately.
The updated guidance is expected to be published by the end of 2023. Once the specific guidance is released, Ecopetrol will review its ambition and alignment with SBTi.

Do you intend to neutralize any unabated emissions with permanent carbon removals at the target year?
Yes

Planned milestones and/or near-term investments for neutralization at target year
The net-zero roadmap includes:
2020- 2025:
- Permanently update the inventory of emissions from direct operations, subsidiaries and non-operated assets, including those associated with scope 3.
- Implementation of initiatives identified for energy efficiency, reduction of fugitive emissions, venting and flaring, and renewable energies – solar, wind and geothermal.
- Identifying additional initiatives for efficiency, flaring reduction and biomass.
- Developing the portfolio of Natural Climate Solutions.
- Green hydrogen pilot.
2025-2030:
- Implementing additional technological options in energy efficiency, reduction of fugitive emissions, venting and flaring, fuel substitution, and renewable energies – solar,
wind and geothermal.
- Further developing the portfolio of Natural Climate Solutions.
- Gradually escalating green hydrogen and carbon capture, use and sequestration pilots – if the technologies are competitive.
2030-2050:
- Capitalizing on the technological advancement of competitive initiatives in green hydrogen, carbon sequestration and renewable energy with storage through batteries.
-Further developing the portfolio of Natural Climate Solutions.
Additionally, according to the 2040 Corporate Strategy, the Company will neutralize around 30% of emissions through Natural Climate Solutions. Also, over the next three
years more than USD 200 million is expected to be invested in green hydrogen projects in the Cartagena and Barrancabermeja refineries, and in CO2 capture projects
through both emerging technologies (CCUS) and Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) projects.

Planned actions to mitigate emissions beyond your value chain (optional)
According to Ecopetrol's strategy, around 30% of emissions will be neutralized through Natural Climate Solutions. It includes avoided deforestation projects, restoration and
reforestation in agroforestry projects, wetland restoration, among others. It may also represent numerous social and environmental co-benefits to the territories where this
strategy is implemented. In addition, these projects have the potential to effectively reduce net CO2 emissions and contribute to the country’s Nationally Determined
Contribution (NDC), considering that the main sources of emissions in Colombia (around 60%) are associated with deforestation and land use changes.
In 2021, Ecopetrol started the Nature Climate Solutions portfolio implementation with the development of four (4) projects in partnership with The Nature Conservancy,
Wildlife Conservation Society, Acción Fund, ISA – Conexión Jaguar and Natura Foundation, with a potential capture of more than 1MtCO2/year. The accumulated potential
of these projects, considering their life span, is more than 15 million tCO2.

C-OG4.2d

(C-OG4.2d) Indicate which targets reported in C4.1a/b incorporate methane emissions, or if you do not have a methane-specific emissions reduction target for
your oil and gas activities, please explain why not and forecast how your methane emissions will change over the next five years.

Both targets, the mid-term by 2030 and net-zero by 2050, include the reduction of methane emissions.
Ecopetrol is part of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), in line with the company's efforts to reduce methane emissions into the atmosphere. As part of the
commitments, the company is systematically advancing in the identification and quantification of methane emissions. In addition, in 2020, the company joined the OGMP2.0
Methane Initiative Framework (Oil and Gas Methane Partnership), which will lead to more transparent and standardized reporting of methane emissions from oil and gas
value chains.
The Company’s Fugitive Emissions and Venting Management Strategy has the following objectives:
1. Achieve compliance with the sectoral goal of reducing methane emissions from member companies of the CCAC by 2025, in absolute terms of 45% between 60% and
75% by 2030, exceeding the levels estimated for 2015.
2. Report 100% of operated assets in 2024 and 100% of non-operated assets in 2026, at the 4/5 measurement level in accordance with the commitments established for
OGMP 2.0 members.
To this end, progress is being made in the development and implementation of the following: i) Updating and adjusting the methane emissions inventory, construction of our
own emission factors, and definition of specific reduction goals; ii) Incorporation of design criteria and good engineering practices to reduce fugitive emissions and venting; iii)
Implementation of the LDAR - Leak Detection and Repair, a program for the identification, quantification, and repair of methane emission leaks.
A campaign to detect methane emissions was deployed in 2021, with greater coverage than the campaign conducted between 2019 and 2020 identifying 1,085 leaks that
already have an action plan, of which, 184 (17%) have already been closed.
Once Ecopetrol's own emission factors are established, it is expected that methane emissions will increase.
In 2022, Ecopetrol will establish its own methane emission reduction goal.

Dedicated budget for
energy efficiency

Ecopetrol has the Energy Efficiency Program, with a dedicated budget, which aims to optimize the organization’s energy performance, achieving a reduction in energy consumption and
a reduction in GHG emissions as part of its decarbonization program objectives. This program is based on the ISO:50001 Standard

Internal price on
carbon

In 2020 Ecopetrol defined the methodology and implemented an internal carbon price that incorporates the carbon dioxide emissions' impact (positive or negative) on investments economic
valuations as a complementary decision-making criteria. Ecopetrol has set an internal carbon price at US$ 20/TCO2 in 2021, 30 US$/TCO2 from 2025, and 40 US$/TCO2 from 2030
onwards, which will be used to assess and evaluate current and future projects and investments.

Dedicated budget for
low-carbon product
R&D

Ecopetrol's Center for Innovation and Technology-ICP develops different projects, (studies on energy efficiencies, hydrogen, optimization in gas processes, etc.) including those that improve
the efficiencies of processes in the value chain and reduce the carbon footprint.

Financial optimization
calculations

In 2021 an update of capital discipline criteria for resource allocation was conducted, considering the energy transition strategy of Ecopetrol, a lower hurdle discounted rate of return
(minimum rate of return expected) was set for energy projects including renewables.

Marginal abatement
cost curve

Ecopetrol continues implementing its Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) identifying six (6) technological levers that lead to 18 mitigation initiatives for the upstream, midstream, and
downstream segments. The technological levers are: energy efficiency, methane and flaring, renewable energy, fuel substitution, renewable hydrogen, and CCUS. In addition, an emission
mitigation potential was established for 7 global initiatives in the company, which are mainly cost-effective.

Internal
incentives/recognition
programs

The company has a short-term variable compensation plan tied to business results that is applicable to all employees and reviewed annually through the Management Balanced Scorecards
(TBGs). Since 2010, Ecopetrol has been implementing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction projects in different operational areas, and since 2012 the company has implemented
annual emission reduction targets. Each annual target is set by identifying projects from the portfolio that will be developed the following year.
For the year 2021, the management Balanced Scorecard includes a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goal that measures the cumulative reduction of emissions in the Ecopetrol Group in
terms of CO2 equivalent (CO2, CH4, N2O), through the implementation of projects such as energy efficiency, process optimization, gas utilization, changes in the energy matrix, among
others.
The Long-Term Incentives (LTI) apply to company executives and each plan includes a GHG reduction target for each three-year period, aligned with the company's goal of reducing GHG
emissions by 25% by 2030 (Scopes 1 and 2) and achieving zero net carbon emissions by 2050.
Currently we have implemented three LTI plans for the periods 2020-2022, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024.

Explain your calculation of avoided emissions, including any assumptions
Ecodiesel produces 100% biodiesel. Ecopetrol owns half of Ecodiesel’s production. Using the 100% biodiesel high heating value, it was possible to calculate the energy
contained in the production owned by Ecopetrol and, using the fossil diesel high heating value, it was possible to determine the produced mass if it were fossil diesel.
Avoided emissions were calculated using emissions factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O for national fuels, calculated by Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME, for its
Spanish acronym).

Regarding the revenue generated from low-carbon products, Ecopetrol owns 50% of the Joint Venture with Ecodiesel. The income from Ecodiesel corresponds to profit and
paid dividends. In 2021, Ecodiesel contributed 4.3% of the total dividends that Ecopetrol receives as non-operating income from joint ventures and associates and 0.16% of
profits. In relation to last year report, the reported figure is adjusted according to the equity method.

C-OG4.6

(C-OG4.6) Describe your organization’s efforts to reduce methane emissions from your activities.

  

Ecopetrol is part of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), in line with the company's efforts to reduce methane emissions. As part of its commitments, the company is
systematically advancing in the identification and quantification of methane emissions. In addition, in 2020, the company joined the OGMP2.0 Methane Initiative Framework
(Oil and Gas Methane Partnership), which will lead to more transparent and standardized reporting of methane emissions from oil and gas value chains. Also, the company
received technical support from the Canadian government for Bottom-up measurements of methane, through Environment & Natural Resources Canada, among others.
The Company’s Fugitive Emissions and Venting Management Strategy has the following objectives:
1. Achieve compliance with the sectoral goal of reducing methane emissions from member companies of the CCAC by 2025, in absolute terms of 45% between 60% and
75% by 2030, exceeding the levels estimated for 2015.
2. Report 100% of operated assets in 2024 and 100% of non-operated assets in 2026, at the 4/5 measurement level in accordance with the commitments established for
OGMP 2.0 members.
To this end, progress is being made in the development and implementation of the following lines of action: i) Updating and adjusting the methane emissions inventory,
construction of our own emission factors, and definition of specific reduction goals; ii. Incorporation of design criteria and good engineering practices to reduce fugitive
emissions and venting; ii) Implementation of the LDAR - Leak Detection and Repair, a program for the identification, quantification, and repair of methane emission leaks.

Ecopetrol has an internal guideline for the implementation of the LDAR program, applicable to exploration and production activities, based on the requirements of Resolution
40066, "Technical requirements for the detection and repair of leaks, exploitation, flaring and venting of natural gas during hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities",
issued by the Colombian Mines and Energy Ministry in 2022 . 

In 2021, a campaign to detect methane emissions was deployed identifying 1085 leaks that already have an action plan, of which, 184 (17%) have already been closed. 

Once Ecopetrol's own emission factors are established, it is expected that methane emissions will increase. 

In 2022, Ecopetrol will establish its own methane emission reduction goal. 

CDP Page  of 7726



C-OG4.7

(C-OG4.7) Does your organization conduct leak detection and repair (LDAR) or use other methods to find and fix fugitive methane emissions from oil and gas
production activities?
Yes

C-OG4.7a

(C-OG4.7a) Describe the protocol through which methane leak detection and repair or other leak detection methods, are conducted for oil and gas production
activities, including predominant frequency of inspections, estimates of assets covered, and methodologies employed.

 In 2021, Ecopetrol carried out the first major fugitive measurement detection campaign in all of its Upstream production assets, with the support of the Canadian government
to structure a robust baseline on methane, to define specific emissions factors for the organization that will lead to an update of the SAP-EC supported information tool on
emissions (named SIGEA) to better monitor and control this source of emissions. Taking this input, as well as the internal guideline for the implementation of LDAR program,
and the recent regulatory framework (Res. 40066 of 2022), the company is planning the corresponding Leak Detection and Repair LDAR campaigns. For the Bottom-up
campaign carried out in 2021 to measure fugitive methane emissions, OGI cameras were used to detect the leak and Hi-Flow Sampler equipment for measurement,
ultrasonic flow meter equipment was used to measure well casinghead venting and cameras OGI, Vortex flow meter equipment and anemometers for venting measurement in
tanks, covering approximately 95% of upstream assets to date. Regarding the frequency of monitoring for consecutive periods, Ecopetrol will follow the recent regulatory
framework.

C-OG4.8

(C-OG4.8) If flaring is relevant to your oil and gas production activities, describe your organization’s efforts to reduce flaring, including any flaring reduction
targets.

 The reduction of flaring is very important to Ecopetrol, and efforts have been made in recent years to significantly reduce it, as shown by our latest sustainability reports.
Likewise, Ecopetrol is part of the World Bank´s Zero Routine Flaring initiative. 

Ecopetrol S.A. has implemented the following initiatives to reduce flaring in existing fields:

- Convert associated gas to electrical power: Gas turbines can convert gases that would otherwise be flared into electricity. The electricity can be used on-site to power
equipment.

- Recover associated gases using vapor recovery units: Vapor recovery units can capture flash gas from tanks and compress it in the gas line so that it can be sold rather
than released or flared.

- Associated gas recovery: It can be treated to remove water, sulphur and carbon dioxide and then compressed on-site to produce compressed natural gas (CNG) and a
natural gas liquids (NGL) product.

To manage emissions from flaring, Ecopetrol designed a guide that establishes the internal guidelines required for the implementation of the "Zero Routine Flaring by 2030"
initiative, which includes the methodology for estimating the reduction of emissions related to gas flaring. Additionally, this guide is aligned with Resolution 40066 issued by
the Ministry of Mines and Energy.

In 2022 Ecopetrol will report, for the first time, routine flaring to the World Bank.

(C5.1a) Has your organization undergone any structural changes in the reporting year, or are any previous structural changes being accounted for in this
disclosure of emissions data?

Row 1

Has there been a structural change?
Yes, an acquisition
Yes, a divestment

Name of organization(s) acquired, divested from, or merged with
Acquired organization: 51,41% of ISA's capital stock; Acquired assets: Pauto - Floreña; Divested organization: Cenit, and ODC. Ecopetrol handed over Cenit's and ODC's
operational control to Cenit.

Details of structural change(s), including completion dates
In August 2021 Ecopetrol acquired 51.41% of ISA’s capital stock. ISA is a multi-Latin corporate group operating in Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and
Central America. ISA and its 46 subsidiaries operate and maintain electricity transmission networks. However, Ecopetrol does not have operational control on ISA’s
operations. For this reason, those emissions are not included in this report. 

For the 2021 term, operational control of the midstream subsidiaries CENIT and Oleoducto de Colombia (ODC) was handed over by Ecopetrol. Additionally, in 2020,
Ecopetrol took over the operation of the upstream Pauto - Floreña asset, which is why the emissions of these assets are included in 2021. Therefore, the total 2018-2020
historical series was recalculated.

Change in boundary: For the 2021 term, the operational control of the midstream subsidiaries CENIT and Oleoducto de Colombia (ODC) was handed over by Ecopetrol.
In this report, scope 3 emissions are aligned with the boundary selected for scope 1 & 2 emissions (facilities where Ecopetrol has operational control), which include Cartagena’s
refinery. 
Change in base year: In 2021, it was updated to 2019. 
Change in methodology: 
Scope 2: last year Ecopetrol calculated scope 2 emissions with the location-based method. As a result of the recommendations obtained during the 2021 third-party verification process,
this report uses both methodologies, location-, and market-based. However, monitoring is done with market-based method because supplier-specific emission factors are used. This
method gives a higher value than the one obtained with location-based method because the national electrical grid has a high hydric component, so the emission factor for electricity
provided by the national grid is relatively low compared to emission factors for electricity from other countries.
Scope 3 C1: Purchased goods and services is mainly calculated with spend-based method. Last year, Quantis models were used for this calculation. This year, instead of Quantis, EEIO
(Environmentally-extended input output) model was used, because it has more specific categories and updated emission factors. In 2021, the inventory has been refined moving away
from spend-based method to average-data method or hybrid method, as much as possible.
Scope 3 C3: In the previous report fuel and energy emissions were calculated using an average between different methodologies, including an estimate from Quantis tool. For this report,
the Quantis tool is no longer used. Emissions are calculated using the national electric grid emission factor, which is updated annually, and using supplier-specific emission factor.
Scope 3 C8: Last year, leased assets (upstream) were calculated with spend-based method using the Quantis tool. For this report, it is calculated using the national electrical grid
emission factor and the energy consumption in each asset. 
Scope 3 C11: In the previous report exported oil related GHG emissions were calculated as part of category 10. For this report, those emissions are part of category 11 Use of sold
product. The calculation methodology was updated considering the carbon content as a conservative criterion, which allows to cover the maximum possible emissions per oil barrel.

Base year emissions (metric tons CO2e)
11047443

Comment
Scope 1 (direct) GHG emissions include all activities under operation control. The included GHG are CO2, CH4, and N2O. The global warming potentials used are from the
Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The main calculation methodologies are mass balance and emission factors. 
Scope 1 emissions accounted for 95% of Ecopetrol’s scopes 1 and 2 total emissions. For base year recalculation, the carbon intensity data of the year in which the acquired
asset began its operation in Ecopetrol is taken and extrapolated to the base year using the asset’s historical production reported in the National Hydrocarbons Agency. Once
total emissions are calculated, scope 1 emissions are calculated using the average of Scope 1 proportion in the last 4 years of Ecopetrol's GHG emissions inventory.

Scope 2 (location-based)

Base year start
January 1 2019

Base year end
December 31 2019

Base year emissions (metric tons CO2e)
367462

Comment
Scope 2 (indirect) GHG emissions are those associated with the consumption of purchased electricity. 
Scope 2 monitoring and targets are based on market-based method because supplier-specific emission factors are used. However, data for both methodologies are
presented in this report.
Scope 2 emissions (location-based) were calculated using the national electrical grid emission factor for 2019, calculated by UPME.

Scope 2 (market-based)

Base year start
January 1 2019

Base year end
December 31 2019

Base year emissions (metric tons CO2e)
620369

Comment
Scope 2 (indirect) GHG emissions are those associated with the consumption of purchased electricity. Scope 2 emissions accounted for 5% of Ecopetrol’s scopes 1 and 2
total emissions. 
For base year recalculation, the carbon intensity data of the year in which the acquired asset began its operation in Ecopetrol is taken and extrapolated to the base year
using the asset’s historical production reported in the National Hydrocarbons Agency. Once total emissions are calculated, scope 2 emissions are calculated using the
average of Scope 2 proportion in the last 4 years of Ecopetrol's GHG emissions inventory.
Ecopetrol uses market-based method because supplier-specific emission factors are used. It gives a higher value than the one obtained with location-based method
because the national electrical grid has a high hydric component, so the emission factor for electricity provided by the national grid is relatively low compared to emission
factors for electricity from other countries. 
It is important to notice that electrical energy purchase from local suppliers is favoured by issues such as facilities located in areas with deficiencies in national electrification
and low reliability of the national system, which forces the company to acquire electricity from local suppliers. These suppliers have higher emissions factors than the ones
for the national electrical grid.

Scope 3 category 1: Purchased goods and services

Base year start
January 1 2019

Base year end
December 31 2019

Base year emissions (metric tons CO2e)
4980589

Comment
Category 1 emissions accounted for 3.47% of Ecopetrol’s total scope 3 emissions. This category is the company's second most significant emissions contributor. Emissions
for purchased goods and services were estimated using three different methods: Supplier specific, Spend-based, and Hybrid according to the subcategory defined and the
available information. The specific supplier method was used for some suppliers classified as relevant for the supply area. The spend-based method was used breaking
down Ecopetrol’s spend data allocated to the most appropriate product group category available within the EEIO (Environmentally-extended input output) model. Finally, the
hybrid method was applied when a relevant supplier had an inventory of GHG emissions but the purchased good or service did not account for a relevant volume or mass.
In this case, carbon intensity revenue-based was used.

included. Last report was calculated using an average between different methodologies, including an estimate from the Quantis tool. For this report, the Quantis tool is no
longer used. Emissions for T&D losses are calculated using the national electric grid emission factor, which is updated annually; emissions for surplus energy sales are
calculated using supplier-specific emission factor.

Scope 3 category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution

Base year start
January 1 2019

Base year end
December 31 2019

Base year emissions (metric tons CO2e)

Comment
Category 4 emissions accounted for 0.21% of Ecopetrol’s total scope 3 emissions. Ecopetrol divided this category into three (3) subcategories: river, marine, and land
transportation. Both river and land transportation occur locally in Colombia, thus, the fuel used in these activities corresponds to fuel sold by Ecopetrol. For this reason,
these two subcategories are already included in category 11 (use of sold product). The reported value corresponds to the whole category, divided as follows: 99,615 CO2e
tons refer to subcategories accounted for in category 11, and 201,602 CO2e tons refer to the one subcategory which is not accounted for in category 11, that is, marine
transportation. Most of these activities are calculated with distance-based method.

Comment
Category 6 emissions accounted for 0.003% of Ecopetrol’s total scope 3 emissions. This category refers to air transportation. Since all travel activities begin in Colombia,
the fuel used in these activities corresponds to fuel sold by Ecopetrol. For this reason, this category is already included in category 11 (use of sold product). This category is
calculated with distance-based methodology, following the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommendation which establishes the average emission per
passenger according to the route, type of aircraft, and cabin on each journey.

Comment
Category 7 emissions accounted for 0.011% of Ecopetrol’s total scope 3 emissions. This category refers to both air and ground commuting. Since all activities occur in
national territory, the fuel used in these activities corresponds to fuel sold by Ecopetrol. For this reason, this category is already accounted for in category 11 (use of sold
product). Some activities are calculated with distance-based method and others using national fuel emissions factors.

Category 8 includes emissions associated with non-industrial leased assets, and Ecopetrol's non-industrial own assets. The last report was calculated with spend-based
method using the Quantis tool. For this report, both subcategories are calculated using the national electrical grid emission factor and the energy consumption in each non-
industrial asset.

Comment
Category 9 emissions accounted for 0.8% of Ecopetrol’s total scope 3 emissions. Ecopetrol divided this category into two (2) subcategories: river, and marine transportation.
River transportation occurs locally (in Colombia), and one portion of marine transportation begins in Colombia, thus, the fuel used in these activities corresponds to fuel sold
by Ecopetrol. For this reason, most of these two (2) subcategories are already accounted for in category 11 (use of sold product). The reported value corresponds to the
whole category, divided as follows: 1,151,056 CO2e tons refer to activities accounted for in category 11, and 2,431 CO2e tons refer to the portion of marine transportation
that is not included in category 11. This category is calculated with distance-based method considering the transported load.

Comment
Category 10 emissions accounted for 4.1% of Ecopetrol’s total scope 3 emissions. This category includes the processing of intermediate products that are sold by Ecopetrol
such as crude oil. For processing crude oil, average-data method was used. The secondary data used was the carbon intensity of an average refining process. This
category is accounted for in category 11 (use of sold product).

Base year emissions (metric tons CO2e)
136862493

Comment
Category 11 emissions accounted for more than 95% of Ecopetrol’s total scope 3 emissions. 
Use of sold product emissions for Ecopetrol includes the direct end-use phase emissions of final products such as liquid fuels and natural gas. Also, this category includes
end-use phase emissions of sold intermediate products such as crude oil. The methodology uses net volume in commercial operations where Ecopetrol has the largest total
amount of potential sold products (results are the same using total volume). To estimate emissions from fuels based on the final products, the quantities of fuels were
multiplied by national combustion emission factor for each type of fuel. Emission factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O were used. National statistics were used to determine the
percentage of fuel burned from stationary and mobile sources and the most representative source was used. Finally, for nonenergy final product such as lubricants and
paraffins, CO2 emissions were estimated using the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) default oxidation fraction.

Row 1

​Scope 2, location-based ​
We are reporting a Scope 2, location-based figure

Scope 2, market-based
We are reporting a Scope 2, market-based figure

Comment
Scope 2 monitoring and targets are based on the market-based method because supplier-specific emission factors are used. It gives a higher value than the one obtained
with location-based method because the national electrical grid has a high hydric component, so the emission factor for electricity provided by the national grid is relatively
low compared to emission factors for electricity from other countries. However, in this report, both methodologies are used: 
For scope 2, location-based figure, the company uses the emission factor for the national electrical grid (National Interconnected System, SIN for its Spanish acronym)
calculated by the Colombian Mines and Energy Planning Unit (UPME for its Spanish acronym) annually. 
For Scope 2, market-based figure, the company uses supplier-specific emissions factors for (i) San Fernando Solar Park, and (ii) natural gas generation centres.

Comment
Main changes from previous reports:
Scope 3 category 1: Purchased goods and services is mainly calculated with the spend-based method. Last year, the Quantis models were used for this calculation. This
year, instead of Quantis, EEIO (Environmentally-extended input output) model was used, because it has more specific categories and updated emission factors. In 2021,
the inventory has been refined moving away from the spend-based method to the average-data method or hybrid method, as much as possible.
Scope 3 category 3: In the previous report fuel and energy emissions were calculated using an average between different methodologies, including an estimate from the
Quantis tool. For this report, the Quantis tool is no longer used. Emissions are calculated using the national electric grid emission factor, which is updated annually, and
using supplier-specific emission factor.
Scope 3 category 8: Leased assets (upstream) emissions were calculated with the spend-based method using the Quantis tool. For this report, it was calculated using the
national electrical grid emission factor and the energy consumption in each asset. 
Scope 3 category 11: In the previous report exported oil related GHG emissions were calculated as part of category 10. For this report, those emissions are part of category
11. The calculation methodology was updated considering the carbon content as a conservative criterion, which allows covering the maximum possible emissions per oil
barrel. 
Ecopetrol’s scope 3 figures differ from public data (GRI report) and from what was published last year because, now, the report includes all facilities where Ecopetrol has
operational control, which means that scope 3 emissions related to Cartagena’s refinery are included.

Comment
In 2020, the first scope 3 inventory estimation was carried out for 2019.
Main changes from previous reports:
Scope 3 category 1: Purchased goods and services is mainly calculated with the spend-based method. Last year, the Quantis models were used for this calculation. This
year, instead of Quantis, EEIO (Environmentally-extended input output) model was used, because it has more specific categories and updated emission factors. In 2021,
the inventory has been refined moving away from the spend-based method to the average-data method or hybrid method, as much as possible.
Scope 3 category 3: In the previous report fuel and energy emissions were calculated using an average between different methodologies, including an estimate from the
Quantis tool. For this report, the Quantis tool is no longer used. Emissions are calculated using the national electric grid emission factor, which is updated annually, and
using supplier-specific emission factor.
Scope 3 category 8: Leased assets (upstream) emissions were calculated with the spend-based method using the Quantis tool. For this report, it is calculated using the
national electrical grid emission factor and the energy consumption in each asset. 
Scope 3 category 11: In the previous report exported oil related GHG emissions were calculated as part of category 10. For this report, those emissions are part of category
11. The calculation methodology was updated considering the carbon content as a conservative criterion, which allows covering the maximum possible emissions per oil
barrel. 
Ecopetrol’s scope 3 figures differ from public data (GRI report) and from what was published last year because, now, the report includes all facilities where Ecopetrol has
operational control, which means that scope 3 emissions related to Cartagena’s refinery are included.

426 For biogenic emissions calculation, a 10% biodiesel content in fuels is considered. Emission is calculated with the emission factor for combustion of national fuels (FECOC). 

Indirect biogenic CO2 emissions (scope 3): 280,169 t. 
Scope 3 Biogenic emissions occur from biofuels combustion. The diesel sold by Ecopetrol S.A. has a percentage of Biodiesel (Biofuel produced from Palm Oil), in line with Colombia's
Law 939 of 2004. The blend marketed by Ecopetrol from the Barrancabermeja Refinery is known as B2E Diesel (98% Fossil Diesel and 2% Biodiesel). Wholesale distributors mix B2E
with Biodiesel, generating a B10 mixture (90% Fossil Diesel and 10% Biodiesel), which is the one consumed in the Colombian market.

These emissions are not relevant to the company.

Direction of change
Decreased

Reason for change
Intensity in 2020: 0.0000002541 tCO2e/COP. 
Intensity decreased because the revenue (denominator) increased as a result of: i) increase in revenues mainly due to a 94.2%, or US$ 32.4 per barrel increase of the
average crude oil basket price and a 61.8%, or US$ 30.4 per barrel increase of the average refined products basket price, which in turn was primarily due to the
strengthening of the international reference prices, a better-negotiated oil spread as a result of the company's commercial efforts, and improved refined products indicators;
ii) increase in the service revenue, primarily due to the consolidation of ISA’s revenues from September 2021; iii) increase in revenues resulting from a 1.52% depreciation
of the Colombian Peso against the U.S. dollar, from an average exchange rate of COP$ 3,691.27/US$ 1.00 in 2020 to an average exchange rate of COP$ 3,747.24/US$
1.00 in 2021, resulting in an increase in revenue from exports; and iv) increase in revenues attributable to an increase in sales volume.

The intensity figure corresponds to upstream carbon intensity. It is calculated by diving upstream scope 1 and 2 emissions by oil, gas, and white product production. This is
done considering operational control boundary. 
Intensity decreased mainly because the scope 2 emission factor for the national electrical grid (National Interconnected System, SIN for its Spanish acronym) calculated by
the Colombian Mines and Energy Planning Unit (UPME for its Spanish acronym) was updated for 2021. It decreased from 0.203 in 2020 to 0.126 tCO2e/MWh in 2021.

Comment
Methane intensity refers to methane emissions in oil and gas assets operated by Ecopetrol divided by: i) total gas production from upstream operations, and ii) total
hydrocarbon production (it includes gas, oil, and white products). 
The following are some of the main actions taken in 2021 to improve the direct measurements of methane emissions and advance in implementing the Leak Detection and
Repair Program:
- For the 2021 period, the company focused its efforts on having more precise data through direct measurements, which is why it carried out Bottom-Up Measurement of
95% of operated assets during this period. 
- Progress is being made in the construction of specific emission factors, based on a periodic program of Bottom-Up measurements set up to update the organization's
GHG emissions inventory.
- Different technologies, both Top Down and Bottom Up, are being used to refine the methane data and to establish the monitoring program, in line with the recent
Colombian regulation (Resolution 40066 of 2022 of the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Colombia) for the control and reduction of fugitive methane emissions.
- Based on the measurements made between 2019 and 2021, Ecopetrol has been defining both the baseline and the different scenarios to set specific methane reduction
targets that will be made public during 2022.

Venting accounts for 13% of scope 1 emissions. 
Ecopetrol's GHG inventory includes, in the venting category, emissions associated with gas treatments (amine and glycol), the chemical treatment process of hydrocarbons
(delayed coking and fluid catalytic cracking), and other industrial processes such as hydrogen and sulphur plants. This categorization is based on the API-2009
compendium methodology. 
The inventory has had improvements in data quality (among these, the emissions calculation for venting activities during catalyst regeneration in catalytic cracking, in which
the coke content was updated from 2018 to 2021). 
For the 2021 term, operational control of the midstream subsidiaries CENIT and Oleoducto de Colombia (ODC) was handed over by Ecopetrol. Additionally, in 2020,

Substitute ODS substances used in refrigeration and firefighting systems are not included in the calculation, as they have zero ozone depletion potential. UPCC’s
Advanced Level 2ª Method (bottom up). The bottom-up approach considers the time interval between consumption and emission explicitly through emission factors. This is
based on the number of products and end uses where chemical substances are consumed and released. With this approach, actual annual emissions are estimated based
on the number of equipment units using these chemicals, the average load of the substance, the average service life, emission rates, recycling, and disposal considerations,
among others. This method was selected because, although Ecopetrol S.A. is a consumer of ODS substances or their substitutes, the Company does not produce, export
(neither in bulk nor in products that contain them) or sell these substances; the Company has only purchased the equipment that contains them from various suppliers (e.g.,
air conditioners, stationary refrigerators, and fire-fighting systems).

Ecopetrol’s reserves process uses deterministic methods which are commonly used internationally to estimate reserves. These methods whilst reliable, have some inherent
uncertainty, and thus, the estimates should not be interpreted as being exact amounts. The majority of the producing proved reserves were estimated by applying appropriate
decline curves or other performance relationships. In analysing decline curves, reserves were estimated by calculating economic limits that are based on current economic
conditions. In certain cases, where the methods previously employed could not be used, reserves were estimated by analogy with similar reserves for which more complete
data was available. Estimates of reserves were prepared by geological and engineering standard methods commonly used in the oil and gas industry. The method or
combination of methods used in the analysis of each reserve was adopted from experience analogy reserves, including information on development stage, quality and

verification

ISO 14067 In 2021, Ecopetrol hired an independent verification by SGS for a Product Carbon Footprint (partial) for a barrel of Castilla Blend, to determine compliance with the
requirements of ISO 14067 standard. This verification covered the Carbon Footprint emissions of the “HCP” cradle-to-gate GHG product included in the life cycle of the
product. 
Partial Product Footprint: Direct cradle-to-gate emissions; from the extraction and production of raw materials, treatment, dilution and blending of crude oil, as well as
the transport of Castilla Blend for export to Coveñas port and arrival at foreign terminals.
Materiality: SGS considered a materiality below 5% as a requirement for verification, based on the needs of the intended users of the GHG assertion. 
Conclusion: 
Ecopetrol provided the HCP Statement based on the requirements of the ISO 14067:2018 standard.
The 2020 GHG information was verified by SGS to a reasonable assurance level, consistent with the objectives, criteria, and scope of the plant gate verification
agreement. 
Based on the data and information given and the processes and procedures carried out by SGS, it is concluded, with reasonable assurance, that:
-The HCP Statement is materially correct and is a fair representation of the GHG data and information.
-The applied GHG accounting methodology is solid, valid and in accordance with the ISO 14067:2018 standard.
-The HCP is accurate, complete, consistent, transparent, and free of material errors or omissions.

Comment
The carbon tax is an economic instrument created to encourage compliance with greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation goals at the national level and consists of the payment
of a fee related to the carbon content of fuels. 
The fuels that are taxed by this tax are: Gasoline, Kerosene, Jet Fuel, ACPM and Fuel Oil. Natural gas is also taxed but only for use in the hydrocarbon refining and
petrochemical industry, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) but only for sale to industrial users.
The tax considers its non-causation through neutralization with carbon credits derived from eligible projects in accordance with the national regulations established for such
purpose. 
In 2021, Ecopetrol accessed this mechanism using GHG emission reduction certificates obtained from its own energy efficiency projects, and the Cartagena Refinery
neutralized emissions through the purchase of carbon credits from projects available in the Colombian carbon market. Total taxed and neutralized emissions were
1,562,930 tCO2, approximately 15% of Scope 1 emissions.

C11.1d

CDP Page  of 7765



(C11.1d) What is your strategy for complying with the systems you are regulated by or anticipate being regulated by?

Ecopetrol's climate change strategy incorporates an action line focused on managing regulatory risks, by actively participating in different discussion scenarios or public
consultations, to anticipate changes and potential implications for the company. In addition, within the framework of the business risk map, there is the "Regulatory
Management Risk", which includes emerging regulatory issues associated with climate change and is analysed from the impact perspective of the business.

Regarding the current regulations, since 2017 Colombia has applied a tax on the consumption of all fossil fuels, including all petroleum derivatives and all types of fossil gas
(only for refining) that are used for energy purposes. This tax is currently priced at approximately US$5 per ton of CO2e emitted. The tax considers its non-causation through
the neutralization with carbon credits derived from eligible projects in accordance with the national regulations established for such purpose.

Regarding emerging regulation, the climate change law (National Law of Colombia 1931 of 2018), defined the provisions for the creation and establishment of a National Cap
& Trade System (PNCTE, for its acronym in Spanish), which is expected to come into force in 2022; according to the law, however, this period can be extended until 2025,
inclusive.

For the above, the company has a Decarbonization Plan, which involves a permanent update of the GHG emissions inventory, a portfolio of emission reduction projects and a
compensation portfolio in Natural Climate Solutions, this plan is part of the carbon neutrality roadmap for 2050 and intermediate goals, which will allow rapid adaptation to the
PNCTE, envisaged by the national government.

Project identification
The casinghead gas from the field La Cira Infantas was not historically captured; on the contrary, it was vented to regulate the pressure of the wells. The project, which has
been implemented since 2010, consists mainly in establishing the casinghead gas network and connecting the wells to this network, thus directly avoiding the emission of
methane contained in the associated gas into the atmosphere. In addition, the project avoids emissions from natural gas consumption by allocating the recovered gas to
other energy uses, thus replacing the use of natural gas with recovered casinghead gas. This project was verified in 2020, and registered on CSA in 2021.

% of supplier-related Scope 3 emissions as reported in C6.5
13.75

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
During 2021, Ecopetrol improved its scope 3 emissions inventory, collecting suppliers' specific information based on activity, which is more accurate than the spend-based
approach. For 92 suppliers, Ecopetrol calculated the indirect emissions based on the activity of their main emissions' sources.

Impact of engagement, including measures of success
The percentage of supplier-related Scope 3 emissions is based on all the activities that are purchased through suppliers that follow Ecopetrol's Procurement Model, and the
services of the Shared Services Model. Therefore, it includes not only the C1 category (purchased goods and services), but also part of C4 (upstream transportation and
distribution), C6 (business travel), C7 (employee commuting), C8 (upstream leased assets), C9 (downstream transportation and distribution) and C13 (downstream leased
assets) categories.

The 2020 inventory of the categories mentioned above corresponded to 2,26M Ton CO2e. The categories were prioritized based on the following criteria:
- Size of the procurement category, considering the amount of scope 3 emissions. 
- Ability of Ecopetrol to manage the decarbonization cycle in the category
- Interest of the market to be part of Ecopetrol's Decarbonization Strategy
- Effort level required to achieve the decarbonization goals
As a result of the application of the criteria, 16 categories were prioritized, which corresponded to 1,5M Ton CO2e. The suppliers of the prioritized categories were the ones
that have reported information, equivalent to 13,75% of total supplier-related Scope 3 emissions.

During 2021, collecting data from suppliers allowed to the reduction of 8,288 Ton CO2e, which represents an increase of 282% compared to 2020.

Comment
Past CDP Climate report informed a 100% of supplier data collection, considering that the inventory based on spend had a full coverage of suppliers. For 2021, Ecopetrol
updated the inventory based on spend and improved it with suppliers' specific activity information. In this case, the percentage reported was based on specific supplier
information. This improvement from the 2021 inventory will continue during 2022 and beyond, as data from other suppliers is collected.

Description of this climate related requirement
Implementation of different kind of circular initiatives like the following examples: 
- "Materials showcase", a platform in which all the materials that Ecopetrol no longer requires are published and to which other companies of the group have access. As of
December 31st, 2021, there are 31,260 materials. The platform is complemented by the materials loan agreement between the subsidiaries, which allows, in a matter of
days, to use leftover materials from one company in another.
- On September 15, 2021, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization -UNIDO- recognized Ecopetrol as a leading company in the implementation of this
model, which consists of moving from the purchase of chemical products to payment for their service.
- 97% of ferrous waste management. 
- First contractual model developed to allow ferrous waste to be used by a third party as raw material in materials required for the company's warehouse infrastructure. This
model can be replicated so that other waste can be used as raw material in goods required by Ecopetrol.
- Re use of pipe plugs.
- Circular initiatives in 8 Catering contracts allowed a waste utilization rate of 84% and a circular index of 69% during 2021.

Describe the process(es) your organization has in place to ensure that your engagement activities are consistent with your overall climate change strategy
In line with its commitment to mitigate climate change, advance with the energy transition, and its TESG agenda, Ecopetrol announced its net zero emissions goal for
scopes 1 & 2 by 2050. Under this goal, the Company ratifies its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement’s purpose of curtailing
global warming. This objective has the intermediate goal of reducing 25% of scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, compared to a 2019 baseline.

Furthermore, Ecopetrol seeks to reduce 50% of its total emissions by 2050 (scopes 1, 2 & 3), contributing to the Colombian government’s commitment to reduce 51% of
GHG emissions by 2030. Under this goal, the energy sectorial target is to reduce 11,2 million tons, and Ecopetrol will contribute with more than half of this reduction.

The Sustainability and Decarbonization Area of the HSE Vicepresidency is responsible for the Company’s climate change strategy and for revising the scope and
implications of national Law and regulations. The actions that are taken in each case are decided in tandem with the Legal Vicepresidency. The Company ensures the
alignment of its climate related policy efforts with its 2040 Corporate Strategy and its environmental strategy. The latter includes, in its Climate Change Pillar, an action line
called “participation in public policy documents”, which establishes the revision and compliance mechanisms of climate related legislation and policy. 

Furthermore, the strategic risk “Inadequate management of climate change and water” includes a Key Risk Indicator (KRI) called “Analysed HSE and climate and water
related normative projects” that seeks to monitor and analyse national, regional, and local legislative projects that affect HSE, climate, and water issues. This is another
mechanism to assure that climate related policy actions taken are aligned with the Company’s overall strategy.

short, medium, and long-term, which were included in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) paper submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC). 

This law reiterates the country’s obligation to fully implement the National Cap & Trade System (PNCTE, for its Spanish acronym) as a NDC implementation mechanism by
2030. This obligation, in turn, creates a set of commitments for Ecopetrol, that include:
• Mandatory reporting of its direct and indirect GHG emissions as well as the information and documentation for the elaboration of GHG inventories. 
• Mitigation initiatives reporting in the country’s National Registry of Emissions and GHG removal (RENARE - Spanish acronym).

Description of engagement with policy makers
Ecopetrol has participated in two (2) construction workshops and has provided information of the Company’s GHG emissions for the sectorial baseline used to construct the
Law. 

Colombia is in the process of structuring the National Cap & Trade System (PNCTE for its Spanish acronym). The roadmap for its implementation has a 5-year duration in
three (3) phases: i) Regulation; ii) Institutional and operational arrangements; and iii) Start up. It is expected that Ecopetrol will further engage with the government during
the implementation phases. 

In 2021, as part of the first phase, regulation design adjustments were made for both the PNCTE, and the Corporate GHG Emissions Reporting Program. Also, as part of
the second stage, institutional arrangements were started. This is an effort that is currently being led by the Colombian Ministry of Environment and Sustainable
Development. In 2022, the first phase is expected to finish with the regulation of both the Corporate GHG Emissions Reporting Program, and the PNCTE. The PNCTE is
expected to start by 2025

Ecopetrol’s environmental strategy (scope includes the companies within the Ecopetrol Group, in which Ecopetrol S.A. holds interests) has defined eight pillars, and Climate
Action is one of them. This pillar seeks to maintain a low emissions operation, reduce infrastructure and operational vulnerability, and adequately manage risks and
opportunities associated to climate change. The Climate Action pillar is based on four strategic lines:

1. Mitigation: Ecopetrol pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 (scopes 1 and 2), reduce 25% of its CO2e emissions by 2030 compared to a 2019 baseline (scopes 1 &
2) and reduce 50% of its total emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2, & 3). 

For the development of the proposed goals, Ecopetrol has a decarbonization plan that includes:

a) Permanent update and verification by a third party of the GHG emissions inventory. 

b) Portfolio optimization by implementing an internal carbon price and diversifying towards low emission businesses.

c) Gradual incorporation of low-carbon emissions technologies (energy efficiency in operations, gas flaring, fugitive emission, and venting reductions, use of renewable
energies, fuel substitution, hydrogen, and carbon capture, use, and storage).

d) Natural-Climate Solutions (NCS) to compensate for residual emissions (around 30%), subject to the mitigation hierarchy. 

2. Adaptation and vulnerability: This component seeks to reduce risks and impacts derived from climate change and variability on the company's facilities, nearby
communities, and ecosystems. The Company has identified inadequate management of climate change and water as a strategic risk. Therefore, it has deployed controls and
actions to prevent its materialization. The Company has implemented a plan to adapt to variability and climate change in six regions of Colombia.

3. Research, development, and innovation: The Center for Innovation and Technology (ICP acronym in Spanish) oversees leading studies, research, and new developments,
to leverage Ecopetrol's decarbonization goals. The ICP has defined a technological portfolio, which includes initiatives for processes optimization, energy efficiency, new
energy vectors valuation, carbon capture and development of low carbon products. In 2022, the Center for Innovation and Technology (ICP acronym in Spanish) was
integrated to the new Science, Technology and Innovation VP to strengthen and develop the Technology, science and innovation agenda in all segments of the Ecopetrol
Group's value chain. 

4. Participation in the drafting of public policies: Ecopetrol articulates its climate change strategy with the National Government’s policy and contributes to the construction of
technical and regulatory guidelines to strengthen the country's institutional capacity in climate change.
