Enquiries Our design centres around the theme of Africa Connected. With a rich 
history, diverse cultures and latent possibilities – Africa is not only where 
we are, it is where we want to be. Our reporting suite design echoes this 
belief, highlighting the potential and power of a continent connected to 
bridge the gaps between people, and the power of networks to create, 
execute and deliver value to our stakeholders. 
Throughout our reports, you will find succinct “did you know” stories 
that provide insight into how we are working to make a meaningful 
contribution towards our stakeholders and the continent we call home.
All images in our reporting suite were taken in the countries in which 
we operate.

Approval
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for ensuring the integrity of this Integrated Report and confirms 
that the report is presented in accordance with the Integrated Reporting Framework. The Board has 
considered the operating context, strategy, and value creation model. This report addresses all issues that 
are material to or that could have a material effect on Old Mutual Limited’s (Old Mutual or the Group) ability 
to create value.   

In the Board’s opinion, this report fairly presents the integrated performance of the Group. The Board 
confirms that the Group complies with the provisions of the South African Companies Act relating to its 
incorporation and is operating in conformity with its Memorandum of Incorporation. The Board approved 
this report for release on 14 April 2023.

Reporting frameworks
 » Integrated Reporting Framework (2021) 
 » King IV  
 » Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Listings 
Requirements for debt and equity issuers

 » Companies Act
 » Insurance Act, 18 of 2017
 » Certain financial information included in this  
report was extracted from the audited consolidated annual 
financial statements which have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS)

Materiality
We apply the principle of materiality in assessing which 
information to include in our Integrated Report. This 
report focuses on the issues, opportunities and challenges 
that could materially impact Old Mutual and our ability 
to consistently deliver value to our stakeholders in a 
sustainable manner.

Reporting scope and  
boundary
This report covers the activities of the Group for 
the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022. 
It provides an overview of:

 » Governance (pages 12 to 23)
 » Operating context (pages 24 to 30)
 » Risk and opportunity management  
(pages 31 to 39)

 » Strategy and value creation (pages 40 to 49)
 » Business model (pages 46 to 47)
 » Stakeholders’ value creation (pages 43 to 45)
 » Performance (pages 50 to 92)

Our financial reporting boundary aligns with our 
financial statements boundary and includes our 
operating subsidiaries, joint ventures, and key 
associates. Due to hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and 
barriers to access capital by way of dividends, we 
continue to exclude the results of the Zimbabwe 
business from adjusted headline earnings. All data 
is at 31 December 2022 unless otherwise specified.

Assurance
Combined reviews by management and internal 
audit were performed to ensure the accuracy 
of our reporting content, with the Board and its 
sub-committees providing an oversight role. This 
report has not been audited but contains certain 
information that has been extracted from the 
audited consolidated annual financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2022, on which an 
unmodified audit opinion has been expressed by 
the Group’s joint independent external auditors, 
Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche. Our Group 
internal audit provided limited assurance for non-
financial information disclosures.

Forward-looking 
statements
This report contains certain forward-
looking statements of Old Mutual 
Limited’s plans and its current 
goals and expectations relating 
to its future financial condition, 
performance and results, and 
estimates of future cash flows and 
costs. Words such as “believe”, 
“anticipate”, “intend”, “seek”, “will”, 
“could”, “may”, “project” and similar 
expressions are intended to identify 
such forward-looking statements 
but are not the exclusive means of 
identifying such statements.

By their nature, all forward-looking 
statements involve inherent risk and 
uncertainty because they are based 
on assumptions related to future 
events and circumstances which are 
beyond Old Mutual Limited Group’s 
and its affiliates’ control. These 
include economic and business 
conditions, and market-related 
risks i.e., equity fluctuations, interest 
rates, inflation, and deflation. These 
circumstances could arise from the 
impact of competition, legislation, 
and the policies and actions of 
regulatory authorities, and the 
timing and impact of any uncertain 
industry changes.

Any forward-looking information 
contained in this report was not 
reviewed and reported on by Old 
Mutual Limited’s external auditors. 
The Old Mutual Limited Group and 
its affiliates undertake no obligation 
to update the forward-looking 
statements contained in this report 
and other related supplementary 
reports or any other forward-looking 
statements it may make. Nothing in 
this report shall constitute an offer to 
sell or solicitation of an offer to buy 
securities.

low-income to high-net-worth individuals, as well as SMEs,

communities, we shift our focus beyond our operations to 
contributing to socio-economic development in a way that 
is impactful and sustainable.  

Regulators

Our business operates in a highly regulated environment, 
and our regulators play a key role in overseeing the financial 
soundness of our business, the strength of our governance 
processes and the treatment of our customers. We are 
regulated by various laws and regulatory bodies in each 
country of operation. 

At Old Mutual, we champion mutually positive futures for our stakeholders and our business. Accordingly, we 
act ethically and with intent to ensure our core business activities create sustainable value for the Group while

We believe an ethical culture is critical to doing business responsibly. Our values are key to building this work 
environment, and we ensure that we lead with integrity and respect to drive employee, customer and investor 
confidence in our business.

Our culture

We believe that our culture is key to our ability to deliver on our strategic ambitions. We have 
been on our culture transformation journey since 2016, and have made significant strides in 
redefining our purpose and values. 
While our Board is responsible for setting and steering the Group’s culture, our leaders and employees – supported 
by organisational structures and processes – bring our culture to life by reinforcing our desired behaviour.

Old Mutual’s organisational culture is built on four cornerstones: 

Driving inclusive leadership to create an environment in which our employees can thrive

Building high-performing, autonomous teams aligned with the Group’s purpose and strategy 

Fostering psychological safety and a non-threatening work environment for our employees, where 
they feel comfortable to voice their ideas and opinions 

Supporting our teams by removing the hassles that negatively impact delivery and engagement

Our organisational culture and behaviours are continuously reinforced through communication and engagement, 
performance management, organisational structures, training and incentives, which help employees understand 
what drives decisions and behaviours from their leaders.

Our ethics

Ethics set the standards for our corporate governance. We strive to conduct 
our business responsibly and ethically and ensure our behaviour is consistent 
with our policies and code of ethics and relevant regulations applicable to 
African financial services companies.

Our code of ethics, the Maadili charter, (Maadili meaning ethics in Swahili), defines ethical 
behaviour as following the spirit and intention of the law and treating our stakeholders and 
competitors fairly and respectfully. It is supported and extended by a number of policies, which 
include our Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy and our Group Conflicts of Interest Policy.

The Maadili charter applies to all Board members and employees and is reviewed regularly 
and revised accordingly to ensure a progressive ethical culture.

We distribute the Pulse Culture and Engagement Survey every second year to 
obtain feedback and monitor the effectiveness and embeddedness of our culture 
journey. The survey provides insight into challenges that need to be resolved 
to execute and deliver on our culture. We focus on the employee engagement 
and psychological safety dimensions of our culture model as these are the 
foundational elements that build high performing teams and organisations.

We foster a culture where 
our employees and leaders 
are aligned with our values. 
Because of this, our values guide 
our interactions with each other, 
our customers, communities 
and other stakeholders.

Governance of ethics
The Board
The Board is responsible for setting 
and steering the Group’s culture. 
Board members are individually and 
collectively accountable for their ethical 
and effective leadership of the Group.

The Executive committee
As delegated by the Board, 
management is responsible for 
implementing and executing the 
Maadili charter and supporting policies 
and the effective monitoring, control 
and assurance of the charter.

Ethics governance structures
Old Mutual’s internal and external 
ethics governance mechanisms 
include a whistleblower hotline, e-mail 
and website for reporting actual 
or suspected unethical or unlawful 
behaviour by directors, employees 
or external third parties. These are 
supported by strong investigative 
capabilities and rigorous disciplinary 
processes and sanctions.

Message from the Chairman

Trevor Manuel
Chairman

In 2022, we responded 
admirably to challenging 
operating conditions, 
returning to pre-COVID-19 
levels of growth and 
regaining market share. 
Old Mutual will continue 
to differentiate its offering 
through a more integrated 
and human-focused 
approach to financial 
services, further enhancing 
customer and adviser 
experience.

2022 proved to be both a challenging and rewarding 
year for the Group and our stakeholders. We returned 
to growth despite a difficult economic environment 
characterised by rising inflation and interest rates, 
as well as fiscal pressures from increased debt 
repayments. The easing of COVID-19 pandemic 
pressures was offset by an increase in weather-related 
catastrophe events, while the ongoing geopolitical 
crisis in Europe heightened market uncertainties.  

Our business improved productivity and delivered 
pleasing shareholder returns, but what has made me 
most proud is the strong way we showed up for our 
customers in what was a particularly challenging year 
for them. We reviewed and strengthened our long-
term strategy through specific focus areas to ensure 
that we become our customers’ first choice to sustain, 
grow and protect their prosperity.

Congratulations to Iain, the executive team and our Old 
Mutual colleagues across the Group for their successful 
execution of our strategy and for delivering on the 
promises made to our investors and customers. It is 
pleasing to see the efforts of the team at growing and 
protecting our core retail businesses, which are mainly 
based in South Africa, while unlocking new growth 
opportunities across the rest of the African continent.

This positive performance by the business occurred 
despite the negative impact of loadshedding on our 
daily operations in South Africa, especially at branch 
level. I express the view that solutions can be found for 
other similar challenges by appropriate and timeous 
government action. The country is entitled to a speedy 
resolution to the epidemic of crime and corruption. 
Similarly, there needs to be a swift response to the 
infrastructure requirements, both in respect of new 
builds and, perhaps more importantly, infrastructure 
maintenance. 

There can be no doubt that South Africa’s rampant 
corruption, unchecked crime and alarming descent 
into lawlessness has been exacerbated by a lack of 
strong leadership and political will. I believe it is an 
appropriate time to make the call for administrative 
clarity on how the many governance crises that 
currently beset South Africa will best be addressed. 

Given the importance of the South African market to 
the Group and the significant customer, shareholder 
and employee base we serve, we remain fully 
committed to working with government to improve 
on the conditions for doing business in the country. 

This covers regulatory certainty, response times 
for regulators and administrators and the general 
applications and consistency of rules. This is an ongoing 
challenge that requires an openness of approach and 
reasonable access for our officers.

Our employees continued to adapt well to the ever-
changing macroenvironment, including the new 
ways of working. Ensuring employees continued to 
receive holistic support remained a priority for the 
Board. With our full backing, the business continued 
to invest in leadership development, attracting and 
retaining critical skills and inspiring a culture of high 
performance.

The team is also to be commended on driving 
sustainable outcomes both for the Group and society. 
We continue to make good progress against our 
commitments to drive transformation in line with both 
policy and societal expectations. In 2022, we concluded 
two major transformation transactions in South Africa 
– “Bula Tsela” and “Futuregrowth” - both of which 
represent practical ways of broadening the ownership 
base of our business in line with national 
transformation imperatives.

Across the business, very clear commitments have 
been made to appropriately address climate change, 
in line with the requirements of a just energy transition. 
The Group’s responsible investment philosophy and 
active stewardship programmes are preparing us for 
a greater role in the green economy over time.

The impacts of the climate crisis are particularly 
pronounced in the developing world. Extreme weather 
events escalated across the continent in 2022, resulting 
in droughts, floods and the displacement of thousands 
of people. Old Mutual responded with speed and 
empathy, working with local partners to provide 
humanitarian relief to the communities worst affected 
by these disasters.

It is now clearer than ever that bold, urgent and 
collective action is necessary to limit global warming. 
I am encouraged by the initiatives addressing this risk 
across the Group.

Read more about these efforts in our Sustainability 
Report

Read more about these efforts in our Climate Report

Managing diverse risks remained a priority for the Board 
in 2022. While the Board is confident that we are taking 
appropriate steps, we remain vigilant and continue to closely 
monitor the Group’s preparedness for any eventuality.

I am particularly pleased that the strategic engagements 
undertaken in 2022 resulted in all our resolutions being 
passed at our May Annual General Meeting, including the 
approval of the Group’s Remuneration Policy. This represents 
the culmination of four years’ worth of work and an incredible 
amount of collaboration throughout the business. 

Going forward, I believe we will continue building on the 
momentum gained in 2022 by differentiating our offering 
with a more integrated and human-focused approach to 
financial services. 

We expect the operating environment to remain uncertain, 
once again testing our business’s resilience and values. 
The headwinds are formidable. The efforts of South Africa’s 
business sector to build an economy and society that is 
more inclusive, just and stable continue to be considerably 
undermined by the country’s crumbling infrastructure, our 
recent grey listing and the public sector’s woeful lack of 
urgency and commitment. 

With civil society holding big business to a higher standard 
than ever before, we need to elevate the status of ethics and 
corporate governance within our own organisation, while 
also safeguarding the financial probity and wellbeing of the 
wider society we operate in. 

As we resolutely enter what we hope will be a bold new era 
of recovery, I am confident Old Mutual has what it takes to 
help address South Africa’s ills, while making the most of 
the opportunities for job creation and growth that positive 
change will present.

It is my fervent wish that our company credo of 
championing mutually positive futures every day for all our 
stakeholders will strongly motivate us to hold each other 
accountable as we set about fixing our broken beloved 
country. 

Lastly, I would like to thank Nosipho Molope and Marshall 
Rapiya, who resigned from the Board in 2022, for their many 
years of service and contribution to building a strong Old 
Mutual. We wish them all the very best.

Ngiyabonga! Rea leboga! Baie dankie! Thank you! Asante!

What is the composition and tenure of the Board?
Our Board consists of 14 members with the necessary qualifications, 
collective skills and expertise required to guide and steer our large and 
complex Group.

The maximum tenure in the Group is three terms of three years and the retirement age for directors is 
set at 70 years, both subject to the discretion of the Corporate Governance and Nominations committee. 
The committee considers, in advance of the Annual General Meeting, the directors required to rotate, in 
accordance with the rotation schedule.

The Corporate Governance and Nominations committee also evaluates the composition of the Board 
quarterly to ensure an appropriate balance of knowledge, skills, experience, diversity and independence. The 
Board composition is also reviewed, taking into consideration its succession plan and rotation schedule.

In terms of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Listings Requirements, the Board must set transformation 
targets in a Board Appointment Policy. Our performance against these targets and other key data points 
about the Board, are set out below:

How is directors’ independence assessed?
Directors’ independence is assessed annually from the perspective of a reasonable and informed 
third party. The assessment is based on, among other things, prevailing circumstances, the definition 
of independence in terms of the Companies Act, the King IV guidance in terms of the assessment 
of independence (substance over form), conflicts of interest (whether perceived or actual) and 
other relevant considerations. The 2022 independence assessment did not result in changes to any 
directors’ designations.

What knowledge, skills and experience does the Board have?
In 2018, at the time of Old Mutual’s listing, the Board determined the individual skills required to provide 
effective oversight over the large and complex financial services business, creating a skills matrix. The 
Corporate Governance and Nominations committee reviews the skills matrix of the Board and its committees 
quarterly. Identifying skills gaps helps the Board to make decisions on future Board appointments and 
informs training requirements. Directors’ level of institutional knowledge is also considered as part of this 
process.

Preference is given to executive and/or industry experience when filling skills gaps on the Board, as the 
Board believes that these skills enable effective functioning, and supports robust oversight by Board 
members with the requisite practical experience.

Important expertise required to effectively govern a Group listed 
on five stock exchanges

Strong strategic and risk management expertise required 
to successfully govern and steer the Group to ensure 
shared value outcome

Key expertise in the context of the rapidly evolving operating 
environment and fundamental technology shifts within the 
financial services industry

Important expertise given the significance of our life business 
and the material impact actuarial shifts can have on the results

Key experience required for effective governance, oversight and 
tracking of performance of a financial services organisation

The Board is satisfied that the directors have the appropriate balance of 
knowledge, skills, experience, diversity and independence to govern the 
Group effectively, considering its nature, size, the scale of operations, and the 
laws and customs governing its actions.

How often do directors rotate and retire from the Board?
In terms of our Memorandum of Incorporation, all directors are subject to retirement 
by rotation and re-election by our investors at least once every three years.

Newly appointed directors may hold office only until the next Annual General Meeting, 
at which point they retire and become available for re-election by our investors on the 
recommendation of the Board. At the Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2022, five of the 
six directors who were up for re-election were elected after making themselves available for 
election in line with our Board Charter. Ms Nosipho Molope did not make herself available 
for re-election, having served on the Old Mutual Group Boards for three consecutive terms of 
three years. 

When identifying directors with the longest term in office since their last election, we consider 
their date of appointment as a Non-executive Director of Old Mutual Emerging Markets  
and/or Old Mutual plc, whichever is earlier.

The time served on either the Old Mutual Emerging Markets or Old Mutual plc Board is added 
to the time served on the Old Mutual Limited Board in considering rotation decisions.

How does the Board ensure that effective succession 
plans are in place for directors and executives?
The Corporate Governance and Nominations committee is responsible for succession 
planning for the Board and key executives. 

During 2022 the Board commenced engagements to expand its medium-term succession 
plans. Of particular focus was the succession plans for the eight directors who are due to step 
off the Board over the next three years.

 » In 2022 the Board and 
management continued to 
enhance the Group’s long-
term strategy, with focus 
on the detailed execution 
steps required for delivery 
of our victory condition 
to be our customers’ ‘first 
choice to sustain, grow and 
protect their prosperity’

 » The primary outcomes of 
this strategy have been 
identified, including 
providing our customers 
with an integrated 
financial services offering. 
These outcomes are 
linked to specific Board-
approved value drivers for 
investors, as detailed in the 
Integrated Report

 » We continued to monitor 
the steps to embed the 
Group’s medium and 
long-term strategy during 
the year, taking into 
consideration the prevalent 
consumer, socio-economic, 
business and competitor 
trends

 »  The strategic allocation 
of capital was monitored, 
with a focus on organic and 
inorganic opportunities

 » The Board supported 
the establishment of a 
transactional capability 
in the Group as part of 
the core strategy. This 
will improve customer 
interaction and cross-
selling opportunities, as 
well as provide a more cost 
effective source of funding 
through retail deposits 

 » The investment profile was 
approved as well as the 
expenditures for the build 
of a transactional capability

 » An ad hoc sub-committee 
was created with Albert 
Essien (Chairperson) 
Prof Brian Armstrong, 
Dr Sizeka Magwentshu-
Rensburg, Trevor Manuel 
and Nomkhita Nqweni 
as members, to oversee 
the initiative. The sub-
committee considered 
the licence application, 
customer value proposition 
and integration of the 
transactional capability. 
It also ensured that the 
latest technology was 
deployed allowing for an 
effective operating model 
and improved servicing 

 » The cloud-based 
technology stack was 
approved through the 
Technology and Platforms 
committee

 » The Corporate Governance

the section 13 submission 
to the Prudential Authority 
and the transactional 
capability announcement 
strategy

 » Old Mutual prioritises 
transforming the economy 
and creating opportunities 
to empower and uplift 
ordinary South Africans 

 » The Group had agreed at 
listing, via a framework 
agreement with the now 
Department of Trade, 
Industry and Competition, 
to achieve a 25% broad-
based black economic 
empowerment ownership 
by 2021, and best in class 
by 2023 (30% at the time 
of listing) 

 » The Board and its 
committees provided 
oversight of each step of the 
process from the design 
to the implementation 
of Bula Tsela, ensuring 
all relevant stakeholders 
were considered and the 
elements of the transaction 
were clearly communicated 

 » It was ensured that: 
 ‒  The transaction enhances 
competitiveness, 
aligns with the Group’s 
responsible business 
principles and shared-
value approach and is 
broad-based 

 ‒  Employees are enabled 
to share in the success of 
Old Mutual, community 
development is 
supported, and it includes 
black South Africans 
from lower-income 
backgrounds

 ‒  The benefits of the 
transaction must 
outweigh and outlive 
the costs

 » The Board monitored 
macroeconomic, socio-
economic, environmental, 
external and emerging 
risks, including the 
emergence of disruptors. 
This informed the Board’s 
considerations of the 
execution steps required 
to achieve our strategy, as 
well as any enhancements 
required to these steps 

 » Sovereign risk was 
considered with downside 
scenarios explored. It 
was noted that financial 
soundness and liquidity 
positions remain resilient 
under stress conditions for 
Old Mutual Life Assurance 
Company (South Africa) 
Limited and Old Mutual 
Limited

 » The risks associated with 
the Bula Tsela transaction 
were reviewed and it was 
ensured that these were 
mitigated

 » The Risk committee, in 
targeted sessions, also 
specifically considered:

 ‒  Business resilience given 
the unstable electricity 
supply in South Africa 

 ‒  The Group’s readiness 
to respond should these 
risks materialise 

 » The Board monitored the 
Group’s initiatives to ensure 
customers were supported 
to make informed financial 
decisions. It also provided 
oversight to ensure that 
the Group offers innovative, 
value for money, integrated 
financial service product 
solutions, particularly in the 
context of the constrained 
macroeconomic 
environment and rising 
interest rates and inflation

 » The Group’s customer 
strategy was interrogated 
in a targeted session, 
considering the targets, 
shifts and initiatives 
required for it to be 
successfully executed 
over the medium term

 » Significant time was 
spent considering the 
Group’s efforts to deliver 
a consistent, high-value 
customer experience 
focused on simple 
solutions. It was noted 
that products are being 
proactively improved, based 
on customer feedback 

 » Through the Responsible 
Business committee 
and the Old Mutual Life 
Assurance Company 
(South Africa) Committee 
for Customer Affairs, the 
Board ensured that the 
Group’s Market Conduct 
Framework, which supports 
the fair treatment of 
customers, was operating 
effectively throughout the 
business

 » The Board continued to 
oversee the Group’s cultural 
transformation to a high-
performance culture

culture surveys were 
considered, and it was 
noted that the culture 
themes and interventions 
of the past two years are 
having a positive impact

efforts aimed at identifying, 
recruiting and retaining 
critical skills

the Group’s succession 
planning methodology

implementation of a hybrid 
working environment with 
our employees

the Diversity and Inclusion 
strategy and related 
initiatives, noting positive 
traction in the execution 
thereof

progress and effectiveness 
of the information and 
technology strategies 
and initiatives across 
the Group, focusing on 
customer, adviser and 
employee experience and 
digitalisation

 » Through the Technology 
and Platforms committee, 
we spent significant time 
considering and monitoring 
the execution and progress 
of the Group’s technology 
modernisation strategy. 
The strategy includes the 
migration to the Amazon 
Web Services cloud and 
the modernisation of 
the solutions supporting 
finance processes. The 
latter project focuses 
on the simplification 
and rationalisation of 
financial data to improve 
the efficiency of financial 
reporting processes and 
enable the implementation 
of IFRS 17

Message from the Chief Executive Officer

Iain Williamson
Chief Executive Officer

In 2022, we continued to 
shift our focus towards 
amplifying growth to 
responsibly build the most 
valuable business in our 
industry. This has enabled 
us to create a positive and 
sustainable impact for 
our stakeholders while 
delivering on our victory 
condition of becoming our 
customers’ first choice to 
sustain, grow and protect 
their prosperity. 

Responsible value creation
The operating environment in 2022 was challenging for the Group and our 
stakeholders given the tough economic conditions. We demonstrated resilience 
as we continued to navigate a challenging environment. We created value for 
our stakeholders through the various strategic initiatives and management 
actions implemented during the year.

Earlier in 2022, we became the first South African insurer to join the Net Zero 
Asset Owner Alliance. Old Mutual Investments also joined the Net Zero Asset 
Manager Alliance, demonstrating our commitment to achieving carbon 
neutrality across our investment portfolios by 2050 or sooner. Our efforts are not 
going unnoticed; Old Mutual Investment Group was awarded Best Sustainable 
African Investment Manager at the European Global Banking and Finance 
Awards.

We also announced the launch of our landmark B-BBEE deal, Bula Tsela. The 
deal positioned us as the first insurer to offer shares directly to the black South 
African public and the first in the country to create an opportunity for lower-
income earners via our Retail Scheme. The deal structure aims to support 
meaningful socio-economic transformation and financial inclusion for our 
communities and employees. The market response considerably exceeded our 
expectations, with the offer being over-subscribed. More than 38 000 black 
South African individuals, small businesses, and groups such as trusts and 
stokvels qualified to participate in the retail portion of the scheme. The Bula 
Tsela deal was shortlisted for the 2022 Exxaro DealMakers BEE Deal of the Year 
Award.

We have made good progress on our listed equity stewardship capability, 
providing institutional investors a single, consolidated approach to active 
ownership that aligns with fiduciary requirements. We have R146 billion of our 
funds under management invested in the green economy with our investment 
teams having voted on over 960 000 resolutions that supported positive ESG 
outcomes.

We remain committed to addressing the biggest systemic risks which climate 
change poses to the world’s emerging economies, including the countries in 
which we operate. We have recently become one of 56 African companies to 
be signatories of the Africa Business Leaders Coalition Climate Statement. This 
statement calls for the international community to support Africa in the fight 
against climate change. 

We are deeply committed to supporting our customers, employees and 
communities through difficult times by being a certain friend in uncertain 
times. Our humanitarian and disaster support initiatives totalled R53 million 
in 2022 and a further R30 million facility for the KwaZulu-Natal rebuild and 
restoration project to provide permanent homes for victims of the devastating 
floods. Old Mutual was awarded the Ubuntu Economic Diplomacy Award 
(Africa) at the 2022 South Africa Ubuntu Awards by the South African 
Department of International Relations and Cooperation. This award recognises 
a business that has contributed to South Africa’s reputation as an ideal business 
destination, created jobs, facilitated trade and attracted investment.

On 1 March 2022, our employees across the continent returned to work 
based on our hybrid working model. The benefits of increased face-to-face 
collaboration had a positive impact on productivity. 

As a company that continually strives to be a progressive and nurturing 
employer of choice, we strive to adapt to changing times and incorporating 
new ways of thinking and working into our workplace. We have implemented 
a revised Parental Leave Policy to demonstrate our commitment to fostering 
a culture of care. The progressive Parental Leave Policy is just one of the ways 
we are embracing our transformational journey of diversity and inclusion. The 
revised policy acknowledges how traditional family units have evolved and, in 
response, details how we have redefined the roles and terms of parenting and 
raising a family, adjusting the benefits accordingly to become broader and 
more inclusive.

Reflecting on our performance
I am very pleased with our robust operating performance with strong sales 
and earnings. The Group delivered a solid set of financial results in 2022 
despite the difficult macroeconomic environment and market volatility. The 
pressure on our operating earnings caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has 
lifted as the ongoing impact of the pandemic becomes muted. Our good sales 
performance was achieved on the back of successful execution of our strategy 
as we continued to enhance our customer and adviser experience. 

Sales maintained momentum throughout the year in our retail segments. We 
made progress in regaining market share in the Mass and Foundation Cluster 
and Personal Finance during the year, as evidenced by external market surveys.

Life APE sales increased by 10% mainly due to strong risk and credit life sales 
in the Mass and Foundation Cluster coupled with higher corporate and retail 
sales in Namibia. Our China business also delivered strong savings sales from 
the broker channels. This was partially offset by lower pre-retirement and 
annuity sales in Old Mutual Corporate. 

The value of new business grew by 16% due to strong sales growth in Mass and 
Foundation Cluster as well as a change in mix towards higher-margin business 
in Mass and Foundation Cluster and Old Mutual Corporate. This was partially 
offset by the reduction in Personal Finance value of new business arising from 
challenges faced with sales volumes and business mix. We have, however, seen 
an improvement in the second half of the year due to management actions 
implemented to improve the business mix to higher-margin risk business. The 
value of new business margin of 2.2% remains within our medium-term target 
range of 2% to 3%.

Gross flows declined by 9% due to the prior year including large transactions 
in Old Mutual Investments and Old Mutual Corporate, which did not repeat in 
the current year. Lower annuity sales and a decrease in demand for offshore 
investments in Personal Finance and Wealth Management also contributed to 
the decline in gross flows. This was partially offset by strong flows in Old Mutual 
Africa Regions and growth in the sales of savings products in China.

Message from the Chief Executive Officer continued

The Group reported negative net client cash flow 
for the year. This was primarily due to the decline 
in gross flows combined with large disinvestments 
and terminations in Wealth Management and Old 
Mutual Investments respectively. We are confident 
that the overall health of our pipeline will support 
improvements in net client cash flow. Our funds 
under management of R1.2 trillion declined by 4% 
due to weaker market performance in South Africa 
and globally. 

Results from operations increased to R8.7 billion, 
primarily driven by improved profits on the back 
of strong sales and core operational performance 
across the Group. Our life profits benefited from 
a refinement in hedging methodology, enabling 
a material release of excess discretionary margins, 
as well as lower mortality in the current year as the 
effects of COVID-19 eased. All remaining COVID-19 
provisions were released but the impact was 
mostly offset by the strengthening of our mortality 
basis to allow for endemic COVID-19 claims and 
worsened persistency as the challenging economic 
conditions continue to impact our retail customers.

The Group return on net asset value improved to 
11.1% due to strong growth in earnings and a lower 
average adjusted IFRS equity base, resulting from 
the unbundling of 12.2% of the Group’s stake in 
Nedbank in 2021, thus delivering on our promise to 
simplify the Group’s capital structure and provide 
a substantial return of capital to our shareholders. 
We remain committed to returning capital to our 
shareholders, with R59.3 billion returned through 
special distributions since 2018.

The Group solvency ratio remains robust at 190%, 
within our target range of 170% to 200%. Old 
Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa) 
Limited (OMLACSA) solvency ratio was at 214%, 
above the target range of 175% to 210%.

Our Dividend Policy targets an ordinary dividend 
cover range of 1.5x to 2x adjusted headline earnings. 
The Old Mutual Limited Board declared a final 
dividend of 51 cents per share, taking the full 
dividend for the year to 76 cents. Adjusting for the 
impact of Nedbank in 2021, dividend growth was 
up 13% from the prior year.

We have further earmarked between R1 billion and 
R1.5 billion for return to shareholders as a share 
buyback and we have initiated approval processes 
with the Board and Prudential Authority.

Insurance Company Limited and ONE Financial 
Services. With these deals now being concluded, 
we are shifting our focus to integration and 
realising synergistic benefits with our partners. 

We are also pleased to announce that we will 
acquire a strategic equity stake in the Two 
Mountains Group which is a licensed micro-insurer 
that distributes and underwrites funeral policies 
and provides burial services. The Two Mountains 
brand is well known and respected and will 
continue to operate under its own brand. This 
transaction will allow us to deliver a more holistic 
value proposition to customers and to grow our 
distribution reach within the communities we 
serve. The transaction is still subject to regulatory 
approvals customarily associated with such 
transactions.

Unlocking new growth engines
We are making good progress across our 
portfolio of new growth engines. While these 
currently represent a small part of our business, 
our investments in these initiatives are critical to 
ensuring sustainable growth over the long term. 
Most notably, we received regulatory approval to 
proceed with our application for a banking licence 
in South Africa. We are in the process of lodging 
a section 16 application in terms of the Banks 
Act. This represents a natural extension of our 
victory condition by enhancing our transactional 
capability to better sustain our customers’ financial 
prosperity.

Read more on pages 50 to 60 on our 
performance against our strategy 

Refer to segment performance on 73 to 92 
for detail on strategic activities delivered by 
segments during the year.

Outlook
The macroeconomic environment in our markets 
is expected to remain challenging, which will 
continue to exacerbate financial pressure on our 
customers. 

As a business firmly committed to helping South 
Africa and its citizens achieve their dreams and 
secure their financial futures, we are extremely 
concerned about the impact load shedding is 
having on lives and livelihoods. We will continue 
to support all moves to find and build alternative 
energy solutions that ensure long-term energy 

We have largely delivered on our medium-term 
targets which were set for 2023. Our results from 
operations target for 2023 was to deliver the 2019 
results plus 5% to 10%. We have met this target 
on a comparable basis to 2019, excluding the cost 
of our transactional capability and NEXT176. This 
was achieved on the back of decisive and focused 
management actions through this recovery phase 
resulting in our sales and gross flows recovering 
to pre-COVID-19 levels. We have also exceeded 
our cost efficiencies target and remain within 
the ranges set for value of new business margin 
and Group solvency. Return on net asset value 
continues to recover and is approaching our cost 
of equity. Old Mutual Insure’s net underwriting 
margin is below our target range owing to the 
severe catastrophe events experienced during 
2022.

Reflecting on our strategy
The continued momentum in our value creation 
reinforces the appropriateness of our strategic 
choices. These choices are anchored in our victory 
condition of becoming our customers’ first choice 
while responsibly delivering long-term value for 
all our stakeholders. In 2022, we continued to shift 
our focus towards amplifying growth while we 
deliver on our victory condition. To amplify growth, 
we made steady progress over the year across 
our focus areas, namely growing and protecting 
the core and unlocking new growth engines as 
we work towards responsibly building the most 
valuable business in our industry.

Growing and protecting the core
Growth across our core (Southern African) 
businesses is underpinned by significant 
investments towards the digitalisation of our 
information technology infrastructure. These 
investments are central to transforming the 
customer and adviser experience, providing them 
with market-leading solutions and positioning us 
as their financial services partner of choice.

The year was also notable for several strategic 
partnerships and acquisitions, which helped 
expand our capabilities and physical reach across 
our South African businesses. These include the 
acquisition of equity stakes in Preference Capital, 
Versma Administrators, Primak Brokerage, Generic 

sustainability, while addressing the urgent needs 
of climate change.

On 24 February 2023, South Africa was grey listed 
by the Financial Action Task Force. Addressing 
crime and corruption, with a deliberate focus 
on rebuilding government institutions as well 
as appropriately tackling the issues of money-
laundering, proliferation, and terrorist financing 
is essential to restoring South Africa’s credibility 
and driving its recovery.

We continue to evaluate the impact of IFRS 17 
and refine the new financial reporting processes, 
systems and controls that will underpin our IFRS 17 
results. While IFRS 17 will not change the underlying 
fundamentals of our insurance business, our cash 
generation or our capital strength, it will significantly 
change how we report on our insurance business. 
We remain on track to report under IFRS 17 for the 
first time for the half year ended 30 June 2023 and 
restated comparative information for 2022 will be 
provided. We are through our recovery phase and 
have largely delivered on our medium-term targets 
one year ahead of schedule. Our next set of results 
will be prepared on an IFRS 17 basis and we will 
communicate the revised medium-term targets in 
due course.

We have demonstrated our ability to deliver on 
our strategy and our focus for 2023 will be to 
continue growing and protecting our core business, 
including focused management actions to address 
the economic and resultant persistency challenges. 
We seek to gain further market share in our retail 
businesses and unlock our new growth engines. We 
will continue to focus on driving shared value and 
sustainable growth for our customers, employees 
and the communities in which we operate.

I would like to thank the Chairman and the Board 
for the unwavering support provided throughout 
2022. Thank you to my executive team for the 
support, passion and dedication you poured into 
this business. To all our stakeholders, thank you 
for your continued support and engagements. 
Finally, to all my colleagues, thank you for the 
resilience and demonstrating the ability to deliver 
on the commitments made to our investors and 
customers.

Imfundo means education in Nguni, an appropriate name for a 
trust that provides academic bursaries to grow the pool of qualified 

individuals in the asset management industry. The Imfundo Trust 
was created in 2011 by Old Mutual Investment Group and its affiliates, 

Futuregrowth and Marriott, as part of our commitment to the 
country’s transformation. 

The trust supports Old Mutual’s economic transformation strategy 
and helps address South Africa’s shortage of black investment 

professionals, with preference given to black women and individuals 
from peri-urban areas.

Macroeconomic environment 

To ensure the Group’s longevity, we monitor our external environment and consider this context in our annual 
strategy development processes to ensure we remain agile while executing our long-term strategy. We continue 
to adapt to our changing environment to ensure Old Mutual’s relevance into the future.

While 2021 was marked by significant post-COVID-19 growth, 2022 was characterised by the after effects of 
the rebound, including supply chain constraints, significant price increases and the ongoing impact of the 
war in Ukraine. These factors resulted in the strongest interest rate upcycle in many decades to fight the 
rise in inflation, causing global growth to slow from 6.2% in 2021, to 3.4% in 2022. 
 

Short term concerns are centred around the potential negative impact of continued load shedding. In 
rebuilding the economy, the inclusion of the private sector and shift in the energy policy should result in 
a lower impact than generally feared. 

The economic growth rate and public debt of South Africa is in a better economic position than it was 
four years ago. Expected economic growth sits at an average of 2.5% a year over the medium term, 
compared with only about 1% between 2015 and 2019 annually. 

Looking ahead, economic activity in 2023 continues to be hampered by significant interest rate 
increases as central banks attempt to combat rising inflation caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Severe 
COVID-19 lockdowns in China dampened growth in 2022, with the recent reopening paving the way 
for a faster than expected recovery. The International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook for 
April 2023 forecasts global economic growth of 2.8% for 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, the South 
Africa Reserve Bank increased the repo rate by a cumulative 75 basis points to control inflation. The 
International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook for April 2023 has forecast growth in Sub-
Saharan Africa at 3.6% for 2023. 

Lagos, Nigeria – Coordinates 6.4570° N, 3.3708° E

  The economies of countries in our African region continued to record 
positive year-on-year GDP growth, albeit subdued. 

  In Kenya, Malawi and Ghana, the fiscal pressures resulting from increased 
debt repayments forced governments to turn to the International 
Monetary Fund for support. Furthermore, in Malawi, acute dollar shortages 
led to fuel shortages and challenges in meeting dollar-denominated 
obligations. 

General currency depreciation and inflationary pressures across most markets, driven by higher energy 
and food prices, continued to threaten economic recovery following the pandemic. Despite this, the 
overall COVID-19 recovery was much better than expected, which supported the return to profitability 
of our Life businesses in Namibia, eSwatini, Kenya and Uganda. In most countries, COVID-19 infections 
drastically reduced and the majority of restrictions were relaxed across all markets.
 

These economic conditions led to reduced customer spending due to lower disposable income and 
poverty levels, which have limited the affordability of insurance and savings products.

In South Africa, inflation averaged 6.9% in 2022, up from 4.5% in the prior year, supported by increased fuel 
and food prices. The South African Reserve Bank raised the policy rate by a cumulative 325 basis points 
during 2022 to combat rising inflation. This, together with a relative slow recovery in employment post 
COVID-19 and the lingering impacts of the 2021 civil unrest, negatively impacted real income growth.

This downward pressure on disposable income growth, combined with depressed confidence made it 
difficult for customers to maintain or increase their contributions to protection, savings and investment 
products. Our corporate customers’ growth and liquidity levels were also negatively impacted.

Industry trends

Digitalisation
Rapid advancements in digital technology, further aided by the COVID-19 pandemic, are causing 
significant disruption across the financial services industry. The democratisation of technology means 
more people are able to interact and consume through digital channels, as devices and the cost of 
data become more affordable. Customer expectations of their service providers are increasingly shaped 
by their interactions in adjacent industries, for example, the retail sector. As a result, expectations of 
financial services providers are high and include elements such as customised or personalised solutions 
and 24/7 always-on service. Digital technologies are being deployed across the value chain to improve 
the customer experience and support the delivery of personalised solutions, drive improved operating 
efficiencies and create opportunities for new revenue streams.

Non-traditional market entrants and the rise of platform-based 
ecosystems
Industry convergence, which sees companies enter into previously unrelated industries, continues 
to gain momentum. This translates to increased competition as we see the likes of non-traditional 
competitors, such as retailers and mobile network operators, expand their offerings into financial services. 
The democratisation of digital technologies has also played a role in the rise of fintechs, insurtechs and 
platform-based ecosystems. These companies often focus on a single, disaggregated point of the value 
chain, be it distribution, fraud detection, pricing or offering a single financial services solution.

In South Africa, most financial services providers have integrated some type of fintech into their offerings 
through their digital channels or have established standalone business units focusing on technology-
related innovations. In other areas, we see traditional and established insurers partnering with fintechs and 
insurtechs by providing underwriting expertise. Fintech offerings are increasingly being included in the 
armory of more established insurers, especially in the Property and Casualty arena.

Platform-based ecosystems differ 
from traditional, linear business 
models because value is derived from 
creating and facilitating connections 
across a range of market participants. 
Embedded finance is a growing feature 
which is closely linked to ecosystem 
business models, where financial 
services are seamlessly integrated 
into technology-based platforms. This 
presents both an opportunity and 
a risk; it provides financial services 
players an opportunity to participate 
in these platforms. However, the 
platform owners may reduce the role of 
intermediaries in financial services incumbents.

Our long-term relevance depends on how adaptable we are to change. As part of the ongoing monitoring of our 
environment, we identify the most material and enduring trends that are shaping our operating landscape. 

An important contributor across several of these trends is the technological revolution brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which has further accelerated as a result of COVID-19. Consequently, these 
trends should not be viewed in isolation as they have the ability to disrupt the broader industry. The trends described below are materially unchanged from last year. They represent the most material and enduring 
trends impacting our business. 

Blockchain technology can ease the administrative burden on customers by replacing the 
manual process of filing claims with an automated system built on a blockchain ledger.

Unique data collected at a granular, customer level through wearable devices and the 
internet of things allows for product development and pricing which is personalised to 

each individual’s circumstance.

Artificial intelligence and robotics can be used to create robo-advisers. Robo-advisers 
aim to offer an intuitive and intelligent interaction for customers who prefer self-directed 
channels, with little human interaction. They have the added benefits of being accessible 

24/7 and at a lower cost than traditional, intermediated channels. 

Despite this increased pace of digital advancement, the nature of our insurance, investment and 
wealth management products still requires face-to-face engagement to share the necessary financial 
advice required across many segments of the market. The human element still plays a critical role 
in building trust in financial solutions whose benefits are only realised over the longer term. The role 
of digital technology in this context is therefore more nuanced. It plays a bigger role in enabling an 
improved customer and intermediary experience through the application of these technologies 
across various points in customer and intermediary journeys.

user journeys

Financial inclusion across Africa
Financial inclusion is an important factor in driving economic growth. Improvements in financial 
inclusion also translate to broader societal benefits such as reduced poverty and inequality levels and 
more resilient communities. Financial inclusion across sub-Saharan Africa has grown in recent years, 
supported by innovative digital financial solutions such as mobile money. Regulatory developments 
have also supported this by creating enabling policies to stimulate formal financial inclusion. However, 
formal inclusion, in the form of bank account and insurance penetration, remains well below that of 
developed markets.

Partnering for success
Collaborating with partners provides opportunities to deliver shared value. It leverages the strengths 
and capabilities of various role-players to drive meaningful growth. In the broader macroeconomic 
context, the role of corporates is evolving with the recognition that the private sector can make a 
greater collective impact through public-private partnerships. Within the private sector itself, the role of 
external commercial partners to drive growth and support strategic delivery has gained importance in 
recent years. 

Public-private partnerships 
Governments across Africa are increasingly turning to public-private partnerships as a means of 
sustainably uplifting communities and delivering meaningful socio-economic impact. This is driven 
by their capital budgets facing constraints as a result of weak economic growth and competing 
development priorities. A cumulative $63 billion was invested in public-private partnerships across 
sub-Saharan Africa from 2010 to 2022, with almost $42 billion of this allocated to investments in the 
electricity sector (World Bank).

Insurance penetration across the Africa region remains considerably underdeveloped, relative to South 
Africa and developed markets. The core drivers of increased penetration are consumer affordability and 
financial literacy. While household disposable incomes are expected to gradually increase over the long 
term, African consumers in particular remain prone to exogenous shocks and live close to the poverty 
line. From a financial literacy perspective, insurance products are also typically more complex and 
intangible compared to banking products, which constrains product uptake across the retail consumer 
market. This is more evident across sub-Saharan Africa, where trust, understanding and awareness 
remain considerable barriers, particularly for life insurance products that are long term in nature. As a 
result, most of Africa’s insurance relates to short-term insurance. 

While these themes are supportive of micro-insurance as a growth opportunity across the continent, 
profits from this class of business are unlikely to emerge in the short to medium term. Investments 
made in micro-insurance should be considered over a longer timeframe and as a market development 
initiative.

Strategic partnerships in the private sector
Strategic partnerships in the private sector seek to deliver specific business outcomes to the mutual 
benefit of both parties. Partnerships are generally entered into to access new distribution channels or 
different capability sets. Strategic partnerships also feature high on the corporate innovation agenda, 
in the form of partnering and investing in start-ups that have specialised digital capabilities. Overall, 
strategic partnerships enable a sustained level of innovation, speed of execution and capital-efficient 
value creation through access to multiple ecosystems and diverse customer bases.

The new world of work
While COVID-19 was the initial trigger to disrupt traditional models of working, organisations continue 
to adapt their responses to workforce and workplace changes in what is now called ‘the new normal’. 
Although social distancing requirements were the primary accelerator of the adoption of hybrid 
working models, employees are now re-evaluating their roles and contributions in the workplace, in 
conjunction with overall work-life balance. The pandemic demonstrated that remote work is possible 
with minimal disruption to productivity, thanks to the availability of broad-based internet and video 
communication tools, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Employees recognise the value of flexible 
working options, including remote working, but still seek a human touch and sense of connection. 
Individuals are also increasingly seeking meaningful employment that aligns to their personal values 
and purpose. 

Skills shortages and the war for talent
The confluence of digitalisation, industry convergence and the new world of work is placing acute 
pressure on skills availability and retention in the broader marketplace. Companies across industries 
and geographic borders are competing for the same skills in a limited pool of experienced candidates. 
The impact of the resultant supply-demand dynamic is three-fold. Firstly, the cost of talent acquisition 
is increasing as a result of the heightened demand and competition. Secondly, the time to fill a vacancy 
is lengthy as recruiters struggle to source and match the available skills to vacancies. Lastly, retaining 
existing talent is becoming more challenging given the worldwide demand and remote working 
possibilities for experienced employees. 

In addition to the heightened demand for strong technical skills, such as data and technology-related 
skills, the pandemic also brought into sharp focus the importance of soft skills. Particularly in a hybrid 
working environment, skills such as resilience, adaptability, self-awareness, empathy and influencing are 
growing in importance.

Employers are having to continuously adapt their recruitment and retention strategies to ensure they 
remain competitive and are able to successfully execute on their business strategies. This includes 
sourcing ‘talent on demand’ through a gig-based workforce that allows experienced professionals the 
ability to work on short-term contracts.

Climate change
The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest climate assessments (fifth 
and sixth reports) highlight the impact of global warming, including global increases in surface and 
ocean temperatures, global glacier reduction and high concentrations of greenhouse gases. The 
current global warming trajectory, with current policies in place, is predicted to reach 2.8°C by 21001. 
To avert extreme climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stresses the global 
temperature increase must not exceed 1.5°C by 21002. Africa has been identified as one of the regions of 
the world most susceptible to the impacts of climate change, despite contributing only 3.8% of global 
emissions. Temperatures in Africa are expected to rise by 2°C to 5°C during this century. Although 
isolated events cannot be attributed to climate change, extreme weather events are on the rise. 

Water: temperature increases lead to droughts, flooding and other evaporative losses

Agriculture: lower yields of important foods, damage due to rainfall changes and drought, 
changes to the ecology of plant pathogens

Health: heat stress, outbreak of transmittable diseases, increased fatalities and injuries

International agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, act as a global catalyst for climate change 
action through the commitments made by nations to collectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Paris Agreement aims to restrict global warming to below 2°C, ideally 1.5°C by 2100. In 2022, the 
COP27 summit focused on climate adaptation and mitigation in developing nations. Countries at the 
summit adopted a final agreement that establishes a fund for loss and damage to help developing 
countries bear the immediate costs of climate-fuelled events such as storms and floods.

One of the long-term outcomes of climate change and its effect on financial services providers will be 
the migration of people. It is expected that there will be an influx of people migrating from countries 
severely impacted by climate change to less impacted countries. While there will be an increased level 
of social and economic pressure in this scenario, there is also an expectation that many economically 
active individuals with capital resources will form part of the ‘climate migrants’. Financial services 
providers will need to find new ways to serve these migrants but can also use this opportunity to grow 
their customer base in terms of asset cash flows. The ability of insurers to effectively pool and price for 
risk events will also be impacted, given the shifts in people and weather patterns. The frequency and 
severity of claims could also increase due to the combined impact of these factors.

Regulatory changes

Reporting
IFRS 17
IFRS 17, a new international accounting standard for insurance contracts, effective for reporting periods 
starting from 1 January 2023, replaces IFRS 4. The new standard offers a comprehensive and consistent 
approach to accounting for insurance contracts – thereby removing inconsistencies, enabling greater 
transparency, and allowing investors and analysts to meaningfully compare insurers. While IFRS 17 
will not change the underlying fundamentals of our insurance business, our cash generation or our 
capital strength, it will significantly change how we report on our insurance business. IFRS 17 impacts 
all segments that issue term and life insurance, life annuities, disability insurance and Property and 
Casualty insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. During 2022, 
we focused on completing the development of our actuarial models, calculation engines, results 
repositories and finance system updates to ensure successful adoption across the Group. We also 
prepared the opening balance sheet for IFRS 17, required as at 1 January 2022. We remain on track 
to report under IFRS 17 for the first time at our 2023 interim results.

At Old Mutual, we support all changes to regulatory and reporting standards that promote financial 
stability or inclusion, encourage uniform market practices and ensure customers are treated fairly. While 
this could potentially impact the cost of doing business and our non-compliance risk, we mitigate this 
by strengthening our compliance capabilities and the systems and processes we have in place. 

Refer to our 2022 Annual Financial Statements for more information on the financial impact of IFRS 17 adoption

Tax legislation changes
We have highlighted the material changes to tax legislation in the countries in which we operate.

South Africa
 » The South African National Treasury reduced the corporate income tax rate from 28% to 27% and 
has also, in considering the implementation of IFRS 17, provided for six and three-year transitional 
adjustment to day one impact of adopting the new accounting treatment for long-term and short-
term insurers respectively. 

Southern Africa
 » In Zimbabwe management fees expenditure from local related parties in excess of the allowable 
deductions will be deemed a dividend subject to resident shareholder tax of 15%

 » In Namibia, thin capitalisation measures disallow the deduction of interest or realised currency losses 
on the portion of debt exceeding the 3:1 debt-equity ratio.

East Africa
 » In South Sudan insurance companies were previously exempt from paying tax, however, from 
18 July 2022 tax was levied at 10% and with effect from November 2022, this tax has been increased 
to 30%

 » Capital gains tax rate increased from 5% to 15% in Kenya, while from 1 January 2023, the Finance Act 
introduced a new transfer pricing documentation regime and expanded the scope of transactions 
with unrelated non-residents

 » Deductions of interest on debt in excess of a 7:3 debt:equity ratio will be disallowed in Tanzania as part 
of thin capitalisation measure

Privacy and data protection
 » We are serious about protecting customers’ personal information and the Group is finalising 
the governance and oversight controls and measures to manage compliance with the fully 
implemented Protection of Personal Information Act, 4 of 2013. 

 » There is a growing trend of privacy legislation being developed across our African regions. Ghana, 
Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe have in-force data protection legislation. In 
Botswana and eSwatini, data protection legislation have been enacted with transitional periods, 
while draft legislation was published in Namibia and Malawi. 

 » We continue to work with in-country compliance officers to ensure we implement privacy 
management processes that are aligned with local requirements and the Group’s standards.

Anti-money laundering
There are several emerging regulations relating to anti-money laundering and the combating of 
financing of terrorism out for comment and in draft. 
 » In South Africa, we are well positioned to comply with any amendments to the anti-money 
laundering legislative framework currently being finalised. 

 » South Africa was grey listed in 2023 – which means the country is identified to have strategic 
deficiencies in its policies to counter money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation 
financing by the Financial Action Task Force. This will have a significant impact on capital inflows into 
the country and our international business operations. We are working closely with our international 
asset and investment managers to understand the potential impact of a grey listing on our clients 
and our operations. 

 » Kenya and Namibia’s evaluation reports were published towards the end of 2022. The findings for 
Namibian were similar to South Africa’s. Tanzania was added to the Financial Action Task Force grey 
list in October 2022. 

Retirement fund reform
National Treasury’s retirement industry reforms, first released in mid-2022, include a proposed two-pot 
retirement system to encourage South Africans to preserve their retirement savings. The changes, which 
include partial compulsory preservation, will have far-reaching effects on South Africans, as well as fund 
administrators.

 » A material risk posed by the proposed amendments is that early access to retirement funds may result 
in fund outflows and could be a liquidity risk for fund administrators. Operationally, processes and 
systems will require substantial changes to accommodate the new requirements. 

 » While the effective date was moved from 1 March 2023 to 1 March 2024, the timelines for the industry 
to align operational processes and systems remain tight.

In addition to the above, several conduct-related standards are in the process of being finalised, 
including amendments to Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act, 24 of 1956.

International Reporting Standards Foundation
The consolidation of the Value Reporting Foundation, home to the Integrated Reporting Framework 
and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Standards, into the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) Foundation was announced in 2022. The IFRS Foundation has two standard-setting 
boards, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which will set the accounting standards 
and the newly created International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The objective is to create 
a global baseline of sustainability-disclosure, which will be connected to financial statements. The 
ISSB expects to issue an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard around the end of Q2 2023. The 
requirements of IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial 
Information and IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures are expected to be effective for periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2024.

DID YOU KNOW
Since its inception, the Old Mutual Masisizane Fund, in partnership 

with the Phakamani Foundation, has been steadily scaling up its 
successful micro-enterprise lending programme, addressing poverty 

and chronic unemployment in rural South Africa. 

Phakamani offers micro-business loans, training and support to the 
underprivileged women entrepreneurs of South Africa. First time 

loans range between R700 and R1 700, increasing to R15 000 once a 
good track record has been established. The repaid funds are used to 

fund the next group of women in the same communities, ensuring 
that the funds invested bring lasting impact to the entrepreneurs, 

their families and communities.

Our approach to risks and opportunities

Our risk strategy
Old Mutual’s strategy is informed by the Group’s risk strategy (appetite) and the Group Financial Management Framework, 
thereby establishing an integrated link between our business operations, risks and strategy. The Group Financial 
Management Framework defines how the Group allocates and manages capital and liquidity, including performance 
hurdles and growth targets to enhance shareholder value.

Our risk strategy follows a top-down approach. It guides risk-taking activities and ensures that we sustainably deliver on 
our strategic objectives. The guiding risk principles that underpin our risk strategy are: 
 » We optimise returns on a risk-adjusted basis
 » We focus on risks that align with our business strategy, areas of competitive advantage and evolving skills
 » Our tolerance for uncertainty is informed by the maturity and growth aspirations of our businesses
 » We use risk mitigation techniques to manage risk exposures
 » We recognise the value of diversification and the challenges of risk interconnectedness to avoid excessive risk 
concentration and ensure sustainability

 » We protect our reputation by maintaining trust with all our stakeholders

The Board, through the Risk committee, oversees the Group’s 
risk management activities. The Risk committee is responsible 
for approving the risk strategy and risk policy suite, as well as 
providing oversight of the risk management system and risk-
taking activities across the Group.

Our risk strategy process
Determining our risk preference for each risk 
category
The risk classification model forms the basis of our risk management 
system. We have a documented risk preference for key types.

Quantifying the risk appetite metrics for financial 
soundness, earnings at risk and liquidity
Risk appetite defines the level of risk exposure we are willing to accept 
in meeting our strategic objectives. Our financial resources and risk 
appetite determine the nature and level of growth that can be targeted, 
as they reflect the impact that assumed risk has on capital requirements 
and earnings volatility. We use stress and scenario testing to evaluate the 
earnings and balance sheet resilience in relation to our business plans and 
risk-taking activities.

Creating target ranges for our earnings at risk and 
statutory capital requirements
Our risk appetite metrics measure capital requirements, earnings and 
liquidity risks and ensure compliance with the Prudential Financial 
Soundness Standards. These are calibrated to allow us to manage an 
extreme downside scenario with sufficient resources to avoid regulatory 
intervention.

Allocating capital
Under the Group Financial Management Framework, we allocate capital 
and funding to segments within our risk appetite parameters. 

This process facilitates a disciplined and balanced approach to strategic 
risk-based decision making, opportunity assessment and resource 
allocation, which are expected to maximise value for investors in the long 
term.

Updating our risk strategy
We review our risk strategy annually and the Board approves any changes.

In 2022 we added specific risk appetite statements for business resilience 
and third-party risks. We also increased our earnings at risk limits to 
recognise the unbundling of Nedbank and an increase in credit risk 
resulting from improved measurement of the underlying risk.

An effective risk management system supports the sustainability and growth of our business and the ability to create 
long-term value for all our stakeholders. Our risk management process is designed to continuously monitor the 
internal and external environment for the purpose of identifying any conditions or changes that may require us to 
mitigate the related risks. This ensures that we remain within our risk appetite, achieve our business plans and realise 
our strategic objectives.

FRAMEWORK

STRATEGY 
AND 

BUSINESS
PLANNING

Business and risk strategy alignment is the process of ensuring that the risks assumed 
in our business plans reflect our risk preferences, considering the interconnectedness of risks 
and points of leverage within our risk mitigation activities. 

Risk measurement and response is focused on quantifying risks by considering the 
likelihood and impact of the risk and deciding on mitigating actions. Risks are quantified in 
three dimensions: 
»  Inherent: considering the likelihood of occurrence and impact (financial and non-financial) 

that the risk may have on the business, without considering any mitigating factors
»  Residual: considering the likelihood of occurrence and impact the risk may have on the 

business, after considering the control environment and any mitigating actions
»  Residual risk vs tolerance: comparing the residual risk to the risk appetite and preferences 

that are stipulated by the risk strategy for that type of risk

Once quantified, we consider the rating of the risk, together with our appetite for that kind of 
risk to determine a risk response and implement mitigating actions as appropriate.

Risk identification is focused on the identification of the key obstacles that can prevent us 
from achieving our business strategy and objectives. We categorise all our risks using our risk 
classification model to ensure consistent classification of risks and enable aggregation of similar 
risks across the Group to understand their full impact.

Risk monitoring is the ongoing process of assessing the control environment and the 
effectiveness of mitigating actions being taken to determine a residual risk rating. It considers 
the impacts of materialised risks, assurance work, indicators and changes in the external and 
internal environment on both our risks and controls.

Risk reporting is focused on comparing the residual risk exposures to our risk appetite, as 
articulated in our risk strategy, reporting on risks that are either outside of the targeted range 
or outside of our risk appetite

Risk management process

Stress and scenario testing is the process of evaluating the impact of specified scenarios 
on our financial position using several statistically defined probabilities. This facilitates the 
assessment of the resilience of earnings and our balance sheet based on our business plans 
and the various risk-taking activities.

The Group Financial Management Framework brings together capital and liquidity management principles with the business planning process, for the purpose of maximising shareholder value in the 
context of the Group’s risk strategy and resultant risk appetite. In doing so, the Group aims to balance competing stakeholder interests, including: 
 » Shareholders: who have expectations of earnings growth, revenue growth, operating margin, cash generation, dividend growth and return on capital
 » Regulators, debt holders and policyholders: who have expectations related to strong solvency and liquidity

and how it addressed risks, refer to page 35 and

Risk management process continued

 
The combined assurance plans provide the Board with an integrated view of all assurance activities 
related to the Group’s key inherent risks. We identify focus areas for a specific year by considering 
the current control environment, assurance work completed in prior years and a risk assessment. 
Quarterly reporting against the plans provides an integrated view of the outcome of all assurance 
activities, resulting in improved confidence in the effectiveness of internal controls. 

The risk function is responsible for developing and maintaining the Group Combined Assurance 
Framework. Independent assurance of the Group Combined Assurance Framework and process 
is provided on a periodic basis. 

Our three lines of assurance

Line 1 –  
management

 » Management is 
responsible for 
implementing an 
effective system of 
internal control, risk 
identification and risk 
management daily 
across the business. 
This line also includes 
specialist and Group 
functions such as tax, 
legal, information 
security and quality 
assurance functions.

Line 2 – 
internal assurance 

providers

 » Internal assurance 
providers are 
responsible for assuring 
the appropriateness 
and effectiveness of 
the risk management 
system, ensuring that 
policies and procedures 
are followed, and that 
reporting is accurate 
and complete. This 
line includes the risk, 
compliance, actuarial 
oversight and forensics 
functions.

Line 3 –  
independent 

assurance providers

 » Independent 
assurance providers 
are responsible for 
independent assurance 
of the effectiveness of 
governance, line one 
and two functions 
and the system of 
internal control. This 
line includes internal 
and external audit 
functions.

Combined assurance
  Our combined assurance processes are well established. Our philosophy 

is to build and sustain an integrated and coordinated approach across 
all three lines of assurance at all levels in the organisation. Our key focus 
is on collaboration and sharing information while ensuring appropriate 
coverage and avoiding duplicate work. 

  As a Group, we follow the three lines of assurance model, which defines 
clear accountabilities for the management of risk and the control 
environment.

Top residual risks continued

Growth risk

The risk of being unable to achieve and maintain profitable growth 
and be a dominant player in our chosen markets.

Business perspective
Adverse economic conditions increase cost-of-living expenses and 
decrease customers’ disposable income. Our corporate customers’ growth 
and liquidity levels were also negatively impacted. 

Non-traditional businesses and fintechs continue to move into the 
financial services space.

Impact
 » Planned new business sales are not achieved in our life and non-life 
businesses, affecting annual premium equivalent and gross written 
premium, respectively

 » Pipelines for asset flows and/or regular contributions do not materialise 
for our Old Mutual Corporate and Asset Management businesses

 » Persistency in our retail life and non-life Insurance businesses worsens
 » Expense to income ratios come under pressure as the book size 
becomes increasingly unable to support the fixed cost base

Key actions
 » Introducing new products and services with more flexibility for 
customers and rewards benefits

 » Scaling alternative distribution channels to drive direct business
 » Prioritising data analytics to drive customer insights and improve 
customer experience – this will promote customer acquisition and 
create cross-selling and upselling opportunities to drive growth

 » New growth engines in the form of our transactional capability are to 
be launched in 2024 as well as leveraging off partnerships in strategic 
growth markets

 » Focusing on corporate business growth across Old Mutual Africa 
Regions

Opportunities
 » Establishing a new capability to respond to opportunities created 
by rapidly changing market dynamics and deliver game-changing 
innovation to support sustainable, long-term growth

 » Exploring inorganic growth opportunities and addressing market 
consolidation in key Africa Regions

Sovereign risk

The risk that governments face challenges in stabilising and servicing the debt which they have issued.

Business perspective
We are directly exposed to sovereign risk through holdings of government bonds and State-owned Enterprise 
investments and indirectly via local banks through bank deposits and hedging strategies. We invest in long-dated 
sovereign and State Owned Enterprise debt instruments in our shareholder funds as well as to match the long-
term nature of the liabilities to hedge guaranteed products. Although default risk is low, a restructure of sovereign 
debt is possible if the fiscal position worsens over the long term. 

Impact
 » A sovereign crisis could reduce our customers’ investment returns and trigger value-for-money concerns in 
some portfolios

 » Depending on the severity, our capital and liquidity levels may be impacted, limiting our ability to invest in 
growth opportunities

 » In some of our Africa region businesses, a substantial portion of shareholder and policyholder funds are invested 
in sovereign debt or the local banking sector, which poses valuation risk to these assets should there be a 
sovereign default or debt restructure

Key actions
 » Introducing portfolio sectoral tilts into our investment portfolios to manage portfolio risk and reduce sovereign 
risk exposure

 » Reducing local bank exposure by increasing our exposure to offshore banks and other international counterparties
 » Rightsizing our exposure to State Owned Entities
 » Tailoring product range and investment strategies to mitigate this risk
 » Engaging with industry groups on how to respond to the systemic risk posed by a sovereign debt crisis
 » Developing a sovereign risk dashboard with forward-looking risk indicators to monitor the extent of sovereign 
risk exposure and enable proactive management decisions

 » Implementing and embedding the investment credit risk framework in our Africa regions
 » Setting appropriate credit risk appetite limits and early warning triggers to ensure actions can be taken 
timeously to correct unexpected performance deviations for institutional credit portfolios

Opportunities
 » Identifying investment and lending opportunities in sectors which show growth potential, resilience or are 
counter-cyclical

Non-life insurance risk

The risk of adverse impacts on our ability to write profitable 
Property and Casualty business.

Business perspective
Underwriting experience across our Property and Casualty 
businesses continues to be challenging, as are higher 
cancellations due to affordability concerns of customers. The 
higher inflation and shortages have increased the cost of parts, 
which has an impact on the cost of claims.

The reinsurance market has become increasingly difficult 
over the past few years, resulting in less capacity and higher 
premiums to transfer risk to a third party.

Impact
 » Increased claims due to the increased frequency and severity 
of weather catastrophes

 » Deterioration in the earnings of the Property and Casualty 
businesses due to losses and higher cancellations due to 
affordability concerns

 » Slow or negative growth in the book size of our Property and 
Casualty businesses

 » Increased retention of risk on the balance sheet of Property 
and Casualty businesses due to hardening reinsurance market, 
together with possible contraction in underwriting margins

 » Inflation has increased the cost of claims

Key actions
 » Exploring different reinsurance options across our entities that 
offer Property and Casualty products

 » Revising pricing and planned premium increases in 2022 and 
2023 on Property and Casualty products

 » Launching a retail top-up product to ensure indemnity level is 
maintained

 » Engaging with reinsurers and exploring capital-efficient solutions
 » Deliver process efficiencies and reduction in claims 
management costs, particularly on motor books 

Opportunities
 » Leveraging insights derived from the Climate Change Task 
Force

 » Partnering with other insurers, municipalities and third parties 
on climate change

 » Exploring opportunities to develop new products
 » Exploring partnerships with SMMEs linked to the insurance 
industry

Top residual risks continued

Life insurance risk

The risk that actual mortality and morbidity experience is 
worse than what we expected.

Business perspective
We provide insurance cover for a wide range of contingencies to 
our customers in the Life and Savings business. The mortality risk 
associated with providing this cover is aligned with our business 
strategy of offering life protection products.

Impact
 » Mortality and morbidity losses reduce earnings where 
experience is worse than expected

 » Where losses are expected to continue for the foreseeable 
future, they are capitalised in that year for the expected future 
losses, which multiplies the effect of a single-year loss

Key actions
 » Undertaking experience investigations in areas of concern and 
adjusting pricing accordingly

 » Re-evaluating the protection product strategy and future 
pandemics in product pricing

Opportunities
 » Refining the granularity of our rating categories for pricing 
purposes

 » Tilting business mix towards underwritten products in middle-
income market

 » Capturing cross-selling opportunities to increase customer 
needs met by writing disability, critical illness and other 
benefits in addition to death cover

Strategic execution risk

The risk of failing to effectively deliver on our material 
programmes in a timely manner to achieve our strategic
objectives.

Business perspective
There are several key change initiatives underway that will set us 
up as an organisation to achieve our strategy and business plan 
objectives.

Impact
 » Delays in progressing change initiatives could result in 
additional run costs, opportunities not being fully capitalised 
on and benefits not being timeously realised

 » Overlapping dependencies on key resources may lead to 
slippage and compression

 » Sustained pressure on key individuals could also impact staff 
wellbeing and retention

Key actions
 » Adopting a value chain-led delivery structure to support an 
agile delivery approach for strategic programmes

 » Back-filling key roles to not impact business as usual delivery
 » Ensuring the Old Mutual Prioritisation Board manages the full 
portfolio of change initiatives and capacity constraints

 » Implementing retention processes in key programmes

Opportunities
 » Driving strategic clarity based on delivering an integrated 
financial services experience for customers

 » Improving resilience, efficiency and agility against a changing 
external environment enabled by migrating information 
technology estate to the cloud

 » Delivering strategic mergers and acquisitions in the Africa 
region to drive scalability of businesses and support quality 
of earnings

 » Maturing our capability to drive innovation and partnerships 
to support growth

Top residual risks continued

Climate risk

The risk that global warming, extreme weather events and the transition to a low 
carbon economy will adversely impact economic growth, asset valuations and insurance 
profitability. These, in combination with increased costs of doing business could threaten 
the resilience and sustainability of our business.

Business perspective
Increased frequency and intensity of severe weather events can cause business disruption, and 
adversely impact claims experience and pricing of insurance products, particularly Property and 
Casualty business in the short term.

Policy shifts could lead to stranded assets and job losses from highly exposed industries, including 
fossil fuel investments.

Impact
 » Property and Casualty claims are increasing due to the rise in frequency and intensity of 
extreme weather events

 » Increased concentration risk by geography or sector due to physical climate risks or dependency 
on primary industries

 » Severe weather events have caused business disruption
 » Adverse non-life underwriting experience due to worsening claims from increased frequency 
and intensity of weather events

 » Reduced capacity in reinsurance markets to transfer risk off our own balance sheet
 » Increased price for securing reinsurance, which may have a knock-on effect on product pricing
 » Stranded assets triggering asset devaluations in highly exposed industries, including fossil fuel 
investments

 » The possibility of deterioration in mortality and morbidity, due to illness and food insecurity 
induced by extreme weather events

Key actions
 » Understand Old Mutual’s fossil fuel investment exposure, and influence action in investee companies 
on climate risk issues and developing a path to decarbonisation of our investment portfolios

 » As a responsible business, we are working to ensure that we minimise the carbon footprint of 
our own operations

 » Assessing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our businesses, strategy, 
financial outcomes, and developing response plans

 » Reviewing policy terms and conditions in conjunction with pricing to ensure these accurately 
reflect the risk exposures

 » Expand our investment projects which develop clean or green prower solutions

Opportunities
 » Exploring ways to develop market-leading products that will help our customers protect against 
climate risk and ensure we continue providing cover for our customers

 » Managing our own carbon footprint as a business by improving our energy management and 
waste recycling processes and creating alternative water supplies for our buildings

Technology and information security risk

The risk posed by heritage information technology infrastructure on our ability to achieve 
targeted customer and adviser experience, operating efficiencies and responding to ongoing 
cyber threats. Ongoing cyber threats pose a challenge to business resilience and data security.

Business perspective
A complex and ageing information technology infrastructure poses a threat to our targeted customer 
and adviser experience, as well as operating efficiencies. 

The evolving global threat landscape may result in Old Mutual being prone to intentional and 
unintentional cyber security attacks.

As we evolve our business model, it is critical we understand the risks introduced by third parties.

Impact
 » System downtime may disrupt servicing and sales processes
 » Customer and adviser experience may not meet expectations, ultimately impacting our growth 
ambitions

 » Process efficiencies and run costs may be compromised
 » Cyber security attacks could result in data, privacy or security breaches
 » Data privacy or security breaches occurring via third parties
 » Disruption of services due to temporary failure of critical third parties

Key actions
 » Adopting a cohesive, Group-wide approach to information technology architecture, business 
resilience and information security

 » Ongoing modernisation and simplification of application landscape, including completing our 
cloud migration

 » Optimising and application refactoring for South Africa
 » Delivering enhanced capabilities and digitalising our processes to satisfy the continuously changing 
demands of our customers and advisers, and increase efficiency for employees

 » Extending the reach and take-up of the MyOldMutual and digital adviser experience platforms
 » Implementing data mesh models
 » Ensuring a centralised capability for oversight of third-party risk management
 » Implementing a comprehensive security strategy to protect intellectual property, sensitive customer 
information and other business-critical information

 » Adapting and enhancing cyber risk monitoring and protection to address changing threats, 
including automated security testing and data protection tools

 » Implementing mandatory cyber risk training and awareness programmes, including phishing 
simulations

Opportunities
 » Improving customer and adviser experience by introducing new technologies
 » Improving operational efficiency and information security and reduced system downtime

Top residual risks continued

Market conduct risk

This risk could arise if our products and solutions are 
not performing as intended or servicing does not meet 
customers’ expectations.

Business perspective
The needs of our customers evolve with changes in the 
macroeconomic environment, their financial health and life 
events, and competitive activity. We need to be able to respond 
seamlessly to all of these.

Impact
 » Service challenges erode our brand promise and pose 
reputational risk

 » If our products are not perceived to be value for money, it will 
impact our growth and persistency

 » If our products are not flexible enough to adapt to changing 
financial health of customers, we may experience a 
deterioration in persistency

Key actions
 » Ensuring products perform in the manner communicated to 
customers at the point of sale

 » Embedding a refined Group Market Conduct Framework 
through the Board’s Responsible Business committee

 » Independently reviewing and challenging the value-for-money 
components of our products at both a design stage and on an 
ongoing basis

 » Introducing flexible resourcing to meet service demand, 
especially in times of high claims and transaction activity

 » Increasing automation of our servicing activities using robotics

Opportunities
 » Launching a new range of savings and investment plans, 
focusing on different time horizons, flexibility, and multiple 
distribution models to drive improved value for money and 
persistency

 » Driving digital engagement with our customers and continue 
to focus on quality advice

 » Focusing on the insightfulness of our campaigns to customers 
using meaningful data analytics

People risk

This risk arises from not attracting, developing and retaining 
the skills necessary to implement our strategic objectives, 
and from insufficient action to reduce the risk of burnout 
among key employees.

Business perspective
Specialist skills are required to deliver our strategic objectives, 
and increased remote working opportunities mean we are 
competing to retain and attract talent on a global scale. 

COVID-19 changed our ways of work and employee wellbeing 
and burnout have become an increasing concern. 

Impact
 » Retaining specialist skills is becoming more challenging, driven 
by the increase in global remote working opportunities – this is 
particularly of concern across the Africa regional businesses

 » Deterioration in employee wellness could impact delivery and 
service, including the execution of large programmes critical to 
our strategy

Key actions
 » Implementing a hybrid working model, with most staff working 
from home for part of the week

 » Developing a Group wellbeing strategy, due for 
implementation in 2023

 » Managing staff burnout risk by filling vacancies, effective 
prioritisation and capacity planning and anti-burnout strategies

 » Revising remuneration value propositions in line with local 
environments where we operate

Opportunities
 » Leveraging wider recruitment pools due to hybrid working for 
specialist skills

 » Marketing employee value proposition effectively to attract new 
skills

 » Offering retention bonuses for key staff
 » Delivering strategic initiatives

Business resilience risk

The risk of being able to minimise the impact of disruptions 
and maintain business operations at predefined levels due to 
internal and external causes.

Business perspective
Scenario planning assists us in assessing where we need to 
strengthen resilience to ensure smooth operations and a consistent 
customer experience despite challenges affecting operations.

Impact
 » Operational systems, people and processes are impacted to 
different degrees depending on the cause of the disruption, 
with knock-on impacts on reputation and market conduct

 » Human error in manual processes could result in financial losses
 » Inefficient processes could also result in poor customer service or 
non-compliance with regulatory requirements

 » Load shedding causes degradation of telecommunication 
services, including internet connectivity

 » Cyber incidents can adversely impact operations

Key actions
 » Strengthening our management and risk oversight of key third 
parties and service providers

 » Ensuring uninterrupted service levels by bringing contact centre 
employees back to the office full-time as part of the hybrid 
working model

 » Ensuring main campuses can support core processes during 
power disruptions, and supporting key roles with uninterrupted 
power supply devices

 » Implementing plans to deal with sustained load shedding
 » Established a Crisis committee, which is invoked if there is a major 
business resilience event

 » Ensuring our business continuity strategies outline how to operate 
should civil unrest occur

 » Focusing on business process documentation and automation to 
improve efficiencies and automate controls

 » Implementing control improvement programmes in areas of our 
business with less mature control environments

Opportunities
 » Responding to competitive advantages that exist for businesses 
that are better enabled to deal with extreme and/or unusual 
operating conditions seamlessly

 » Reducing the running expenses in the business through 
efficiency improvements initiatives

 » Decreasing loss events due to tight execution of automated 
processes

STRATEGY AND 
VALUE CREATION



Our strategy has been formulated taking into consideration our operating environment, evolving customer needs, the competitive landscape and rapidly changing technological advancements to ensure 
that we are able to sustainably deliver long-term value to all our stakeholders. It remains unchanged from last year and is anchored in our victory condition of becoming our customers’ first choice. Our five 
interconnected strategic pillars describe how we will go about delivering on our victory condition. Collectively, they aim to drive brand differentiation, provide holistic solutions that meet changing customer 
needs and enable a seamless transition between face-to-face and digital experiences. We draw on our talented and engaged employees to achieve these objectives. Our five value drivers create a link between 
our strategic actions and the value creation impact for the Group. They also help inform the prioritisation of these actions to ensure maximum value creation for customers and shareholders alike. 

Our strategy

Creating shared value and sustainable transformation is at the core of how we do business. We recognise that the 
success of our business is integrally linked to the wellbeing of the communities we form part of and operate in. In 
building the most valuable business in our industry, we strive to create a positive and sustainable impact across our 
communities, the environment and broader society.

support customers, their families 
and communities.

We will aim to be always 
present first 
by ensuring that propositions and 
advice are available to customers 
when and how they need them and 
ensuring a top-of-mind brand.

We will build rewarding digital 
engagement
by using advice and customer data 
considerately and effectively.

Our high-performing,  
engaged employees 
will make meaningful contributions 
to achieve our purpose, victory 
condition and values.

We will deliver solutions that 
lead 
in service and performance for 
insurance, investments and 
supporting banking needs.

Our stakeholders

Bokamoso Solar Park, Klerksdorp, South Africa – Coordinates 27.1582° S, 26.4007° E

Value is created by and within an organisation through relationships. We create value for the organisation that affects 
the financial returns to our investors, our stakeholders and society at large through our activities, interactions and 
relationships. Our stakeholders are those individuals or groups that have a material interest in our decisions and 
activities. Our stakeholders provide useful insights about matters that are important to them, including economic, 
environmental and social issues that affect our ability to create value.

Stakeholder management
Three core commitments form the foundation of our stakeholder engagement mandate.

Our first commitment is to create value for all our stakeholders. Knowing our stakeholders and 
understanding their needs is important to us, as this forms the basis of all our relationships. Wherever 
there is shared value, there is a lasting commitment to building and growing together.

Our second commitment is to adhere to strong corporate governance in the management of all our 
relationships. Our Stakeholder Relations Policy ensures that the standards by which we operate across 
all our markets are in line with international best practices and King IV.

Our final commitment is to follow a method of structured strategic engagement, allowing us to 
monitor and evaluate the quality of our relationships and their impact on the communities we serve.

To fulfil these commitments we manage, govern and monitor our stakeholder engagements.

Our subsidiaries’ Boards adopt Old Mutual Limited’s Stakeholder Relations Policy and ensure that the 
applicable requirements are implemented and complied with. Subsidiary Boards must ensure local 
regulatory requirements are included in the policies adopted at a subsidiary level.

We are proud of our decision as a business to be a responsible social partner within our markets, actively 
participating in industry bodies and professional associations that seek to drive financial inclusion 
in Africa. We are purposeful about lending our voice to conversations that shape the future of our 
continent, using international platforms such as New Partnership for Africa’s Development, UN Higher 
Commission for Refugees and the World Economic Forum to support the global sustainability agenda.

We engage with our stakeholders regularly in the ordinary course of doing business to understand, 
account for and respond to their needs and interests. We strive to build trust and a willingness to engage 
among our stakeholders to continuously improve the quality of our relationships.

Manage

Our dedicated stakeholder 
relations function ensures 
we observe effective 
industry and international 
practices in managing the 
requirements and views of 
our stakeholders.

Govern

The Responsible Business 
committee is responsible 
for oversight over effective 
stakeholder engagement on 
behalf of the Board and in 
line with policy, governance 
codes and best practice.

Monitor

The Board monitors the 
quality and effectiveness 
of our stakeholder 
relationships and 
engagements.

Stakeholder value creation

Our interactions with stakeholders can materially influence our decisions, actions and business performance. 
Therefore, we must monitor and measure these relationships in a way that is effective and transparent. By 
understanding the needs and priorities of our stakeholder groups, we ensure our Group strategy facilitates behaviours 
that are mutually beneficial. Furthermore, as much as is possible, our stakeholders have the opportunity to provide 
input into those decisions that could potentially impact them. By following this approach, our strategy safeguards our 
business performance, protects our licence to operate and ensures our external relationships deliver value to both our 
Group and stakeholders.

In line with our victory condition of becoming our customers’ first choice, we are continually exploring how we can 
better understand and serve our customers while generating sustainable long-term value for all our stakeholders. We 
continue to make strategic investments to secure Old Mutual’s future growth and build the financial services business 
of the future. Our investments represent our response to rapid changes in market trends and our customers’ needs 
and preferences. These investments also reflect our commitment to securing our collective futures – not only for our 
company, but for our customers, communities and the businesses that we partner with.

Enhancing value creation by investing in long-term growth

These businesses are currently in their infancy, with a considerable amount of investment required to build the requisite infrastructure and capabilities. They 
have been deliberately set up in a way that allows us to swiftly adapt to new trends as they emerge and deliver new solutions at pace. We remain steadfast in 
our belief that doing the right thing for customers will translate into sustainable financial value over the long term.

NEXT176 was established in August 2021 as our New Growth and Innovation Office, with a mandate to accelerate the 
growth and innovation agenda at an enterprise level. Over the past year, we focused on developing its brand identity, 
strengthening its team, as well as developing and exploring innovative new solutions and partnerships.

The NEXT176 brand was launched to the market in H2 2022. Conceptualised and announced 176 years after Old Mutual was 
formed, it represents an extension of the core Old Mutual brand and the start of the next 176 years of creating shared value 
across emerging economies through disruption, innovation, and sustainable growth.

Our application for a banking licence 
in South Africa brings us a step closer 
to delivering on our victory condition 
by enhancing our ability to sustain our 
customers’ prosperity. We have existing 
lending and transactional solutions in 
South Africa, consisting of our Money 
Account and an unsecured lending 
product.

Our current transactional solution 
is delivered through a commercial 
arrangement with a third-party bank. 
Securing our own banking licence allows 
us to hold the primary relationship with 
our customers. This will drive greater 
regular interaction with them and 
enhance the cross-sell opportunity 
across our businesses. 

We are building this transactional 
capability using the latest technology 
to allow enhanced servicing and 
personalisation. This, together with 
a cloud-based technology stack, will 
enable us to deliver cost-effective, 
flexible and scalable solutions to our 
customers. We are on track to launch our 
proposition in the second half of 2024.

Investing in our South 
African transactional 
banking capability

Amplifying our growth through NEXT176

Meeting customer needs through ecosystem-based 
business models
We aim to make a meaningful impact on our customers’ lives through our 
ecosystem approach; solving friction points in the following ecosystems with 
attractive growth potential, where we have a “right to win”.

We will deliver value by:

 Building new growth ventures across our priority ecosystems to 
enhance our businesses of today and build businesses of tomorrow

 Investing in companies for either distribution or capability across key 
ecosystems and target sectors

Partnering with large scale businesses to unlock the benefits of 
embedded finance to customers

Since launch, we have committed R300 million in capital towards NEXT176. We 
are currently incubating five ventures across these ecosystems, including:
i)  Our digital wills offering that continues to show good growth with more 

than 9 000 wills finalised on the platform since its launch in October 2021. 
We recently concluded the acquisition of a digital wills platform, QuickWill, to 
further grow and scale this venture.

ii)  Through Oystar, we are solving friction points for owners, teachers and 
parents in the early childhood development ecosystem with more than 
1 000 early childhood development centres active on the platform at 
the end of the year. 

We also made strategic investments into CoverGo (a ‘no code’ insurtech 
platform) and WIZZIT (a mobile payment solutions company).

Our remuneration philosophy underpins our Group strategy in supporting a high-performance 
culture that remunerates engaged employees who make meaningful contributions to achieve 
the Group’s purpose, victory condition and values. Our core remuneration principles support 
this philosophy and are underpinned by our fair and responsible pay approach, ensuring that 
remuneration across the Group is externally relevant, internally equitable and supports the 
delivery of the Group’s short, medium and long-term objectives. 

With effect from the beginning of 2023 our variable pay approach at Old Mutual includes a 
short-term incentive and a deferred performance award. 

A single Group scorecard applies to both the short-term incentive and deferred performance 
award creating aligned focus across the organisation. The Group scorecard is closely aligned to 
the Group’s strategic direction and objectives and measures delivery against financial, strategic 
and ESG-linked objectives. 

The majority of the incentive outcome remains linked to financial performance. As in the 2022 
scheme, operational profit delivery drives the creation of the short-term incentive pool. This 
creates a direct link to financial value creation. The scorecard then increases or decreases the 
short-term incentive pool depending on wider business performance.

The outcome of the deferred performance award will similarly be driven by financial 
performance with a 65% weighting to this category. Capital efficiency, as measured by return on 
net asset value, has a high weighting given the focus on ensuring an efficient use of capital in 
delivering shareholder outcomes. In addition, total shareholder return relative to peers and the 
broader market has been included for 2023. This closely aligns the experience of shareholders 
with that of management. The vesting period of the awarded shares is between two and four 
years, further aligning management outcomes with those of shareholders.

Delivery of value drivers measured through the 
following performance metrics

Financial
Return on net asset value remains a core component of the scorecard with the largest weighting. This assesses the 
efficient use of capital in delivering shareholder outcomes with performance measured against cost of equity.

Value of new business and value of new business margin remain critical components of the scorecard. Value of new 
business assesses the growth in life business through profitable new business. Targets are set relative to nominal 
gross domestic product +1% indicating the need to grow ahead of the nominal growth in the economy. Value of new 
business margin assesses the efficiency of this profit generation with targets set relative to our medium-term targets.

Gross flows and gross written premiums represent growth across Life and Savings, Asset Management and Property 
and Casualty through new and existing business. Targets are similarly set relative to growth ahead of the economy.

Relative total shareholder returns aligns the outcome for management with that of shareholders. Performance is 
assessed relative to peers (specifically Alexander Forbes, Discovery, Momentum Metropolitan Holdings and Sanlam) 
and relative to the Capped SWIX 40 benchmark. Targets are set with performance in line with the peer group or 
broader market required before an incentive is achieved. 

Strategy
Integrated financial services refers to our strategy of offering a comprehensive suite of financial services to meet 
our customers’ needs as they navigate their life-long financial journeys. Our customers benefit by having multiple 
products from us and from making good financial decisions. Performance will be measured quantitatively against 
a scorecard agreed with the Remuneration committee and aligned with the internal business plan. The scorecard 
focuses on delivering our bank build within the project timelines and budget, improving our propositions and 
growing our Old Mutual Rewards membership.

Old Mutual Africa Regions remains a key area of growth for the Group and strategic progress will be measured 
quantitatively against targets agreed with the Remuneration committee, with a focus on financial performance.

ESG
Employees – The employee engagement index is a component of the culture and engagement index in the current 
2022 long-term incentive. This index measures the engagement levels of employees using energy, commitment 
and positive feeling as metrics. These dimensions have been selected based on research into their link to improving 
service delivery and operational support which are closely linked to better outcomes for our customers. Therefore, as 
our organisational culture improves, our customer satisfaction and brand reputation will improve.
Customer growth and experience – A quantitative assessment of the growth we are driving in our retail customer 
base together with the experience of our customers. This is made up of:
 » Average needs met per customer in the retail segments
 » Customer numbers in the Mass and Foundation Cluster and in Personal Finance
 » Net Promoter Score across our South African businesses

All three metrics continue from the 2022 incentive schemes.
Green economy – This dataset demonstrates Old Mutual’s contribution towards investing in a sustainable economy, 
focused on renewable energy, agriculture, affordable housing, water, health, transport and education.
The Old Mutual green economy taxonomy categorises which assets have an active positive impact on the 
sustainability of the economy according to global best practice criteria. Our taxonomy was developed with the 
European Green Economy Taxonomy as the guiding framework. 
This metric measures the growth in new business across our Listed Equity and Alternatives Green Economy funds and 
propositions. This is a strong contributor to building a better, more sustainable future and works alongside our net 
zero commitments.
These funds have a positive social impact, as well as a positive impact on the environment and the economy at 
large. Success in this area therefore reflects our ability to develop propositions that balance impact with delivering 
compelling investment outcomes.

deferred performance award)

How do we deliver this
We aim to make it evident that Old Mutual cares through solutions and actions that support 
customers, their families and communities. Accordingly, we offer our customers accessible, 
affordably priced solutions and support them through our financial education initiatives. As a 
responsible asset owner and manager, we also make sure our responsible investment practices 
incorporate ESG-related considerations into investment decisions.

We also demonstrate care by treating all stakeholders fairly and ensuring that we create shared 
value by contributing towards positive economic, environmental and social outcomes. These 
are incorporated into our Sustainability Framework and span education and skills development, 
financial education and inclusion, entrepreneurship, humanitarian and disaster risk reduction, 
employee volunteerism and stakeholder management.

Environmental impact
 » Climate is our primary environmental focus. We became one of the signatories to the Africa Business 
Leaders Coalition Climate Statement, released at COP27. The statement includes commitments 
around adaptation and resilience, a just transition and mitigation, and calls to action the international 
community to support Africa in these endeavours. We reported our South African Scope 1 and 2 
emissions, and part of operational Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, to the CDP and achieved a B 
rating. The Old Mutual Investment Group pioneered a low-carbon investment product that is 40% less 
carbon-intensive than the Capped SWIX 40.

Financial education and inclusion
 » Our extensive portfolio of financial education and inclusion initiatives reaches customers 
and communities in the 13 African countries we operate in. Our programmes are designed 
to connect with people from both urban and rural communities, and are available through 
digital and face-to-face mediums to ensure content is easily accessible to everyone. 
Across Africa, our financial education initiatives reached over 36.6 million people (2021: 
22 million). As part of our Learn.Think.Do initiative, we developed financial literacy content 
in several South African official languages to distribute across key platforms. In Kenya, we 
supported the development of a teacher training course to embed financial literacy in the 
competency-based curriculum for rollout in 2023.

Entrepreneurship 
 » We help entrepreneurs build resilient and successful businesses. Our offerings are 
designed to provide an integrated commercial service offering while delivering impactful 
solutions. This spans customised funding solutions, market access facilitation and 
mentoring and coaching. We reached 5 270 (2021: 4 600) SMEs and committed R290 million 
(2021: R260 million) in South Africa. The Masisizane Fund disbursed R102.8 million (2021: 
R62.8 million), up 68% from 2021.

Education
 » Our education initiatives are designed to impact the entire education value chain to support 
meaningful systemic impact. Our approach starts from early childhood development through 
to tertiary education – in preparation for employment or entrepreneurship. Our Education 
Flagship Programme focuses on literacy and numeracy, with a focus on home language 
content development. In 2022, we loaded 356 school-owned devices with digital mathematics 
content and distributed 6 200 mathematics and reading books. We also supported the 
development of two Xitsonga grade 1 books. We invested R4.8 million in higher education 
bursaries across the accounting, information technology and actuarial science fields. 

Humanitarian and disaster support
 » We offer humanitarian support to communities that suffer from natural or man-made 
disasters. We provide support through our internal response capability, like the Old Mutual 
Foundation, coupled with our external partner network, such as Habitat for Humanity 
South Africa. Our humanitarian and disaster support initiatives totalled R53 million in 2022 
(2021: R14 million). We provided extensive support to the communities affected by the 
floods in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, including providing food and shelter. Longer-term 
interventions include a R30 million facility to rebuild 80 homes by the end of 2024.

What we aim for
Offering our customers the right solution (product, service and advice) at the right time and 
through the channel of their choice. 

By understanding our customers individually, and with the support of superior engagement 
levels and leading solutions, we will be the preferred brand for the solutions we offer.

How do we deliver this
We will maintain our dominance across our physical channels and modernise our traditional 
distribution advantage by digitally enabling our intermediaries. We will integrate the best 
parts of our physical solutions with digital solutions to provide a seamless, integrated customer 
experience across all touchpoints. Enhancing our physical reach with a digital presence will help 
us be ‘always present’. This is further supported by a strong brand presence to ensure that when 
customers think of financial services, they think of us first.

company (Old Mutual), the next time they purchase a financial services product.

 » Marginal decline to 67% (2021: 70%) of our SA Net Promoter Score, which is a measure of customer 
satisfaction.

 » Used WhatsApp, USSD and the MyOldMutual web-based platform to process more than 53 000 
claims (2021: 65 000) in South Africa. Although the volume of overall claims processed reduced year 
on year, the percentage of processes on web-based platforms is in line with 2021.

 » Expanded the rollout of the MyOldMutual app to East and West Africa and Zimbabwe. Customers are 
able to register, view their portfolio and product offerings, request a call-me-back and submit the first 
notification of loss to make a claim.

 » Expanded the rollout of non-app-based channels across our African regions. Customers can now 
interact with us using USSD in Nigeria and WhatsApp in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.

Building brand equity in East Africa
A significant milestone in 2022 was the rebranding of our Rwandan and Kenyan businesses 
to Old Mutual. This was a culmination of a multi-year process that started in 2015 when Old 
Mutual acquired a controlling stake in UAP Holdings (broader East Africa) and Faulu (Kenya). 
The rebranding of Uganda is the next focus. 

Following these acquisitions, we aimed to migrate the East African brands to Old Mutual in two 
stages: a dual brand (UAP-Old Mutual) in 2017, followed by a single brand. A one-brand strategy 
across the region allows us to leverage our heritage and brand power to become a source of 
growth across East Africa. 

Benefits of the rebrand

Reignite staff and 
intermediary passion in 
the business

Strengthen our 
relationships with 
customers

Grow the business 
through the strength of 
the parent brand

Digitally enabling our intermediaries

Face-to-face distribution is our primary channel for advice-led sales and represents the tangible 
experience of the trust the Old Mutual brand is known for. Our intermediaries are an important 
element of our internal ecosystem. By investing in the digitalisation of the intermediary 
proposition, we aim to make it easier for them to do business with us and, by extension, be better 
equipped to serve our customers.

We defined the digital adviser experience to give customers a future-fit experience while 
delivering quality and service improvements for our advisers. New functionality developed 
include digital leads and campaign management, an improved 360-degree view of the 
customer, the delivery of customer insights via new digital channels and enhanced servicing 
capabilities via web and mobile-based applications.

Rewarding digital engagement

What we aim for
Delivering a meaningful and personalised customer experience integrated across digital and 
face-to-face mediums through the MyOldMutual platform. 

Our goal is to convert our customer base to multi-product consumers by effectively leveraging 
advice and customer data, supported by meaningful incentive structures.

How do we deliver this
We will convert our understanding of our customers’ goals and circumstances to provide 
personalised, regular and meaningful engagement. We do this by educating, encouraging and 
rewarding customers for taking consistent action towards achieving their personal financial 
goals.

At the centre of this intent is MyOldMutual, a pan-African digital platform aiming to deliver a 
seamless and integrated customer experience across our full suite of capabilities. This includes 
financial advice, financial education, rewards, data-driven nudges and a full suite of modular 
products. This will enable us to offer customers the right solutions at the right time, helping

Rewarding digital engagement

Old Mutual Rewards
Apart from incentivising good financial behaviour, 
the Old Mutual Rewards programme aims to reward 
customers for meeting more of their financial needs 
with Old Mutual. This helps us get closer to becoming 
their lifetime financial partner of choice. Membership 
numbers reached 1.8 million in 2022, with 1.4 million 
of these being Old Mutual customers. Customers who 
are members of Old Mutual Rewards have 35% higher 
average needs met (2021: 30%) and take out products 
for additional financial needs at twice the rate of non-
members. Our efforts to enhance the programme 
were also recognised in the loyalty industry, and the 
programme was commended in three categories 
at the 2022 South African Loyalty Awards for Best 
Loyalty Programme of the year – Financial Services, 
Best Short-Term Loyalty Marketing Campaign and 
Best Long-Term Loyalty Programme.

We introduced the following functionality and 
feature enhancements in 2022:
 » Members have the option of completing a 
fitness assessment with a biokineticist to earn 
fitness bonus points. This was introduced as an 
alternative to taking part in qualifying endurance 
activities at least every six months.

 » We integrated additional functionality into the 
MyOldMutual app. This included programme 
sign-up and activities for earning points.

 » We introduced the redemption of points via 
WhatsApp.

 » We launched several enhancements to better 
integrate the Old Mutual Rewards-Old Mutual Protect 
ecosystem. Customers purchasing Old Mutual Protect solutions can now easily sign up to 
the rewards programme as part of their policy application process. Members can also earn 
up to 500% in rewards points of their premium on qualifying Old Mutual Protect solutions, 
including health bonus points. 

Our migration to cloud-based technology
Given the rapid technological advancements brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, 
we started migrating our core technology infrastructure in South Africa to the cloud in 2019. This 
was an important strategic choice to transform our business into a fully digitalised enterprise and 
secure our long-term competitive advantage. The shift to cloud-based technologies also enables 
us to create an environment where our customers, employees and intermediaries feel secure 
and supported with innovative technology tailored to their needs. This technology is also the 
foundation of our MyOldMutual platform and ensures that we can deliver flexible, responsive and 
scalable solutions for customers and advisers alike. 

At the end of 2020, only 15% of our South African legacy technology estate was cloud based. By the 
end of 2022, we successfully completed 95% of the migration with the remaining items scheduled 
for completion in the first quarter of 2023. 

The migration delivers benefits to a broad range of stakeholders: 
1.  Improved speed of execution, which has seen a significant reduction in the lead time to deploy 

new solutions and systems. In the past, these activities could take up to six months or more 
to deploy. In the new environment, we are able to execute in a matter of weeks. This means 
our customers and advisers benefit from rapid, continuous improvement in their sales and 
servicing experience with us.

2.  Enhanced shareholder and customer value through greater operating efficiencies and 
competitive pricing, brought about by lower infrastructure costs. 

3.  Enhanced the employee experience through the integration of Workday, our human capital 
technology platform.

Engaged employees

What we aim for
We aim to create an environment where our employees find a deep sense of connection and 
meaning in our purpose and victory condition, as demonstrated by their relentless focus on 
delivering meaningful customer experiences at every stage of the customer journey. 

We believe agile delivery driven by engaged employees yields meaningful customer 
experiences. We strive to unlock the potential, passion and drive of our employees by creating 
meaningful experiences for them. We want our employees to feel empowered and motivated to 
be part of an organisation that rewards and recognises high performance.

How do we deliver this
Our people strategy focuses on building a future-fit transformed workforce, culture and 
employee experience that enable the business to respond effectively to rapidly changing 
customer needs.

In building this workforce, we are creating an environment that embraces new ways of working 
and developing the capabilities needed to gear the business for growth. This will be supported 
by driving the requisite culture shifts to create an agile and execution-focused organisation. We 
will also ensure our employee experience, including our employee value proposition, remains 
compelling to attract and retain key talent.

What we achieved
 » Decreased our score in the employee engagement dimension of our culture index score to 4.42 (2021:

in the face of low energy levels, which is negatively impacting engagement levels. Our score in the 
psychological safety dimension reduced to 4.37 (2021: 4.50). This was driven by the negative impact of 
the implementation of mandatory vaccination and hybrid working model policies on the employee 
experience.

 » Invested R176.4 million (2021: R82 million) in learning and leadership development initiatives to 
support emerging talent, employee reskilling and upskilling and future-fitting our leaders. 

 » Trained 372 (2021: 335) intermediaries through the Celestis Academy.
 » Completed more than 4 425 (2021: 1 778) agile training courses across the organisation, supporting 
our transition to agile ways of working.

 » Progressed the diversity, equity and inclusion agenda through Bula Tsela – our B-BBEE Scheme – 
including issuing 78.1 million shares to all qualifying employees, with a tilt to black African employees. 
The objectives of the Employee Scheme include providing an opportunity for employees to share in 
the success of Old Mutual by becoming shareholders in the business and driving its performance.

 » Launched our True Connectors Leadership Signature to progress our culture journey by defining the 
behaviours we expect our leaders to role model to drive the required culture shifts.

Equipping ourselves to become our customers’ first choice
To successfully deliver on our victory condition, we continuously review how we attract and retain talent. This includes providing meaningful work to our employees, building an inclusive, psychologically safe and 
delivery-focused culture, growing and developing our talent and providing a holistic wellbeing offering. We recognise that a multi-faceted approach is required as no single solution is going to effectively retain a 
productive and engaged workforce.

Engaged employees

Transitioning to a hybrid way of work
At the beginning of 2022, we implemented a hybrid working model, requiring employees to be 
in the office for two days per week. The transition was supported by a set of guardrails, focusing 
on information technology and home office enablement, office readiness, training of line 
managers and employees to lead in the hybrid model, wellbeing support, change management 
and employee experience tracking.

As part of our commitment to delivering an 
optimal employee experience, we relaunched 
our employee wellbeing programme, 
#BeWELL.
The programme aims to get employees to focus on their 
wellbeing in a holistic way. All wellness-related content is 
now accessible through a single, online health and wellness hub that provides employees with 
tools, advice and events to support them across all aspects of wellbeing (emotional, physical and 
mental). Wellbeing was also introduced as part of the onboarding process for new employees.

Talent management
We offer talent development and retention programmes aimed at accelerating growth for those 
who demonstrate the potential to grow in our organisation. Our programmes are designed 
to target employees at various levels of leadership, from junior management to executive 
management. Our talent retention initiatives include providing individuals with access to 
executive coaches and meaningful exposure through secondment opportunities across the 
Group. We specifically emphasise developing high-potential female leaders by running a 
custom-designed programme called UnleashHer. The programme aims to advance women to 
the next level in their careers by helping them identify and address specific obstacles to their 
development progress. One of the desired outcomes of the programme is to improve diversity 
by building a strong internal pipeline of female talent. 

Building a culture that delivers results

Culture transformation is a complex journey that takes time. While we have made significant 
progress on our culture transformation journey, our long-term business strategy amplifies the 
need to respond to customers’ changing needs at pace. 

Our culture transformation begins with changing how leaders lead, behave and make decisions 
in the organisation that support our cultural aspirations. To date, our culture transformation 
journey focused on building and role modelling inclusive leadership. This started with shifting 
the mindsets and behaviours of executive teams aligned to the desired culture end-state and 
cascading this into the next layers of the business. Executive intact team culture workshops are 
used to build highly aligned and effective leadership teams by fostering trust, psychological 
safety and cohesive relationships.

We also defined a set of leadership behaviours, referred to as the True Connectors Leadership 
Signature. This aims to create a shared understanding across the business of what is expected 
from leaders and employees alike to achieve our cultural aspiration.

Guides leaders on how to build their 
teams by creating an environment 
where everyone can thrive, contribute 
and learn from each other to give of 
their best.

Guides leaders around putting the 
customer at the heart of everything 
we do to ensure we deliver the best 
customer experience that will allow us 
to become our customers’ first choice.

Challenges leaders to rethink the way 
work is done and how we operate so 
that we can execute and deliver with 
speed.

Focuses on leaders using our 
business strategy to guide their 
actions and decisions to drive 
business value for us in the market.

Solutions that lead

Enhancing the Old Mutual Protect adviser experience
Following the launch of Old Mutual Protect in 2020, one of the challenges our advisers encountered was 
that they were straddling two co-existing systems. Their propositions were mainly split via our heritage/
old generation propositions and the new Old Mutual Protect proposition. This led to frustration around 
systems and processes, which ultimately negatively impacted the adviser experience. One of our priority 
focus areas in 2022 was to improve the adviser and service experience. Initiatives put in place include the 
Prestige Service Model for selected advisers and a Fastlane service across key customer moments of truth.

The Prestige Service Model offers advisers a single entry point for servicing across all work processes, 
making it easier to access the support they need. It also includes a dedicated relationship manager and 
underwriter to deliver personalised service across all our Personal Finance (South Africa) products and 
service processes.

Following the enhancements, we experienced increased sales volumes and adviser usage because of the 
optimised functionality. In Q3 2022, we recorded our highest sales month since we first launched in 2020. 
By the end of the year, we had over 1.6 million active policies. The adviser Net Effort Score also improved to 
76% by the end of the year.

The Fastlane service was launched for both advisers and customers to offer them the best experience for 
key ‘moments of truth’, such as disinvestments. The service aims to minimise the friction points in their 
journeys by, firstly, removing complexity and clutter in our servicing processes and, secondly, setting up 
our servicing teams optimally to ensure ownership and delivery at speed.  

Expanding our alternative investments capability in East Africa
Our investments business in Kenya (Old Mutual Investment Group Kenya) expanded its offering for 
pension schemes and launched an alternative investment capability, which includes non-traditional asset 
classes such as private equity, agri and venture capital. This will allow pension schemes to diversify their 
investment portfolios while targeting attractive risk-adjusted returns. Apart from presenting attractive 
long-term investment opportunities, alternative investments have the added benefit of delivering tangible 
societal impact and contributing to the country’s growth and development agenda. By driving greater 
investment in sectors such as agriculture, infrastructure, sustainable energy, health care and education, we 
are able to stimulate economic growth to the benefit of our customers, communities and investors.

Impact on comparability of results
Nedbank unbundling
In November 2021, the Group unbundled 12.2% of its 19.4% stake in Nedbank by way of a distribution 
in specie. The unbundling was in the best interests of shareholders and it allowed shareholders to 
participate directly in the investment cases of both businesses while also returning capital to 
shareholders. The table below re-presents the prior year metrics to show the movement in these 
metrics on a comparable basis.

COVID-19
The volatility in our operating earnings caused by the pandemic over the last two years has stabilised in 
the current year as the ongoing impact of the pandemic became muted.

In the current year, our life profits benefited from lower mortality as the effects of COVID-19 eased. All 
remaining COVID-19 provisions were released but the impact was mostly offset by the strengthening of 
our mortality basis to allow for endemic COVID-19 claims, and worsened persistency as the challenging 
economic conditions continue to impact our retail customers.

Building a transactional capability
The Group has received Section 13 approval from the Prudential Authority to proceed with the 
application for a banking license. The establishment of an entity in the Group with a banking licence is 
a natural progression of our core strategy, helping us to sustain our customers’ prosperity through an 
enhanced transactional banking capability. This will allow us to hold the primary relationship with our 
customers, driving greater regular interaction with them and enhancing the cross-sell opportunity 
across the Group. It will also enable the Group to accept retail deposits, thereby providing a more 
efficient source of funding. 

The approved expenditure to complete the build of the transactional capability is R1.75 billion. In line 
with the business case, to date we have incurred costs of R1 billion and approximately 20% of these costs 
were capitalised. Once relevant Prudential Authority approvals are received, the launch is targeted for 
the second half of 2024. The entity is expected to breakeven three years after the launch. As the 
capability matures post-breakeven, the return is expected to be significantly above the target return of 
4% in excess of the cost of equity. We are currently working on our application under Section 16 of the 
Banks Act for the registration of the bank. 

IFRS 17
IFRS 17 will not change the underlying fundamentals of our insurance business, our cash generation or 
our capital strength, it will significantly change how we report on our insurance business. The Group 
estimates that the impact of initial application of IFRS 17 on the consolidated financial statements will 
be between R3 750 million to R4 500 million decrease to the Group’s total equity at 1 January 2022, net 
of adjustments relating to consequential amendments to other IFRS. This range has been determined 
in line with the principles underlying the use of ranges in trading statements as per the JSE Listings 
Requirements. Total equity as at 31 December 2021 under IFRS 4 was R65 301 million. The increase in 
liabilities that results in the decrease in total equity is not material relative to the size of the total IFRS 17 
liabilities (less than 1% change).

The impact on Group equity resulting from transition to IFRS 17 arises due to the different requirements 
of IFRS 17 compared to the accounting policies and actuarial methodologies used under IFRS 4. The 
differences include the removal of compulsory and discretionary margins that were required or allowed 
under IFRS 4 but not under IFRS 17, offset by the requirement to set up a contractual service margin 
and risk adjustment under IFRS 17. The contractual service margin and risk adjustment will be released 
into profit over time as service is provided and as risk expires, respectively.

The various portfolios of business in the Group are impacted differently by the transition to IFRS 17. The 
majority of the Group impact arises from OMLACSA. The impacts for the other Group entities are less 
material. The most material impact observed is for the Mass and Foundation Cluster risk portfolio 
where liabilities increase on transition to IFRS 17. IFRS 4 required the set-up of material lapse margins 
associated with expected higher levels of lapses at early durations for this portfolio. These margins were 
then released into profit at early durations under IFRS 4 as the high early lapse risk expired. Under 
IFRS 17, the contractual service margin is released more slowly as the service is provided. This, together 
with a history of favourable basis changes following management and other interventions that increase 
the contractual service margin under IFRS 17, rather than directly impacting profit as was the case 
under IFRS 4, resulting in an increase in liabilities which will be released over time into profit.

1 The composition of the shareholder operational costs and net treasury (loss)/gain was revised. Comparatives were 
re-presented to reflect this change

The loss on net result from group activities of R1 471 million increased by 83%. The increase in 
shareholder operational costs was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs following 
increased variable pay and inflationary increases as well as an increase in project costs, including IFRS 17. 
The increase in interest and other income was largely driven by higher interest income earned on cash 
balances, and favourable fair value movements. The negative mark-to-market movements on assets 
relative to the liabilities on the post-retirement medical aid obligation resulted in the net treasury loss. 
The increase in new growth and innovation initiatives reflects further investments in NEXT176 and the 
building of our transactional capabilities.

B  Shareholder investment return
Rm 2022 2021 Change
South Africa 741 1 931 (62%)
Old Mutual Africa Regions 727 795 (9%)
Shareholder investment return 1 468 2 726 (46%)

Shareholder investment returns for the Group of R1 468 million decreased by 46% largely due to market 
volatility experienced across most asset classes over the year. The difficult global and local 
macroeconomic environment provided a challenging backdrop for investment markets. The South 
African asset base reduced, contributing to the lower shareholder investment returns earned. Despite 
the volatile investment environment, the shareholder investment strategy continued to meet the 
primary objective of protecting and preserving shareholder capital.

South African interest-bearing assets earned a 5.5% return for the year representing a 0.3% 
outperformance of the STeFI Composite Index. This outperformance was due to various enhancements 
and cash optimisations executed within the portfolio. 

The local bond portfolio returned 4.4% for the year, marginally outperforming the Government Bond 
Index by 0.2%. The local bond portfolio benefited from favourable positioning across the bond curve 
relative to the index. 

The South African listed protected equity portfolio (excluding Nedbank) returned 4.3% for the year. Over 
the same period, the Capped SWIX 40 Index returned 6.5%, driven by a strong rally in equity markets 
in the fourth quarter of the year. By year end, the portfolio was fully transitioned from the SWIX 40 Index 
to the Capped SWIX 40 Index, with the Capped SWIX 40 Index outperforming the SWIX 40 Index by 1.9% 
for the year.

Supplementary income statement continued

The hedging strategies on the protected equity portfolio, excluding Nedbank, are executed in the form 
of zero cost collars whereby the exposure to losses is limited to 0% to 15% of the investment value, while 
the underlying equities track the Capped SWIX 40 Index. Although the underlying equity holdings 
passively track the market index, the overall equity strategy protects against downside losses via a 
hedging overlay structure and is therefore expected to underperform in rapidly rising markets. As the 
local protected equity strategy is used primarily to reduce capital losses it incurs an opportunity cost to 
ensure this level of protection. The Protected Equity portfolio targets on average 50% to 60% of overall 
market performance. Thus in 2022, given the market returns of 6.5% this translates to a targeted return 
of 3.3%-3.9% with our portfolio outperforming the target by yielding a 4.3% return. The investment 
performance on the protected equity strategy is also limited to the cap levels, which are determined at 
the onset when entering into the various hedging strategies over the year.

The Nedbank investment is similarly fully hedged using a collar structure with a protective downside 
floor limiting losses to between 2%-5% of the initial starting price, and an associated ceiling, that limits 
the upside gains to between 105%-112%. As the collar structure unwinds, the proceeds will be reinvested 
in accordance with the Group’s Strategic Asset Allocation Framework. For the year, the Nedbank 
holding returned 9.1% primarily due to an increase in the Nedbank share price relative to the prior year. 
All unhedged Nedbank holdings were disposed during the first half of the year. The remaining stake in 
Nedbank is 3.56% at the end of the year.

The unlisted equity portfolio returned negative 10.3% for the year. This was primarily due to impairment 
losses experienced on a subset of assets in the portfolio including legacy agriculture investments. The 
agriculture sector has been negatively impacted by geopolitical tensions, rising input costs and a 
constrained trading environment.

Shareholder investment returns in the Old Mutual Africa Regions of R727 million decreased by 9%. This 
was primarily driven by lower investment returns in East Africa and Namibia, as well as impairment 
losses in Ghana. In East Africa, fair value losses on fixed income securities, equity and property were a 
major contributor to the decrease in returns. Namibia’s investment returns reduced due to a decline in 
equity markets relative to the prior period. This was partially offset by higher fair value gains in Malawi 
resulting from a rally in local equity markets as well as an increase in interest income in Nigeria. The 
increase in interest income in Nigeria is attributable to a rise in interest rates and a higher average asset 
base as equity investments were transitioned to interest-bearing assets over the year.

C  Finance costs
Finance costs on the long-term debt that supports the capital structure of the Group increased by 22% 
to R662 million. This was largely driven by the significant interest rate increases and issuance of 
additional floating rate subordinated debt instruments. OMLACSA issued R1.6 billion of floating rate 
subordinated debt instruments and redeemed R977 million of subordinated debt instruments in 2022.

D  Impact of restructuring
In the current year, the restructuring line includes one-off costs related to the Bula Tsela B-BBEE 
ownership transaction, which was implemented in November 2022. 

In East Africa, the remaining at-acquisition provisions relating to UAP Holdings were released in the 
fourth quarter of the year following the completion of the balance sheet substantiation project. The 
release of the provisions has been excluded from adjusted headline earnings as it does not represent 
the operating activity of the Group and is not expected to persist in the long term.

In the prior year, the restructuring line included costs mostly relating to the Nedbank unbundling, with 
R1.1 billion deferred tax raised on the total stake at 30 June 2021. For the distributed stake, the difference 
between the carrying value under IFRS 5 and the tax base of the investment was a taxable difference in 
terms of IAS 12, resulting in a tax liability of R731 million at the capital gains tax rate. This amount was 
reclassified from deferred tax to a current tax liability upon recognition of the held for distribution 
liability and was settled prior to 31 December 2021.

E  Operations in hyperinflationary economies
Due to hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and barriers to access capital by way of dividends, we continue to 
exclude the results of the Zimbabwe business from adjusted headline earnings.

Profits in Zimbabwe continue to be driven by investment returns earned on the Group’s shareholder 
portfolio and volatile currency movements. The decline in Zimbabwe earnings was largely driven by the 
deterioration of Zimbabwean dollar to the rand and the lower investment returns on equities traded on 
the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange relative to the prior year. 

The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange generated returns of 80% during the year compared to 311% reported in 
the prior year as market participants seek to invest in equities which preserve value in an inflationary 
environment. At 31 December 2022, the year-on-year inflation rate for Zimbabwe was reported at 244%. 
We caution users of our financial results that markets remain volatile and there is a risk of returns 
reversing in the future.

F  Residual plc
Residual plc reported a profit of R173 million, a significant increase compared to the prior year. This was 
primarily driven by positive foreign exchange movements recognised on US dollar-denominated cash 
balances following the weakening of the rand in 2022. Staff costs were lower than the prior year due to 
the continued winding down of the remaining operations.

G  Property and intangible asset impairments
Impairments recognised in the current year relate mainly to write downs in respect of our offices, to 
ensure alignment of the property value with prevailing market conditions. In East Africa, the UAP Old 
Mutual brand was impaired after the business rebranded as Old Mutual during the year.

H  Disposal of subsidiaries and associated undertakings
The loss on disposal of subsidiaries relates mainly to the disposal of the Group’s investment in Old 
Mutual International (Guernsey) to Northstar Group (Bermuda) Limited during the year, in line with 
strategy to simplify the Group structure.

Management of the Group’s balance sheet
Shareholder capital management
Overview
The Group proactively manages its balance sheet to maximise shareholder value. This is achieved 
through various frameworks and initiatives that drive capital optimisation and efficient capital 
allocation, combined with sophisticated financial risk management and the optimal allocation of 
shareholder funds. The Group also actively manages the returns and related capital of guaranteed 
products. This ensures optimal allocation of scarce resources (capital and funding) in line with the 
Group’s business strategy and risk appetite.

Solvency risk management
The Group solvency position remained strong at 190% for the current year, within the solvency target of 
170% to 200%. Capital is allocated within the Group based on subsidiary risk profiles, the requirements of 
relevant regulators, competitor and customer considerations, and return on capital targets. All entity 
solvency positions are monitored on a regular basis to ensure they are appropriately capitalised. The 
largest insurer in the Group, OMLACSA solvency position was above the solvency target range of 175% to 
210%, at 214% as at 31 December 2022. 

Discretionary capital
The Group manages its discretionary capital by optimising the balance sheet and allocation of capital 
within the Group. Discretionary capital represents the surplus assets that are available for distribution, 
deployment and/or acquisitions. The discretionary capital balance includes amounts earmarked for 
investments in growth and innovation initiatives including building our transactional capabilities. The 
Group’s discretionary capital balance as at 31 December 2022 was R3.5 billion.

Capital optimisation
The Group continues to optimise its capital structure to enhance value for shareholders. The cash flow 
optimisation in Old Mutual Investments resulted in a capital release to the Group, which improved 
return on capital for the segment and discretionary capital for the Group. The Residual plc board 
declared a dividend, which was paid to the Group in December 2022. The dividend increased the 
discretionary capital for the Group. The Group will continue to identify opportunities to optimise its 
balance sheet.

Capital allocation
The Group’s strategy is supported by financial metrics and targets that drive shareholder value. These 
targets and metrics are embedded in all significant business decisions, including the annual business 
planning process and in the assessment of inorganic growth opportunities. Any new opportunities are 
further appraised against our Group acquisition framework. During the year, the largest portions of 
capital were allocated to Mass and Foundation Cluster and Personal Finance and Wealth Management 
to support new business and growth in the in-force book. These segments contribute the majority 
of Group earnings.

The acquisition of a 51% equity interest in ONE Financial Services, 
which writes short-term insurance via a cell captive

An agreement was reached with Letsema Brokerage Solutions to create 
a new majority Black-owned joint venture, which will be aimed at 
acquiring small to medium-sized brokerages and administrators in 
the short-term insurance industry

The acquisition of an equity interest in Preference Capital, a leading local 
provider of SME finance and foreign exchange solutions. The deal comprises a 
30% equity investment and the provision of funding to the business 
for on-lending to small and medium businesses

The acquisition of a 51% equity interest in a general insurance 
administrator, Versma Administrators and Primak Brokerage

The acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in Old Mutual Finance 
(RF) (Pty) Ltd resulting in Old Mutual Finance becoming a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Group

The sale of 21.2% of Futuregrowth to African Women Chartered 
Accountants Investment Holdings. This has allowed Futuregrowth and 
Old Mutual Investment Group to move towards becoming majority black 
owned

The sale of a Guernsey based life insurance closed book of business, 
inherited from Managed Separation

In early 2023, we completed the acquisition of a 100% equity interest in 
Genric Insurance Company Limited, a licensed non-life insurer and 
specialist insurer focused on bringing innovative and niche insurance 
solutions to the market. We also acquired the remaining 25% interest in 
Old Mutual Finance (Namibia) Proprietary Limited

During the year, the Group successfully concluded the following strategic 
acquisitions and disposals:

The Bula Tsela B-BBEE ownership transaction was approved at the General Meeting held on 12 August 
2022 and implemented in 2022. This transaction was implemented to fulfil our commitment to reach a 
30% B-BBEE ownership level by June 2023.

Management of the Group’s balance sheet continued

Shareholder investments
The Group manages its shareholder assets in accordance with the Strategic Asset Allocation Framework 
which aligns to the Group Financial Management Framework. The Strategic Asset Allocation 
Framework prescribes a low-risk investment strategy for shareholder invested assets aimed at 
protecting and preserving shareholder capital. The investment strategy targets an asset allocation that 
maximises net of tax expected returns subject to a defined market risk budget and the Group’s liquidity 
and solvency requirements.

In South Africa, we mainly target a combination of protected equity and interest-bearing assets 
(including a small allocation to bonds). During the year, we disposed of a number of our unlisted assets, 
resulting in a significantly smaller allocation to unlisted equity assets which are deemed to be strategic 
in nature. Post unbundling in November 2021, the retained Nedbank stake is recognised as part of 
shareholder invested assets. The protected equity allocation therefore includes a 3.56% stake in Nedbank 
which is also fully hedged using a similar collar structure. 

The shareholder investment strategy is designed to ensure optimal, long-term investment outcomes. 
Various optimisations have been implemented during the year. These include transitioning the 
protected equity underlying index to Capped SWIX 40 from SWIX 40, the disposal of the unhedged 
portion of the Nedbank stake and various enhancements to the fixed income portfolio. The shareholder 
investment portfolio will be managed in adherence to the Group’s Responsible Investment Policy and 
transitionary climate action plans.

Across the Old Mutual Africa Regions, the shareholder investment strategy adheres to the Group’s 
low-risk investment strategy aimed at protecting shareholder value. The strategy targets capital and 
inflation protection, subject to the market risk appetite. Each entity has a bespoke investment strategy 
which is influenced by the respective macroeconomic and regulatory regimes. Significant progress has 
been made in de-risking the balance sheet in this regard and enhancing the investment outcomes for 
the entities in these regions. This includes transitioning the investment strategies to low-risk 
asset classes. 

Issuance of tier 2 subordinated debt
During the year, OMLACSA redeemed R977 million of subordinated debt and issued R1.6 billion of 
floating rate subordinated debt under the Old Mutual Limited Multi-Issuer Domestic Medium-Term 
Note Programme (the debt programme) at 155 bps over three-month Johannesburg Interbank Average 
Rate. The debt programme was amended to include updates to the JSE debt listing requirements and 
to remove Old Mutual Insure as an issuer on the debt programme. Old Mutual Insure redeemed the 
R500 million listed subordinated debt in November 2022. 

We intend to issue subordinated debt annually to optimise the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, 
in line with the optimal gearing ratio of 15% to 20%, subject to market conditions and investor demand 
remaining favourable.

Shareholder liquidity risk management
The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally and ensures that sufficient liquidity is available to withstand 
severe market stresses; all subsidiaries carry sufficient liquidity to support their respective business 
activities. The Group’s liquidity position remained robust and within target ranges throughout the year 
and remains sufficient to cover the Group’s modelled stress scenarios. Liquidity sources consist of liquid 
assets and Group contingency facilities. The Group continuously aims to enhance the modelling that 
results in optimising the management of liquidity and reducing related costs.

The Group refinanced its revolving credit facilities – both ZAR and multi-currency – which form part of 
the Group’s liquidity risk mitigation strategies. This refinance included sustainability linked parameters, 
one of the first of such facilities in the insurance industry.

Dividend Policy
The Dividend Policy targets a full year ordinary dividend cover of 1.50x to 2.00x adjusted headline 
earnings. When determining the appropriateness of a dividend, we consider the underlying cash 
generated from operations, fungibility of earnings, targeted liquidity and solvency levels, the Group’s 
strategy, and market conditions at the time. 

In light of our strong liquidity levels and well-capitalised balance sheet, the Old Mutual Limited Board 
is pleased to declare a final dividend of 51 cents per share which amounts to a dividend cover of 1.73x.

Asset liability management
Products with shareholder guarantees or guaranteed rates of return are managed according to the 
Group’s risk appetite. Financial risks (including market, liquidity, funding, and reinvestment risk) are 
mitigated through a range of hedging strategies. 

Within OMLACSA, guaranteed products are managed centrally (in line with the Group’s Three Manager 
Model operating framework) to optimise hedging costs and ensure that capital within the Group is 
preserved. Through the Three Manager Model, the optimal deployment of funds generated through 
product premiums is facilitated once the related financial risks have been efficiently mitigated. Funding 
generated from guaranteed products post financial risk mitigation are invested according to a 
guaranteed product investment strategy, the bulk of which is invested in fixed interest credit assets 
within the respective investment businesses, taking into consideration the duration and nature of the 
product liabilities.

For the rest of the Group, the financial risks resulting from the sale of guaranteed products are 
mitigated through the selection of appropriate matching assets (usually fixed interest assets); where 
capital markets allow, more sophisticated hedging programs are executed to mitigate financial risk. 

During the year, the refinement of hedging methodologies resulted in the release of R1.3 billion of 
discretionary margins. Specific focus was also devoted to changes resulting from IFRS 17 to ensure 
strategies remain effective. This included a review of valuation curves and rebalancing of hedging 
programs where appropriate.

South Africa 11.4% 10.4% 100 bps
Old Mutual Africa Regions 9.8% 2.1% 770 bps

Return on net asset value 11.1% 9.0% 210 bps

Return on net asset value of 11.1% increased by 210 bps from 9.0% in the prior year, due to the significant 
improvement in adjusted headline earnings and a lower average adjusted IFRS equity base, resulting 
from the unbundling of 12.2% of the Group’s stake in Nedbank in 2021. Adjusted headline earnings 
would have been up 34% excluding the distributed stake of 12.2% in Nedbank in the prior year.

Return on net asset value of 11.4% in South Africa increased by 100 bps from the prior year, reflecting 
growth in adjusted headline earnings attributable to South Africa from R5 202 in the prior year to 
R5 268 million. This was primarily due to strong growth on results from operations partially offset 
by lower shareholder investment returns.  

Closing adjusted IFRS equity in South Africa increased by 6% due to higher profits from the South 
African businesses and dividends received from Residual plc operations. This was partially offset by 
dividends paid to shareholders of R3 424 million. In contrast, the average adjusted IFRS equity base was 
8% lower as the prior year included the distributed stake in Nedbank of 12.2% in the opening balance 
prior to unbundling in November 2021.

Return on net asset value of 9.8% in Old Mutual 
Africa Regions increased by 770 bps from the prior 
year. This was primarily due to higher adjusted 
headline earnings, resulting from the substantial 
improvement in operating profits, which was 
partially offset by lower shareholder investment 
returns. Average adjusted IFRS equity increased by 
16% from the prior year, reflecting the impact of 
higher opening balances in the current year and an 
increased closing adjusted IFRS equity due to 
retained profit for the year and capital injections.

Old Mutual Africa Regions 9 734 8 865 10%

Invested shareholder assets 34 676 38 458 (10%)

The total invested shareholder assets of R34 676 million reduced by 10% from R38 458 million at 
December 2021. 

The asset base in South Africa decreased by 16% due to dividend payments made during the year, a 
material reduction in the unlisted equity portfolio and a sharp equity markets decline during 2022. The 
reduction in the unlisted equity portfolio aligns to the low-risk investment strategy and the broader 
Strategic Asset Allocation Framework.

Within Old Mutual Africa Regions, invested shareholder assets increased by 10%. The growth was driven 
by an increase in interest-bearing assets due to capital injection and significant interest rate increases, 
which resulted in higher returns earned as well as fair value gains on investment properties. Most 
countries have adopted a low-risk investment strategy in line with the Group’s Strategic Asset Allocation 
Framework. This has resulted in a higher allocation to fixed income assets to preserve capital in an 
efficient manner. In countries experiencing macroeconomic difficulties such as higher inflation and 
sovereign risk concerns, a tailored Strategic Asset Allocation Framework is in place to better preserve 
shareholder capital.

3 We reallocated pooled investments previously disclosed separately to Old Mutual Africa Regions interest-bearing 
assets category. Prior periods have been re-presented to reflect this.

C  Embedded value
The return on embedded value increased to 7.3% largely due to less negative assumption changes, 
improved mortality and expense experience and higher new business value. Overall, the operating 
embedded value earnings increased to R5 103 million.

Experience variances improved from the prior year, with materially better mortality and expense 
experience, partially offset by significantly worse persistency in the Mass and Foundation Cluster. 
Assumption changes were less negative in 2022, with the release of remaining COVID-19 provisions 
being partially offset by strengthening of persistency bases and mortality bases (to include expected 
future endemic COVID-19 costs into base mortality).

Value generated by new business was higher than 
the prior year driven by strong sales in the Mass and 
Foundation Cluster and a change in mix towards 
higher-margin business in Mass and Foundation 
Cluster and Old Mutual Corporate. This was partially 
offset by an adverse change in mix and expense 
attribution change in Personal Finance. However, we 
have seen an improvement in the second half of the 
year due to management actions implemented to 
improve the business mix to higher-margin risk 
business.

Embedded value reduced by 8% mostly due to a 
R5.5 billion dividend from covered business and 
negative economic variances, as subdued equity 
market performance led to lower-than-expected 
future asset-based fees on investment products and 
lower-than-expected shareholder investment returns.

by the lower closing value of covered business as outlined in the embedded value note above. The 
equity attributable to covered business also includes a capital outflow to Asset Management and 
Banking and Lending following a refinement of the allocation of equity between lines of business. 

The Group equity value of non-covered businesses increased by 15%. The value is based on a series of 
directors’ valuations for each material legal entity, with the remaining entities included at IFRS equity 
attributable to equity holders of the parent. 

Asset Management Group equity value increased by 5%, mainly due to a higher valuation of Old Mutual 
Wealth. The Asset Management business was reallocated equity of R1.7 billion from the covered line of 
business and paid dividends of R1.1 billion in the year. 

The Group equity value of the Banking and Lending business increased by 45% reflecting higher 
valuations of both Specialised Finance and Old Mutual Finance in South Africa and Namibia. Old Mutual 
Finance was valued with reference to the purchase price agreed in December 2022 to acquire the 25% 
minority shareholding. The Banking and Lending business was reallocated equity of R1.6 billion from the 
covered line of business in the year. 

Property and Casualty Group equity value increased marginally by 1%. The Property and Casualty 
business received capital injections of R0.5 billion and paid dividends of R0.2 billion in the year. 

Following the unbundling of 12.2% of our stake in Nedbank in November 2021, the retained stake in 
Nedbank is no longer classified as an associated undertaking and is included at fair value in the Group 
equity value related to covered business.

The Residual plc contribution to Group equity value is based on the realisable economic value of 
approximately £20 million at 31 December 2022, translated at the closing exchange rate. The Residual 
plc business paid dividends of £39 million in the year. 

The value of the business in Zimbabwe is reduced to zero in Group equity value due to the continued 
impact of hyperinflation on the Zimbabwean economy, and in particular the unrealised nature of the 
listed investment return supporting the IFRS net asset value for this business. 

The value of ‘other’ increased mainly due to dividends received in holding companies from the covered, 
Asset Management and Property and Casualty businesses, as well as from Residual plc. This was 
partially offset by dividends paid of R3.4 billion and capital injections mainly to Old Mutual Africa 
Regions and Old Mutual Insure.

E  Solvency and capital
Solvency
The solvency ratio for OMLACSA increased to 214% from 203% in December 2021, due to a combined 
decrease in both eligible own funds and the solvency capital requirement.

The decrease in eligible own funds was primarily due to negative investment variances across the 
segments and shareholder assets as well as the negative impact of economic basis changes. The 
eligible own funds were further reduced by the impact of poor persistency experience in Mass and 
Foundation Cluster, as well as mortality and persistency basis changes in Personal Finance and Mass 
and Foundation Cluster and net capital flows. This was partially offset by the impact of positive new 
business written over the period and a decrease in the iterative risk margin, which was mainly driven by 
the year-on-year reduction in the non-hedgeable risk component of the solvency capital requirement. 

The reduction in solvency capital requirement was driven by lower equity risk, due to the decrease in the 
size of the prescribed equity shock and lower shareholder equity exposure. There was also a reduction in 
life risk due to the impact of book run-off on certain products. The reduction in life risk was offset by a 
decrease in the diversification benefits between life risk and market risk, following the large decrease in 
equity risk.

The Group solvency ratio has increased to 190% from 184% in December 2021. This was primarily driven 
by higher solvency ratios for unregulated entities due to a lower prescribed equity. The Group solvency 
ratio was further improved by the increase in the OMLACSA solvency ratio.

The Group regularly models the impact of an extreme but plausible sequence of events leading to a 
‘perfect storm’ scenario on our solvency capital and liquidity positions. These stress tests have shown 
that we remain sufficiently capitalised with appropriate liquidity.

Balance sheet and capital metrics continued

Discretionary capital
The Group’s discretionary capital balance was maintained at R3.5 billion as at 31 December 2022. This is 
the net impact of inflows and capital allocations since 30 September 2022. The main inflows included 
R330 million from Old Mutual Investments as a result of refinements to the risk management strategy, 
which released capital and £39 million from Residual plc. Capital allocations included the buyout of the 
shares for the minority stake in Old Mutual Finance for R1 082 million and continued investment into 
our growth and innovation initiatives. The discretionary capital balance at year end is earmarked for the 
Genric acquisition of R300 million, which was concluded in January 2023, the minority buy of Old 
Mutual Finance Namibia of N$214 million, the acquisition of a strategic equity stake in the Two 
Mountains Group and continued investment in our growth and innovation initiatives. The Group has 
further earmarked between R1 billion and R1.5 billion for return to shareholders as a share buyback and 
has initiated approval processes with the Board and Prudential Authority. 

Free surplus generated from operations
Operating segments generated gross free surplus 
of R7 473 million, representing 117% of adjusted 
headline earnings. Our operating segments continue 
to generate a high proportion of cash earnings which 
were paid to the Group as dividends. The 
distributions made to the Group through once-off 
capital transactions and optimisation initiatives have 
also increased our free surplus. The free surplus is 
net of central costs and can be deployed to 
dividends, working capital and transactions. 
Distributions include dividends from OMLACSA of 
R5.5 billion, Old Mutual Investments of R880 million, 
Residual plc of £39 million and other operating 
subsidiaries net of central costs of R309 million.

F  Gearing
The gearing ratio of 14.3% was 80 bps lower than the 
prior year, due to increased closing adjusted IFRS 
equity reflecting retained profit for the period and 
dividends received from Residual plc operations.

The IFRS value of debt remained largely flat in 
comparison to the 2021 closing value. OMLACSA 
issued in total R1.6 billion of floating rate 
subordinated debt instruments and redeemed 
R977 million of fixed rate subordinated debt 
instruments during the year. Old Mutual Insure 
redeemed the full balance of issued subordinated 
debt of R500 million towards the end of 2022. 

Interest cover of 15.3 times decreased marginally 
from 15.4 times in the prior year, reflecting the 
increase in adjusted headline earnings before tax, 
non-controlling interest and finance costs.

Net assets
The net asset position has remained relatively stable year on year with a 2% increase. The increase in 
total assets of R13 billion was offset by a R12 billion increase in total liabilities. The increase in total 
assets was driven by a combination of increases in investment property, cash and cash equivalents 
and other assets and a decrease in investments and securities due to a decline in market 
performance. A R25 billion increase in third-party interests in consolidated funds was the main driver 
of the increase in total liabilities. This increase was offset by a decrease in long-term business 
policyholder liabilities2 mainly due to weakening market performance. All remaining COVID-19 
provisions were released but the impact was mostly offset by the strengthening of our mortality 
basis to allow for endemic COVID-19 claims and worsened persistency as the challenging economic 
conditions continue to impact our retail customers.

Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent
Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent increased by 3%, largely as a result of IFRS profit 
recognised for the period, offset by dividends declared for the current year.

Total revenue decreased by 54% to R113 billion, largely due to a decrease in investment returns. 
Investment returns decreased by 87% from the prior period, primarily due to global factors 
negatively impacting market values.

Total expenses
Total expenses decreased by 56% to R104 billion, largely due to a decrease in net claims and benefits 
incurred, change in investment contract liabilities and change in third-party interests in consolidated 
funds. Net claims and benefits incurred decreased due to a decrease from lower mortality as the 
effects of COVID-19 eased. Change in investment contract liabilities expense and change in 
third-party interest in consolidated funds were significantly lower than the prior year mainly as a 
result of lower investment returns earned, which was largely driven by the weaker 
market performance.

Operational metrics

Mass and Foundation Cluster is a business segment that operates in the low-income and lower-middle-
income markets. The segment’s existing and potential customers span individuals who earn R1 000 to 
R30 000 per month. The Mass and Foundation Cluster has an established brand presence in its core 
markets driven by vast distribution channels built from and for communities. We offer a comprehensive 
range of products to the mass and foundation markets across underwritten life and funeral insurance, 
savings, lending and transactional banking.

Operating context
2022 was a difficult year for our customers, who grappled with severe increases in the cost 
of living created by steep rises in inflation and interest rates. The growing financial pressure 
our customers faced worsened our persistency experience due to higher levels of lapses, 
surrenders and missed premiums. Despite the challenging environment, we managed to 
post a relatively strong set of results.

Mass and Foundation Cluster continued

Strategic focus areas

 1 An enhanced customer experience and cross-sell

We delivered an enhanced integrated financial services customer experience by 
building rewarding customer relationships. We delivered improvements to the 
servicing and claims experience and meaningfully increased Old Mutual Protect 
underwritten life sales by 92%. We achieved R1.1 billion lending cross-sell to the 
life customer base.

 2
Grow long-term insurance market share through appropriate, 
relevant product propositions and by increasing points of 
presence

We made significant strides in regaining market share in 2022 due to strong 
sales growth across most of our channels, with standout results coming from 
our branch adviser, foundation market, third-party and digital channels. The 
growth in our risk mix was particularly pleasing, driven in part by the strong 
growth in our non-advice risk sales and underwritten life sales. We also 
materially increased the capacity in our third-party and foundation market 
channels, which positions us well to continue to deliver strong sales growth 
over 2023.

3 Drive profitability in the long-term Insurance business by 
improving business mix, persistency and cost efficiency

2022 was a difficult year for our customers, who had to grapple with severe 
increases to the cost of living created by steep increases in interest rates 
and inflation rates. This led to a negative persistency variance and the 
strengthening of our persistency basis. However, favourable mortality 
experience has started to emerge in 2022, which is expected to persist. 
Despite these effects, our financial results delivered material growth on the 
prior year.  

4 Profitable growth in Old Mutual Finance

We continue to drive profitable growth in Old Mutual Finance via 
transactional banking and diversifying income streams. Old Mutual Finance 
has extended wholesale lending to Bridge Taxi Finance that has created 
access to a new market. Good progress has been made within Old Mutual 
Finance to grow its alternative channels (direct and digital) during 2022. The 
net transactional revenue from each active Money Account grew materially in 
2022 by 38%.

5 Execute on the people plan

We continue our focus on talent, culture and core capabilities. Strong progress 
has been made on our key human capital metrics, including employment 
equity, skills development and culture scores. We continue to retain our high-
potential employees despite strong competitor recruitment activities. 

  Customers:
 » R6.9 billion (2021: R7.2 billion)
   in claims and benefits paid

 » R15.5 billion (2021: R14.8 billion)
   in responsible lending to Old Mutual Finance customers to meet 

their financial goals

 » 88% (2021: 84%)   of funeral claims paid within four hours

  Intermediaries:
 »  R44.0 million (2021: R33.1 million)
  spent on intermediary training and development

Trade-off
Our responsible lending approach to a heavily indebted mass market 
that is experiencing the financial pressure in the tough economic 
environment has resulted in muted growth in the loan book but has 
continued to support a strong core credit experience.

Key activities 2023

 » Increase needs met through an enhanced integrated financial services 
customer experience

 » Drive customer growth through holistic propositions
 » Continue to grow market share through expanded points of presence 
 » Continue to enhance profitability by improving persistency, product mix and 
efficiency

 » Continue to build the right capabilities, talent and culture
 » Promote sign-on to Old Mutual Rewards and drive financial wellbeing 
through financial education

 » Continue to use models to manage credit experience, appetite and level of 
risk-taking

Mass and Foundation Cluster continued

Performance overview
Gross flows of R12 924 million (2021: R12 870 million) were slightly 
ahead of prior year due to growth in the life in-force book following 
annual premium increases, which was largely offset by a decline 
in savings sales and worse persistency during the year. Despite 
this, net client cash flow improved by 13% to R5 580 million (2021: 
R4 959 million) due to lower funeral claims from the easing impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. We saw an increase in surrenders as 
more customers chose to access their savings to support them 
during these difficult economic conditions.

Life APE sales of R4 216 million (2021: R3 475 million) increased 
by 21% from the prior year, driven by good growth across several 
non-advice and advice channels, with particularly strong growth 
from within the foundation market. This was supported by very 
good credit life growth on the back of a 37% growth in unsecured 
new business loans, higher average prices and the increase in the 
shareholding of Old Mutual Finance. Risk sales recovered to well 
above 2019 levels and remain a key focus area in driving sustained 
long-term value.

Loans and advances of R15 512 million (2021: R14 795 million) grew 
by 5%, supported by the higher levels of sales which included 
wholesale funding granted to Bridge Taxi Finance.

The net lending margin of 13.6% (2021: 18%) decreased by 440 bps 
while the credit loss ratio increased by 390 bps to 4.8% (2021: 
0.9%). The prior year benefited positively from a material once-off 
provision unwind from a declining loan book. The core credit loss 
ratio remained stable over the year. 

Namitete, Malawi – Coordinates 14.0242° S, 33.3626° E

Results from operations declined by 11% to R2 442 million (2021: 
R2 752 million) due to lower profits from the Banking and Lending 
business. The prior year included a significant once-off provision 
release on the back of a declining loan book. 

Life profits were well ahead of the prior year due to higher annual 
premium and cover increases on the existing book and the net 
positive effect of basis changes which included economic basis 
changes related to the refinement of hedging methodology. 
The claims experience was significantly better due to less severe 
COVID-19 variants and higher levels of immunity resulting in 
mortality profits recognised over the year. We have now fully 
released the mortality provisions for excess claims. Higher sales 
volumes, improved sales mix and good cost management 
contributed further to the strong results from operations. These 
were partly offset as our customers’ growing financial pressures 
translated into a worse persistency experience due to higher 
levels of lapses, surrenders and missed premiums. The impact of 
the strengthening of our persistency basis was more than offset 
by the release of the excess claims provision and various other 
discretionary reserves. 

Value of new business grew by 48% to R945 million (2021: 
R638 million), due to higher issued sales volumes and good cost 
management, partly offset by the strengthening of persistency 
basis. Value of new business margin of 7.6% (2021: 6.2%), was up 
140 bps from the prior year, attributable to increased risk sales 
volumes and strong credit life performance as well as effective 
cost management.

Operational metrics

Personal Finance and Wealth Management is a 
retail segment that offers holistic financial wellness 
propositions to middle and high-income and affluent 
customers both digitally and face-to-face through 
our high-calibre advisers.

Operating context
Our customers’ sentiment and disposable income was heavily impacted by rising inflation 
and interest rate increases, lower offshore markets and a weaker rand exchange rate. These 
economic conditions affected our customers’ ability to maintain or increase protection, savings 
and investment products.

We saw an industry decline in the underwritten risk1 and single premium businesses, which 
affected our volumes and mix. Overall investment gross flows were lower due to decreased 
demand driven by market volatility and a weaker rand. We benefited from a decreased 
COVID-19 impact and positive economic basis changes.

Strategic focus areas

 1 Retain and acquire new customers in Personal Finance through:

 » Digitised and adviser-enabled customer experiences
 » Improving our adviser base and productivity levels

The efforts made towards improving our adviser experience are gaining traction following the funding of 
additional resources and collaboration across teams to re-train, introduce fast lanes and automate. This 
resulted in the reduction of backlog and complaints. 

We stabilised and grew our experienced adviser base. The focus on better quality recruitment and an 
improved development academy is yielding results, with an overall increase in adviser activity.

We continued to improve the adviser experience on Old Mutual Protect, our risk product, and made 
progress towards the planned delivery of the new Savings and Investments product. Integrating Old Mutual 
Rewards with Old Mutual Protect contributed to exceeding the 2022 target for new members by 30%.

We introduced client wealth managers linked to our services and products, which was well received with 
a resultant increase in net client cash flows. The digital enhancements to our customer journey led to an

 2 In Wealth Management, grow our share of the independent financial advisers market, 
extend our lead in the offshore space and build out our high-net-worth client offering by:

 » Improving customer and planner experience
 » Building sustainable distribution businesses

We enhanced the customer propositions for more holistic and integrated services. 

We improved our planner experience through enhancements to our integrated wealth planning 
tools, simplified operational processes and increased automation and digital capabilities. Our offshore 
administration capabilities were simplified and enhancements were made to our product offering and 
platform. We continued to build a sustainable distribution business that supports our target market.

We implemented the first phase of tighter integration in our high-net-worth client proposition and 
enhancements to the service model.

3 Rectify our mix of new business to improve margins

We improved our business mix by driving middle and upper-income solutions. In the second half of the 
year we achieved higher guaranteed annuities, fixed bond and living benefits sales, which contributed to 
improving our margins. 

4 Optimise our expense base through efficient cost management

We continue to focus on efficiency by removing duplication, inefficiency and better prioritising. Some of the 
cost savings were applied to focused investment in our capabilities. The expense for Wealth Management 
grew 1%, which is below the inflation rate, and Personal Finance managed to deliver expenses below 2021.

Personal Finance and Wealth Management continued

Performance overview
Gross flows decreased by 5% to R77 130 million (2021: 
R81 186 million) due to lower annuity sales in Personal Finance 
and a significant decrease in demand for offshore investments 
in our Wealth Management business resulting from lower 
offshore markets and weaker performance of the rand against 
the US dollar. 

Life APE sales for the segment were flat on prior year, with growth 
in savings sales largely offset by the decrease in guaranteed 
annuity sales. In Wealth Management, we saw a shift to our 
smooth bonus and fixed bond options as customers showed 
a preference for stable and guaranteed funds.

Despite significantly lower mortality claims in Personal Finance, 
net client cash flow ended well behind the prior year due to a 
combination of lower offshore flows and large disinvestments 
in Wealth Management, partially offset by strong inflows in the 
Private Client Securities and Treasury Advisory Services businesses.

Results from operations for the segment recovered to 
R3 217 million (2021: R448 million). Our mortality experience 
improved significantly in 2022 and was better than the levels 
provided for, but we still experienced excess mortality on our 
underwritten risk book. We have therefore released the short-
term COVID-19 provisions in full, and made an adjustment to the 
long-term mortality basis, applied on the underwritten risk book, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania – Coordinates 6.7924° S, 39.2083° E

to allow for the future impact of excess COVID-19-related mortality. 
Net positive economic basis changes included the release of 
discretionary margins related to the refinement of our hedging 
methodology. Results from operations has now recovered well 
above 2019 levels.

Wealth Management results from operations decreased by 
4%. Volatile global markets negatively impacted Old Mutual 
International profits and the market value of our offshore seed 
capital investments.

Value of new business of R152 million (2021: R285 million) for the 
segment reduced by 47%, with a corresponding 40 bps decrease 
in the value of new business margin to 0.5% (2021: 0.9%). Despite 
Life APE sales being flat on the prior year, Personal Finance’s 
value of new business declined due to lower policy volumes in 
key products, which led to worse initial expense variances. Value 
of new business was further impacted by the decrease in high-
margin annuity sales. During the second half of the year, the value 
of new business improved with a shift in mix to higher-margin 
risk business and a review of the persistency assumptions in our 
funeral products. 

Wealth Management’s value of new business of R81 million 
(2021: R72 million) was up 13%, driven by a more profitable mix 
of business following higher sales of smooth bonus and fixed 
bond products.

Operational metrics

Old Mutual Investments is one of South Africa’s 
leading investment managers, offering investment 
solutions to institutional and retail customers.

Operating context
The increase in inflation rates caused downward pressure on the equity and bond markets 
requiring a recalibration of metrics to accommodate the shift from low inflation and low interest 
rates. This new reality is marked by periodic panic selloffs. 

The ongoing market volatility from local and international geopolitical developments, 
macroeconomic uncertainty and a decline in the equity market continue to grow fears of a global 
recession. The benefit of having a diverse capability set and asset class exposures was evident in 
2022 as we delivered double-digit growth in results from operations despite the tough trading 
conditions.

Strategic focus areas

 1 Deliver consistent top-quartile investment performance

Overall, investment performance for 2022 was not as strong as the preceding 12 months, however, against a volatile market backdrop, our investment 
teams have performed credibly in navigating the year for our clients. Longer term investment performance relative to benchmarks has shown a steady 
improvement with 75% of our funds above benchmark over the three-year period, up from 50% a year ago.

 2 Drive transformation efforts within the business, including majority black ownership

We concluded the sale of 21.2% of our stake in Futuregrowth Asset Management to African Women Chartered Accountants. This, along with the Bula Tsela 
initiative, moves both Futuregrowth and Old Mutual Investment Group towards becoming majority black owned. Client engagements continue to highlight 
a positive response to the deal.

3 Grow market share in both retail and institutional markets

Growing our retail and institutional market share is critical to remaining relevant and defending our status as the largest asset manager in the country. We 
have enhanced our capabilities in the Alternatives business to enable us to compete better in the third-party institutional market. We have invested in our 
client-facing teams to drive growth in flows across our affiliates.

4 Focus on key revenue and growth initiatives

New revenue lines are critical for all our affiliates and a key part of their KPIs. We completed our Private Markets initiative and launched infrastructure debt 
and hybrid funds, improving competitiveness in the third-party institutional market. We launched global active ESG, the applied intelligence capabilities, 
Africa Income and Retirement-Driven Investments capability, a Venture Capital Fund in Futuregrowth, scrip lending and extended our Liability-Driven 
Investments capability for defined contribution funds . Our Alternatives business raised R17.4 billion (2021: R9.9 billion) of capital during the year, which will 
support annuity revenue growth.

5 Stabilise and invest in our operating platforms

Ongoing upgrading of front office information technology systems is critical to significantly improve our operating efficiency and de-risk the business to 
ensure that it remains future fit. We continued to make progress on our strategy to refresh our technology environment, which includes process automation 
and leveraging artificial intelligence to improve efficiencies and drive investment outcomes. We also improved our client relationship management tool across 
our affiliates.

Old Mutual Investments continued

Performance overview
Despite the ongoing market volatility and macroeconomic 
uncertainty, we achieved good results, which benefited from 
exceptional non-annuity revenue, as well as solid growth in annuity 
revenue. The combination of lower inflows and a decline in the 
equity markets saw assets under management decrease by 4% 
from December 2021 to R774.0 billion (2021: R809.1 billion) at the 
end of the year. 

The higher annuity revenue was supported by record levels of 
capital raised in our Alternatives business, which came through as 
management fees, commitment fees and catch-up fees.

A major differentiator from our peer group is our operating model 
that delivers significant non-annuity revenue. This revenue is 
more volatile but provides significant economic value through the 
investment cycle. The component parts include carried interest, 
revaluation of fund co-investments and mark-to-market impacts 
from changes to credit spreads and equity exposures. Non-annuity 
revenue grew by 48% from the prior year, mainly due to strong 
investment returns in our Alternatives business and positive market 
movements on the credit portfolio in our Specialised Finance 
business. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 on our results, our non-
annuity revenue has ranged between R156 million and R515 million 
over the past five years.

Gross flows in 2021 represented a five-year high for Old Mutual 
Investments with strong flows in Liability-Driven Investments, 
indexation capabilities and Marriott. Gross flows in 2022 were 

Alternatives
The business produced a strong set of results with R17.4 billion 
(2021: R9.9 billion) of new capital being raised and R14.9 billion 
(2021: R7.9 billion) of new deals concluded during the year. Annuity 
revenue was higher mainly due to the significant increase in capital 
raised in recent years and the addition of credit capabilities that have 
transferred from our Specialised Finance business. Non-annuity 
revenue also increased significantly following higher investment 
returns, with some unlisted assets delivering excellent returns in the 
year, which was partially offset by lower performance fees on certain 
domestic funds. The overall impact was an increase in results from 
operations of 187% (excluding the impact of the Private Markets 
transfer, results from operations was up by 136%).

Specialised Finance
The total deal volume originated during the year resulted in the 
balance sheet growing by 8% to R35.4 billion. Results from operations 
declined marginally due to lower annuity revenue related to the 
transfer of certain credit capabilities to Alternatives and mark-to-
market losses in the equity portfolios. These were largely offset by 
higher non-annuity revenue driven by other positive mark-to-market 
gains and lower expenses following the transfer of capabilities to 
Alternatives. 

relatively subdued following such a strong performance. Higher client 
liquidity requirements resulted in net outflows from low margin 
money market funds, which led to negative net client cash flow of 
R7 723 million (2021: positive R4 907 million). Net client cash flow was 
also impacted by structural outflows given the ongoing strain in the 
South African pension fund market, as well as some unexpected 
terminations and client restructures. Our success in Liability-Driven 
Investments is creating a higher base of expected benefit payments 
because of the larger book. The overall health of our pipeline supports 
our expectation of better net client cash flow in future years.

Results from operations increased by 12% to R1 240 million 
(2021: R1 109 million) driven by higher revenue, partially offset by 
increased expenses. Expenses are up as a result of key vacancies 
being filled, inflationary salary increases, and the continued 
investment in revenue-generating initiatives and technology.

Asset Management
Results from operations were 12% down, largely due to lower non-
annuity revenue from reduced performance fees and fair value gains 
compared to the prior year, as well as higher expenses as outlined 
above. The elevated prior year flows into Liability-Driven Investments 
and Marriott were not repeated and Futuregrowth experienced 
lower flows into money market and corporate cash products. This, 
along with expected Liability-Driven Investments benefit payments 
of R3.7 billion, contributed to the negative net client cash flow of 
R7 990 million (2021: positive R4 560 million). Flows from our retail 
channels were up mainly due to higher money market net flows.

Old Mutual Corporate provides pre-retirement and post-retirement investments, group risk cover, 
administration, consulting services and specialised solutions to employer-sponsored retirement and

Old Mutual Corporate is a leading player in the mature 
traditional employee benefits industry and provides 
employee benefits and consulting services to large 
corporates and SMEs in South Africa. The segment 
remains a leader as against its listed competitors.

Operating context
COVID-19 tested the resilience of most companies. In its aftermath, increasing inflation and 
interest rates led to slow macroeconomic recovery and a volatile market environment which 
increased cost of doing business. Consequently, we have seen an increase in company 
liquidations, low SME growth, higher benefits outflows and slower decision making around 
procuring employee benefit solutions.

The employee benefits industry remains subject to various retirement reforms, such as 
the two-pot system for retirement savings, which present opportunities to enhance value 
propositions. We continue to actively participate in consultative processes and to prepare 
for implementation of upcoming reforms.

Strategic focus areas

 1 Strengthen and grow core and large enterprise

We focused on improving the resilience and competitiveness of our employee benefits business, while innovating growth opportunities in 
the SME market. Our Group Life Assurance business remains a leading provider of Group risk solutions, while our smooth bonus offerings 
remained attractive in a volatile environment, with strong bonuses and flows. We continued to achieve strong results from our annual client 
satisfaction survey, with 88% overall satisfaction with our corporate consultants, 83% for value for money, and 90% for skills, knowledge and 
expertise. To support growth, we reviewed the remuneration structures of our intermediaries.

The integration of Remchannel, our reward management solution, continues to create value for the Employee Benefits and Corporate 
business and the Old Mutual SuperFund continued with its ongoing endeavours to educate, enable and empower members through the 
Financial Wellbeing Programme.

We launched the Old Mutual SA Retirement Gauge, which is an analysis tool designed to analyse the retirement readiness of members 
in umbrella funds and a social experiment campaign that highlighted the dilemma most households will face at retirement and created 
awareness by reaching over 6 million views across all social media platforms. We also introduced ‘Big Business Insights’, a new Old Mutual 
Corporate Podcast series that focuses on sharing business insights relating to human capital management and employee benefits.

 2 Accelerated execution of the SME proposition

The update of our SME digital channel SMEgo2.0 was launched and features increased capabilities beyond offering a funding platform. It 
delivers a holistic proposition to small business owners based on three pillars: enabling efficient business operations, providing access to 
funding and access to markets, to facilitate entrepreneurs to run and grow their businesses successfully. 

New features include enabling small business owners to generate invoices with payment links online, automate payment reminders to 
support operational efficiency and invoice discounting, which assists SMEs in accessing funds earlier for outstanding invoices. 1 950 invoices 
were generated on SMEgo2.0 to the value of R94.7 million.

We successfully launched our SME e-market, a marketplace to connect SMEs with each other and customers. The platform currently has 
over 2 000 SME products on offer and 600 buyers and sellers.

We acquired a 30% stake in a specialist SME lender, Preference Capital, which provides SME finance solutions in response to the funding 
gap for SMEs in the market.

3 Build business agility through improved business responsiveness and operational efficiency

Our servicing and administration came under pressure, particularly in dealing with the volumes of death claims caused by a backlog which 
continued into 2022 from the spike in COVID-19 claims in 2021. In response, we enhanced the resourcing and management focus and 
positive results are emerging. We provided multiple servicing channels to improve access and responsiveness and focused on process  
re-engineering and automation to ensure faster turnaround and improved customer experience.

We reviewed our data and digital capability to leverage our information technology and developed a digital roadmap for implementation 
in 2023.

Key activities 2023

 » Improving employee benefits offerings by investing in servicing and 
administration, as well as improving the customer and intermediary 
experience

 » Preparing for the regulatory changes implied by the two-pot system
 » Investing in our digital and data and continuing to enhance Old 
Mutual Corporate’s product offerings 

 » Growing and extending the core employee benefits business 
through internal innovation, external partnerships and acquisitions 
to diversify channels, markets, capabilities and offerings

 » Scaling the SME business by accelerating traction in the lending 
business and extending the SMEgo platform proposition

Value creation

  Customers:
 » R41.5 billion (2021: R49.3 billion)
   in claims and benefits paid

 »  Facilitated the disbursement of  R9.6 million to SMEs 
through our funding concierge

  Intermediaries:
 »  R1.7 million (2021: R0.8 million)
   spent on intermediary training and development

 » 550 intermediaries 
  and 50 clients attended our face-to-face roadshows

Trade-off
Trade-offs were made to ensure the sustainability of the 
business while meeting the needs of clients. Old Mutual 
Corporate experienced a surge in death claims in 2020 and 2021 
as a result of COVID-19.

We prioritised increasing our specialist operational capacity 
for the moving of our information technology estate to the 
cloud for medium to long-term value for all stakeholders at the 
expense of short-term claims delivery capacity availability. This 
created a lag and backlog in our claims processing. This had a 
regrettable impact on customer experience. 

Awards
 » Our Nine Yards magazine won three awards: from the Global Content Awards, United Kingdom Content Marketing Association Awards and 
New Generation Digital Awards

 » Our Nine Yards video series won three awards: at the SA Publication Forum Awards, New Generation Digital Awards and first place in the 
Content Council 2022 Pearl Awards (United States) 

 » Our Mindspace magazine (thought leadership) won two awards: at the Content Council’s Pearl Awards in New York and at the local

Old Mutual Corporate continued

Performance overview
Gross flows decreased by 4% to R32 765 million (2021: 
R33 957 million) mainly due to lower pre-retirement single 
premiums, with the prior year including a very large umbrella 
deal. Recurring premiums improved with strong Group assurance 
new business sales, while flows in our smooth bonus products on 
our retail platforms grew by 16%. Life APE sales decreased by 8% 
to R2 212 million (2021: R2 416 million) mainly due to decline in pre-
retirement single premium sales. Following the buyout of minority 
shareholders of Old Mutual Finance in December 2022, credit life 
premium sales were excluded from Old Mutual Corporate’ s life 
sales and reported in the Mass and Foundation Cluster. 

While Life APE sales decreased, it was pleasing to see that 
value of new business improved by 14% to R235 million (2021: 
R207 million), with a corresponding increase of 20 basis points in 
the value of new business margin to 1.2% (2021: 1.0%). Value of new 
business benefited from a more favourable product mix within 
our investment offering compared to the prior year, improved 
expense efficiencies and strong growth in Group assurance new 
business sales. During 2020 and 2021, we deepened and cultivated 
relationships with our Group assurance customers by supporting 

them through the unique challenges and uncertainties 
experienced during the pandemic, including several COVID-19 
support services made available free of charge. We purposefully 
followed a customer-specific approach in tailoring solutions for 
customers, which contributed to the growth in new business 
in 2022.

Despite the decline in gross flows, net client cash flow improved 
by R660 million from the prior year due to lower benefit 
outflows from mortality and morbidity claims, and lower 
client terminations. 

Funds under management declined by 4% to R293.5 billion (2021: 
R304.7 billion) due to a weaker performance in the equity market 
and the impact of negative net client cash flow. A component of 
the funds under management relates to our flagship smoothed 

bonus funds, which performed well in an extremely unpredictable 
market environment. This reduced the market volatility customers 
experienced through smoothing, while building investors’ 
retirement savings by providing consistent real returns.

Results from operations improved substantially from R727 million 
in the prior year to R1 978 million. The prior year included large 
net negative basis changes, mostly related to the strengthening 
of COVID-19 provisions. Results from operations benefited from 
strong mortality underwriting profits as a result of a muted 
COVID-19 experience and we released the remaining COVID-19 
provision. Net positive economic basis change included a release 
of discretionary margins in respect of investment guarantees. Our 
asset-based revenue grew on the back of higher average funds 
under management over the year.

Operating context
The 2022 year was characterised by weather events which were a reminder of the risk and 
impact that climate change has on our business. This was coupled with an increase in claims 
costs due to significant strain on the global supply chain resulting in disruption and shortages 
in parts. Catastrophe events in the year, specifically the KwaZulu-Natal floods and two adverse 
weather conditions in December had an impact on claims. Load shedding has resulted in an 
increase in power surge claims. High inflation rates continued to impact repair and replacement 
costs, increasing claims values. The severe increase in the cost of living has influenced client 
retention which impacted the gross written premium.

Strategic focus areas

 1 Diversify our distribution channels and products to grow revenue

We established a virtual distribution model within retail to optimise the costs to 
service our customers and established a tied agency capability within our retail 
business. Several branches were closed down as we reduce our branch footprint.

We formed strategic partnerships that will enhance our product offering in iWYZE 
and Mutual & Federal Risk Financing.

Alternative business solutions including the tied agent model, grew rapidly, 
reaching a new monthly sales milestone of R1.8 million in November, while iWYZE 
continued to grow through the business partner programme and increased digital 
presence as customers registered on WyzeHub. 

We made satisfactory progress in securing inorganic growth opportunities through 
the purchase of Versma Administrators and Primak Brokerage. We also activated 
the Letsema broker services pipeline.

 2 Leverage data and technology to drive efficiency, pricing and risk 
selection

We focused on a sustainable reduction in costs through technology development 
and stabilisation for future savings, invested in the right skills and systems and 
simplified, digitised and automated products and processes. The expense 
management project unlocked R174 million in savings and the automation 
currently underway will enable the next phase of cost savings in 2023. 

We continued the implementation of advanced analytics use cases, including 
pricing and renewals informed by actuarial analytics and techniques. We 
implemented a technology re-platforming in Credit Guarantee Insurance 
Corporation and began quoting new business and renewals in Corporate property 
using the new rating platform. We also implemented a new reinsurance system to 
improve data quality, reporting and governance.

3 Enhance customer engagement models

We continued with the sales force rollout to automate the capturing of complaints, 
significantly reducing the time to respond and action client complaints. We 
enriched our customer experience through enhanced digital solutions. 

4 Optimising reinsurance structures

Bespoke programmes are in place for all business divisions. The new reinsurance 
system together with an exercise underway to optimise reinsurance structures will 
create protection against volatility and improved value for money. It will also unlock 
reinsurance placement synergies on completed acquisitions.

Key activities 2023

 » Acquired 100% of Genric Insurance Company in the first quarter of 2023

Trade-off
The trade-off remained in the deployment of funds in the business. The 
ongoing information technology strategy refresh to align the business 
with the broader Old Mutual Limited information technology strategy 
requires investment which may have otherwise been spent elsewhere 
however, it is aimed at long-term value retention and generation for 
the shareholder and customer. 

In underwriting, remediation across several portfolios results in 
premium growth sacrifices and potentially broker resistance. However, 
it also strengthens the quality of the book over time and aims to 
enhance the margins. This is planned for large books within Retail, ONE 
Financial Services and the Premier book.

Luderitz, Namibia – Coordinates 26.6420° S, 15.1639° E

Old Mutual Insure continued

Performance overview
Gross written premiums of R17 190 million (2021: R15 927 million) 
increased by 8% largely due to good premium growth across all 
our divisions. The Specialty division onboarded several new cells 
in the Mutual & Federal Risk Financing business and new policies 
were secured in Retail, particularly in the alternative business 
solutions channel and elite products. The continued growth of 
our direct channels in iWYZE benefited from increased customer 
numbers and in Credit Guarantee Insurance Corporation 
improved customer retention contributed to the growth in gross 
written premiums.

Net underwriting results decreased by 25% due to increased 
claims following severe weather events, the impact of rising 
inflation on claims costs and an increased claims frequency 
as a result of load shedding. The KwaZulu-Natal floods had a 
net negative impact of R87 million and the storms recorded in 
December negatively impacted the results in the last quarter of 
the year. Repair and replacement costs increased due to inflation, 
resulting in an overall increase in the cost of claims. This was partly 
offset by the release of business interruption reserves held in the 
prior year amounting to R83 million, the inclusion of ONE Financial 
Services profits in the current year, and an increase in Specialty 
underwriting profits. The decline in underwriting results led to a 
net underwriting margin of 3.1% (2021: 4.8%), which is below the 
target range of 4% to 6%.

Credit Guarantee Insurance Corporation
Net underwriting result marginally increased to R502 million 
(2021: R489 million) due to continued underwriting discipline, 
and moderate attritional claims. The business was not directly 
impacted by the weather-related catastrophe events. 

ONE Financial Services
The acquisition of ONE Financial Services has led to additional 
net earned premiums of R1.2 billion in the current year. Net 
underwriting results of R55 million (2021: nil) improved significantly 
from a loss of R36 million during the first half of the year due to the 
effectiveness of remedial actions implemented by management. 
Management action is ongoing and expected to continue to 
balance the risk exposure to the benefit of the business. Net 
underwriting profits were partially offset by increased attritional 
losses on motor sections as well as the catastrophe events claims.

Results from operations were 9% below prior year, primarily driven 
by the decrease in net underwriting result, which was partially 
offset by higher investment returns on insurance funds given the 
higher interest rate environment.

Retail
Net underwriting loss of R392 million(2021: loss of R100 million) 
significantly increased from the prior year, largely due to a 
combination of higher volumes of attritional claims and weather-
related catastrophe claims related to KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and 
North West floods.

iWYZE
The strong net underwriting result of R100 million (2021: R67 million) 
was due to a new excess structure implemented across all products, 
which benefited the claims experience. The weather-related 
catastrophe events had a minimal impact on the results.

Specialty
Net underwriting result of R97 million (2021: R5 million) substantially 
improved from the prior year, primarily driven by ongoing prudent 
underwriting and risk selection practices which assisted in ensuring 
that the attritional losses remained low. This was partially offset by 
the catastrophe claims in our Corporate Property and Marine lines of 
business related to the KwaZulu-Natal floods.

Operational metrics

Old Mutual Africa Regions operates in 12 countries 
across three regions: Southern Africa, East Africa and 
West Africa.

Operating context
The operational environment was challenging in our markets in 2022. The nascent economic 
growth recovery from the COVID-19-driven induced recession was slowed down by rising 
inflation and interest rates, exchange rate volatility, and a tightening of policies by central banks.

Ballooning external debt payments increased demand for US dollars accelerating currency 
volatility and widespread depreciation. In Kenya, Malawi and Ghana, the fiscal pressures forced 
governments into public debt restructuring programmes and to turn to the International 
Monetary Fund for support. Inflationary pressure continues to be a key factor impacting the 
regional economies driven by the knock-on effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 

In Malawi, acute dollar shortages resulted in fuel shortages and challenges in businesses 
meeting US dollar-denominated obligations. The Cholera outbreak in Malawi is putting 
increasing strain on the economy and health system.

In Ghana, the debt restructuring plan announced by the government is expected to result in 
bond holders incurring some losses on the value of their holdings.

The net effect has been pressure on household disposable incomes and rising levels of poverty, 
thus impacting top-line growth in some segments. 

The economic pressures have largely affected the credit quality in the banking businesses 
which we have mitigated by tightening the lending criteria. Our other lines of business have 
experienced top-line growth.

Strategic focus areas

 1 Profitable top-line growth

Our insurance and asset management business delivered strong year on year topline growth driven by improving distribution 
efficiencies and cross-selling as we continue to integrate our offerings. Life APE sales grew on good margins and gross written 
premiums also increased by 27%. Mortality experience improved from prior year but is still elevated. 

We made progress on improving Property and Casualty margins in Kenya, but more work is required in other markets. Although 
growth in our lending book remained constrained as we tightened lending criteria, net lending margins improved from prior 
year. 

We launched a Broker’s portal to improve engagement in West Africa. In Namibia, Rwanda and Uganda, we launched the 
MyOldMutual app to our customers. We also enabled secure web and USSD platforms in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Botswana, 
thus increasing our reach and improving our customers’ access to our solutions.

 2 Turnaround underperforming businesses

The number of profitable operating entities increased to over 80% in comparison to 63% in the prior year. We completed the 
East Africa control improvement project and each business has established the necessary governance systems and structures to 
ensure the sustainability of the control environment. Our Zimbabwe business was also profitable and remitted the 2021 declared 
dividend of USD 1.2 million to the Group. The rightsizing of our Nigeria business continues; however, delays were encountered 
related to the implementation of shared services and automation. We also exited unprofitable product lines and client segments 
and pivoted to corporate sales in East and West Africa to support top-line growth and margins.

3 Strategic partnerships and scaling to optimise long term sustainable return on capital

To support growth and acquisition of new capabilities, we strengthened and expanded bancassurance partnerships in West 
Africa. We continued to pursue other partnerships to support our ambitions in loyalty programmes, strategic distribution and 
claims management. We continue to evaluate options to build scale in our smaller businesses through strategic partnerships 
and pivoting to other profitable financial services verticals in some markets with the goal of optimising return on capital in the 
long term. 

4 Build a leading brand and relevant solutions

We successfully rebranded UAP-Old Mutual entities in Kenya and Rwanda to Old Mutual. In Malawi and Zimbabwe, we continued 
to grow our end-to-end funeral services offerings and integrating them to our suite of risk products. In Kenya we launched 
alternative investments to expand the asset classes available for our long term investors. We continued to scale alternative 
investments in Malawi and Zimbabwe with a bias towards sustainable energy, infrastructure and agriculture.

Trade-off
To improve the affordability of our Property and Casualty products, we 
had to forgo passing on inflationary increases to our customers. We 
instead managed these increases by negotiating preferential pricing 
with suppliers.

We are invested in the implementation of IFRS 17 and are dependent 
on actuarial and finance skills. High demand and scarcity have made it 
increasingly difficult to retain talent in these fields. We have therefore 
improved our employee value proposition for the finance and actuarial 
jobs to improve retention.

Performance overview
Please note that the financial performance commentary excludes 
the performance of our business in Zimbabwe. This is in line 
with the Group decision to exclude Zimbabwe from our key 
performance indicators due to the existing hyperinflationary 
conditions in the country. All other non-financial data points 
include Zimbabwe.

Southern Africa
Gross flows increased by 7% to R13 618 million (2021: 
R12 691 million) due to improved corporate and retail flows in 
Namibia and Malawi as both markets saw a recovery in operating 
conditions following a tapering of the COVID-19 pandemic. This, 
coupled with reduced outflows on account of the non-repeat 
of the high death claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
resulted in a significant improvement in net client cash flow 
to R738 million (2021: R215 million).

Life APE sales increased by 23% to R838 million (2021: R681 million) 
due to large single premium corporate inflows as well as improved 
retail and corporate recurring premium sales in Namibia. The 
value of new business increased by 4% due to higher sales and 
profitable sales mix in Namibia. The effects of high expense 
inflation and increased sales of lower-margin Group funeral 
business in Malawi partially offset the increase in value of new 
business, which led to a reduction in the value of new business 
margin by 120 bps to 3.6% (2021: 4.8%).

The continued tightening of credit granting criteria implemented 
to manage credit quality resulted in gross loans and advances 
decreasing by 4% to R1 281 million (2021: R1 334 million). These 
management actions and improved collections resulted in lower 
impairments, which absorbed the reduction in interest income 
on account of the smaller loan book. As a result, the net lending 
margin improved by 200 bps to 18.3% (2021: R16.3%).

Gross written premiums increased by 10% to R1 087 million 
(2021: R990 million) due to higher new business and renewals 
written in both Namibia and Botswana. Net underwriting margin 
decreased by 80 bps largely due to adverse claims experienced in 
Botswana’s motor book as the lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions 
saw a higher incidence of claims and higher severity of claims due 
to the impact of inflated cost of spare parts.

There was a marked turnaround in results from operations, which 
increased significantly to R984 million (2021: loss of R16 million), 
largely due to a recovery in the Life and Savings business. This was 
attributable to an improved mortality experience across the region 
as the COVID-19 excess claims reported during the third wave did 
not repeat in the current year. In addition, improved experience 
variances and positive assumption changes contributed to the 
improved results. The assumptions changes in 2022 included a 
release of COVID-19 provisions, which was offset by strengthening 
mortality basis in Namibia to mitigate changes in mortality levels 
from future endemics.

Asset Management results from operations increased by 8% to 
R230 million (2021: R213 million) mainly due to higher fee income 
on the back of increased funds under management. This was 
driven by higher flows and improved investment returns following 
a good equity performance in Malawi. The Banking and Lending 
results from operations were flat on prior year due to the lower 
interest income earned on the smaller loan book. Property and 
Casualty results from operations decreased by 20% to R12 million 
(2021: R15 million) due to the adverse claims experience in 
Botswana.

East Africa
Gross flows increased by 65% to R10 943 million (2021: R6 614 million) 
due to strong retail unit trust flows in Uganda and corporate flows 
in Kenya. Higher gross inflows more than offset higher outflows in 
Uganda as customers sought liquidity in the challenging economic 
climate which resulted in net client cash flow of R2 845 million 
(2021: R1 243 million).

Life APE sales increased by 6% to R214 million (2021: R201 million) 
mainly due to improved productivity, which resulted in increased 
retail and corporate sales in Uganda and Kenya. There was an 
improvement in the value of new business and the value of new 
business margin due to the continued higher proportion of more 
profitable corporate sales.

Stricter lending criteria and buyoffs by mainstream banks led 
to a 20% decline in loans and advances to R2 216 million (2021: 
R2 778 million). The stricter lending criteria coupled with improved 
collections translated into lower impairments resulting in a 130 bps 
improvement in the net lending margin.

Good customer acquisition and retention strategies led to a 
33% increase in gross written premiums to R3 822 million (2021: 
R2 873 million). However, poor claims experience resulting from the 
higher incidence of both health and general insurance claims as well 
as the higher cost of claim settlement continue to adversely impact 
the underwriting experience, with the net underwriting margin 
decreasing by 60 bps to negative 8.7% (2021: negative 8.1%).

A turn around in results from operations, at R86 million (2021: 
negative R104 million), was driven by improvements in all lines of 
business. Life and Savings results from operations significantly 
improved due to better mortality experience and positive basis 

changes related to Kenya. The COVID-19 provision of R21 million 
was released in the current year. Asset Management results from 
operations improved by 22% to R60 million (2021: R48 million) due to 
higher fees generated from higher funds under management, which 
benefited from the positive net client cash flow of recent years.

Banking and Lending results from operations improved by 
R35 million, mainly due to lower impairments stemming from 
improved collections and a stabilising loan book. Property and 
Casualty results from operations improved by R6 million due to 
higher investment returns driven by growth in fixed interest assets 
backing policyholder liabilities due to the growth in business written, 
as well as higher yields on fixed assets in Kenya and Uganda. These 
returns offset an underwriting loss as a result of high claims in health 
and motor insurance lines. 

West Africa
Despite increased corporate flows in Nigeria, in line with the strategy 
to pivot towards corporate business, gross flows decreased by 6% to 
R548 million (2021: R583 million) due to a 39% appreciation of the 
rand against the Ghana cedi. In local currency, Ghana flows increased 
by 10% due to higher corporate and retail flows. Net client cash flow 
decreased by 10% as the lower outflows partially offset the decrease 
in inflows, driven by better claims experience.

Life APE sales decreased by 15% to R163 million (2021: R191 million) 
due to the appreciation of the rand against the Ghana cedi. In local 
currency, Life APE sales increased by 2% due to improved retail and 
corporate sales in Ghana, which were partially offset by the closure of 
an unprofitable product line to new business in Nigeria. Value of new 
business and value of new business margin worsened due to low 
margin product mix as well as new business initial expense losses in 
retail book.

Gross written premiums increased by 28% to R245 million (2021: 
R192 million) due to new business onboarded and improved 
productivity. Despite the impact of high inflation on expenses, the 
strong top-line performance coupled with the containment of 
claims resulted in a significant improvement to the net underwriting 
margin.

Life and Savings results from operations loss improved by 4% to 
R26 million (2021: R24 million) due to positive basis changes related 
to the refinement of hedging methodology. Property and Casualty 
results from operations loss improved by 66% to R21 million (2021: 
loss of R62 million) driven by the improved underwriting result and 
higher investment returns on assets backing policyholder liabilities 
due to higher interest rates.
