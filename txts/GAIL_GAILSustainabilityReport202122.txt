Synergy for Green Energy

I am pleased to present GAIL’s 12th Sustainability 
Report, ‘Synergy for Green Energy,’ which demonstrates 
our eff orts to improve Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) performance. GAIL’s resilience has 
been a key driver this year in enabling us to thrive, 
despite the challenges of a post pandemic world.  Our 
employees and systems are adapting to the urgency 
of climate change and we are working on eff ective 
mitigation and adaptation strategies. Additionally, 
geopolitical changes leading to disruptions in supply 
chains and volatile commodity prices have also 
highlighted the need for GAIL to remain agile during 
this time. GAIL has focused this year on ensuring 
growth in the supply of gas, as the transition fuel, 
towards India’s goal of reaching Net Zero by 2070. 

GAIL is dedicated to reducing its carbon impact by 
diversifying into renewable energy, alternate fuels 
and exploring innovative technologies. Committed 
to meet India’s target of reaching Net Zero by 2070, 
GAIL has already embarked on its Net-Zero journey 
through science based ambition and action plan 
with the aim of achieving “100% reduction in Scope 
1 and Scope 2 emissions and a 35% reduction in 
Scope 3 emissions by 2040”. Additionally, GAIL is 
participating in the Internal Carbon Pricing project 
supported by GIZ, Germany coordinated by SCOPE. 
In FY 2021-22, we achieved another milestone in 

our sustainability journey with GAIL Pata (one of the 
few manufacturing locations) receiving a GreenCo 
“Gold” rating from CII, that indicates sustainability is 
deeply ingrained in our operations.

Our organization has a signifi cant responsibility to 
uphold & achieve the Government of India’s vision 
of “One Nation, One Gas Grid”. While fulfi lling this, 
GAIL strives to create a positive impact on the 
environment and society. Our growing contribution 
towards energy security and meeting India’s 
growing energy demands in a low carbon economy 
is unmatched. GAIL currently operates around 
14,500 km of pipeline network and markets two-
thirds of the total quantity of Natural Gas sold in the 
country. Additionally, we will add another 5,000 km 
of pipeline length in the next fi ve years. 

Natural Gas, will be a key transition fuel which is 
going to shape the decarbonisation journey across 
sectors. Apart from large corporations, medium and 
small businesses are also switching to Natural Gas 
to reduce the environmental impact. Our overall 
strategic intent is supported by reviewing and 
reframing our operational systems and procedures 
to mitigate risks and tap emerging opportunities.

This fi nancial year, GAIL has taken further initiatives 
to promote gas markets in new cities and create

new market opportunities. We have focused on 
expansion and ensured that we are on track to meet 
the ambitious targets that were set on the ‘Urja 
Ganga’ project, to bring clean energy to eastern 
India.

Additionally, through our synergistic acquisition 
of 26% equity stake in ONGC Tripura Power 
Company (OTPC), we will further strengthen our 
presence in the North Eastern region of the country. 
Furthermore, in line with the National Hydrogen 
Mission, GAIL has commenced, a first of its kind, pilot 
project to mix hydrogen into natural gas to work 
towards a hydrogen-based and Net-Zero future.  
GAIL is setting up a 10 MW Green Hydrogen plant 
at Vijaipur (Guna District, Madhya Pradesh), as we 
march towards establishing hydrogen economy in 
India, GAIL is also exploring the viability of possible 
hydrogen derivatives in India such as ammonia, 
methanol etc.

GAIL is committed in upholding world-class 
standards to ensure operational safety, performance 
and growth. We take numerous measures to ensure 
better health and well-being of our employees 
and community, through our CSR initiatives. 
Under the ‘GAIL Hriday’ initiative, we aim to 
improve the lives of thousands of underprivileged 
people by generating social capital in the areas of 
education, healthcare, skill development, women 
empowerment and environmental protection. As a 
responsible company, we have spent ` 204.97 crore 
under various initiatives of ‘Hriday’. 

We are also committed to increase the participation 
of local vendors and suppliers in our supply chain, 
in line with the PM’s goal of ‘Vocal for Local’. We 
believe, this will not only reduce the environmental 
impact but also create a positive social impact in the 
long run. 

At GAIL, our mission is to be focused on “Enhancing 
quality of life through clean energy and beyond” 
across the nation by connecting various households, 
industries and the transport sector with eco-friendly 
fuel. Creating a positive customer experience and 
driving value through quality, innovation and 
responsiveness is a strategic pillar in our business 
growth model.

GAIL has always strived for strong governance and 
a robust set of triple bottom line management 

strategies and policies. This guides us into consistent 
implementation of our sustainability agenda 
throughout our joint ventures, locations and 
subsidiaries. By establishing the right leadership, we 
aim to foster a culture of ethics and trust. GAIL’s code 
of conduct is designed to support our commitment 
towards conducting business with the highest 
possible ethical standards. Our business processes 
and practices are focused on achieving excellence 
while addressing issues such as the environment, 
health, safety and human rights. The robustness of 
our governance practices has made GAIL achieve 
performance and operational excellence every year, 
while delivering and serving the nation with top notch 
quality. We are consistently providing steady long-
term returns on the investments to our shareholders. 
This year marked the highest ever dividend payment 
by GAIL in terms of the total dividend amount.

Our report follows the Global Reporting Initiative’s 
“Comprehensive” reporting standards. It also 
complies with the updated Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR), National 
Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct 
(NGRBC), IPIECA 2020, Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB) requirements. I would like 
to thank all the GAIL employees for their ongoing 
dedication and hard work.

It gives us immense pride to mention that GAIL 
(India) Limited was featured at COP26 as part of 
the UN Global Compact-Accenture CEO Study on 
Sustainability for 2021. This was the largest CEO 
study on sustainability and climate change ever 
conducted in the history of global sustainability 
conferences. Out of the numerous businesses 
present across the world, only ten Indian businesses 
were featured in the report and GAIL was one of 
them.

Additionally, GAIL won the prestigious “Sustainably 
Growing Corporation of the Year” award from 
Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry (FIPI) 
this financial year. GAIL has been awarded for 
its conservation practices by PCRA (Petroleum 
Conservation Research Association) ‘Saksham’ a 
campaign launched by MoP&NG. These awards are a 
recognition of GAIL’s continued sustainability efforts. 
We look forward to continue our sustainability 
journey and are delighted to share our progress, thus 
far, through this report.

Message from 
Director (Projects)

At GAIL, we recognise that sustainable growth can only be achieved through purposeful integration 
of economic, environment and social aspects. The overall performance of our company is the 
result of all our eff orts in this direction. GAIL is continually striving to fulfi l rising energy demand 
to serve our country become self-suffi  cient.

We are working diligently to achieve energy security while also addressing growing concerns 
about climate change and carbon emissions.

GAIL is expanding its pipeline network by over 5,400 kilometres during the next few years, at an 
investment of more than ` 25,000 crore. While completion of PM Urja Ganga pipeline Project is 
in full swing, GAIL is also executing 1755 Km long Mumbai-Nagpur-Jharsuguda Pipeline (MNJPL) 
under PM Gati Shakti, which connects Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. 
Apart from this, Barauni- Guwahati (729 Km) Srikakulam- Angul (744 Km), Dhamra – Haldia (252 
Km), etc. are other major pipelines under execution to connect to National Gas Grid.

We are making strides in our eff orts to achieve a zero-emission future. Accordingly, GAIL has 
successfully commissioned India’s First Project for Hydrogen Blending in City Gas Station (Avantika 
Gas Ltd.), Indore on 31st January 2022. GAIL’s Board has also approved the construction of a 10 MW

Message from 
Director (HR)

GAIL acknowledges that Sustainability is most eff ective when integrated into a company’s strategic framework. 
GAIL, as a responsible corporate, is mindful of the impact of our operations in the society and the environment. 
The past few years have been critical for the environment and the climate agenda. As the push towards 
decarbonization strengthens, we are mobilizing all our stakeholders in the value chain to come together to 
support our vision of sustainable development.

The pace at which the social, political and technological environment is changing around us, HR is expected 
to respond, even at a faster pace or rather proactively. The next generation of workers are craving to work for 
meaningful organisations that off er more than just a steady income and progression opportunities. At GAIL, 
we constantly focus our endeavours on building capabilities, nurturing a learning environment, implementing 
the best HR practices in line with global standards, Digitalization of HR process and helping leaders prepare in 
the face of business volatility. Our aim is to nurture a positive culture through pay equity, workforce inclusion, 
diversity and gender sensitivity.

GAIL has been keenly interested in developing Human Capital of the employees though job training and coaching. 
In alignment with GAIL’s philosophy of attaching high priority to Learning & Development, GAIL Training Institute 
(GTI), established in the year 1997 as the intellectual and knowledge management wing of the organization, 
this year completed 25 years of its glorious existence. As part of our skill development eff orts, total 325 no. of 
apprentices were engaged in FY 2021-22 which is 6.69% of total workforce including contractual staff .

GAIL Medical Department, along with HR Department, put their untiring eff orts in ensuring availability of 
timely and effi  cient Medical care though 24x7 Online Consultation, Home Isolation kits in case of COVID-19 
positive detection and organizing Vaccination Camp for employees, their dependent family members and 
PRMS benefi ciaries. We concerted all our eff orts and resources in ensuring that we prepare our employees in 
their fi ght against Covid-19 and its after eff ects, by providing adequate knowledge and support to deal with the 
pandemic, all the while maintaining their spirit. Comprehensive relief measures were notifi ed to take care of the 
dependents of the deceased employees by providing for Education, Medical, Accommodation facilities so as to 
mitigate the hardships of the family. 

During the peak of Covid-19 2nd wave (April 2021 -June 2021), a unique initiative named SPARSH was re-launched 
which was aimed at providing a healing touch to the Covid infected employees and their family members. The 
Sparsh team provided daily support and coordinated with Covid task force in providing medical resources like 
medicine, beds, oxygen concentrators etc, to the employees at the earliest.

During lock down period, security personnel provided security services round the clock, at all Offi  ces/Townships/
Pipeline installations with zero breach of security.

GAIL’s CSR Projects such as Aarogya, Ujjwal, Kaushal, Unnati, Sashakt, Harit under GAIL’s Hriday program 
are a direct representation of our endeavor to support long-term sustainable and inclusive development 
of the society. As part of our social commitment, GAIL spent ` 204.97 crore (3% of the average net profi t of 
the preceding three years) on CSR activities during FY 2021-22 which is more than the statutory mandated 
expenditure of 2% (` 136.46 crore) of average net profi t of the preceding three years. 

I strongly believe that a culture of Sustainability helps in creating a competitive advantage by encouraging 
and maintaining a collective sense of the social environment in the organization. Sustainable business and 
commercial success need to support one and other. By harnessing the unique energy and capability of our 
organisation, the sustainability strategy can create value for society and the company.

Indian economy is on healthy growth path. The expanding economy along with growing population is 
going to increase the consumption of primary energy resources such as Coal, Crude Oil, Natural Gas and 
Renewable Energy in the country. 

Among the available energy sources, Natural Gas being an environment friendly clean fuel has a 
potential to play a signifi cant role in providing solutions to the environmental challenges as well as 
ever growing energy needs in a sustainable manner. Accordingly, Government of India has focused to 
promote the usage of natural gas as a fuel/feedstock across the country to increase the share of natural 
gas in primary energy mix from current level of 6.7% to 15%.

Gas Pipeline infrastructure is an economical and safe mode of transporting the natural gas by connecting 
gas sources to gas consuming markets. Gas pipeline practically determines the structure of the gas 
market and its development. Therefore, an interconnected National Gas Grid is envisaged to  ensure the 
adequate availability and equitable distribution of natural gas in all parts of the country.

For India, a gas-based economy is critical and progress is being made towards the goal of “One Nation, 
One Gas Grid.” One Nation, One Gas Grid refers to the integration of several regional networks, resulting 
in the creation of a National Grid for supplying natural gas-generated energy to various stakeholders 
such as the central government, state governments, the public and commercial sectors.

The committee also ensures compliance with 
the policy through direct supervision of all 
sustainability initiatives and responsible for 
executing the company’s sustainability goals as 
well as risk and performance management. We are 
extremely concerned about the environmental 
impact of our operations and managing the same 
take precedence. Efforts are constantly made to 
reduce or neutralize the impact of greenhouse 
gases and to achieve zero waste disposal.

Various units at the organization are actively 
assessing the risk posed by climate change. 
We have separate groups that coordinate 
risk management throughout the firm. While 

HSE is coordinating for all risks pertaining to 
environmental and safety issues, the CSR group 
is coordinating for all risks pertaining to social 
impact related issues. These groups ensure that 
all existing and anticipated environmental, 
economic and social risks are addressed. The 
risks are recognized, evaluated qualitatively and 
quantitatively, analysed and effectively managed 
by implementing mitigation plans. 

4.1.4  Sustainability Activities 

At GAIL, we recognize our role in establishing  
India’s energy security in line with nation’s 
decarbonization strategies and our commitment 
towards meeting India’s ever growing clean 
energy demand. To achieve this, we are in process 
diversifying our supply chain as well as building a  
portfolio of clean energy sources. As a testament of 
our sustainability efforts, we were amongst the 10 
Indian companies to be highlighted at the United 
Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties 
(COP26) 2021, as a part of UN Global Compact – 
Accenture CEO Study on Sustainability.

During FY 2021-22, we initiated and executed 
several projects and programmes across multiple 
sites as part of our Annual Sustainability Workplan 
in order to realize our sustainable growth vision:

 y We have set a target to achieve Net-Zero 
(scope 1 and scope 2) status by 2040, while 
reducing our scope 3 emission by 35% (from 
baseline year of 2020-2021) by 2040.  

 y GAIL has awarded the contract to set up the 
10 MW, Green Hydrogen project based on PEM 
technology that will produce 4.3 tonnes of green 
hydrogen per day  of 99.99% purity, which will 
be mixed in natural gas for supply to industries. 

 y In the field of CBG, GAIL has signed investment 
agreements with 04 numbers of start-ups 
working in the area of Compressed Bio-Gas 
(CBG) sector for a financial commitment of  
INR 7 crore. Furthermore, we are also in process 
of constructing our first CBG facility with a  
5 TPD capacity, in collaboration with Ranchi 
Municipal Corporation and has entered into 
a 22-year concession deal for the supply of 
municipal solid waste (MSW) and related 
infrastructure for the construction of the plant.

in association with Central Institute of Mining 
and Fuel Research (CIMFER), Dhanbad. 

4.1.5 Monitoring of Sustainability Projects

4.1.5.1  Dashboards

Understanding the importance of real-time 
monitoring for efficient management of  
resources, we have developed number of 
dashboards using our in-house capabilities. 
These dashboards  enable us to conduct real-
time monitoring of various significant energy 
users (SEUs), such as Gas Turbines, Heavy Duty 
Steam Turbines, Centrifugal Compressors, Gas 
Cracking Furnaces, Boilers, Heat Recovery Steam 
Generators (HRSGs), other process heaters, 
Extruder units.

4.1.5.2 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
Community Member

Being a founding member of GRI South Asia 
Consortium since 2013, GAIL has been engaging 

with the GRI in various aspects to make its 
sustainability reporting practices more relevant 
and transparent. 

4.1.5.3  GreenCo Assessment of the sites

As part of our efforts to reduce our energy 
consumption, we are constantly implementing 
various energy efficiency initiatives across our 
sites. To further streamline these efforts, GAIL has 
commenced the process of implementing the 
GreenCo Rating across its several sites.

GreenCo Rating implementation gives firms 
with leadership and direction on how to make 
their products, services and processes more 
environmentally friendly by evaluating the 
enterprises on the environmental friendliness 
of their activities using a life cycle approach. 
During FY 2021-22, GAIL’s Pata plant achieved the 
distinction of becoming the first GAIL unit to be 
awarded the “GreenCo Gold” rating by CII Sohrabji 
Green Business Centre. Further, GAIL Gandhar 
unit and Vizag-Secunderabad LPG Pipeline (VSPL) 
received the “GreenCo Silver” rating.

Our Stakeholder Inclusion and Materiality
At GAIL, we acknowledge our responsibility to 
identify and meet stakeholder expectations to 
create long-term value for all stakeholders. We 
engage with our stakeholders and understand 
their concerns and interests through the 
materiality assessment process. Materiality 
assessment is crucial to determine the key topics 
that could have a signifi cant impact on our 
stakeholders as well as on our business. The new 
BRSR requirement now also includes reporting 
on the signifi cant material issues identifi ed and 
the rationale for identifying them.

During FY 2021-22, we undertook the ‘Towards 
Sustainable and Net Zero GAIL Survey 2021-
22’ as a key step to gather the perspectives 
and feedback from our stakeholders. The 
survey recorded participation from around 252 
employees. The outcome of such feedback and 
materiality assessment was utilized in defi ning 
the Company’s key ESG priorities and develop 
action plan to address the same.

5.1  Our Stakeholders
Stakeholder engagement is a multi-stage process 
of identifying and prioritizing stakeholders, 
identifying the means and modes of the 
engagement and managing the stakeholder 

expectations periodically. We have identifi ed and 
prioritized our internal and external stakeholders 
based on their relative importance to our 
business and their impact on our business and 
vice versa. A full list of individuals and groups 
whose interests are aff ected or could be aff ected 
by our activities was created and classifi ed into 
internal and external stakeholder groups. The 
internal stakeholders comprise all the employees 
whereas the key external stakeholders comprise 
the remaining 12 stakeholder groups.

environmental challenges. Systematic channels of 
interaction with our stakeholders are embedded 
within our business processes, which include one-
on-one meetings, annual general meetings, training, 
group discussions, surveys, supplier and customer 
meetings and grievance redressal methods.

Stakeholder concerns are assessed and taken 
into account at a strategic level. It is our constant 
endeavour to strengthen our stakeholder 
engagement mechanism and expand  
stakeholder participation continuously. Meeting 
our stakeholders’ expectations is incredibly 
valuable and our stakeholder engagement 
framework represents how we connect with 
them and address their concerns.

5.2  Finding Focus Areas: Materiality 
Assessment
We believe that it is important to identify how 
our operations are impacting our stakeholders 
and how stakeholders expectations impact our 
business to ensure sustainable business growth 
and value creation for all stakeholders. Creating 
value for all stakeholders in our value chain and 
beyond has always been critical to our vision. 
Hence, determination (materiality assessment) 
of key material topics that impact our operation, 
as well as our stakeholders, remains an important 
exercise. This enables us to align our sustainability 
and business objectives with societal needs 
and expectations, thereby ensuring long-term 
sustainability and enhancement of stakeholder 
value.

Rather than adopting a one size fits all approach, 
we have referred to standards specific to the oil 
and gas sector such as International Petroleum 
Industry Environmental Conservation Association 
(IPIECA) and International Finance Corporation 
(IFC) standards for offshore exploration and 
SASB industry-specific standards for materiality 
assessment. This ensures that the disclosures are 
material, comparable and will provide a decisive 
way forward for investors.

The comprehensive and strategic materiality 
assessment framework has enabled us to  
identify, review, analyse the potential 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
issues that could impact our operations 
and stakeholders. We have recalibrated our 
materiality considering contemporary relevance. 
Identification and prioritization of material topics 
are the most critical steps towards understanding 
a company’s sustainability approach and 
performance.  This enables us to understand how 
the resources are allocated and utilized. 

The materiality assessment consists of five phases: 
understanding the context, identifying actual 
and potential impacts, assessing the significance 
of impacts, prioritizing the impacts and review 
by the senior leadership. The following sections 

describe the five steps to determine material 
topics in more detail.

5.2.1  Phase I:  Understanding the context

This step includes creating an initial overview 
of the activities and business relationships. It 
includes considering business activities, business 
relationships, stakeholders and sustainability 
context of all the entities GAIL controls or has 
an interest in (e.g., subsidiaries, joint ventures, 
affiliates), including minority interests. 

5.2.2  Phase II: Identify actual and potential 
impacts

This step includes identifying actual and 
potential impacts of the topics on the economy, 
environment and people, including impacts 
on their human rights, across our activities 
and business relationships. Actual impacts are 
those that have already occurred and potential 
impacts are those that could occur but have not 
yet occurred. These impacts include negative 
and positive impacts, short-term and long-term 
impacts, intended and unintended impacts and 
reversible and irreversible impacts. 

Diverse sources such as oil and gas sector-
specific standards, legal reviews, anti-corruption 
compliance management systems, financial audits, 
occupational health and safety inspections and 
shareholder filings help in identifying such impacts.

5.2.3  Phase III: Assess the significance of 
the impacts

Relevant stakeholders are consulted to assess 
the significance of its impacts through relevant 
engagement mechanisms. The responses of 
relevant stakeholders are analysed to determine 
the significance of the impact of probable 
material issues. The severity of an actual or 
potential negative impact is determined by the 
following characteristics:

 y Scale: how grave the impact is.

 y Scope: how widespread the impact is, for 
example, the number of individuals affected 
or the extent of environmental damage. 

GRI 102-44



Sustainability Report  2021-22

43

GRI 102-47,  GRI 103-1

 y Irremediable character: how hard it is to 
counteract or make good the resulting harm.

5.2.4  Phase IV: Prioritize the most significant 
impacts for reporting

The material topics are prioritized based on their 
significance as per stakeholder consultation and are 
ranked into high, medium and low. Prioritization helps 
us in focusing on highly material topics first and then 
directing our efforts towards other material topics.

5.2.5  Phase V: Review

Once the topics are prioritized, our senior executives 

or group of senior executives in the organization 
review the topics. The senior leadership reviews the 
process and results of the assessment and provide 
their inputs The involvement of senior leadership 
in materiality assessment is the testament to the 
fact that materiality assessment and stakeholder 
consultation is given utmost priority. The following 
table highlights the key material issues for GAIL 
under the Economic & Governance, Environmental 
and Social dimensions. The issues are further 
ranked in three categories – High, medium and 
low based on their importance to GAIL and their 
important to our stakeholders.

GAIL, as a responsible Public Sector Undertaking, 
sets the standard for ethical business conduct by 
prioritizing the development and implementation 
of a solid corporate governance structure. GAIL’s 
corporate governance framework is intended 
to detect, analyse and handle the risks, as well 
as provide constructive feedback, to align 
management’s responsibilities with the Board’s

01 woman Director. The typical tenure of a 
Board member is three to four years. Our Board 
of Director’s diversity policy mentions that the 
Board should include an optimal mix of executive 
and non-executive directors, with at least one

Government of India nominates and appoints the 
directors. 

Our executives have extensive experience in the 
fi elds of marketing, project, operators, fi nance 
and governance and they place a high emphasis 
on sustainability and ESG. We additionally 
hold frequent capacity-building sessions on 
the changing ESG landscape including climate 
change, which are detailed in the subsequent 
chapters of this report. Additional information

management and ensure that all the stakeholder 
needs are met promptly. The Board of Directors 
and senior management team endeavour to

6.1.4  Performance Evaluation, Remuneration 
and Incentives

We are a Public Sector Enterprise and our Directors 
are appointed/nominated by the Government 
of India, which also carries out the performance 
evaluation as an appointing authority. The role of 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee is as per 
SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, the Companies Act, 
2013 and Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) 
guidelines on Corporate Governance for Central 
Public Sector Enterprises, 2010 as amended from 
time to time. As on 31st March 2022, the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee of the company  
comprised of Dr. Nandhagopal Narayanasamy as the 
Chairperson, Dr. Navneet Mohan Kothari and Shri 
Sher Singh as the member(s). Prior to consideration 
by the Board, the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee is responsible for reviewing issues 
relating to compensation and incentives other than 
Performance Related Payment (PRP). Performance 
of the company and board members are evaluated 
on both financial and non-financial criteria, as 
specified in the MoU between GAIL and the Ministry 
of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG). The MoU 

provides the vision, weightage and targets which 
are related to economic parameters like revenue, 
Market Cap, Capex, EBITA etc as well as expenditure 
on R&D/innovation initiatives, procurement 
from MSMEs (marginalised groups and women), 
compliance with Company’s Act etc. The senior 
management performance evaluation, which 
includes the CMD, Directors, EDs and GMs, is based 
on the individual’s parametric scoring based on 
the GAIL’s business, financial, CSR, human resource 
and R&D performance during the reporting 
period. This comprises both financial and non-
financial goals aimed at improving the company’s 
overall ESG performance. The Annual Report and 
the MOU signed with the government contain 
more information on the performance target and 
its equivalent compensation. The performance-
related remuneration is calculated using the 
performance evaluation score and the composite 
score. Despite the continuing adverse effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in the current reporting year, 
GAIL has made sincere attempts to fulfil its MoU 
responsibilities. Self-evaluation of the MoU for FY 
2021-22 will be completed and submitted to the 
Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) on time.

Avoidance of Conflict of Interest
By establishing the right leadership, we aim to 
foster a culture of ethics and trust. To ensure that 
there are no conflicts of interest in workforce 
operations, we promote transparency and 

responsibility among all our stakeholders. 
Furthermore, we are fostering a trustworthy 
workplace in which employees are not hesitant 
to raise and expose potential conflicts of interest. 
A Board-level deliberation is also conducted 
to adequately manage such difficulties and 
concerns. In this sense, GAIL’s conflict of interest 
policies are as follows:

 y Whenever any director has a direct or indirect 
stake in an agenda/matter, they would refrain 
from participating in the discussion. Each 
director gives the disclosure of his interest in 
any company or body’s corporate firm, or other 
association of individuals by giving a notice in 
writing; and the same is put up to the Board.

 y GAIL’s Related Party Transaction Policy enables  
us to address any related party transaction-
related challenges and concerns. The SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
(Fourth Amendment) Regulations, 2019 
(Amended from time to time) and the 
Companies Act, 2013, govern the parameters for 
this policy. It also includes materiality policies 
and recommendations for handling transactions 
involving related parties. Our Annual Report 
is the vehicle through which we disclose our 
concerns with conflicts of interest.

Our Annual Report contains further information  
on each Director’s attendance, number of additional 
Directorships, Chairmanship/ Membership of 
Committees and stock ownership.

6.1.6 Internal Control System and their 
Adequacy

To increase operational and financial integrity, 
we have established promising principles, 
frameworks and policies as part of our internal

control system. Improved financial reporting 
process contribute to the development of more 
accurate and dependable financial statements 
as well as more comprehensive audits. GAIL’s 
Internal Financial Control System (IFC) helps 
the organization generate updated formal, 
centralized and controlled internal financial 
control documentation. Following the IFC 
compliance study, a Risk Control Matrix (RCM) was 
created in consultation with external consultants.

GAIL has received NIL comments from Comptroller 
and Auditor General (CAG) for 13th year in a row in 
FY 2021-22.

Audit Committees play a critical role in overseeing 
internal control. Our internal audit team provides 
guidance and recommendations on potential 
gaps and risks, as well as potential efficiencies 
and process improvements. Members of the 
audit team have academic and professional 
backgrounds in accounting, information 
technology and engineering. This group evaluates 
the risk management system and informs the 
audit committee. The Board’s audit committee is 
responsible for authorising the annual audit and 
reviewing findings of the audit team as well as 
the CAG audit. The internal audit team also audits 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and E&P blocks for the 
promoters.

6.1.7  Ethics and Integrity

GAIL’s Code of Conduct is intended to support 
our commitment to conducting business with 
the highest ethical standards possible. Our 
corporate processes and practices are geared 
toward achieving excellence while addressing 
issues such as the environment, health and safety 
and human rights, among others.

Our beliefs, principles and standards are outlined 
in GAIL’s Code of Conduct and accompanying 
circulars, which serve as the foundation for our 
operations. We cultivate and enable long-term 
growth, as well as trustworthy connections with 
our clients, staff and business partners. This 
Code of Conduct is required to be followed by all 

employees, including senior management and 
Board members, contractors and all corporate 
representatives. As a responsible company, we 
follow anti-corruption, anti-boycott, export 
control and trade sanctions legislation across 
all our locations. In FY 2021-22, 215 employees 
(4.52% of total employees) underwent training on 
anti-corruption and other organizational practices. 
Our strong policy frameworks allow us to build our 
business in a sustainable way while also protecting 
us from corruption and other unethical conduct.

The policies that govern ethics and integrity in 
our organization are listed below.

 y Code of Conduct, Discipline and Appeal 
(CDA) Rules/Standing Orders

 y Fraud Prevention Policy

 y Whistle Blower Policy

 y Code of Fair Disclosure and Conduct

 y Practices and Procedures for disclosure of 
unpublished price sensitive information.

 y Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and 
Report Trading by Insiders

 y Code of Conduct for Board Members and 
Senior Management Personnel

We have also included a policy for determining 
materiality disclosure to ensure that our material 
concerns are communicated to our stakeholders 
on time. This policy follows Regulation 30 of SEBI 
LODR, 2015.

We undertake awareness workshops on a regular 
basis to ensure that our staff and suppliers are 
committed to fighting corruption and ensuring 
that we are entirely independent of it. In addition, 
we conduct periodic risk assessments to identify 
potential corruption issues in our operational 
units. During FY 2021-22, we had one corruption-
related instance and no other major risk of 
corruption was discovered and reported.

Employees are encouraged to report any 
suspicious, unlawful, unethical, or improper acts 
in the business under the Right to Information,

Transparency in Business

We hold regular meetings and communicate with 
our stakeholders, shareholders, policymakers 
and peer companies to take the steps necessary 
to improve our advocacy approach. This aids 
us in enhancing and strengthening our anti-
corruption practices, as well as other parts of our 
sustainability projects. The Board of Directors 
examine internal policies pertaining to training, 
implementation and monitoring actions on a 
regular basis. We publicly state clear positions, 
voice our concerns and keep ourselves up to date 
on industry best practices to adapt and enhance 
our projects through dialogues and forums.

Tax Strategy

GAIL is a public sector undertaking. The 
Government of India (GoI) holds 51.45% of the 
paid-up equity share capital. Policy related to 
tax strategies are governed by the GoI. We follow 
statutory requirements including provident fund, 
employees’ state insurance, income-tax, sales-
tax, service tax, duty of customs, duty of excise, 
value added tax, cess, Goods and Service Tax and 
any other statutory dues with the appropriate 
authorities. We strictly adhere to amendments to 
tax policies notified by the GOI.

Settlement of Direct Tax Cases – GAIL has applied 
for settlement of direct tax dispute of FY 2020-21, 
under the ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ scheme which was 
accepted by the Income Tax Department. This will 
result in the settlement of 44 direct tax cases.

Anti-competitive Behaviour

All our stakeholders’ actions combine to help us 
encourage and maintain clarity in our business 
operations. We ensure that anticompetitive 
behaviour is discouraged to strengthen our 
business. At all levels of our organization, we do 
this by aligning our systems and procedures with 
the national and international norms. In the last 
five years, we have paid no fine or settlements for 
such wrongdoings.

Cases that were brought to the notice of the 
dispute resolution processes are still pending. 

In addition, status updates on anticompetitive 
activity, antitrust violations, monopoly legislation 
and unfair trade practices, in which we have 
been identified as a participant, were also filed. 
The status of causes related to anti-competitive 
behaviour, irresponsible advertising, unfair 
trade practices and violations of anti-trust and 
monopoly legislation; in which we have been 
identified as a participant, is submitted.

We have submitted the status of the following 
cases up to FY 2021-22, which were settled/
pending regarding unfair trade practices, anti-
competitive behaviours, monopolization as 
identified against GAIL:

i) GSPCL filed a case against GAIL before PNGRB 
claiming Restrictive Trade Practice (RTP) for 
not allowing to change connectivity from 
GAIL-PLL to GSPL-PLL connectivity. PNGRB 
made rulings against GAIL. GAIL challenged 
the same before APTEL which decided in favor 
of GAIL. GSPCL appealed against that order 
before Supreme Court which is pending.

ii) GSPC Gas filed a case against GAIL claiming 
RTP before PNGRB but the same was held 
in favor of GAIL. GSPC Gas has filed appeal 
against the said order before APTEL and the 
order of PNGRB has been reversed. Now GAIL 
has pressed appeal before Supreme Court, 
which is pending.

iii) GSPCL filed a complaint against GAIL before 
PNGRB alleging restrictive practice while 
booking of pipeline capacity on Renewable 
Energy Basis. PNGRB while disposing of 
the complaint filed by GSPCL for booking 
of capacity on RE Basis held that practice  
adopted by GAIL while booking common 
carrier capacity is discriminatory and 
amounts to restrictive trade practice in as 
much as it offers bundled services to its 
customers without requiring them to execute 
standard GTA on Ship or Pay basis and puts 
such restriction on other gas suppliers. 
PNGRB directed GAIL to cease RTP and has 
also imposed civil penalty of INR 1 lakh on 
GAIL. GAIL challenged the said order before 

GRI 206-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 419-1

6.1.8 Stakeholder Grievance Redressal45

We have multiple mechanism (Grievances 
Redressal Forum, Customer Relations 
Management (CRM), Vigilance Complaints, Vendor 
Grievance) to receive and resolve grievances of 
community, stakeholders, large public etc. Our 
grievances systems also ensure transparency, 
expectations of the community. GAIL has 
established a dedicated grievance cell in each 
of its offices and all complaints are received in a 
single system and each grievance is investigated 
separately and thoroughly with equal importance. 
GAIL has an Online Complaint System which has 
been introduced as a part of the 360° evaluation 
of receiving and redressing grievances of the 
community. Additionally, we also redress and 
resolve the complaints received on CPGRAMS.

6.1.9 Grievance Redressal Mechanism

At GAIL, two of our top priorities are stakeholder 
responses and concerns. The grievance redressal 
mechanism allows our stakeholders to submit 
complaints or grievances, which allows us to 
respond quickly to any issue raised by them, 
allowing us to provide better services. We have 
created an online grievance redress platform 
called ‘Samadhan’ that all our stakeholders 
can use to voice their complaints. Violations 

of systems and corruption, forgery, cheating, 
misappropriation, favours, deliberate ignorance, 
reckless decision-making, procedures and 
irregularities in the exercise of delegated power 
can all be reported and handled using our online 
portal: http:// GAILonline.com/onlineComplants.
html. There is also an option to lodge complaints 
or problems directly with the factory head at 
every location of our operation through the OIC 
Sampark email. 

To provide citizens and the public at large with 
a grievance redressal mechanism, all the written 
complaints received from all the workplaces  
and centres are uploaded to the Centralized 
Public Grievance Redressal and Monitoring 
System (CPGRAMS), which is accessible to all 
the citizens, who have lodged this complaint. 
CPGRAMS is a Government of India Portal, aimed 
at providing the citizens with a platform for 
redress of their grievances, where complaints are 
directly received by the MoPNG.

During FY 2021-22, a total of 347 public grievances 
through centralized public grievance redress and 
monitoring system (CPGRAMS) were received 
during the reporting period. All those received 
complaints on CPGRAM portal are resolved under 
the grievance redressal system.

GAIL Vigilance reviews the internal processes, 
carries out regular surprise checks, periodic 
inspections, detailed intensive inspections 
and examination of CAG / Internal Audit paras 
for detection of Vigilance angles, if any. The 
lapses observed are analysed and systemic 
improvements are suggested to ensure avoidance 
of re-occurrence of lapses. Efforts are made to bring 
in continuous system improvement to ensure 
greater transparency, automation of processes 
for reducing manual intervention. To sensitize the 
stakeholders- employees, customers, contractors, 
vendors, various awareness workshops are held 
at various GAIL locations. During the FY-2021-
22, 38 surprise/ periodic inspections of various 
Contracts/ process/ files pertaining to various 
GAIL locations were carried out. In addition to

received from various sources. Based on the 
examination and investigation of complaints/
case, appropriate action against the concerned 
officials/ vendor/ supplier etc. is recommended to 
the Disciplinary Authority. Apart from this, regular 
surprise checks/ inspections are conducted to 
detect any system gaps/ lapses/ irregularities or 
any incidence of corruption. 

FY 2021-22, we received 128 complaints under 
vigilance, 125 complaints (including previous 
year complaints) were successfully resolved.

6.2 Risk Management
 y Risk Management is an ongoing process of 

identifying, analysing and managing risks 
within all the operational units of GAIL. While 
we adhere to all the standards and keep pace 
with our industry peers, we map and manage 
both financial and non-financial risks through 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).

 y Risk assessment of several factors (climate 
change, fuel prices, energy supply security, 
etc.) that could potentially influence our 
business growth is studied and analysed 
through Enterprise Risk Management. As a 
part of the process, the risk management 
plan includes business continuity planning, 
risk communication and resource allocation, 
amongst others.

6.2.1  Overarching Management Approach 

Our committed and independent Risk 
Management department implements the 
comprehensive risk management policy 
framework, on both the corporate and 
business levels to improve our approach to 
risk management to meet the demands of an  
evolving business environment. The risk 
management policy allows us to be proactive  
in reviewing, reporting and mitigating risks at  
our company while also contributing to long-
term business growth.

The ERM provides an integrated framework  
for Board to examine organisational risks on a 
regular basis by offering an objective picture of 
the overall control system that leads to GAIL and 
its subsidiaries’ overall risk management. 
Furthermore, it provides a better grasp of the 
opportunities for improving company processes 
related to operations.

The ERM has been implemented in all facilities, 
including zonal marketing offices, across the 
company. The Board of Directors are the highest 
governing authority in charge of assessing the 
efficiency of GAIL’s risk management practices. 
The Board, through the Audit Committee, Risk 
Management Committee, Corporate Level Risk 
Steering Committee oversees the establishment 
and implementation of an adequate system of 
risk management across the organization. The 
Chief Risk Officer (CRO), unit level risk steering 

committee chairman and Corporate Level Risk 
Steering Committee review various types of 
risks whether existing and or anticipated in the 
short, medium and long-term in future. The 
Risk Management Department apprises the 
Corporate Level Risk Steering Committee (CLRSC) 
of executive directors chaired by the Director (BD) 
quarterly, Board level committee of RMC chaired 
by independent director biannually and Audit 
Committee and the Board annually.

Unit level risks including social and environmental 
risks are mapped and are being monitored quarterly 
through the unit level Risk Steering Committee 
headed by unit OICs/ Functional Heads. Mitigation 
measures are also devised and monitored by 
respective units. GAIL has identified top corporate 
key risks which includes market, logistic, strategic, 
JV subsidiary and financial risks.

Risk Management and Strategic Initiatives

GAIL’s comprehensive risk management 
initiatives enable us to meet our goals and 
protect our operations while adhering to legal, 
regulatory and societal expectations. We improve 
our ability to respond and adapt to the changing 
environment by mitigating risks.

Our risk management entails a three-step 
examination that includes identifying, analysing 
and evaluating potential threats to corporate 
operations. This procedure aids in the strategic 
direction and management of our company’s 
operations, as well as the proper risk management. 
A risk register review report is submitted by 
the unit risk owners quarterly by the 10th day, 
following the quarter-end and a risk database 
review report is submitted annually by 15th June, 
following the financial year-end through online 
Risk Management System (RMS).

The Company evaluates various types of risks, 
including commercial and financial risks as well 
as non-financial risks such as climate change, 
fuel pricing and energy supply security, all of 
which could have an impact on the Company 
in the future. The “Risk Rating” is assigned to the 
identified risks based on their impact on the

6.2.2  Key Risks and Mitigation Measures

Some risks are simpler to control, while others necessitate a significant amount of time. As a result, tying 
risks to the financial year is challenging. To improve operational performance, the GAIL Corporate Level 
Risk Steering Committee has identified risks and mitigation strategies. We are taking the necessary steps 
to resolve/deliberate the risks that have been identified. Stakeholders should consult the Management 
Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of the Annual Report for more information on specific risks.

duration between the occurrence of an incident 
and its impact on GAIL is considered while 
calculating “Risk Velocity.”

The corporate level risk steering committee 
(CLRSC) is expected to examine the status of all 
Corporate Level Residual Key Risks, including 
economic, environmental and social risks, on a 
quarterly basis, as per the authorised Risk 
Management policy. Prior to placing before Audit 
Committee, the status is deliberated in the Risk 
Management Committee (RMC). The status is put 
up to the Board annually for approval. We are very 
sensitive to the environmental impact of our 
operations. Efforts are always in place to minimize 
/ neutralize the impact of greenhouse gases and 
zero waste disposal. Various units are working to 
identify the threat posed by climate change. 
Within GAIL HSE, there are groups that coordinate 
all risks related to environmental and safety 
issues. The CSR group oversees coordinating all 
risks associated with social and CSR issues. These 

groups ensure that all present and future 
environmental, economic and social risks are 
identified, qualitatively and quantitatively 
assessed, analysed and correctly managed 
through the implementation of effective 
mitigation plans. Our Management is updated on 
a regular basis by both groups.

FY 2021-22 is important in context of the global 
energy and oil markets because the year marks 
a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which 
caused a signifi cant drop in energy production 
and consumption. 

Recently, the ongoing geopolitical crisis has 
also had an impact on the global energy sector, 
emphasising the importance of diversifying 
energy supplies for countries all over the world to 
achieve energy security. 

Further, due to increased emphasis on climate 
change post COP-26 (Conference of the Parties), 
governments around the world are working 
towards transitioning to low-carbon energy 
systems such as renewable, electric vehicles, 
blue and green hydrogen projects, Carbon 
Capture Utilization & Storage (CCUS) and more. 
According to the BP World Energy Outlook 2022, 
the share of renewable energy in the global 
primary energy mix is expected to rise. However, 
it also emphasizes that fossil fuels will continue 
to remain prominent in the overall primary 
energy mix and will be responsible for social and 
economic development around the world in the 
coming decades.

As per BP Statistics review, natural gas 
consumption for the last 5 years given below 
indicates that the global demand for gas has 
recovered rapidly post the pandemic:

Consumption 
(in bcm)

3,654 3,837 3,903 3,822 4,038

The global gas demand is expected to peak in 
2035, after which situations are anticipated to 
alter due to growing decarbonization pressures 
refl ected in national priorities across the world. 

LNG is also going to play a key role in the next 
few years as natural gas is going to get a bigger 
share in the world’s energy basket. A combination 
of strong demand, stiff  Asian competition for 
LNG imports (particularly from China due to the 
coal crisis), the current geopolitical situation and 
relatively low inventories at the start of the winter 
heating season resulted in a short-term natural 
gas supply crunch, across much of the world.

India Energy Sector 

India is at an inflection point with respect to 
energy consumption. Because of rising incomes 
and living standards, India is now the world’s 
third-largest energy consumer. Since 2000, 
energy consumption has more than doubled, 
with coal, oil and solid biomass still meeting 80% 
of demand. Despite the rapid growth in absolute 
energy consumption, measured on a per capita 
basis, India’s energy consumption is still less than 
half of the global average (Source-IEA). As India 
recovers from a Covid-induced slump in 2020, it 
will re-enter a highly dynamic phase in its energy 
development journey.

An expanding economy, rapid urbanization and a 
growing population are the fundamental drivers 
of India’s energy demand, setting India on track 
to becoming one of the most significant energy 
markets by 2040. The nation’s per capita energy 
consumption is expected to surge further by 
three to four times over the long term and hence 
ensuring energy security for the country is of 
utmost importance. 

According to the 2021-22 Economic Survey, fossil 
fuel-based energy will continue to outmatch 
the year-on-year growth of any other source of 
energy in the country. Thermal energy accounts 
for the largest share of total installed capacity in 
utilities (61.42%), followed by renewable energy 
(24.7%) and hydro (12.09%). Coal is India’s most 
important and abundant fossil fuel, accounting 
for 55% of the country’s energy needs.

Natural gas currently makes up roughly 6.7% 
of India’s primary energy mix and is targeted 
to reach 15% by 2030. Because of rising 
infrastructure and supportive environmental 
policies, India’s medium-term outlook for natural 
gas consumption remains optimistic. Residential, 
transportation and energy are also expected to 
drive demand.

On the regulatory front, the government, Ministry 
of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoP&NG) and 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board 
(PNGRB) have taken several actions to promote 
gas use in India and create a strong gas-based 
economy.

The GoI has an energy strategy for the country 
with the goal of increasing the availability of 
affordable and clean energy for all citizens. At 
the COP26 summit in Glasgow, in November 
2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged 
to cut India’s total projected carbon emissions 
by 1 billion tonnes by 2030, reduce the carbon 
intensity of the nation’s economy by less than 
45% by the end of the decade and reach net-zero 
carbon emissions by 2070. This has led to the 
emergence of an alternate energy market, with 

a mission to transition to a low carbon economy. 
In this endeavour, gas is expected to play a 
significant role as a transition fuel.

GAIL is pushing its targets and strategies towards 
achieving the goal of energy security for the nation 
while also considering key sustainability issues 
such as carbon emissions and climate change. We 
currently operate a pipeline network of 14,500 
km and market two-thirds of the total amount of 
natural gas sold in the country. Additionally, we 
will add another 5,000 km of pipeline length in the

Synergy for Green Energy

next five years. The GoI has planned investments 
worth multi-billion USD towards establishing ‘One 
Nation One Gas Grid’, indicating their commitment 
to building a gas-based economy. This nation-wide 
momentum has provided GAIL with the space for 
expansion. GAIL has been focused on expansion 
and ensured that we are on track towards meeting 
the ambitious targets that were set on the Urja 
Ganga project, to bring clean energy to eastern 
India. Additionally, we are expanding our presence 
in the north eastern region of the country through 
our synergistic acquisition of ONGC Tripura Power 
Company (OTPC). 

Several strategic initiatives were identified 
across various business verticals, primarily 
focusing on core areas like Gas Sourcing and 
Marketing, Expansion of National Gas Grid (NGG), 
Petrochemicals including PDHPP and CGDs, 
amongst others. Apart from these, new potential 
growth drivers such as creating a sizable 
renewable energy portfolio, entering specialty 
chemicals, investing in new technologies and 
clean energy have also been analysed.

As part of short-term strategic objectives, we 
are continuing to serve the country’s natural 
gas demand while building gas pipeline 
infrastructure across the nation. With a vision 
of enabling India towards gas-based economy, 
we are implementing CGD projects and market 
development to supply natural gas to domestic, 
industrial and commercial customers. In terms of 
petrochemicals, we foresee the organization as 
becoming the foremost domestic petrochemical 
player both through expansions at the existing 
plant at Pata and setting up of a new unit at 
Usar, while also exploring a new greenfield 
ethane cracker project. We take pride in being 
among the top ten global LNG players and we 
strive to become a global energy portfolio player 
in the field of LNG by leveraging our diverse 
portfolio and pursuing business interests in 4-5 
international markets.

Regulatory, market and price risks are interrelated 
to the strategic initiatives of the dynamic oil 

and gas industry both nationally and globally. 
Geopolitical changes leading to disruptions in 
supply chains and volatile commodity prices have 
also highlighted the need for us to remain agile 
during this time. This year, we have remained 
profitable thorough proactive measures such as 
using US cargos for arbitrage and forward time 
swap of cargoes in quarter 2 and quarter 3. We 
conduct regular strategy revisit exercises to 
ensure risk mitigation. 

We have also been proactive about managing 
our capital structure and making the necessary 
changes to enable us to thrive within the varied 
economic conditions. We adjust dividend payments 
to shareholders, return capital to shares, share 
buybacks and the issue of new shares as required. 
We are consistently providing steady long-term 
returns on the investments of our shareholders. This 
year marked the highest ever dividend payment by 
GAIL in terms of the total dividend amount. 

7.2  Economic Performance of GAIL 
During FY 2021-22, we have registered a gross 
turnover of INR 91,426 crore as against INR 56,529 
in FY 2020-21. PBT has increased by 113% from INR 
6,386 crore (FY 2020-21) to INR 13,590 crore (FY 
2021-22) mainly because of higher Gas marketing 
spread.  PAT has shown an increase of 112% from 
INR 4,890 crore (FY 2020-21) to INR 10,364 crore 
(FY 2021-22). As on 31st March 2022, the market 
capitalization of the company is INR 69,137 crore 
reflecting strong investor confidence in the 
company. Neither was any political contribution 
made by GAIL nor any financial assistance 
received from the Government in FY 2021-22  
except capital grant received of INR 589.55 crore 
for JHBDPL Project during the year.

GAIL declared an interim dividend of INR 4 
per share to its shareholders in the month of 
December 2021 and INR 5 per share in March 
2022. Further, GAIL Board recommended final 
Dividend of INR 1 per share subject to approval of 
shareholders in Annual General Meeting, taking 
the total of 1st, 2nd interim & Final dividend (if 
approved), to INR 10 per equity share.

RFCL achieved a major milestone of achieving 
100% plant load of Ammonia and Urea on  
26th April, 2022. This achievement is a significant 
step toward Atma Nirbhar Bharat. Throughout 
the year, 389 MT of urea and 256 MT of ammonia 
were produced.

Power sector: GAIL has consistently focused on 
growing our presence in gas-based power, across 
the country. We currently supply around 60% of 
Lthe country’s gas consumed by gas-power plants. 
One avenue for growth, over the last few years, 
has been partnering with power producers to 
operationalize their stranded units. Additionally, 

we have been exploring opportunities to ensure 
the supply of natural gas to gas-based power 
generation units at affordable prices. This year, 
GAIL supplied approximately 4.17 MMSCMD of 
RLNG to power plants, in addition to allocated 
domestic gas. 

Developing the country’s natural gas pipeline 
infrastructure by laying new natural gas pipelines 
and expanding the current pipelines operated by 
GAIL is a focus area for us. For the upcoming new 
sources, GAIL is also providing tie-in connections 
with natural gas pipelines to enable new gas 
injections into pipelines. Additionally, GAIL 
provides Interconnections (ICs) with the natural 
gas pipelines of other pipeline entities across 
India. 

Furthermore, GAIL focuses on enabling Last 
Mile Connectivity (LMC) to multiple industrial 
consumers, giving access to natural gas and 
aiding a shift from other alternate fuels. Another 
solution GAIL provides is Hooking-up connectivity 
from the trunk natural gas pipeline to the CGD 
networks which has been done for more than 
100 CGD networks across India. 8 new Last Mile 
Connectivity and 29 Hook-ups were completed 
to supply and transport gas during the reporting. 

GAIL is the only gas pipeline company in India, 
successfully operating an online pipeline 
open-access portal. The portal allows for easier 
and transparent booking of Common Carrier  
Capacity in our natural gas pipeline. During 
FY 2021-22, over 5,000 Capacity Tranche (CT) 
requests were processed through the portal and 
over 11,000 CT requisitions have been processed 
since the launch of the portal in 2018. Finally, to 
facilitate smooth transportation of gas traded in 
the newly established Gas Exchange, GAIL has 
firmed up a modality with the Gas Exchange.

 y Asset Integrity Management System 

 y  Quality Management System 

 y Environment Management System 

 y Energy Management System 

8.3.1 Asset Integrity Management System

Our assets are important pillars of our business.  
To strengthen and to optimize asset integrity, 
GAIL has invested in establishing Asset Integrity 
Management System Plan. We undertake regular 
tracking and updating of records of assets for 
better utilization, reducing risk, ensuring efficient 
operations, allowing implementation of a risk 
plan, managing inventory and enhancing safety. 
We also take various initiatives and programs 
for our asset management. Key highlights of  
such programs are: 

1. GAIL believes in doing the best, so we 
ensure that all national and international 
standards (PESO, API, NFPA, PNGRB, ASME) 
are followed during design, construction, 
engineering, commissioning and operation 
and maintenance

2. Occupational Safety and health of  employees 
is our prime focus while working in the plant/
site. Our investment in developing new 
assets is always assessed through process for 
identification of hazard associated and risk 
analysis. At GAIL, our all projects approved for 
implementation  start only after the positive 
HAZOP study and Risk analysis. It not only 
reduces the risk associated but also enables 
us to take preventive measures at regular 
intervals

3. Since gas supply is our primary business, it 
is critical to eliminate any kind of leakage or 
intrusion in the gas pipeline. A Centralized 
Application Software (APPS) system with Leak 
detection system has been implemented 
for trunk gas pipeline networks. For further 
precaution Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) based 
Pipeline Leak & Intrusion Detection (PLIDS)  
are also being deployed at vulnerable 
locations for real time monitoring of detection 
in pipeline Right of User (ROU)

4. Integrity Management System is in place 
and followed for entire network of Cross 
Country Pipelines in accordance with PNGRB 
(Integrity Management System for Natural 
Gas Pipelines) Regulations 2012

5. Empanelment of Subject matter Experts 
for expert services with regard to Pipelines 
Corrosion, Cathodic Protection (CP), in line 
Inspection (ILI), Coating, metallurgy and 
welding

6. A structured set of information of all our

7. To eliminate any risk or leakage incident, an 
aerial patrolling is also being carried out. Any 
abnormality encountered during supervision 
is promptly reported and rectified.

8.3.2 Responsible Pipeline Integrity 
Management System

The integrity of pipeline begins with the design 
and construction stage. Our gas pipeline 
networks comprise predominantly of carbon 
steel pipelines of sizes ranging from 4” to 48” 
diameter and steel grades up to API 5LX 80. 
These pipelines are constructed to stringent 
quality specifications in accordance with different 
codes and standards such as PNGRB – Technical 
Standards & Specifications including Safety 
Specifications for Natural Gas Pipelines – 2009 and 
ASME B 31.8 Gas Transmission and Distribution 
Piping Systems. The pipelines are coated with 
Three Layer Polyethylene (TLPE) on the external 
surface supported by Impressed Current Cathodic 
Protection (ICCP) system to protect them from 
external corrosion and are buried.

For uninterrupted and continuous operation, the 
pipelines are operated and maintained to the best 
of industry standards. Round the clock monitoring 
is done through state-of-art communications and 
telemetry systems from regional control rooms 
at the headquarter of each network and from a 
central control room at Noida called National Gas 
Management Centre (NGMC). All GAIL pipelines 
are having Pipeline Integrity Management 
Program as per PNRGB Regulations and ASME 
B31.8S / API 1160. Integrity Management system 
comprises of 3-tier Governance mechanism with 
Central Integrity Management Group (CIMG) at 
Corporate O&M, Regional Integrity Management 
Groups (RIMG) at all Pipeline headquarters backed 
with Maintenances bases. The implementation of 
Operation & Maintenance Policy and Guidelines 
for Pipelines is strictly monitored and reviewed 
regularly. Various Pipeline Integrity web 
applications and databases have been developed 
for analysis and managing the huge data related to 
pipelines. Integrity assessment through the tools 
such as In-line Inspection (ILI), Direct Assessment 

(DA) and Hydrotest is carried out as per defined 
frequencies or at more intervals as required and 
timely mitigation actions are taken accordingly. 
External Corrosion management by Cathodic 
protection system monitoring and maintenance, 
Internal Corrosion management by cleaning and 
pigging. Quality monitoring of gas source is done 
along with coupons and probe monitoring.

Initiatives of Pipeline Integrity Management 
System: 

 y GAIL has also initiated a concept of virtual 
pipelines in CGD which was approved 
by MoPNG to allocate domestic gas to 
geographical areas (GAs). This mode enables 
the transportation of CNG and PNG to CGD 
entities through cascades in a compressed 
form, or through LNG tankers in a liquid form

 y GAIL O&M and HSE Executives participated 
in various Sub-Committee meetings of 
PNGRB Regulations on Emergency Response 
and Disaster Management Plan, Retail 
Outlet Dispensing, Integrity Management 
System for Natural Gas Pipelines & City Gas 
Distribution Networks, Gas Processing Plants

ENERGY 
MANAGEMENT 

PROCESS AT GAIL

To ensure highest level of energy conservation 
and efficiency, all our major installations are ISO 
50001 certified for Energy Management System. 
As a responsible organization, we are committed 
to Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), set 
by the Government of India to address climate 
change and taking possible measures to reduce 
its environmental footprint. 

Following are key energy saving initiatives that have 
been implemented at our plants in FY 2021-22:

 y Flare Gas Recovery Unit (FGRU) of C2-C3 was 
installed at GAIL Vijaipur by utilising it to 
connect with LPG flare header. This would 
save approximately 0.2 MMSCM flare gas per 

month. Recovered fuel gas will use as fuel gas 
in Utility boiler and HRSGs

 y Installation of 2 Nos of HRSG (Heat Recovery 
Steam Generator) for DVPL (Dahej Viajipur 
Pipeline) Compressors. The capacity of 
HRSG unit is 17.5 TPH HP steam which will 
approximately save 12 MMSCM fuel gas 
annually as per estimation

 y Rich-Lean Gas Corridor Project for integrated 
HVJ pipeline network with a project cost of 
INR 60 crores was commissioned in July 2021. 
This has enabled GAIL to efficiently utilise 
the installed compressor in the HVJ pipeline

HPMV/HPSV lamps & other lighting systems 
with energy efficient LED fittings & lighting 
systems like High mast, Main gate, watch 
towers, etc. at plant areas & township carried 
out at different GAIL Installations

 y Replacement of old and energy inefficient AC 
systems with energy efficient star rated AC 
systems.

Hazira plant

 y Energy Savings project was taken up. All the 
old HPSV/HPMV lights were replaced with 
LEDS at High mast, Main gate, watch towers, 
etc. The project cost was about INR 13.12 lakhs. 
The projected annual savings is supposed to 
be worth INR 12.59 lakhs 

 y  Reduction in Power consumption after 
installation of new Battery Chargers: The 
project was commissioned in May 2021, 
the aim was to discard the old batteries and 
install more energy efficient batteries. In 
compressor suction line at Hazira Compressor 
station, an installation of isolation valve to 
facilitate RLNG Intake from HLPL Hazira into 
HVJ compressors discharge has resulted in in 
fuel gas saving on account of no additional 
compression required for RLNG for mixing in 
HVJ pipeline network.

World’s First Floating CNG Station In Varanasi

In a far-reaching move to make the holy river Ganga pollution free, Hon’ble Prime Minister  
Shri Narendra Modi today dedicated to the 
Nation 500 boats converted to run on 
environment-friendly Compressed Natural Gas 
(CNG) from petrol and diesel.

These boats are being supplied CNG from 
India’s first floating CNG station built by GAIL 
(India) Limited at Namo Ghat here.

The conversion of the boats running on petrol/diesel to run on CNG also was carried out under 
GAIL’s Corporate Social Responsibility initiative in association with Varanasi Nagar Nigam (VNN). 
VNN appointed Varanasi Smart City as coordinator of the project while Mecon Limited is providing 
engineering and consultancy services for conversion of the boats to run on CNG.

Many of the boats present across the various ghats of river Ganga are used by tourists when they 
visit the holy city Varanasi. However, leakage and exhaust from conventional fuels is a major concern 
which affects the water quality and marine life of the river Ganga.

Conversion to CNG will not only reduce pollution but the resultant savings on fuel will lead to better 
economic condition of boatmen.

While 500 boats have been converted to CNG so far, work is going on at a fast pace to convert the 
other boats to the clean fuel too.

company’s sustainability ambitions as well as risk 
and performance management. Our Sustainability 
Policy https://gailonline.com/pdf/Sustainability/
Sustainability%20Policy10-02-2020.pdf is an 
overarching document that signifies our initiatives 
towards economic, social and environment aspects 
co-creating harmony between development 
and ecosystem. Site-specific SOPs and other 
operational memos ensured that all of our work is 
aligned in such a way that our processes have the 
least impact on the environment.

9.2  Biodiversity Management
GAIL is committed to maintaining, enhancing 
and conserving biodiversity/ecosystems for its 
own operational activities and supply chain in 
accordance with regulatory standards. GAIL 
recognises the significance of biodiversity 
management in maintaining the area’s ecological 
balance. GAIL is dedicated to abstaining from 
operational activities near IUCN Category I-IV 
protected areas and World Heritage sites as well 
as following the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, 
minimise, restore and offset).

GAIL takes proactive measures to protect local 
biodiversity and ensure that its operations have 
no negative impact on the local environment 
in the areas where it operates. GAIL  conducts 
environmental impact evaluations prior to the 
construction of new plants. We have a well-defined 
Environment Management Plan (EMP) that lays 
out the principles and processes for implementing 
various green-belt and biodiversity management 
programmes at GAIL locations. The development 
of green-belt areas exemplifies GAIL’s efforts to 
preserve biodiversity and maintain ecological 
balance in the regions in which it operates. A 
diverse range of native plants and fauna can be 
found in these greenbelt areas. There are also large 
water reservoirs within these green-belt zones, 
which are home to a variety of aquatic animals. A 
scientific approach to the care and preservation of 
these green-belt regions is used in collaboration 
with local administration. We conduct regular 
surveys and studies on the environment and 
ecology of the area in and around GAIL units to 

ensure problem prevention and timely resolution. 
This system has made a significant contribution 
to SDG 14 and 15 and has a positive impact on 
the life of living creatures under water and on 
land. It also aids in the identification of necessary 
mitigation and preventive measures. As a part of 
our efforts to safeguarding biodiversity, we have 
ensured that there are no protected habitats 
within 10 km of any operating site of GAIL. The 
pipelines that are laid in the green cover areas 
have a lifespan of 25-30 years. A bare minimum 
area is used for this purpose. Once the pipeline is 
laid, necessary actions are taken to restore/reclaim 
the forest area and it is generally untouched 
until the requirement of maintenance arises. To 
limit the negative impact of the pipelines on the 
environment, we utilize less than one-third of the 
RoU for the pipelines passing through the forest 
area.

GAIL does not have any offices around 
ecologically sensitive areas (such as national 
parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, 
wetlands, biodiversity hotspots, forests, coastal 
regulation zones etc.)

Our largest plant, Pata is focused on creating, 
maintaining and ensuring a safe and clean 
environment. GAIL’s Pata plant is a major contributor 
to Sustainable Development and various Green 
Initiatives and the company strives to be seen as 
an environmentally responsible business entity. 
The documentary ‘SANJEEVANI - A Sustainable 
Journey’ discusses the sustainability initiatives 
and benchmarks attained. This documentary is 
designed by in house team which was released 
on 1st January  2022. It reflects the dedication and 
contribution of GAIL’s Pata employees and their 
families. GAIL has also contributed to emission 
reduction through COMPA (Compensatory 
Afforestation), which is done during laying of 
pipelines through Forest land.

9.4 Emission Management
We understand our role in achieving a low-
carbon economy by controlling emissions 
arising from our operations as a responsible 
corporate striving to augment the Government 
of India’s capacity to meet their commitments 
in the Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs) and commitments to the Paris Accords. 
Air emissions and greenhouse gas emissions are 
the most significant emission sources in the gas 
transmission, liquid hydrocarbon, Natural Gas 
processing and polymer manufacture industries.

We monitor and regulate emissions in 
accordance with the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse 
Gas Reporting Standards, ISO 14064-2006 
and the American Petroleum Institute (API), a 
compendium of GHG emissions methodology for 
the oil and natural gas industry –20098. To further 
strengthen emission control, we undertake 
various initiatives to reduce and monitor GHG 
Emissions. Our emission management initiatives 
are categorized into core areas.

9.4.1 Reducing Methane Emissions

Methane, one of the primary constituents of  
natural gas, has a higher global warming potential 
and a lower emission rate during combustion. 
Some gas escapes into the atmosphere during 
natural gas transmission, particularly between 
pumping and storage operations and between 
the storage station and the end-user, reducing 

GRI 302-1, GRI 302-2, GRI 302-4, GRI 302-5



92

Synergy for Green Energy

the amount sold to the market by operators. 
It is prudent for a Natural Gas marketing and 
distribution company like GAIL to manage 
emission rates due to the environmental and 
economic impact. We are constantly working 
to reduce leakage during transmission with the 
help of our industry peers to develop effective 
strategies for detecting and reducing potential 
leaks. Reducing production related GHG 
Emissions.

Combustion of Natural Gas, diesel and LPG 
constitutes the primary source of emission. 
Natural Gas and LPG are also vent out in miniscule 
quantities in some processes causing methane 
emissions. Electricity purchased for operational 
purposes including manufacturing and 
transmission contributes to indirect emissions. 
Initiative of reduction of GHG emission.

Our initiative of GHG reduction has reduced 
Reduction of 156 Kg of GHG emission by replacing 
52 nos. of HT SF6 circuit breakers with vacuum 
circuit breakers.

We follow certain practices to reduce the 
production related GHG emissions such as:

 y Monitoring and tracking our energy 
consumption

 y Setting internal targets to reduce the 
consumption

 y  Energy generation through renewable 
sources i.e., Solar, wind etc.

9.4.2 Reducing Other Air Emissions

At GAIL, we manage emissions using a cloud-based 
monitoring system that is linked to our emission 
analysers. The Central Pollution Control Board 
(CPCB) and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) 
websites are then linked for proper monitoring. 
Several initiatives for emission management have 
been taken across all our locations throughout 
the year to reduce the air emissions.

Ozone depleting substances (ODS), which are 
banned by our internal policies, are a prevalent 
component in household electronics like 
refrigerators and air conditioners. They are

9.5 Responsible Water Management
Being one of the most precious resources on  
the earth, we at GAIL believe that it is our 
responsibility and duty to save water and to 
bring awareness among our people for effective 
utilisation of water. According to the current 
trend of industrialisation and the expansion of 
manufacturing facilities, it is clear that future 
water demand will be increasing and future 
water availability will be critical. Water scarcity 
is a pressing issue for the world’s rapid growth.  
GAIL believes that ‘water is the lifeblood of 
our society.’ As a result, in order to preserve 
water and maximise consumption, we are 
constantly researching and developing the best 
available technologies and systems that have 
a quantifiable impact on water conservation 
through innovation.  At GAIL, we have conducted 
assessment of water-stress sites to evaluate 
the risk and opportunity of our operations. Our 
assessment also helps is visualisation of future 
demand. There were no negative impacts found 
on water bodies.

Our water trends in FY 2021-22, we withdraw 22.19 
million m3 of water out of which, 91.14 % of water 
is sourced from surface water (having TDS < 1000 
mg/l), 7.61 % from municipal and only 1.3 % of water 
from ground water. Water consumption at water 
stress area is around 6 % of total water consumption.

As a responsible company, we make every 
effort to ensure that our operations have no 
negative impact on the supply or quality of 
water resources across our sites. As a result, 
we have taken proactive steps to identify, 
evaluate and mitigate any future water-related 
risks, thereby increasing the resiliency of our 
operational activities. As part of our proactive 
approach, we conduct periodic internal/external 
audits to determine the root cause of excessive 
water demand.. We always encourage and 
support innovative and smart approaches to 
water conservation at our sites through various 
water management initiatives such as reduced 
freshwater consumption, rainwater harvesting/
collection system, monitoring and management 
of waste-water discharge, wastewater treatment 
and recycling based on our Environmental Policy, 
national, local and regional guidelines.

GAIL sincerely follows and complies with all 
applicable environmental rules and regulations, 
which improves our operational capabilities and 
demonstrates our commitment to environmental 
conservation. Furthermore, the discharge of water 
at manufacturing sites is monitored continuously 
on real time basis through Online Continuous 
Emission Monitoring System (OCEMS) and also all 
the details of effluent discharged with respective 
parameters are being recorded in the server 
of OCEMS to validate compliance with Central 
Pollution Control Board (CPCB)/ State Pollution 
Control Board (SPCB) effluent limit. Wastewater 
generated from processes is treated, through 
Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP). The treatment 
system comprises of pH stabilization, removing 
suspended solids and reducing Biological Oxygen 
Demand (BOD), such that no water bodies 
were affected by the discharge. The majority of 
GAIL’s operations and maintenance facilities are 
zero liquid discharge. The discharge of water 
at manufacturing sites is monitored to ensure 
compliance with the Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB)/State Pollution Control Board 
(SPCB) effluent limit. Effluent treatment plants

(ETP) treat wastewater from processes, which 
includes adjusting pH, removing suspended 
solids and reducing Biological Oxygen Demand 
(BOD), if any. The discharge of treated wastewater 
had no effect on any water bodies. GAIL Mumbai 
is a zero discharge building utilizing 2000 Lit/day 
of treated water for HVAC and horticulture use. In 
FY 2021-22, total wastewater discharge was 1.64 
million m3. GAIL Vijaipur has ZLD facility where 
all the wastewater is used in horticulture. In  
FY 2021-22, 5,51,353 m3 of waste water after 
getting treated through effluent treatment plant 
was used for horticulture purpose.

As GAIL Pata being our largest manufacturing 
facility alone contributes over 95% in total water 
discharge, the water is treated (having TDS <1000 
mg/l) with high Performance Effluent Treatment 
plant and is discharged into Sengar river with 
compliance to all discharge permissible limit 
and permissions. Before discharging wastewater 
outside our premises, we conduct a detailed 
analysis of key parameters and respective 
regulatory agencies (SPCB/CPCB) monitor treated 
wastewater quality at the plant outlet and in the 
final water body. 

9.5.1 GAIL’s approach to reduce water 
footprint / Water Management Initiatives at 
GAIL sites

Initiatives in GAIL Pata

 y Recovery of CBD/IBD water of UB I & UB II 
in Power Plant-II: An in-house modification 
was performed to connect the individual 
boiler blow down (CBD & IBD) to the cooling 
water return header, along with an NRV & 
an I/V for diverting the blowdown to CT. 
The modification implemented is beneficial 
in terms of resource conservation and 
optimization because good quality water will 
be reused as cooling water. This project aims 
to conserve natural resources while reducing 
the effluent load on waste-water treatment 
plants and  saved consumption of 300 m3/day 
of fresh water. 

 y Recovery of steam condensate from flaker 
unit through condensate header: Currently, 
the steam condensate from the melter drum 
and the low polymer transfer pump’s jacketed 
suction/discharge lines has been completely 
drained, resulting in a total loss of steam 
condensate. The goal of this QC project is to 
recover steam condensate from the flaker 
unit by transferring condensate via the 
condensate header to the steam condensate 
drum. The connection to the condensate 
header was completed in 2021, resulting in a 
condensate savings of 617 tons/month.

9.6 Responsible Waste Management
At GAIL, we aspire to implement the concept 
of circular economy by enabling access to 
innovative resource efficient technology. With 
enhanced focus towards reduction in waste 
generation from our facilities and exploring ways 
to recycle/reuse to the extent possible in our 
operations. Given the nature of our business, the 
waste generated from our operation can be both 
hazardous and non-hazardous.

In our waste management process, we aim to 
minimize both hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste. Additionally, we follow 3-R strategy of 
Reducing, Reusing, Recycling at GAIL sites, 
accelerating progress towards our waste 
reduction goal. We conduct waste audits through 
internal and external agencies to explore more 
ideas for waste reduction at the source or 
through small changes in operation. This also aids 
in mapping our waste management compliances 
as per regulations. We are pleased to report that 
no waste-related impact on business operations 
or products was discovered during waste audits.

As an active participant in preserving pollution 
and creating positive image in society and bring 
awareness among our workforce and our other 
value chain partners GAIL is supporting the 
initiatives on Plastic Waste Management through 
ICPE where the policy makers, bureaucrats, 
representatives from Industry, NGO etc. address

also reduced. This initiative have also resulted 
in reduction in smell/odour in the surrounding 
areas. Through this mechanism in FY 2021-22, 
2776.82 MT slop oil recovered.

9.6.2 Hazardous Waste Management
 We take our commitment to hazardous waste 
management very seriously and we have a 
zero tolerance policy for non-compliance with 
hazardous waste management. As a hazardous 
waste with toxic, flammable, corrosive and other 
properties, it has a high potential to harm human 
health and the environment. The generation 
of hazardous waste varies depending on our 
operational activities and location. For example,

at the GAIL Pata site, hazardous waste includes 
tar, oily WWTP sludge, slop oil, molecular sieves, 
used oil, waste mineral oil, spent carbon, ashes 
and so on, whereas at the Vijaipur site, hazardous 
waste includes asbestos, glass wool, ceramic, 
empty barrels/containers/liners contaminated 
with hazardous chemicals/waste, used or spent 
oil, waste or residues containing oil and so on. The 
majority of the sites produce waste oil. We ensure 
best compliance and safety during transportation 
of hazardous waste, which is a very critical and 
sensitive process. All of our hazardous waste is 
sent to authorised State Pollution Control Board 
(SPCB)/Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 
Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) 
or recyclers. We also follow the guidelines of the 
Manifest (Form-10) and Transport Emergency 
Card (TERM) while transporting hazardous waste 
and there was no significant spill in the reporting 
year 2021-22.

Other initiatives of waste management

 y Development of waste storage shed for 
segregated storage of various hazardous 
and non-hazardous wastes is operational for 
sustainable management of wastes at the 
premises.

 y  Developed SOP for transfer of waste to 
the storage shed has been circulated to 
concerned departments.

 y Conducting knowledge sharing session on

unit and producing a sellable product of high 
quality. Extruder Machine waste (poly lumps), 
Plant sweep and ground sweep, Polymer powder/
fines generated are also sold off to customers. 
And it reduces landfill waste generation.   

9.7 Research and Development 
Initiatives
Good growth momentum coupled with rapid 
urbanisation and growing population drives 
India’s energy demand. Consequently, the 
demand for oil and gas is expected to increase 

manifold. In this aspect, Natural gas as a fuel 
source is much “greener” than alternative fossil 
fuels and as a transition fuel can address climate 
change through decarbonisation without 
compromising economic growth.  The share 
of Natural gas in energy basket is consistently 
increasing and is widely used as fuel and feedstock 
for power, fertilizer and petrochemical industries 
GAIL, as a pioneer of the Natural Gas economy 
in India, emphasis on sustainable development 
and promote investments in research and 
development (R&D) activities in natural gas and 
allied sector. 

Our collaborative R&D works are carried out in 
association with various academic Institutes, 
Center of Excellences (CoE) and CSIR Laboratories. 
Through these collaborations our major focus  
is on emerging technologies such as green 
hydrogen, battery technology, CO2 utilization and 
Waste Valorizations, pipeline integrity management 
and development of new catalysts etc.

Further to complement our collaborative  
research efforts, new innovation and 
development projects are implemented at 
various GAIL sites which lead to improvements  
in process/efficiency/safety and / or cost 
reductions, system optimization etc. of existing 
processes and systems through technology 
renewal and modernization works.

We always aspire to deliver best of our capabilities 
and support India in building Aatma-Nirbhar-
Bharat. In 2021-22, our focused R&D initiatives 
continued emphasis on the identified above 
major thrust areas. 

In this direction under the Green Hydrogen 
initiative, we are developing a low-cost electro 
catalysts and self-supported electrode for large 
scale electrochemical hydrogen in association 
with Indian Institute of Science Education and 
Research (IISER), Kolkata. Furthermore, we are 
also conducting a research project for efficient 
production of hydrogen through biomass 
gasification is pursued with Indian Institute of

Climate Change

GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 103-2

As per Climate Action Tracker, the global mean 
temperature has already risen by 1.2°C and if we 
don’t take strong measures today, we are looking 
at 2.4°C rise in global temperature as compared 
to pre-industrialization period. 

Countries around the world are already feeling the 
brunt of accelerated climate change in the form 
of increasingly frequent and severe fl ash fl oods, 
drought, heatwaves, wildfi res, precipitation and 
tropical cyclones. 

Climate change, pollution and the depletion of 
natural resources are a threat to our society. The 
rise in global temperatures in future can have a dire 
impact on business ecosystem as well. Therefore, 
as business continues to grow it becomes more 
important than ever for businesses to have a proper 
climate change strategy/ action plan to thrive.

10.1 Climate Change and 
Sustainable Development
The overall global strategy for climate change 
mitigation and reducing global GHG emissions 
are centred around an energy transition towards 
cleaner energy sources like renewables, while 
phasing out fossil fuels. 

Furthermore, during the COP 26, Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi has announced India’s target of 
becoming ‘Net-Zero’ emissions by 2070. As a part 
of his address, he also put forth the “Panchamrita” 
(a fi ve-fold strategy) to deal with the challenge 
of climate change which included the following 
targets for India:

I. Enhance non-fossil energy capacity to 500 
GW by 2030.

II. Meet 50% of its energy requirements till 2030 
with renewable energy.

III. Reduce its projected carbon emission by one 
billion tonnes by 2030.

IV. Reduce the carbon intensity of its economy 
by 45% by 2030.

V. Achieve Net-Zero by 2070.

Being a premier gas distributor agency of 
India, GAIL recognized the pivotal role it will 
play in realizing Government of India’s Net-
Zero ambitions. At present India’s energy mix

is dominated by carbon intensive fossil fuels 
i.e., coal/oil with a combined contribution of 
almost 80%. To reduce this dependence on fossil 
fuels, Natural Gas, being a cleaner and feasible 
alternative, will play an important role in India’s 
decarbonization strategy, which is evident by the 
fact that Government of India’s strategy 2030, 
that envisages the increase in share of natural gas 
from 6.7% to 15% in India’s energy mix.

GAIL is further committed and has already 
embarked on its Net-Zero journey through 
science based ambition and action plan with 
Government of India’s vision and has set a target 
to achieve Net-Zero (Scope 1 and Scope 2) status 
by 2040, while reducing our Scope 3 emission by 
35% (from baseline year of 2020-2021) by 2040.  
We have already started developing our Net Zero 
roadmap to achieve our decarbonization targets 
in line with the 1.5-degree celsius scenario of IEA. 

Our Net-Zero strategy is based on 4 strategic 
pillars including Operational Decarbonization, 
Energy transition, Carbon Capture and Utilisation 
(CCUS) and Offsetting backed by a robust 
Governance structure.

GAIL’s decarbonization initiatives will also help 
in contributing towards the India’s commitments 
for UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

SDG’s comprises of a set of targets building a 
framework for leading development for the 
period till 2030. By endorsing the universal 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development, including 
its 17 SDGs and 169 Targets, the global community 
reaffirmed its commitment to sustained and 
inclusive economic growth, social inclusion, 
environmental protection and fostering peaceful, 
just adjust, inclusive societies through a new 
global partnership. 

GAIL’s climate change actions are directly or 
indirectly contributing towards the following 
SDGs:

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and 
Production: The production of goods and 
services today not only depletes natural resources 
and causes environmental degradation including 

soil, water and air pollution but also generates 
huge amounts of GHGs, therefore contributing to 
climate change throughout their life cycle.

SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy: An immediate 
increase in renewable energy technologies and 
increased energy efficiency is an essential part of 
reaching Paris goals stated under the NDC of India. 
Cleaner fuels than the conventional high carbon 
emitting ones will serve as a transition platform to 
reach complete Net-Zero.

Climate action on energy efficiency can increase 
energy access and reduce energy expenditure 
(SDGs 1, 7), can improve health (SDG 3), can 
reduce water pollution (SDGs 11, 14) and increase 
economic productivity (SDGs 8, 9).

Reduction in burning dirty fossil fuels like oil 
and coal means cleaner air in our cities and 
homes (SDGs 11, 12). This will lead to less people 
suffering and dying from respiratory diseases, 
especially children and elderly and will enhance 
everyone’s well-being and quality of life (SDG 3).

Protecting our forests, peat lands and oceans 
means we and future generations will be able 
to enjoy nature and their ecosystem services, 
like a healthy life under water and livelihoods 
for millions of people, cities and villages that 
are protected from storm surges or sandstorms 
(SDGs 14, 15).

10.2 Vision and Action pertaining 
to climate strategy
Our management is already working to achieve 
our Net-Zero ambition. GAIL has set a significant 
goal to install 1 GW of renewable energy capacity 
in the coming years, in order to contribute 
considerably to India’s NDC and to enable GAIL 
become Net-Zero, along with further extensive 
benchmarking projects and initiatives. GAIL 
employees from all divisions share the following 
vision for combating climate change, which 
aids us in working together and strategically to 
achieve sustainability and Net-Zero:

 y To ensure that the public has more access 
to affordable, reliable and contemporary 



102

Synergy for Green Energy

energy services with a low carbon footprint 
by accelerating the cost-effective provision 
of clean energy, renewable energy and 
a Net-Zero business plan. Exploring 
potential of decentralized renewable 
energy incorporation, alternative fuels 
such as Compressed-Biogas and innovative 
technology to reduce emission by applying 
scientific rationale and testing.

 y Enable and promote cooperation and 
partnership towards the implementation 
of Goal 7 by transitioning to Net-Zero CO2 
emissions by mid-century so as to meet the 
goals of the Paris Agreement including by 
introducing carbon pricing.

 y Increase awareness, capacity and knowledge 
sharing, while also strengthening the ability 
of the supply chain of the company to take 
stronger action against climate change.

Adaptation and mitigation are two strategies 
for combating climate change. Adaptation will 
boost resilience to current or predicted climate 
changes and mitigation will reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, effectively addressing the source 
of rising world average temperatures. GAIL 
is committed to addressing climate change 
adaptation and mitigation through a variety of 
projects and actions. We have recognised the 
need to set a target for achieving GAIL Net-Zero, 
which will contribute to India’s NDCs, create 
a benchmark for fossil fuel firms and offer up 
different options for the Company to become 
resilient for tomorrow.

10.2.1 Adaptation

Climate change has a clear impact on the 
availability of critical natural resources like water. 
That is why, at GAIL, we have implemented water 
conservation and management systems across the 
Board, ensuring that water is used wisely and in a 
circular manner whenever possible. Plantations 
and the extension of green belt over numerous 
GAIL sites are intended to help replenish ground 
water levels while also functioning as a carbon sink.

Every day, the field of transition in technology, 
management and finance instruments for climate 
change adaptation evolves. At GAIL, a dedicated 
R&D team is motivated to conduct research 
in order to bring out best practices that will 
contribute to sustainability and climate change 
action.

The transition to cleaner sources of energy 
requires the proper capacity in terms of financial 
tools along with accountability being taken for 
the activities which contribute to emission. The 
strategy to deal with both these requirements has 
been believed to be achieved by carbon pricing. 
GAIL is positive to bring internal carbon pricing 
within its business activities to uncover new areas 
of climate adaptation and mitigation. GAIL has 
already started a study to find its internal price of 
carbon and the result of the project is envisioned 
to be published by 2023.

GAIL has analysed the vulnerability of several 
places to storm surges, cyclones, heavy rains and 
flooding and has recommended crucial steps for 
each department and individual before, during 
and after such disasters. Mitigation measures are 
also taken into account during the design stage 
before construction. Currently, flood prevention 
measures are being implemented at all sites 
along India’s coast. Our Emergency Response 
and Disaster Management Plan (ERDMP), PNGRB, 
Incident reporting System (IRS) and Evacuation 
Standard Operating Procedure ensure effective 
management of any disaster. 

Onsite and offsite mock drill is conducted to bring 
awareness and preparing for what actions to be 
taken during any accident.  At GAIL, a dedicated 
disaster handling team which consist of incident 
handling team and managing any disaster 
affecting the Data Centre at Sector-1, Noida. 
Our multiple systems and mechanism ensure 
business continuity like our digital initiatives, 
risk management plan, uninterrupted supply of 
goods and services related to both our core and 
non-core operations from our suppliers.  

Our climate related detailed disclosures can be 
found in CDP report.

10.2.2 Mitigation

GAIL stands at a crucial juncture being a natural gas 
company. Natural gas being the cleaner fossil fuel, 
(releases 50% less CO2 than that of coal and 20-
30% less than oil) will prove to be instrumental in 
transitioning towards zero-carbon energy systems. 

GAIL has been consistently working on 
accelerating and optimizing the effective and 
economic use of natural gas and its fractions for 
the benefit of the national economy. The Indian 
government is committed to moving toward a 
gas-based economy by raising the share of natural 
gas in India’s energy basket from the current 6.7% 
to 15% by 2030 to support the transition to a low-
emission future.

10.3 GAIL’s Envisioned Net-Zero Action Plan

GAIL is committed towards developing 
decarbonization capabilities in line with 
Government of India’s vision. To achieve the 
above targets, GAIL has already embarked on its 
Net-Zero journey through science based ambition 
and action plan with the aim of achieving “100% 
reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and a 
35% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2040”. Our 
Net-Zero Action plan is being based on the four 
pillars namely: 

1. Operational Decarbonization,  

2. Energy transition

3. Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage- (CCUS)

4. Offsetting

10.3.1 Operational Decarbonization 
Decarbonization includes the technology and 
initiatives taken or being planned by GAIL to 
reduce its direct inhouse GHG emissions by 
improving the efficiency of its operations. The 
various initiatives planned/undertaken are:  

 y  Reducing Methane Emission

 Methane is one of the potent GHG gas. 
Methane leakage, methane venting and 
routine methane flaring are usual activity in 
a gas industry and contributes significantly to 
their GHG emissions. To reduce GAIL’s methane 
emissions, we have taken various initiatives 
at our sites like installing, Flare Gas Recovery 
units (FGRU), increasing natural gas flaring 
rather than direct venting where possible. 

 We are always working to reduce leakage 
during transmission with the help of our 
industry colleagues to develop effective 
leak detection and reduction solutions. And 
have installed Lower Exclusive Limit (LEL) Gas 
detectors at various locations under Agra 
region so as to check any gas leakage at the 
stations. Moreover, 20 hand-held LEL meters 
were procured for the line patrollers so as to 
check any gas leakage in the pipeline section. 
These detectors will help mitigate direct 
release of gas, hence mitigating emission. 
Leak Detection System (LDS) has also been 
implemented for Kailaras-Malanpur Pipeline.

 y Increasing Energy efficiency

 GAIL has a dedicated Energy Management 
system, with the focus of reducing our energy 
intensity. To reduce our energy demand, we 
have undertaken various projects to increase 
our energy efficiency.

 We have taken following key energy saving 
initiatives:

 y Rich-Lean Gas Corridor Project for integrated 
HVJ pipeline network with a project cost 
of INR 60 crores commissioned in July 2021 
which has enabled GAIL to efficiently utilise 
the installed compressor in the HVJ pipeline 
network and estimated to save approximately 
0.22 MMSCMD natural gas as a fuel gas.

in DBNPL which has enabled GAIL to maintain 
optimum inventory/line pack in this pipeline 
while ensuring adequate supply pressure in 
24” Dadri-Babrala HVJ pipeline to meet the 
customer requirement. This modification has 
been beneficial for efficient pipeline operations 
and better pipeline hydraulics management.

 y Commissioning of grid power supply at Khera 
Compressor station with effect on 14th March 
2022 from GEG power to grid power which 
received from 33 KV/6.6KV power source. 

We have also undertaken various plant specific 
initiatives such as:

Vijaipur Plant
 y Flare Gas Recovery Unit (FGRU) of C2 C3 was 

installed at GAIL Vijaipur by utilising it to 
connect with LPG flare header. This would 
save approximately 0.2 MMSCM flare gas per 
month. Recovered gas will use as fuel gas in 
utility boiler and HRSGs.

 y  Installation of 2 Nos of HRSG (Heat Recovery 
Steam Generation) for DVPL (Dahej Vijaipur 
Pipeline) compressors. The capacity of 
HRSG unit is 17.5 TPH HP steam which will 
approximately save 12 MMSCM fuel gas 
annually as per estimation.

Initiatives taken in GAIL Maharashtra: Using 
less energy to perform same task

 y Replacement of conventional lighting with 
LED for all SV/IP/Customer terminals of 
Maharashtra region

 y Total outdoor lights (HPMV and HPSV) 
replaced at 75 stations

 y Total 550 numbers of lights replaced with 
high efficiency low wattage consumption 
and better illumination LED lights

 y Estimated Annual saving is expected to be 
around INR 40 Lakh per annum

Hazira Plant

 y Energy Savings project was taken up. All the 
old HPSV/HPMV lights were replaced with 

LEDS at high mast, main gate, watch towers, 
etc. The project cost was about INR 13.12 lakh. 
The projected annual savings is supposed to 
be worth INR 12.59 lakhs. 

 y Reduction in Power consumption after 
installation of new battery chargers: The 
project was commissioned in May 2021, 
the aim was to discard the old batteries and 
install more energy efficient batteries.

 y In compressor suction line at Hazira 
Compressor station, a installation of isolation 
valve to facilitate RLNG Intake from HLPL 
Hazira into HVJ compressors discharge has 
resulted in fuel gas saving on account of no 
additional compression required for RLNG for 
mixing in HVJ pipeline network.

 y Renewable Energy

 GAIL intends to set up solar PV projects 
in order to reduce carbon footprints and 
contribute to clean energy mechanism at 
National level. In line with above, GAIL is 
exploring various opportunities in solar 
with an objective to have a sizeable solar 
portfolio. For organic growth in solar sector, 
GAIL is participating through bidding in the 
forthcoming solar tenders floated by various 
government agencies like SECI, NTPC, etc. for 
developing green field projects, mainly solar 
projects as Independent Power Producer 
(IPP). GAIL shall participate in solar tenders 
with the minimum capacity of 100 MW and 
continue to participate till the cumulative 
awarded capacity reaches 500 MW.

 GAIL is committed to reduce its carbon 
footprint through implementation of 
renewable projects and it has a total installed 
capacity of 131.75 MW of alternative energy.  
We have also set a target to add 1 gigawatt 
of renewable energy through solar and wind 
both together and any other renewable* 
by 2025. Towards that, we are doing both 
inorganic and organic efforts to achieve the 
same. We have chalked out INR 6000 crores 
to achieve our target of 1 GW of renewable 
energy.

 (* Includes all clean energy projects like solar, 
wind, CBG, green hydrogen etc)

10.3.2 Energy Transition

Energy transition includes the technology switch 
and initiatives taken to replace the existing source 
of energy. While at present gas is considered as a 
cleaner transition fuel, however, in the context of 
Net Zero, GAIL believes that it is important that 
alternate green fuel sources are also explored.

 y Compressed Biogas (CBG):

 GAIL and its CGD JVs, as well as GAIL Gas 
Limited and its JVs, have invited expressions 
of interest and issued letters of intent for 
the GoI’s Sustainable Alternative Towards 
Affordable Transportation (SATAT) Initiative 
to provide a sustainable alternative to 
affordable transportation as a developmental 
effort that would benefit everyone. GAIL is 
a partner in the Ministry of Petroleum and 
Natural Gas’ SATAT (Sustainable Alternative 
Towards Affordable Transportation) initiative, 
which promotes compressed biogas (CBG) 
as an alternative, green transportation 
fuel. Agriculture residue, bovine manure, 
sugarcane press mud, municipal solid 
waste, sewage treatment plant waste and 
other waste/biomass sources produce 
biogas spontaneously through anaerobic 
decomposition. It is compressed after 
purification and labelled CBG, which contains 
over 95% pure methane.

 In terms of composition and energy 
potential, compressed biogas is identical 
to commercially available natural gas. 
Compressed Biogas, which has  qualities 
similar to CNG, can be utilised as an alternative, 
renewable automotive fuel. Compressed 
Biogas has the potential to replace CNG 
in automotive, industrial and commercial 
applications in the coming years, thanks to 
the abundance of biomass in the country. 
India’s potential for producing compressed 
biogas from diverse sources is estimated to 
be around 62 million tonnes per year.

 Understanding the advantages of CBG, 
the Government of India announced the 

Sustainable Alternatives to Affordable 
Transportation (SATAT) scheme, an initiative 
aimed at establishing compressed bio-gas 
production plants and making it available 
in the market for use in automobile fuels by 
inviting Expressions of Interest. Under this 
scheme, GAIL is also in process of setting up 
400 CBG plants by 2025, out of which 237 LOIs 
for production of compressed biogas have 
been issued, with a capacity of 1184 TPD.  

 GAIL has taken also the decision of venturing 
into CBG business by setting up CBG 
production plants. GAIL is setting up its 
first CBG plant of 5 TPD CBG production 
capacity in Ranchi and has signed concession 
agreement for 22 years with Ranchi Municipal 
Corporation for supply of Municipal Solid 
Waste (MSW) and associated infrastructure 
for setting up CBG plant at Ranchi. This will 
enable provision and supply of Compressed 
Biogas (CBG) from the plants processing 
biomass/waste to various Retail Outlets of 
CGD companies across India.

 Potential positive benefits of CBG

yy Stubble/Agro-residues can be utilized for 
CBG which can reduce stubble burning 
hence air pollution

yy Additional revenue source for farmers

yy Boost to entrepreneurship, rural economy 
and employment

yy  Responsible waste management, 
reducing waste related emissions

yy Replacing fossil fuel in vehicles, reducing 
direct GHG emissions

yy Reduction in import of natural gas and 
crude oil

yy Support to national commitments in 
achieving climate change goals

 y Ethanol Blended Petrol

 The Government of India (GoI) has committed 
to supply Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) in 
order to reduce oil imports, with a goal of 
10% blending by 2022 and 20% by 2025. 

GRI 302-4, GRI 302-5

Synergy for Green Energy

In keeping with the Government of India’s  
goal, GAIL is exploring the possibility of 
establishing a 500 KLPD 1G (first generation) 
grain-based ethanol plant for the Ethanol 
Blended Petrol (EBP) programme. Carbon 
monoxide emissions are projected to be 
reduced by 30-50 percent when this E20 
(Ethanol 20%, Petrol 80%) fuel is used.

 y Green Hydrogen

 In India, usage of Hydrogen as an alternative 
fuel is a relatively new area for which 
companies from various domains are 
evaluating the business potential. GAIL is also 
exploring the possibilities to blending green 
Hydrogen with natural gas in pipelines at 
pilot scale, which is a path breaking step in 
CGD sector. In future, Hydrogen can provide a 
supplementary role to fossils, renewables and 
batteries, in a transition towards Net-Zero 
economy. 

 In line with the National Hydrogen Mission, 
as a pilot  project, GAIL has started green 
hydrogen blending in City  Gas Distribution 
(CGD) network of Avantika Gas limited,  
Indore after due approval from PESO to blend 
up to 2%  Hydrogen in Natural Gas. The green 
hydrogen blending  has operated successfully 
without any observation with  2% blending 
at present. Further, permission has been  
applied by GAIL from PESO for 5% Hydrogen 
blending. Impact Study on CGD /NG pipeline 
network due to various  levels of Hydrogen 
blending in NG is also being carried out  
through consultant. GAIL is also in process 
of setting up 10 MW green hydrogen plant 
(largest in India) in Guna, Madhya Pradesh.

10.3.3 Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage 
(CCUS)

Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) 
technology encompasses methods and 
technologies to remove CO2 from reaching 
the atmosphere. The CO2 is captured from 
significant emission sources and either storing it 
permanently or utilizing it.

GAIL is currently undertaking various initiatives 
while exploring possibilities of investing heavily 
into the projects for utilizing and storing carbon. 
At present GAIL has undertaken 4 major R&D/  
pilot projects in collaboration with reputed 
institutes for developing feasible CCUS 
technology. These projects include

 y CO2 to Methanol & DME (Dimethyl ether)- in 
collaboration with IIT-Delhi

 y CO2 to Polycarbonate Diol- in collaboration 
with IISER- Tirupati

 y CO2 to Syngas- in collaboration with IIP 
Dehradun

In addition to above technologies, GAIL has also 
implemented a pilot project for fixing CO2 (1TPD) 
using microalgae in an Open Raceway Ponds at 
Pata petrochemical complex in association with 
Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research 
(CIMFER), Dhanbad. Trial runs for which have 
been initiated with suitable microalgae strains in 
the open ponds and currently its growth level is 
being monitored.  

10.3.4 Offsetting

Offsetting includes the technology and initiatives 
that are designed to reduce/remove the carbon 
emitted from the air to compensate for the 
emissions. While GAIL is prioritizing achieving 
decarbonization targets as much as possible 
by following the mitigation hierarchy through 
reducing its emissions, we understand that it is 
not possible to achieve Net-Zero based on just 
avoidance and reduction of GHG emissions.

GAIL is looking to invest/implement various 
Nature Based Solution for offsetting its emission 
as the last resort to achieve its Net-Zero targets.

Nature Based Offseting: GAIL has planted total 
85,542 plants in FY 2021-22 out of which 75,800 
trees were planted at their PATA plant. GAIL is in 
process of further augmenting this number, with 
the target of planting 1,50,000 more trees using 
“Miyawaki Forestry” technique in FY 2022-23.

11.1 Initiatives for Employee Well-being

GAIL is in a constant journey to better itself 
as an employer. Our endeavour is to create a 
positive, nurturing and learning environment. 
The implementation of several progressive 
HR initiatives is reflection of how employee 
well-being is prioritized. There is a constant 
evaluation of HR policies to align the Corporate 
HR Strategy with the Organizational Strategy 
to meet changing business requirements and 
preserve a competitive advantage. GAIL’s policy 
covers Human Resource Acquisition (General 
Terms and Conditions of Service, Recruitment 
Policy and Procedure and so on), Employee 
Compensation (Pay Scales, DA, Transfer Benefits 
and so on), Employee Benefits (Leave Rules, 
Medical Attendance, House Building Advance 
Rules and so on), Motivation and Development 
(Performance Management System, Incentive for 
obtaining Higher Education and so on), General 
(Grievance Redressal Procedure, CDA Rules) and 
Others.

From GAIL’s viewpoint and assessing the present 
offerings, we can undoubtedly lay claim to 
the fact that financial health of the employees 
has been our priority and well taken care of 
through a well-structured compensation. GAIL’s 

approach to employee’s financial health has 
been holistic with helping employees save for 
retirement, providing 100% medical cover to self 
and dependants, providing medical assistance 
to retired employees. Similarly, community/
social health has been ingrained as a value in the 
company which started off with a small number 
of employees and grew together into 4700+ GAIL 
family today. Our townships, cultural and festive 
celebrations with employees and their families 
celebrating each other’s achievements are all 
symbols of tightly knitted communities that exist 
in GAIL. 

Such social bonds create a strong sense of 
employee citizenship. Aside from that, employees 
come together to participate in competitions 
during vigilance awareness week, Hindi fortnight 
celebration, World Environment Day celebration, 
Fire Week etc..

In light of the current pandemic, we recognised 
575 Covid fighters across GAIL and honoured 
them with an appreciation certificate from the 
CMD/Functional Directors for their dedication.

The SPARSH initiative
During the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 
pandemic, a one-of-a-kind project called SPARSH 
was designed with the aim of delivering a 
healing touch to COVID affected personnel and 
their families. The SPARSH team provided daily 
assistance and worked with the Covid task force 
to supply medical supplies such as medicine, beds, 
oxygen concentrators etc.  to employees as quickly 
as possible.

11.2  Talent Acquisition and Development

A talented, motivated and innovative workforce 
is what GAIL aspires for in its journey to make the 
nation future ready for all its energy needs. As it 
diversifies into clean and green energy portfolio, 
the responsibility is immense. Our recruitment 
strategy is continuously aligned to the business 
requirement and focuses on recruiting people 
who will be in the alignment with our overall 
values and vision. 



110

Synergy for Green Energy

As a part of HR recruitment strategy, we use a 
structured and objective assessment approach to 
find the best available talent. On a regular  basis, 
as part of our manpower planning, we analyse 
and determine the need for fresh entrants and 
their changing skill sets requirement to align 
with the requirements of different locations and 
functions. 

Through our  training interventions, we emphasize 
heavily on creating an atmosphere that allows 
our employees to reach their full potential and 
advance in their careers. GAIL’s recruiting team 
plays a key strategic role in creating a future ready 
workforce which will act as a key differentiator 
for GAIL in the face of growing competition and 
uncertainty.  

We want to create a group of employees who 
are development-oriented, productive and 
enthusiastic to grow with us. 

11.3 Diverse and Inclusive Workforce

Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) has been on 
GAIL’s priority for the past few years. The 
implementation of D&I initiatives across locations 
have gained momentum across all of its sites last 
year. A diverse workforce is critical to achieving 
greater results. We strive for diversity through 
recruiting people from various backgrounds, 
genders and communities. Our transparent and 
sound recruitment processes enable us to hire 
people from a variety of backgrounds, ensuring 
that everyone, regardless of gender, caste, or 
physical ability, has equal possibilities. During our 
recruitment process, we adhere to the principles 
of diversity and inclusion and all candidates 
are objectively evaluated. We spend time and 
effort scouting talent from local areas in order to 
create a more multi-cultural and inclusive staff. 
Candidates from diverse Indian states are given 
equal consideration.

GAIL Board’s approved recruitment policy is 
modified on a regular basis to keep it updated in 
terms of diversity and inclusion. 

A total of 12,694 male and 380 female contractual 
workers work across various operational sites 
as part of our staff. Across our units, our total 
permanent workforce comprises of 3,621 male 
and 272 female management employees and 
824 male and 36 female non-management 
employees. There are 3,676 male and 9 female 
security personnel. This year, GAIL employed 
325 apprentices, (275 male and 50 female). 
The non-core tasks of the organisation, such as 
housekeeping, pantry, horticulture and security, 
employ a large number of temporary workers54. 

11.3.1 Employee Benefits

Performance and applicable laws or policies 
govern the benefits we give to our employees

 y All GAIL permanent employees are entitled 
to Provident Fund coverage and contract 
labour coverage under the Employees State 
Insurance Scheme, Workmen’s Compensation 
Act and other statutory benefits / payments. 

 y PF, gratuity, pension and Post PRMS - 
According to DPE guidelines, O.M. No. 
W-02/0028/2017- DPE (WC)-GL-XIII/17, a 
ceiling of 30% of the basic and DA has been 
set for contributions to these superannuation 
benefits. 

 y The majority of our policies and efforts are 
targeted at creating a productive environment 
for our employees. Female employees can 
also take a two-year compensated child 
care leave. We also reward our personnel 
for achieving better qualifications, which 
improves their competence and efficiency.

 y We have implemented IT systems for 
workforce management strategies. All 
workforce-related information is monitored 
and captured using the SAP ERP system and 
it is systematically analysed to improve our 
workforce strategies.

 y We have implemented many programmes 
providing monetary incentives that were

examined and amended during the reporting 
year, such as the revised policy published 
in respect of the Furnishing Hire/Purchase 
Scheme and PC/Peripheral Scheme, Employee 
Travel Entitlement and so on. Realizing the 
constant work demands cause mental and 
physical tiredness. Hence, the personnel who 
executed continuous on-site responsibilities 
during lockdown were granted compensatory 
offs. Employees who were on sanctioned 
leave prior to the lockdown proclaimed by 
many states/jurisdictions who were unable 
to report to their work-centre after their leave 
term expired were granted ‘Work from Home’ 
permission.

 y Salaries, wages, Contributory Provident 
Fund, gratuity, leave encashment towards 
un-availed leave, compensated absences, 
post-retirement medical benefits and other 
terminal benefits are examples of employee 
benefits. All of these advantages are  
provided to our valued workers.

 y All our permanent employees are covered 
under health insurance. GAIL offers a variety 
of employee benefits that go above and 
beyond the minimum legal standards, such  
as Children Higher Education Advance 
Scheme, GAIL Medical Attendance Rules 
and Relief Measures for dependent family 
members of deceased employees.

11.4 Employee Engagement

In last couple of years, organizations have put 
a strong focus on employee engagement and 
their experience within the workforce. Increase 
in anxiety, stress levels and higher cases of  
burnout impact focus and engagement of 
employees. Employee engagement post-
pandemic will be more people-centric, focusing 
on their individual needs rather than the 
companies. 

Employee engagement might be expressed as 
what inspires an employee to put effort into their 
job. An engaged employee focuses on learning 

and knowledge, thinks of team performance, 
has an emotional connect with the work and is 
triggered by internal factors. GAIL recognizes that 
an engaged workforce is key to achieve long- 
term objectives of industry leadership and 
profitable sustainable growth. Finding ways t 
o get all employees, from top executives to 
assembly line workers, intimately involved in 
day-to-day corporate sustainability activities is 
critical to building a dynamic and sustainable 
organization. 

Person engagement at GAIL begins with the 
recruitment process and continues through 
onboarding, learning,  career planning and 
progression until the employee leaves the 
company. To ensure that employees and their 
families do not miss out on key recreational or 
fitness related facilities while they are at sites,  
GAIL facilities are equipped with sports, gyms 
and other recreational amenities to enhance 
the employee experience. Further through 
implementation of Sports Promotion Policy, we 
encourage people to live a more active lifestyle. 

GAIL act as a family unit and hosts various 
celebrations at its plant/offices to create a feeling 
of camaraderie and oneness. 

During the reporting, period 10 complaints were 
received from employees and 100% of them  
were addressed.  No employee engagement 
survey was conducted in the reporting year.

As a tribute to GAIL Leadership, we released 
an in-house e book named “GAIL in 
SNAPSHOTS,” along with self-clicked picture 
entries of GAIL plants, sites, awe-inspiring 
landscapes and joyful social events. 

‘JAGROOK’- A GAIL Publication

11.5  Capacity Building
GAIL’s investment in capacity building aims to 
enhance competencies of its talent through 
learning process. We think that developing 
personnel skill and competency is critical to the 
successful implementation of GAIL’s strategic 
initiatives. We have built mechanisms at GAIL 
for successful capacity building and subsequent 
expansion of the existing resource base. 

Executive recruitment is primarily done at the 
entry-level, i.e., at the level of Executive Trainee 
and Sr. Officer/Sr. Engineer, because we believe  
in providing our employees with significant 
career advancement prospects. At the entry- 
level, both a campus selection procedure and 
an open recruitment exercise are used to hire 
executives. For executives and non-executives, 
the recruiting process is done through various 
modes such as open recruitment, GATE and 
campus placements.

At GAIL, overall employee development is one 
of our primary focus areas. We encourage our 
employees to develop their leadership qualities 
and technical abilities. This is made possible by 
offering a diverse choice of engaging multiple 
training programmes, skill development 
programmes, performance appraisals and 
feedback sessions to our employees in order to 
help them advance their careers.

11.5.1  Training and Development

GAIL provides personal and professional 
development opportunities for its employees 
through a variety of training programmes held 
on a regular basis. The goal of these trainings 
is to help our employees  learn need based 
new skills and become updated about recent 
advancements in the oil and gas business.

This continuing and continuous process, which 
includes learning and development for both 
personnel and professional, will help to improve 
their performance and skills while keeping them 
above with current industry circumstances. 
To provide continued support to increase the 
employability of retired employees, GAIL has 
conducted 178 skills management and lifelong 
learning programs.

GAIL Training Institute

GAIL Training Institute (GTI) has long served 
as a platform for training our precious human 
resources by imparting vital knowledge 
and experience in a variety of sectors. It also 
provides financial support for employees to

and it is in the interest of organisation as with it, 
comes accountability for the jobs. 

With the changing business landscape, Company’s 
strategic direction needs to be proactively 
supported by way of organization structure and 
right manpower placement decision. Here it is 
pertinent that diligent and systematic process 
like PMS framework, DPC, etc were put in place for 
identifying the right talent to be deployed for key 
assignments at domestic and foreign locations.    

11.7.1 Succession Planning at GAIL

GAIL Succession Planning Framework is primarily 
an Executive Development oriented initiative. It 
is aimed to put in place a structured framework 
to ensure adequacy of talent pool/skill set 
availability, both in terms of quantity and quality 
of potential successors, in line with Company’s 
business plan. Ready availability of sufficient

talent pool will help the Company to take prompt 
decisions in cases of unanticipated vacancies 
and/or business requirements.    GAIL Succession 
Planning Framework is applicable on positions 
upto 3 levels below the Board level in Senior 
Management Executive Levels. These positions 
are Executive Director (E-9 Grade), Chief General 
Manager (E-8 Grade) and General Manager (E-7 
Grade). As a part of our preparedness for coming 
challenges, GAIL has put in place Integrated  
Leadership Development Framework for 
facilitating leadership development and career 
planning.  

The development framework includes a variety of 
talent development interventions, such as:

 y 360 Degree Feedback Exercise: 360 Degree 
Feedback aims to deliver appropriate 
feedback to concerned executives through 
peers, subordinates and superiors.

 y Senior Management Development Centre 
(SMDC) Exercise: SMDC is a tool for ensuring 
that the organisation has better and more 
inspiring leadership. For senior executives in 
the E-5 grade and above, a Senior Management 
Development Centre (SMDC) exercise is 
conducted. Following the SMDC, executives 
are given books, e-learning modules and 
competency-specific training at top B-schools. 
Women executives in positions E-5 and 
above have also participated in customised 
management development programmes on 
leadership. Additionally, all newly promoted 
E7 and E8 executives are given a structured 
Management Development Program.

 GAIL prioritises the development of its 
leadership capabilities. We continue to 
conduct SMDC exercises as part of the 
Leadership Development Program, with 
a focus on the developmental aspects of 
individual executives. Almost all senior 
executives in  E-5 grade and above have been 
covered by the programme to date. 

 y Focused development programs: GAIL is 
preparing senior executives at the Executive 

Director and Chief General Manager levels 
for Board positions through competence 
building programmes such as Master Class 
for Directors and Board Room Effectiveness, 
in which GAIL Board Directors have 
participated. Capability building programmes 
on emerging areas such as Renewable and 
Alternate Energy (Solar and Wind Energy), 
Water Value Chain, Specialty Chemicals 
Segment and other upcoming areas such as 
Mobility Future, Industry 4.0 and Automation 
are being conducted on a regular basis to 
meet the objectives of GAIL’s Strategy-2030 
in line with the global business environment 
and India’s future growth trajectory.

11.8 Labour Practices and Human 
Rights
GAIL prioritizes aspects related to working 
conditions, quality of life at work and health 
and safety. We are committed to strengthening 
fundamental human rights and ethical labour 
standards throughout our operations as part of 
our mission to become a real socially responsible 
corporation. The Labour policy and practices are 
aligned to international frameworks (including 
ILO convention) for human rights and labour 
practices related matters. To address the issues 
and impacts related to Human rights, an Officer-
In-charge is appointed for each unit/office/
installation.

GAIL has framed a draft Equal Opportunity 
Policy as required under Section 21 of RPwD Act, 
2016, which has already been forwarded to the 
Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment for 
registration. 

GAIL strictly prohibits Child labour in any form. 
There is Zero Tolerance policy for acts culminating 
to violation of human rights. To ensure the 
same employees and all security personnel are 
sensitized on subject matters amounting to 
human right violation. The same applies even 
to our contractors. There is strict adherence to 
this and security personnel are trained to not

allow any underage worker. The only exceptions 
to the 18-year-old age limit are individuals 
who are enrolled in government-approved 
apprenticeship programmes or internships. There 
were no incidents of child labour, forced labour, 
or compelled labour throughout the reporting 
year that has been recorded.

For reservation, relaxations, concessions and 
other benefits for Scheduled Castes (SCs), 
Scheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes 
(OBCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in 
Direct Recruitment, we follow the Presidential 
Directives and other instructions and guidelines 
issued by the Government of India.

GAIL ensures freedom of speech across the 
organisation. Several labour union/ worker 
associations are recognised by GAIL, as long 
as they abide by the law and GAIL’s code of 
conduct. GAIL recognises and supports Workers’ 
Unions, Officers’ Associations, Women’s Forums, 
SC/ST Employees Associations and others that 
promote freedom of association and collective 
bargaining. GAIL Employees Association (GEA), 
a representative body of non-executives posted 
at various field offices/plants/installations 
across India except the corporate office and 
GAIL Karamchari Sangh (GKS), which represents 
non-executives posted at the corporate office, 
have both been recognised by management. 
The Industrial Relations Team is responsible for 
handling labour related disputes. IN FY 2021-22, 
there were no loss of man-days due to industrial 
dispute or disturbance. 

We recognise collective bargaining at our 
organisation. 18.13% of our employees (Non-
Management) are under Collective Bargaining 
Agreement. Aligned with organisation’s value, 
we follow a principle of remuneration equity 
and non-discrimination and it is purely based on 
performance and competence. Statutory Social 
Security benefits are in accordance with the 
applicable statutes. Apart from the above, there 
are several non-statutory social security benefits.

The organization’s pension benefits are available 
to all GAIL workers and meet all legal standards. 
GAIL ensures that all of its facilities, which are 
spread across India, meet the minimum wage 
regulations set forth in The Minimum Wages Act, 
1948. Actual pay is significantly higher than the 
minimum wage requirement and it varies by state. 
Regular interaction with employee collectives, 
coordination with labour authorities, settlement of 
industrial disputes, recording and analysis of work 
centre level issues and long-term settlement with 
Unions are all examples of GAIL’s commitments to 
human rights and labour practices, including the 
provision of the minimum wage. 

Grievance Redressal System

There is an online system for attending to 
grievances of employees. The portal uses a three-
tiered structure to ensure that grievances are 
resolved quickly and that the system is monitored 
often. The concerned HR In charge is accountable 
to register the complaint and resolve it within a 
time period of 10 days of complaint registration. 
Under instances of unsatisfactory redressal, 
the system allows escalation of the matter to 
corporate HR department who shall thence 
resolve the same within a period of 15 days. In 
case matter still remains unresolved, an appeal 
can be filed to Director (HR) whose decision shall 
be binding and final. The Director HR must also 
attend to the appeal and resolve it within 15 days.

No unfair labour practices

Unfair practices are discouraged and strictly 
prohibited by means of set policies and 
regulations. Employees have to abide by the 
following:

 y Code of Conduct

 y CDA Rules

 y Standing Orders

 y  Fraud Prevention Policy 

 y  Whistle Blower Policy

This year 10 employee grievance cases were 
registered and all are resolved successfully.

Apart from the Policies and code of conduct, it 
is expected that employees observe an abide by 
instructions or directions that may be circulated 
from time to time.

GAIL Training Institute conducts several training 
programs for all employees including executive, 
non-executive as well as contractual. These  
serve the means to educate, aware and sensitize 
them on labour laws and human rights. The 
human rights policies sensitize new joiner on 
GAIL’s commitment and processes in place. 
Furthermore, all security staff have received 
training on specific human rights procedures 
connected to security services.

We take the appropriate actions to ensure that 
our employees are not subjected to any sort 
of harassment as part of our commitment to 
providing a safe workplace for all employees and 
to assure the same we have a clear policy in place 
to avoid sexual harassment in the workplace.

There is an Internal POSH Committee responsible 
for preparing annual report that is submitted to  
the Company Secretary in accordance with the 
Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace 
(Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. It 
covers all aspects in accordance with GAIL’s policy 
for the prevention, prohibition and redressal of 
sexual harassment of women at work. There were 
no complaints of sexual harassment in FY 2021-22.

Periodic meetings with both employee unions and 
management are held at the unit and corporate 
levels to address actual employee complaints. In 
terms of notification of change, we follow Section 
9A of the Industrial Dispute Act 1947. Contractors 
must also give all applicable statutorily mandated 
social security benefits, including a provident 
fund, to contract workers they hire. 

The contract workers are covered and benefitted 
under Employees’ Compensation Act, 1923 or the 
Employees’ State Insurance Act (ESI),1948 and the 
Contractor also obtains an Insurance Policy on 

a regular basis for the grant of Death/Disability 
benefits; Furthermore, contract workers are 
covered by Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA).

We support the fact that decent employment is 
a societal right. We have put in our best efforts 
to provide appropriate working conditions for all 
of our employees, including adequate housing. 
Human rights reviews and impact assessments 
are conducted on a regular basis for all GAIL 
operations. During this fiscal year, no employees 
were laid off and no discriminatory employment 
complaints were filed.

11.9 Employee Well-Being
Physical and mental health goes hand in hand  
and at GAIL we take care of wellness of our 
employees. There is no compromise when it 
comes to health of our workforce and community. 
Employees’ physical and mental well-being is 
non-negotiable at GAIL. The long-term success of 
our company can be backed strongly by healthy 
individuals.

There is a provision for full health screening 
programme for both permanent and contract 
staff apart from annual occupational health 
check-up. At our official joint management  
health and safety committees, our entire 
workforce is represented. This committee is 
critical in conducting awareness sessions on 
health and safety concerns. It includes sessions 
such as fitness, yoga, stress management, lifestyle 
management and nutrition sessions. A healthy 
lifestyle is also promoted through conduction  
of sport events like cycling, badminton and 
others. To ensure workplace safety and efficiency, 
we give our employees 15 days’ notice before 
making any operational changes. 

Our Corporate Medical Cell (CMC) performs 
regular health screenings for our employees and 
keeps track of individual employee health. A 
doctor is always available to any GAIL employee, 
both at the corporate headquarters and at 
operational sites.

The details of our HSE Policy can be found 
at https://www.gailonline.com/pdf/others/
CorporateHSEPolicy.pdf

12.2  HSE Management System
Health, Safety and Environmental Management 
System (HSEMS) is an integral part of our HSE 
Philosophy. HSE Management System was 
formulated in-line with Oil Industry Safety 
Directorate Standard on “Safety Management 

System in Petroleum Industry”. It is an integrated 
approach aimed at managing workplace safety 
covering all aspects of plant and facilities to 
mitigate any losses with respect to personnel, 
equipment, material and environment. 
Accordingly, the HSE Management System 
of GAIL has incorporated 18 elements, which 
are applicable to all activities of GAIL. The 
HSE document provides a set of requirements 
and guidelines against each element for 
implementation across the GAIL installations.

Leadership and Commitment, Operational and 
Maintenance Procedures, Work Permit Systems, 
Third Party Services, Training, Incident Reporting, 
Investigation and Analysis, Occupational Health 
and Environmental Management are few of the 
topics covered by our HSEMS. We are constantly 
working towards improving the effectiveness of 
our HSE Management System. Our management 
is committed to provide enough resources and 
deploying skilled staff to comply with our HSE 
Policy and HSEMS regulations.

Safety Committee (s) have been constituted 
comprising members from management and 
non-management staff including trade unions to 
meet the statutory requirement of the Factories 
Act 1948, prescribed under section 41 (G) as well 
as to improve the safety standard in day to day 
working activities in plant/facility.  Site-level Safety 
Committees have responsibilities to oversee 
the overall safety at our operational sites. Safety 
Committees meet at least once in three months 
to assess matters related to health and safety 
performance and make decisions on remedial 
and preventive actions. GAIL has continually 
excelled in health and safety performance as a 
result of its robust HSE framework. 

12.2.1 HSE Score Implementation in GAIL

For constant monitoring and ensuring 
implementation of HSE Management System, it 
is necessary that the performance of sites with 
respect to implementation of HSE management 
system and safety compliances is measured 

GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 403-2, GRI 403-3, GRI 403-4, GRI 403-7, GRI 403-8, GRI 403-1



122

periodically. Towards this end, we have a “HSE 
Score” system to measure HSE performances 
of O&M sites. This system helps in effectively 
monitoring the implementation of elements 
like Leadership and Commitment, Employees 
Participations, Work Permit System, Risk Analysis, 
Maintenance and Inspection of Critical Safety 
Appliances/Equipment, Occupational Health, 
Emergency Preparedness, Compliance Audit etc. 
The advantage of HSE score system gets reflected 
in the form of increased productivity and  
morale of all those associated with the business 
activities. These benefits reflect a reduction in 
workplace accidents, injuries and illness.

All applicable GAIL sites submit their annual HSE 
plan and annual training calendar duly approved 
by site OIC/ WIC. Based on the annual plan, fire 
and safety in-charge and O&M in-charges of 
respective sites carry out programs. Some of the 
common practice includes:

 y Entry of site wise HSE performance by 
designated executive preferably HOD (Fire 
and Safety) in GAIL intranet HSE Score Entry 
System: entries are further approved by 
Respective OIC/WIC

 y Compilation and computation of HSE score 
by Corporate HSE Department is being done 
on monthly basis. HSE Scores are a part 
of Monthly Safety Day discussion at every 
site and necessary actions are taken for 
improvement

 y The functional director periodically reviews 
the exception report on Monthly Safety Day 
Observations and HSE Performance

 y Sites with high safety scores undergo physical 
verification for their HSE Performances by 
Corporate HSE official at sites.

Revision of HSE Score System was done in 2021-
22 to capture the key performance areas of Safety 
in Operation and Maintenance considering latest/
amended PNGRB/OISD Regulations/Standards.

12.2.2 Health, Safety and Environment 
Performance

The Health, Safety and Environmental 
management performance of GAIL’s operation 
and maintenance installations is measured 
through mechanism of HSE Score System which 
encompasses leading and lagging indicators. 

 y GAIL achieved an average “HSE Score” of 
97.18 for the FY 2021-22 against an  internal 
target of 95.00 

 y No major incident was reported at GAIL 
installations during the reporting period, in 
accordance with incident categorization of 
PNGRB, OISD and MOPNG

 y 32 minor incidents were reported during 
the year. Investigation of all incidents are 
conducted by a multi-disciplinary committee 
to find out the root causes and mitigation 
actions, to prevent reoccurrence of any such 
incident.

12.3  Transport Safety
We are in the business of transporting natural gas 
and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) through our 
cross-country pipeline system, which is one of  
the safest modes of transportation. In addition,  
oil marketing companies such as IOCL, BPCL, 
HPCL and GAIL carry hydrocarbons such as 
LPG, Propane, Pentane and Propylene mainly 
via road transport. With severity categorization, 
transportation safety evaluation allows us 
to identify potential hazards, risks, injury, or 
harm that may occur during the transportation 
and distribution of gas. Standard operating 
procedures and processes are followed to 
minimize/reduce the risk as low as reasonably 
practicable. 

Additionally, we also provide support/assistance 
required for attending emergencies as well as 
recovery of inflammable liquid hydrocarbon 
products due to in-transit accidents in the vicinity 
of GAIL’s supply plant(s) which is always rendered 
by GAIL’s fire and safety department.

Transportation Safety for Cross Country 
Pipelines

 y Risk assessment of cross-country pipelines are 
being carried out to determine the Individual 
Risk Per Annum (IRPA) and mitigation 
measures are taken to minimize risk.

 y  GAIL spreads awareness amongst the 
community on safety of pipelines through FM 
Radio jingles. Safety awareness campaigns 
are organized for nearby inhabitants 
along the pipelines on a regular basis for 
propagating information regarding pipeline 
location, informing them about Do’s & Don’ts 
in the ROU area, potential consequences 
of damage, company contact information 
for reporting leakage and informing before 
carrying out any excavation etc.

 y Nukkad Natak on pipeline safety is being 
organized at villages situated in close vicinity 
of cross country pipelines.

 y In order to have faster communication during 
any emergency, all India toll-free short key 
no.15101 has been started apart from existing 
1800118430.

 y National Gas Management System at Noida is 
our nodal centre for emergency management.

 y Daily foot patrolling in populated/ urban 
centers and monthly foot patrolling of Lines 
at other locations is conducted to identify 
encroachments / suspicious activities, if any.

 y Implemented GPS based online tracking 
system for foot patrolling across the 
organization.

 y Integrity Management System is followed for 
entire Cross Country Pipelines in accordance 
with PNGRB (Integrity Management System 
for Natural Gas Pipelines) Regulations 2012.

12.3.1 Road Transport Safety

Trucks are permitted inside the plant for loading 
only after validation of proper documentation 
as per RTO & PESO requirements and visual 
inspection. The trucks are inspected by CISF 
before entering the plants. Some of the major 
road transportation safety measures are 
mentioned below:

 y Online SAP based ‘Dangerous Goods 
Authorization’ to ensure healthiness of 
hydrocarbon tankers by reviewing the safety 
aspects, prior to loading

 y Physical checking of hydrocarbon tankers by 
regular employees

 y Periodic capacity building sessions for the 
workers involved in loading of hydrocarbon 
product to make them aware about the 
hazards associated with operation and its 
mitigation measures

 y Checking for proper flow when the truck 
reports at the bay

 y Ensuring that there are no jutting objects in 
the trucks which would damage the bags

 y Drivers are personally instructed to maintain 
safety standards inside and outside the plant 
premises.

12.4  SAP-based Environment, Health 
and Safety Management (EHSM)
SAP-based Environment, Health and Safety 
Management (EHSM) have been implemented 
which has multiple functionalities such 
as incident management system (safety 
observation, recording never miss and incident/
accident), risk assessment and job safety  
analysis, management of change and safety 
audit/activity monitoring.

Impacts and benefits of the EHSM SAP include 
the following:

 y Establishment of uniform procedures across 
GAIL for incident management, job safety 

analysis, risk assessment and management of 
change

 y Introduction of workflow for improving clarity 
and accountability  to transform compliance 
approach

 y Generation of incident reports for institutions/ 
statutory bodies like PNGRB, OISD, PESO, 
Factory Directorate and GAIL specific through 
a single portal

 y Strengthening the Work Permit System at 
GAIL by linking job safety analysis

 y Increasing the efficiency of monitoring 
and analytical reporting by introducing a 
user-friendly dashboard to OICs / WICs / 
coordinators

We have an Online System accessible to all 
employees including contractual workers for 
reporting safety observation (Unsafe Act/
Condition) and near miss in the portal using a 
developed interactive form instead of offline 
complaints. Contract workers can report 
such events through their GAIL supervisor for 
corrective actions.

12.5 Safety Audits
Safety audits are undertaken on a regular basis 
to ensure that the HSE Management System 
Guidelines and Emergency Preparedness plan are 
followed and the system is performing well. 

Design, Construction, Operation and  
Maintenance of GAIL installations are carried  
out in accordance with national and  
international codes including standards like 
ASME, API, OISD, PNGRB, PESO, NFPA etc. 
Safety audits of facilities are also carried out 
simultaneously conforming to central and state 
regulations to ensure compliances of various HSE 
aspects. 

Internal audit (Proactive Audit and Internal  
Audit-CO) is conducted at least once in a year by in-
house team to identify the areas of improvement 
with respect to PNGRB and other regulations, 
OISD Standards, Management Governance etc. 
Also, internal audit on Occupational Health and 
Environment Management are being conducted 
periodically on sample basis to ensure the 
compliances of GAIL’s occupational health 
guidelines and environment management. 

In addition to internal audits, external safety 
audits of GAIL’s installations are carried out by 
third party inspection agencies in accordance 
with the applicable national codes and standards. 
External safety audit of major installations is

12.6 Employee Safety: Occupational 
Health, Training and Emergency 
Preparedness
GAIL has implemented Health and Safety 
Practices for employees including contract 
workers that are primarily driven by Health, Safety 
and Environment Management System. 

Occupational Health: The Corporate Occupational 
Health Committee meets quarterly to monitor 
the occupational health programme and its 
efficacy is assessed using the results of an 
Occupational Health Audit conducted by in-
house multi-disciplinary teams. The Occupational 
Health Guidelines cover a wide range of topics, 
including site-specific occupational health 
infrastructure, occupational health committees, 
medical surveillance programmes, health data 
documentation and analysis and bio-medical 
waste management, among others. Medical 
surveillance is performed regularly on employees  
to assess their health while occupational 
health check-ups are conducted on permanent 
employees once a year to measure their well-
being.

We also conduct periodic awareness workshops  
on health. Employee health scores are calculated 
and recorded based on predetermined parameters, 
which are communicated with employees. We 
also communicate ways to improve health score 

to all employees. Every site develops a cumulative 
health index based on individual employee  
health scores for the purpose of analysing and 
improving employee well-being.

Our Suppliers
At GAIL, suppliers are one of our key stakeholders. 
They play a pivotal role in ensuring business 
continuity by supplying essential materials, 
goods and services to both our core and non-
core operations. Therefore, our suppliers are a 
key pillar in our business operations and a major 
contributor to our continuous success. 

We take conscious eff orts to engage and 
interact with our suppliers and to build long-
term partnerships with them. This entails clear 
dialogue and transparency of operations across 
our value chain. Our motivation to engage with 
our suppliers is to create a mutually benefi cial 
long-term relationship. We aim to understand 
their concerns, build their capacity as needed and 
align them with our sustainability vision.  

13.1 Procurement Practices
At GAIL, ethical procurement is one of our 
guiding principles, which leads to both tangible 
and intangible gains for the company. Our 
sourcing practices ensure better transparency, 
opportunities to connect with suppliers, enhanced 
brand image, elimination of uncertainties and 
hence aim to secure our prospects. To incorporate 
and promote sustainable development, we 
ensure all our sourcing practices are conducted 
in a responsible manner with an emphasis on 
environmental and societal benefi ts. Our processes 

followed regarding standards of sourcing, 
selection and maintaining compliance ensure that 
our key suppliers are risk-free. We ensure that all 
our suppliers adhere to the applicable regulations 
and standards set by GAIL. This in turn enables 
the uninterrupted operation of our facilities. 
Additional information about our procurement 
practices is described in the sections below.

GAIL is making best eff orts to enhance the 
procurement from Medium and Small Enterprises 
(MSEs) owned by SC/ST entrepreneurs as follows:

 y GAIL has adopted a special tie-breaker 
methodology in tenders for services/works. 
In case of tie at the lowest bid (L-1) position 
between 02 or more start-up/non-start up 
bidders, following sequence of preference shall 
be adopted while placement of LOA/order:

yy In case one of the bidders is MSE owned 
by SC/ST Entrepreneur, then order shall 
be placed on such bidder.

13.2 General Conditions of Contract 
and Shaping of Contracts
We select our suppliers and vendors through 
our tender and bidding process. This includes 
identifying and eliminating any conflicts of 
interest, other violations against our procurement 
policies and ensuring alignment with ethical 
and legal standards. Furthermore, the General 
Conditions of Contract (GCC) forms an integral 
part of our tender documents. Once awarded with 
a contract, all vendors and suppliers are mandated 
to comply with the conditions of the GCC. 

To strengthen our sustainability focussed 
assessment, our suppliers follow GCC guidelines 
and the same needs to be confirmed by the 
bidders in their bids. This includes a Human 
Rights clause which is also a part of all the 
investment agreements and contracts with 
suppliers. Moreover, we follow a comprehensive 
and periodic screening process for our critical 
suppliers to monitor the implementation of 
all regulatory requirements. Based on the 

assessments, we encourage suppliers to adopt 
sustainable practices in their operations. We are 
proud to share that for the reporting period, 
there were no negative social or environmental 
impacts created by our suppliers.

Qualifying process for Suppliers and Vendors 
at GAIL:

The suppliers are expected to adhere to the 
Supplier Code of Conduct and compliance based 
on environmental and social criteria. Adherence 
to both is also monitored by GAIL. As and when 
required, we also conduct capacity building 
initiatives for our suppliers. 

13.3 Zero Tolerance to Child labour
As a responsible organisation, we have a zero-
tolerance policy towards child labour. We strictly 
adhere to this and do not endorse or promote 
child labour within our premises and across our 
supply chain. All security personnel have been 
trained to ensure that no underage workers enter 
the plant/office premises and our contractors 
are not allowed to hire underage workers. The 
contract documents include an appropriate clause 
to that effect. Additionally, prior to starting any 
work, contractors are required to obtain labour 
permission from the GAIL authority to ensure that 
there is no child labour within their operations. 
Our labour practices across all units also comply 
with the government’s rule of a minimum age of 
18 years for employment. The only exceptions to 
the 18-year-old age limit for any operation are 
those who are enrolled in government-approved 
apprenticeship programmes and internships. 

GAIL upholds a zero-tolerance policy towards any 
act that leads to the violation of human rights. We 
also have ratified a zero-tolerance policy for the 
prevention of child and forced labour and ensure 
that no such employment occurs at any of our 
operation. During this reporting year, no incident 
of engagement of child or forced or compulsory 
labour has been recorded. We have developed 
and implemented stringent guidelines in 
ensuring our suppliers are also upholding zero 
tolerance to child labour.

Qualification of Indian Bidder Based on 
Experience of Foreign Supporting Company

To boost GoI initiative of Make in India and 
Atmanirbhar Bharat and enhance the participation 
by Indian bidders, a policy has been introduced at 
GAIL to give preference to Indian bidders based on 
the qualifications of foreign supporting bidders.

INDEG Group constituted for development 
of Import substitution

INDEG Groups at the Apex level and at Site levels 
have been constituted at GAIL and meetings of 
the committees are held regularly. The objective 
of the INDEG Groups is to take initiative to 
develop indigenous sources of materials and 
services, import substitutions and reserve 
materials and services to be supplied by domestic 
vendors only. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural 
Gas (MoPNG) has constituted a technical group 
consisting of representatives of EIL, ONGC, IOCL, 
GAIL, BPCL, HPCL and OIL for the development of 
a Make in India-Exhaustive portal. GAIL has been 
actively participating in the development of the 
Make in India - Exhaustive portal covering the 
opportunities in the Oil & Gas sector for Indian 
and foreign manufacturers interested in setting 
up a manufacturing base in India.

Initiatives taken for Engaging with Suppliers

To ease and facilitate business with our vendors 
and suppliers, GAIL has taken the following 
extraordinary initiatives:

 y Payment of labour charges to contractors 
during the lockdown period

 y Faster payment to contractors to provide 
them with liquidity

 y Consideration of COVID-19 as Force Majeure 
and extension of contract periods by 3 to 6 
months

 y Reduction of CPBG to 3% from the previous 
10% in ongoing and new contracts

 y Relaxation of timelines for the submission of 
CPBG.

We endeavour to procure materials and services 
by following transparent procedures, guidelines 
and policies set forth internally and by the 
Government of India. In all cases, tender, pre-
tender, or pre-bid meetings are conducted to 
ensure vendor participation and to educate 
vendors on the tendering process. In addition 
to the above, vendor meets, MSEs meets and 
representation in Industry Conclaves are a few 
other initiatives taken by GAIL to effectively 
engage with suppliers.

GAIL has also conducted various meets with MSEs 
including those run by SC or ST entrepreneurs 
across India. In this financial year, GAIL has 
conducted 35 Vendor Development Programs in 
FY 2021-22 across our various work centres. 

At GAIL, we regularly conduct Interactive Meets 
& Development Programs for all Vendors/
Suppliers/Contractors across all its work 
centres. During our interactions multiple case 
studies and presentations on various initiatives, 
policies of GAIL is being highlighted especially 
those in the line of ease of doing business.  
Further to strengthen our relation and ensuring 
development of suppliers, we have Vendor 
Coaching program being held with aim to 
eliminate the gaps in understanding of tender 
process and contract execution.

To seek advice and express concerns, an email 
helpdesk called ED C&P Cell has been set up where 
officials may send their questions and issues 
raised throughout the tendering and contracting 
process. The questions are appropriately 
addressed and then incorporated into the form 
of a FAQ. During the reporting year, around 45 
queries were addressed by ED-C&P Cell.

Other Sustainable sourcing initiatives:

 y To reduce the volume of a tender document 
and usage of paper, a standard document GCC 
is already available on GAIL’s tender website, 
as a part of our Digital initiative and ease of 
doing business. GCC is no longer being made 
part of tender documents

14.2 Digital Transformation
As a growing organisation, under the digital 
India campaign, GAIL aspires to digitalize most of 
our services. Digitalization increases the level of 
transparency and trust among our stakeholders. 
We have integrated digital technology into all 
areas of our business over the past few years, 
fundamentally changing how we operate and 
deliver value to our stakeholders. By putting 
new systems and processes in place, we are 
contributing to the development of a new 
digital economy. As a part of this continuous 
transformation, we have incorporated online 
management tools like the bill watch system, 
cashless transactions, a file movement system, 
paperless transactions, etc. 

Through collaborative efforts of GAIL’s IT team 
with other departments, we have been able to 
provide prompt solutions to both external and 
internal stakeholders. To ensure transparent, fair, 
competitive and cost-effective practices in our 
procurement, GAIL has introduced e-tendering. 
This initiative also contributes towards reduction 
in paper consumption and is a green initiative 
taken by the organization. Further, in order to 
ease the process of submission of CPBG, GAIL has 
introduced the option of submitting the same 
through online banking. 

To conclude the maximum number of tenders 
through e-tendering, the threshold value has 
been reduced to INR 2 lakh from the previous INR 
7 lakh. To streamline the process of submission of 
EMD, we have initiated the option of submitting 
the same through online banking. We always 
believe in giving equal opportunity to all and aim 
for a fair and transparent process. As we host our 
tender process on our website, anyone who is 
interested can participate in the bidding process 
without visiting the tender issuing site. For better 
reach we also publish the same requirement 
in newspapers.  We are proud to share that our 
order value through Government e-Marketplace 

(GeM) in FY 2021-22 is INR 2,593 crore compared 
to INR 1,033 crore in FY 2020-21. 

As a part of our ease of doing business, Digital India 
initiative, reducing the paper consumption and 
eliminating record keeping in large volumes, we 
have a standard document GCC which is available 
on GAIL’s tender website. GAIL has introduced the 
Document Transmittal System for signing and 
countersigning of bulky contract documents in 
Projects. All bulky documents are signed by the 
relevant GAIL official via a digital signature to 
reduce paper consumption. This digitally signed 
contract document is sent online to the contractor, 
who countersigns it and returns it to us.

Further, the following initiatives have been taken 
towards the Ease of Doing business at different 
stages of a project:

A. Pre –Award Stage 

Pre-Tender Meeting: The aim is to improve 
comprehension of technical and financial 
qualification criteria, requirements and the 
tender’s scope of work. This eliminates any 
complexity during the evaluation stage. Details 
of the pre-tender meeting are posted on GAIL’s 
website for wider circulation.

Uploading of Tenders on GAIL’s and Govt. 
Website: All tenders are uploaded on GAIL’s 
tender website, relevant Government. website 
and Government e-Marketplace (GeM) for 
wider circulation. Any bidder who meets the 
Bid Evaluation Criteria (BEC) can download and 
participate. This ensures transparency and equal 
opportunity to all the eligible bidders. 

Uploading of General Conditions of Contract 
on Website of GAIL and Non-Inclusion in Tender 
Documents: To minimize the consumption of 
paper in terms of the size, volume of tenders and 
bids, the GCC are available on GAIL’s tender website.

E-Tendering: This is a secure platform for sending 
and receiving tenders by electronic means. The 
threshold value of E-Tendering has been lowered 
to INR 2 Lakh.

domestically manufactured products, services 
or works relating to telecom, domestically 
manufactured products of petroleum and natural 
gas sector and registration of bidders from 
country sharing land border with India, amongst 
others.

Procurement through Government e- 
Marketplace (GeM): All the items and services 
available on GeM are procured through GeM. 
Additionally, efforts are being made to bring 
all GAIL’s items and services onto GeM which 
promotes transparency and efficiency. The GeM 
has transformed the procurement of goods & 
services of GAIL has brought an order value 
of 2,593 crores in FY 2021- 22 through the 
Government e Marketplace (GeM).

B. Post –Award Stage

Kick Off Meeting: After the award of a contract, 
the EIC organises a kick-off meeting with the  
contractor. Aspects covered during the kick-
off meeting include signing of the agreement, 
submission of CPS, schedule for submissions, 
approval of drawings and documents, work 
schedule and sub-milestones. 

Bill Watch System: The system helps in tracking 
vendor bills and ensuring timely payment to 
them. Vendors can also keep track of their bill and 
check the status.

Review of CPBG in Work Contracts & Time 
Period for Submission of CPBG: CPBG in work 
contracts was modified as 5% initially and a 
deduction of the remaining 5% from running 
bills was done. The time frame of the submission 
of CPBG has been rationalized. 

Measures taken in Pipeline Laying Contracts: 
A mobilization advance in two instalments of 5% 
each has been instituted. The rate of interest has 
been reduced to MCLR for one year and charged 
by SBI plus 2.0% p.a. on a reducing balance basis. 
The release of 70% of the running bill payment 
is done within a period of 7 days. Extended stay 
compensations are given to contractors.

Methodology for Transaction on Trade 
Receivable Discounting System (TReDS): 
TReDS addresses the challenges faced by MSMEs 
to maintain their working capital due to delayed 
payments from buyers. TReDS is an online 
electronic institutional mechanism for financing 
of trade receivables of MSMEs. GAIL is already 
registered on all the three TReDS platforms.

Vendor Feedback Portal: For any organization  
to grow, feedback from stakeholders is 
important. To capture the feedback of suppliers 
and contractors in an effective way, a Vendor 
Feedback portal has been launched.

Vendor Grievance Portal: To capture the  
grievances of suppliers and contractors we have 
developed and deployed a portal known as 
‘Samadhan’.

Health Monitoring of Contracts: Monthly  
health monitoring of contracts has been 
implemented to ensure that contracts are 
managed and executed to the satisfaction of 
stakeholders. This includes various contract 
management aspects including claims, 
deviations, amendments, issues, disputes etc. 
Reports in the prescribed format are submitted 
monthly to management.

Quarterly Closure of Contracts: GAIL implemented 
the quarterly closing of contracts to ensure that 
contracts are managed and executed to the 
satisfaction of all stakeholders and there is an  
ease in contract closure. 

Pre-Dispute Resolution (Samadhan) Mechanism: 
During the execution of contracts, any disputes 
arising with Contractors due to lack of clarity in 
contracts, different interpretations etc. are resolved 
via the Samadhan Mechanism. This minimizes the 
number of disputes turning into arbitrations or 
legal disputes.

Settlement Advisory Committee (SAC): Issues 
and disputes are mutually resolved within a 

reasonable time, through SAC. SAC consist of 
Conciliators who are persons of unquestionable 
integrity and good public standing. The  
Settlement Advisory Committee facilitates 
voluntary resolution of the dispute and 
communicates the view of each party to the other.

Revised Dispute Resolution Mechanism 
Clause: GAIL has simplified the Dispute 
Resolution Mechanism provisions. The party 
invoking the arbitration has the option to either 
opt for Ad-hoc Arbitration or Institutionalized 
Arbitration. Procedures for vendor performance 
evaluation for suppliers were reviewed and the 
concept of issuance of yellow card (watchlist)  
has been introduced instead of the previous  
Red Card (Holiday) provision.

Contract Management Document (COMAND): 
For better contract management, COMAND was 
launched for EICs containing the various aspects 
and procedures to enable a better contract 
execution.

15.2 Customer Privacy
As people spend more time online, customer 
privacy is becoming more vital than ever. 
Customer privacy includes issues such as data 
protection, using information/data for the 
intended purpose, preserving confidentiality and 
avoiding information theft or abuse.

We understand our duty to uphold the integrity 
and accuracy of our stored documents, records 
and information. All the information created, 
captured and stored are in compliance with our 
Document Preservation Policy. Furthermore, 
customer privacy is an essential component 
of GAIL’s agreements. These include using 
information or data for its original intended 
purpose, maintaining confidentiality and 
protecting information and data from misuse 
or theft. During the reporting year, no cases of 
customer privacy breach were recorded. GAIL 
takes additional efforts to protect customer 
privacy (end consumers and business to business 
customers) depending on the industry in which 
the customer operates:

 y RLNG: The Gas Supply Agreements and 
Gas Supply Purchase Agreements contain a 
confidentiality clause. Accordingly, both the 
buyer and the seller are obligated to keep 
information regarding the transactions and 
business confidential except for its usages 
towards purposes allowed by law.

 y Domestic Gas: GAIL supplies natural gas 
to a wide range of businesses across the 
natural gas value chain and therefore has a  
broad customer base. Each customer type 
has a unique selling proposition- contractual 
provisions and financial agreements. Clauses 

with  customers, regardless of whether they 
are end consumers or business-to-business 
customers, are kept confidential. Domain 
experts have been consulted to put in place 
measures around the protection of data and 
prevention of its misuse and theft.  

15.3 Product labelling
Through our product labelling, we strive to enable 
our customers to make informed decisions about 
the social, economic and environmental impact 
of the products they are purchasing. GAIL has 
taken measures to ensure that the information 
provided is adequate and accurate. There were 
no incidences reported of non-compliance 
with regulations or voluntary codes concerning 
the health and safety impacts of products and 
services within the reporting period.

basis by loading in road tankers and/or 
railway wagons deployed by customers. 
Technical and safety-related information on 
the product being carried is displayed on 
the truck tanker or rail wagon itself as per 
local laws and is ensured by the customer or 
transporter concerned. As LHCs are carried 
in bulk, separate labels are not provided. 
The tankers are clearly labelled ‘inflammable 
products’ when they are transported via 
roads as a safety requirement. Additionally, 
the product name, safety signage, hazardous 
chemicals signage, emergency contact, 
transporter’s name and contact are also

15.4 Customer Satisfaction
Our core values are founded on our constant 
pursuit of exceeding our customers’ expectations 
and being their first preferred partner by offering 
superior products. Thus we ensure customer 
satisfaction and strive to create a loyal customer 
base for long-term business growth. 

Understanding customer satisfaction levels and 
feedback allows us to review and redefine our 
strategies and eventually provide better services 
and offerings through our business initiatives. 
We capture the voice of our customers through 
our customer value management and Customer 
Satisfaction Index surveys. The Customer 
Satisfaction Survey is an in-house, half yearly, 
online (through SAP) survey, carried out for 

obtaining customer complaints and feedback. 
Customer feedback is taken in the form of scores 
on various parameters such as Quality, Delivery, 
Technical support etc. The customer inputs are 
then translated in the form of an index called as 
the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI). To improve 
business services, the surveys are shared with the 
marketing department who work to expedite 
solutions and drive customer loyalty.

Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) online 
survey 2021-22

Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) is an in-house 
attempt to collect the feedback from customers. 
A link is provided to all active customers to 
their registered email-id. Customers share their 
feedback on various parameters on quality and 
services. Their feedback is collected through 
SAP and analyzed. The observation is mitigated 
promptly and appropriately and there after 
customers are informed to complete the loop.

CVM offline survey FY 2021-22

Customer Value Management (CVM) refers to 
the feedback from Customers that are collected 
by a third-party evaluating agency. Customers 
are requested to respond to a set of questions 
and their feedback is recorded. This feedback is 
further analyzed by the agency and presented 
GAIL’s Management. Customer concerns are 
discussed and deliberated and corrective action 
plan is shared by the marketing department. 
Accordingly, the steps taken have been shared 
with customers.

Customer Value Management (CVM) Survey - The 
feedback from customers on product quality 
and services, are captured through a structured 
questionnaire through offline mode. During the 
reporting year, there were about 150 CVM visits 
conducted to capture customer voices. 

The observations from the CVM survey are 
addressed by the team and corrective actions are 
taken. Once the appropriate measures are taken, 
the customers are being informed to complete 
the loop.

15.6 Customer Engagement 
Our focus is to deliver the best end-to-end 
customer experience. Engagement with 
customers through various touch points 
throughout the year enables us to establish a 
level of trust within them. In addition to customer 
satisfaction surveys and customer grievance 
mechanisms, our team engages through  
multiple platforms and focused initiatives  
under our customer engagement programs. 
Customer engagement initiatives are focused 
on solving customer queries about products and 
our portfolio and creating awareness about our 
services. The long-term goal is also to enhance 
brand credibility and build our reach with 
potential customers.

To build an understanding of customer needs,  
we use technology and customer intelligence. 
Market intelligence regarding prevailing RLNG 
prices, Polymer grade specific discount and LHC 
product prices is obtained and communicated to 
our corporate office for necessary action. Steps 
are accordingly taken to tie up GAIL volume 
with customers and refine our product price 
and offerings to make us more competitive. 
Customers are offered a mix of the portfolio 
available with GAIL. Marketing Retail has also 
developed an application to inform customers 
about price updates directly from the system.

GAIL has also put mechanisms in place to inform 
consumers of government updates and any risk 
of disruption or discontinuation of essential 
services. Any anticipated disruptions in gas 



Sustainability Report  2021-22

supplies and transmission are informed to the 
customers at the earliest through e-mails and 
phone calls. For gas marketing, regional control 
rooms are in touch with customers round the 
clock to inform them about any potential delays 
or disruptions. With regards to our petrochemical 
lines, plant shutdown activities, availability of 
grades and changes in government regulations 
are communicated promptly through e-mails and 
over the phone.

To inform and educate consumers about safe  
and responsible usage of products and services, 
their contracts, MoUs and our Sales Policy has 
specific information on the usage of products. 
With regards to natural gas, LHC and polymer 
segments, MSDS is also provided to customers. 
Customers are also required to maintain statutory 
licences needed to handle the products sold. 
Customer interactions, whether visits or meetings, 
are also a key channel for communicating 
information around the safe and responsible 
usage of products. Additionally, GAIL’s Fire & 
Safety department organizes demonstrations to 
educate customers about safe and responsible 
use of natural gas. Moreover, our CGD company 
also conducts safety training of downstream 
customers to educate them on safe use of natural 
gas. Periodic mock drills are also done to educate 
customers and the public about actions needed 
to be taken in case of any hazardous situations.

Furthermore, consumer awareness activities are 
conducted through industry associations like 
TAAPMA and their publications, in which GAIL 
actively participates. Our Awareness campaigns 
like SAKSHAM are adding more value to our 
efforts.

Initiatives taken during the reporting year for 
engaging with customers:

 y  Due to the pandemic, most customer 
interactions were performed digitally, with 
only a few physical meetings taking place. The 
purpose of these meetings was to address 
customer concerns, maintain frequent 
relationships and explore new business 

opportunities. Meetings with customers, for 
example, to discuss the use of natural gas 
in unexplored areas such as blast furnaces, 
calciners, power plant boilers and so on. 
This helped in identifying potential areas of 
natural gas usage, as well as customers inputs 
on potential difficulties and what can be done 
to eliminate them

 y  Visit to LCNG plants with potential customers 
to show the storage facilities of natural gas in 
the form of LNG and how it can be filled in 
vehicles easily to use as replacement of diesel 
to demonstrate the use and wide scope of 
LNG in automotive

 y CGD companies are also ensuring safety 
training to downstream customers to educate 
them on safe use of natural gas. Periodic mock 
drills are carried out to educate customers 
and public about actions to be taken in case 
of any safety hazard

 y In case any existing contracts/GSA are 
expiring, the Zonal offices reach out to 
customers for contract renewal and based on 
customers’ then prevailing requirement, enter 
into new contract after internal deliberation 
with GAIL Corporate Marketing 

 y GAIL is the only gas company to provide 
online open access to the shippers (gas 
suppliers/ marketers/gas producers) for 
booking of common carrier capacity on its 
various NG pipelines through “Open Access 
Portal” on GAIL’s website

 y PNGRB has granted authorizations for 
development of City Gas Distribution (CGD) 
networks in about 201 Geographical Areas 
(GA) in the 9th, 10th and 11th bidding rounds 
and out of these, almost three-fourth of GAs 
would be served through GAIL’s pipelines. 
Accordingly, for development of expeditious 
hooking-up connectivity between GAIL’s 
pipelines and the CGD networks, GAIL has 
been proactively procuring long-lead items 
such as metering skids and taking steps for 
faster development of CGD connectivity

GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3

Synergy for Green Energy

 y GAIL has provided tie-in connectivity / 
interconnections to various pipeline entities/ 
LNG & FSRU Terminals and Natural Gas 
Producers for evacuation of gas from their 
isolated, CBM and DSF fields through GAIL’s 
trunk natural gas pipelines for onward supply 
to natural gas customers

 y  Addition of new sources of gas into the 
existing pipelines: Recently, there have 
been more discoveries of domestic gas in KG 
Basin, Rajasthan, Cauvery Basin and Coal Bed 
Methane (CBM). Gas import terminals are also 
emerging both in the west and east coasts of 
the country. Thus, GAIL has taken steps to 
provide connectivity to the upcoming new 
gas sources so that the availability of gas from 
these new discoveries could be accessed by 
the customers falling along GAIL’s pipelines. 
GAIL’s recent/upcoming tie-in connectivity 
with new sources include:

a) ONGC’s Madanam: Memathur, Cauvery 
Basin Pipeline Network 

b) ONGC’s Bantumilli: Ulumpuru, KG Basin 
Pipeline Network 

c) ONGC’s Odalarevu: Bodaskurru, KG Basin 
Pipeline Network 

d) ONGC’s Suvali : Kawas, Integrated HVJ 
Pipeline System 

e) Vedanta’s Jaya field Jambusar: South 
Gujarat Pipeline Network 

f) Jaigarh LNG terminal: Dabhol, DUPL-
DPPL Pipeline 

g) CBM Bokaro and Jharia: JHBDPL Natural 
Gas Pipeline 

h) CBM gas at Shadol: Phulpur, Integrated 
HVJ Pipeline System 

 y Inter-connection with pipelines of other 
operators: GAIL has provided interconnection 
to various other pipeline operators like M/s 
PIL’s EWPL (at Oduru /Mhaskal/ Ankot) with 
its KG Basin NG pipeline network, DUPL 
pipeline and HVJ pipelines respectively. M/s 

IOCL’s Dadri Panipat NGPL (at Dadri) with its 
HVJ pipeline, M/s GSPL’s HP Gujarat Gas Grid 
(Dahej) with its HVJ pipeline, GIGL’s Bhatinda-
JammuSrinagar NGPL (at Jalandhar) with its 
DBNPL, RGPL (at Phulpur) with its integrated 
HVJ/ JHBDPL, thus providing access to almost 
all the other operators to its pipelines

 y Inter-connection with upcoming pipelines: 
GAIL will also be providing interconnection 
of its JHBDPL pipeline with the upcoming 
Indradhanush Gas Grid of M/s IGGL to 
connect the entire North-East region with 
the main grid. In the southern region, GAIL 
will be inter-connecting its KG Basin Network 
with M/s APGDC’s upcoming Kakinada-
Srikakulam Pipeline. Furthermore, GAIL will 
also be providing interconnection of its 
Dabhol-Bengaluru pipeline and its upcoming 
KKMBPL at Bengaluru with the upcoming 
Ennore-Thiruvallur-Bengluru-Puducherry-
Nagapatinam-MaduraiTuticorin pipeline of 
M/s IOCL, thus connecting the entire southern 
region with the main grid

 y To allocate domestic gas to Geographical 
Areas (GAs), GAIL has initiated a concept of 
virtual pipelines in CGD, approved by MoPNG. 
This mode enables the transportation of CNG 
and PNG to CGD entities through cascades in 
a compressed form, or through LNG tankers 
in a liquid form. As a result, this will not only 
assist in ensuring domestic gas supply to 
geographical locations that are not connected 
to any natural gas pipeline network but also 
increase the customer base

 y In order to resolve potential contractual issues 
with shippers, Dispute Resolution Mechanism 
is defined in the Gas Transmission Agreement 
(GTA) to resolve issues through amicable 
settlement/ conciliation / arbitration

 y For capacity booking, the Open Access Portal 
now includes digital signature feature

 y In FY 2021-22, our team visited major customers 
in India covering sectors like Injection 
Moulding, Film Sector, Blow moulding, Raffia, 



Sustainability Report  2021-22

147

Pipe Sector etc. to enhance market share and 
product promotion. Due to the pandemic 
when visits were not possible, we emphasized 
strongly on virtual meetings with major and 
new customers for technical support, product 
feedback and new product development. Over 
the last few years, as a value-added service, the 
GPTC team visits the premises of our leading 
polymer customers. This deepens our insight 
into our customers business requirements, 
technical issues they face relating to polymer 
processing and moulding as well as any specific 
concerns they have. These efforts towards 
understanding the ever-evolving needs of our 
customers have not only helped in adapting 
to their requirements and building a positive 
relationship with them, but also in promoting 
specific grades of products. Additionally, 
many processing trials were conducted with 
customers for trouble shooting, assessment of 
quality improvement in improved batches and 
new product development

 y Additionally, GAIL’s zonal offices are constantly 
in touch with the customers of their respective 
regions to gather information related to their 
natural gas requirements, issues pertaining 
to supply, Gas Supply Agreement (GSA), etc. 
Zonal offices also monitor statuses of contracts 
and agreements and proactively reach out 
to customers for contract renewal and to 
understand prevailing requirements. Zonal 
offices also deliberate internally with GAIL 
corporate marketing before entering new 
contracts. GAIL provides contractual flexibility 
in order to adapt to changing customer needs 
and secure customer retention.

GAIL Polymer Technology Centre (GPTC) in Noida 
(Delhi NCR) provides customer satisfaction 
services, technical assistance and resolution of 
product-related concerns on polymer grades 
for our petrochemical business segment. Their 
customer service and feedback interface carry 
out the below-mentioned activities:

 y Customer complaint redressal

 y Assistance on the proper selection of GAIL 
grades

 y Entrepreneurial guidance

 y Development and modification of GAIL 
petrochemical grades to meet market needs

 y  Application development and promotion for 
customer benefits

 y Participating and representing GAIL in 
technical forums and business association for 
awareness and policy advocacy purposes

Additional initiatives on customer engagement 
by zonal offices have been outlined below: 

 y Hyderabad Zonal: For the PC & LHC 
segments, rigorous digital customer 
interactions were undertaken. This served as 
a mechanism to ensure customer connect in 
the pandemic period when physical visit to 
customer premises were not possible. In the 
NG segment, the team has been constantly in 
touch with all customers through e-mails and 
telephone calls, for contract management 
and addressing their issues or concerns. 
Timely meet-ups with existing customers 
were held to discuss the extension of gas 
supply and transmissions contracts

 y Mumbai Zonal: The team undertook 
frequent customer interactions, visits, 
meetings through physical and virtual modes 
and product development trials for polymer 
grades which led to a deep understanding 
of the customers exact requirement and 
therefore high retention of customers

 y Jaipur Zonal: Physical customer visits were 
done as far as possible. Wherever these were 
restricted, phone, WhatsApp and video call 
were used. Jaipur Zonal Office visited many 
major customers and organised interactive 
meets. They also engage with  prospective 
customers in various industrial clusters across 
the state to educate them about the safety 
and usage of natural gas

 y Chandigarh Zonal: Physical customer visits 
were done wherever possible. Additionally, 
online and telephonic interactions with 
customers were undertaken.

16.5 Need Analysis and Impact 
Assessment
We are making deliberate efforts to support 
community development by providing a variety 
of opportunities through targeted and proactive 
projects. These projects are implemented based 
on in-depth assessments with an aim to create a 
valuable impact to the society.

To determine the impact of our projects, we 
conduct surveys and collect feedback and thus 
measure the social impact of our efforts based 
on the feedback we get. We also perform third-
party assessments of our important initiatives to 
ensure their long-term viability.

Our CSR initiatives are in line with our knowledge 
and skills. As a result, we have made some 
remarkable impacts on the beneficiaries’ life.  
We understand that no amount of secondary 
data on a community can fully validate the 
community’s requirements. A mandatory 
preliminary baseline survey/need assessment 
study is usually conducted as a pre-requisite 
for starting any CSR project. We design our CSR 
programmes in line with our CSR policy: GAIL – 
Hriday Corporate with a heart https://gailonline.
com/pdf/CSR/final_policy2010.pdf

Need Analysis:

The GAIL CSR Committee evaluates and approves 
CSR initiatives depending on the needs and 
demands of local communities. The following are 
the steps involved in doing a need analysis:

 y Field assessment by the local CSR team to 
identify the need

 y Requests from communities, local authorities 
and the district administration

 y Needs assessments by third parties

 y International organisations and ministries 
issue reports, publications and surveys

 y Requests received from people representatives 
for their respective constituencies

Impact Assessment:

Funds are made available to undertake impact 
assessments to achieve maximum impact in a 
sustainable and participatory manner. GAIL’s 
CSR section and site coordinators conduct the 
impact assessments in collaboration with various 
agencies and academic institutes.

The impact assessment also includes a SWOT 
(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities for 
Improvement/ Augmentation/ Modification and 
Threats) analysis, which allows the CSR team to 
determine the projects’ viability, sustainability 
and areas for improvement. An external agency 
is also involved in conducting the impact 
assessments. Case studies, success stories and 
inputs from interested parties are also collected 
as part of the impact assessment process. 

Stakeholder perspectives are important to 
us in project planning, design, execution and 
operational planning. While beginning any 
project, we consider addressing the concerns and 
issues of the local communities to be one of our 
top priorities.

During the financial year 2021-22, GAIL has 
conducted third party impact assessment study 
of multiple eligible CSR projects with support of 
Deloitte, KPMG and Institute of Public Enterprises 
(IPE). Our impact assessment study measures 
the stakeholder participation and ensure that 
maximum community people get benefitted 
through our CSR projects. Following are details 
of projects which are covered under impact 
assessment study: 

 y GAIL Arogya – Provision of free basic 
healthcare and primary care services of 56 
MMUs, which covers  43 districts across India

 y GAIL Utkarsh – Provision of specialized 
residential coaching for engineering entrance 
exam for 200 students across Uttarakhand 
and Uttar Pradesh centres

 y Skill development training programmes 
in plastic product manufacturing for

schools

 y Providing skill development training programs 
in hydrocarbon and other allied industries 
through six SDIs under Hydrocarbon Sector Skill 
Council (HSSC), Ministry of Petroleum & Natural 
Gas and Government of India.

16.6 Community Grievance Redressal5

We believe that developing social bonds helps us 

to be more transparent and accountable to each 
other. We make it a point to engage with our 
communities on a regular basis to understand 
their discomfort and provide them with a method 
to voice their concerns, address complaints and 
find solutions to the problems they are facing. 
 For this reason, we have established a grievance 
cell in each of our offices. All complaints are 
collected and stored in a single system and 
each grievance is investigated separately and 
thoroughly with equal importance. Further, 
necessary actions are taken in this regard. 

During the reporting year, GAIL received 
243 complaints from internal and external 
stakeholders and 100% of them being promptly 
resolved.

sites/ pipeline

 y GAIL may look to reduce its direct NG venting

 y GAIL may consider updating its SOP for GHG emissions calculation to incorporate latest emission factors

 y GAIL may consider updating its data collection software, including template for scope 3 data collection

 y GAIL may consider undertaking climate change analysis (scenario analysis) and risk assessment for 
all its sites in line with TCFD

 y GAIL may consider conducting independent research on biodiversity and other related topics 
present in its operational boundaries, including an examination of the species that are on the IUCN 
List and national conservation lists

 y GAIL may consider conducting life cycle assessment (LCA) of all its products to identify environmental 
impact and risks associated with its products

 y GAIL may consider developing a framework for conducting routine and systematic environmental 
and social impact assessments at both the corporate and site levels

 y GAIL may consider developing a standardized manual, for calculations and assumptions regarding 
water balance calculations. In addition, SOPs for monitoring of quality and quantity of recycled 
water can also be developed for all sites
