KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS

WELCOME TO OUR  
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS REPORT
ABOUT OUR THEME
The theme for our 2022 Sustainable Business Report is 

Partnering for Growth: Transforming Lives. Our focus on 

partnership reflects the Kenyan proverb “Sticks in a bundle are 

unbreakable”. In other words, together we are stronger, together 

we can do more to transform lives. Together with our partners, we 

have demonstrated unwavering commitment to this vision and will 

continue to do so.

We continue to partner with others and leverage our connectivity, 

platforms and technology as we work to realise our strategy 

of transforming Safaricom into a purpose-led, technology 

organisation by 2025. In this, we are guided by our priority 

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) as 

outlined throughout this report. 

We aspire to be a digital first, insights-led organisation that 

enables platforms and ecosystem partnerships. We always look 

beyond the expected to deliver the most favourable outcomes for 

all our stakeholders, particularly our customers. In doing so, we 

connect people to people, people to knowledge and people to 

opportunities for growth – today and tomorrow. 

ABOUT THIS REPORT
This 11th Sustainable Business Report sets out to disclose our efforts 

to achieve our goal of transforming lives by partnering for growth. 

We report transparently on our successes and our setbacks, with 

narrative supplemented by four-year graphs and tables to provide 

relevant, material and comparable information. 

We cover highlights, stakeholder issues, how we went beyond 

the expected in FY22, together with our future focus areas, all of 

which are important to our business and of interest to our various 

stakeholders. This report covers our fiscal year from 01 April 2021 

to 31 March 2022. For a more detailed overview of the value 

we add to our stakeholders and our impact on society, this report 

should be read together with the 2022 Safaricom Annual Report 

and Financial Statements.  

OUR REPORTING STANDARDS
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option. Our report 

also serves as our Communication on Progress – an explicit 

responsibility of our continued membership of the UN Global 

Compact (UNGC) and the Global Compact Network Kenya 

(GCNK).

RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR REPORTING 
The Board is responsible for ensuring that sustainability is at the 

heart of our overall business strategy. For more information on 

our governance structure and the responsibilities of the relevant 

governing bodies, please refer to the governance section of the 

2022 Safaricom Annual Report.

On behalf of the Board, we acknowledge that our responsibility is 

to ensure the integrity of this Sustainable Business Report and we 

are confident that it presents the progress we have made towards 

our goal of building a more sustainable future with satisfactory 

accuracy and impartiality.

KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS

MESSAGE FROM OUR  
CHAIRMAN
ACKNOWLEDGING OUR PEOPLE AND 
OUR CEO
The Board is encouraged by the recovery from the COVID-19 

pandemic in the past year and the return to pre-pandemic growth. 

This upward recovery will unlock opportunities, especially for 

micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) who lie at the heart 

of Kenya’s – and Africa’s – economy.

Our strong financial and ESG performance over the last year are 

the result of placing our customers at the heart of our business 

priorities and are due, in no small part, to the commitment 

of our employees, ably led by our Chief Executive Officer, 

Peter Ndegwa. From the time of his appointment, Peter has 

demonstrated that he truly understands the DNA of Safaricom – 

that our purpose is not just about profits and that we are not just 

a utility, but that we are focused on transforming lives.

Under his guidance, we have made significant progress in 

realising our strategy of transitioning from a telco to a technology 

company. We have also demonstrated resilience in living true to 

our commitment of being a sustainable purpose-driven business – 

one which has delivered consistent returns to shareholders. During 

the year, the Board declared an interim dividend of KSh 0.64 

per ordinary share amounting to KSh 25.64 billion. The Board 

recommended to shareholders a final dividend of KSh 0.75 per 

ordinary share amounting to KSh 30.04 billion that was approved 

in the last AGM held in September 2022. 

LIVING UP TO PREVIOUS 
COMMITMENTS
A significant development in FY21 was that we were the first 

operator in East Africa to launch 5G with the aim of empowering 

our customers with super-fast internet at work, at home and on 

the move. 5G can support up to 1 million connected devices 

per square kilometre compared to 4G which can only support 

up to 100 000 connected devices in a similar area. This makes 

5G suitable for providing super-fast internet speeds in high 

density areas and for linking thousands of connected devices in 

a manufacturing environment and supply chain management for 

businesses.

“Our strong financial  
and ESG performance  
over the last year are the 
result of placing our customers 
at the heart of our business 
priorities.”



6 |   SAFARICOM SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS REPORT 2022

KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS

We are confident that we have overcome the regulatory 

challenges and consumer’s suspicions associated with 5G and we 

believe that traction is set to accelerate, positioning us ahead of 

the curve as a company and as a country.  

One of the highlights of FY22 was the announcement at the 

beginning of the year that the consortium led by Safaricom had 

won the bid for a telecommunications operator licence in Ethiopia. 

I am delighted to be able to report progress in this regard:

We have signed a five-year lease agreement with Ethiopian Electric 

Power (EEP), the Ethiopian state-owned power utility company, to 

share fibre optic infrastructure. Under the deal, Safaricom will use 

an existing network of fibre optic ground wire cables along high 

voltage transmission lines – currently standing at 15 000 kilometres 

– owned by EEP. We have also built two data centres, made the 

first test call, sent the first SMS, completed the first data session and 

successfully tested the SIM card registration process.

We remain more committed than ever to establishing a foundation 

for a digital society in Ethiopia and to providing quality, 

competitive technology services across the country. Both the Board 

and I have confidence that getting in on the ground floor will have 

significant benefits for our investors and for Ethiopian society.

CELEBRATING 15 YEARS OF M-PESA
In 2007, we made a significant investment to establish M-PESA 

which today is a household name. At the time, no one thought 

it would be viable but today, I think it’s safe to say, M-PESA has 

revolutionised the financial services sector – particularly for low-

income people living in remote areas. M-PESA has opened new 

avenues for people to interact with financial services, providing 

access to affordable, convenient finance; enabling people to 

make financial transactions remotely; removing the necessity for 

travelling long distances to bank outlets and avoiding the risks of 

transporting physical cash from one place to another. 

That initial investment has continued to show rewards with M-PESA 

revenue growing 30.3 % year-on-year.

We continue to invest in new products and services on M-PESA that 

include savings, wealth management and insurance. At year end, 

downloads for the M-PESA Super App stood at 5.3 million while 

M-PESA Business App downloads were recorded at 462 000.

IMPACTING LIVES THROUGH OUR 
FOUNDATIONS
Our Safaricom and M-PESA Foundations continued their work to 

transform lives, partnering with local and national authorities and 

others to make a tangible difference across all levels of society. 

The Foundations have now impacted over 4.2 million lives over the 

past three years in areas such as education, health and economic 

empowerment. 

While agriculture is integral to the Kenyan economy, productivity 

in the sector is low. Accordingly, we are more determined than 

ever before to play an enabling role in the success of small-scale 

farmers by providing end to end products and services and scaling 

the Digifarm model. Our overarching aim is to have a million 

farmers active on the platform.

LOOKING FORWARD
There are several important local and international events set to 

take place in the year ahead, among these the national 2022 

elections. I am encouraged by the fact that, unlike other years, 

there appears to be no downturn in tourists and no sign of let 

down in economic activity. There could be some tension around 

local issues, but I anticipate legal challenges rather than rigging 

challenges.  

“The Foundations have now 
impacted over 4.2 million lives  
over the past three years in areas 
such as education, health and 
economic empowerment.”

“We have signed a five-year  
lease agreement with Ethiopian 
Electric Power (EEP), the Ethiopian 
state-owned power utility company,

KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS

The Ukraine-Russian crisis was still dragging on at the end of our 

financial year. This has had a major impact on oil supply and 

prices, agricultural commodities and metal prices around the 

world. Spikes in global oil prices have resulted in inflationary 

pressures that are currently being experienced through increased 

food, transport and manufacturing costs – all of which have been 

exacerbated by poor rains in Kenya. Once again, Safaricom has 

stepped in to help. Shortly after year-end we will be launching the 

Pamoja Tuungane initiative to provide a vehicle through which 

Kenyans can support others in areas affected by drought. 

A key event on the international calendar is COP 27 in Egypt – the 

third time this event has taken place on the African continent. The 

frequency and intensity of extreme weather events has increased 

in Kenya over the past decade, with mean surface temperatures 

projected to increase 1°C to 1.5°C by 2030.

While Kenya accounts for a miniscule percentage of global 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the county is working to tackle 

climate hazards head on. The most recently submitted Nationally 

Determined Contribution (NDC) targets commits to abate GHG 

emission by 32% by 2030 relative to the business-as-usual 

scenario of 143 MtCO2e in line with the sustainable agenda and 

national circumstances.

As a responsible corporate citizen and in line with our commitment 

to SDG7: Affordable and Clean Energy, we are determined to 

help drive emissions abatement by increasingly moving to sources 

of green energy and planting five million trees by 2025. 

CONTINUING TO TRANSFORM LIVES 
The digital economy has played and will continue to play a key 

role in overcoming socio-economic challenges by expanding 

regional business networks, making local communities become 

more resilient against economic threats. As outlined in this report, 

Safaricom is helping to accelerating the digital economy not only 

in terms of economic empowerment, but also across areas as 

diverse as agriculture, education and healthcare. 

We recognise that the digital landscape is constantly shifting 

and in response, we are constantly innovating, refining and 

redesigning the digital experience as we work to realise our 

strategy of becoming a technology company by 2025.

This, Safaricom’s 11th Sustainable Business Report articulates how 

we are doing so as we continue to deliver new innovative products 

and services that help to drive inclusive sustainable development 

and transform lives.

8 |   SAFARICOM SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS REPORT 2022

KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS

MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO
TRANSFORMING LIVES IN A 
CHALLENGING YEAR
The year under review was challenging for us as a company and 

a country as we shifted our focus from surviving the COVID-19 

pandemic to co-existing with the disease. Economic growth 

slowed, due in large part to the impact of the war in Ukraine, 

the associated impact on commodity prices and the concomitant 

increase in import costs. In addition, another poor rainy season 

in Kenya hampered crop production, further compounding the 

economic situation. 

Despite these challenges, I am pleased to report a financial year 

of strong performance with significant commercial momentum.

While I am proud of these results, I am even prouder of the 

resilience and commitment our people showed as they upheld the 

four cardinal virtues of the Spirit of Safaricom – namely Customer 

Obsession, purpose, innovation and collaboration. 

Our Foundations, our people and our partners have leveraged 

these virtues to positively impact 4.2 million lives over the last 

three years.

PUTTING OUR CUSTOMERS FIRST 
Our aim is to put our customers at the centre of everything 

we do. This means putting ourselves in the shoes of ordinary 

Kenyans, understanding what they go through and getting 

to know their needs, aspirations and priorities. This 

approach is anchored in our Agile way of working which 

fosters collaboration across the organisation and speeds 

up decision-making, bringing us closer to our customers.

In this way, we enrich our customers’ digital lifestyles 

and deliver a superior customer experience as we 

transition to become a purpose-led technology 

company by 2025. Our focus this year was to 

embed Customer Obsession at the core of our 

culture by delivering superior customer experiences.

LEVERAGING THE INNOVATION 
EMBEDDED IN OUR DNA
Innovation helps us to stay ahead of the ever-changing 

environment and to be more responsive to customers, colleagues 

and community needs. As a sustainable business, we do not 

innovate simply because we have the resources, but because we 

want to combine technology and innovation to transform lives and 

the society in which we live and work.

“I am pleased to report 
a financial year of strong 
performance with significant 
commercial momentum.”



9PARTNERING FOR GROWTH: TRANSFORMING LIVES   |   

KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS

The usefulness of technology does not lie in its uniqueness but in its 

ability to solve a pressing societal problem. While unique is good, 

a functional solution that solves a societal problem is better.

Our telemedicine initiative that targets over 32 000 children in 

Homabay, Samburu, Baringo and Lamu Counties is one example 

of solving a societal issue. It is also an example of the power 

of partnerships. As a technology company, we do not have 

the expertise to overcome healthcare challenges on our own. 

However, working closely in partnership with the national and 

county governments and others, we can scale solutions to support 

access to quality paediatric healthcare and a healthy workforce.

Yet another example is our partnership with Zeraki Learning to 

provide secondary school learners with access to affordable 

education services from well trained teachers leveraging 

informative video lessons on a digital platform. Education is one 

of our priority areas and we will continue to invest in this sector 

through our products, services and Foundations.

We want to continue to play a key role in driving healthcare and 

education inclusion as well as enabling smallholder farmers to 

become wealthier and commercially sustainable.

Innovation can also be leveraged to promote the inclusion of 

unserved markets, as we demonstrated in the reporting year with 

the launch of Halal Pesa, a shari'ah-compliant digital product for 

savings and credit. We saw over two million opt-ins on the product 

in the reporting period.

CELEBRATING LIFE-SAVING FINANCIAL 
SERVICES
The launch of M-PESA ushered in an era of life-changing 

financial services for millions of customers. In 15 years, M-PESA 

has served over 51 million customers in seven countries and has 

grown by 15% in the last five years to become the largest fintech 

platform in Africa. Today, M-PESA has evolved from a simple 

money transfer service to become a robust payment platform and 

driver of financial inclusion for Kenyans. During the reporting 

year, we reached the milestone of 30 million monthly active 

M-PESA customers in Kenya. 

M-PESA is a genius invention. However, I believe we are yet to 

scratch the surface of its potential when leveraged as a platform 

that supports other fintech ideas. The M-PESA super-app which 

we launched in the past year is the start of this. The super app 

enables the use and completion of transactions without bundles 

or even when offline. Customers can download ‘mini-apps’ within 

the app to complete tasks ranging from ticket booking to shopping 

and licence applications. The super app also incorporates 

comprehensive security features. 

The super app won a prestigious Global Mobile Award at the 

Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in the category ‘Best Mobile 

Innovation for Connected Living’.

The award builds on M-PESA’s legacy of consistently delivering 

innovations that meet the needs of our customers in line with our 

purpose of transforming lives. We will maintain this commitment 

into the future to deliver digital financial innovations and enhance 

our customers’ experience as more of our customers move to 

smartphones.

COLLABORATING TO ACCELERATE 
NEW GROWTH AREAS
In October 2020, we rolled out our new corporate strategy, the 

overarching aim of which is to Transform Lives. The third pillar of 

this strategy was based on ‘winning in select digital ecosystems’. 

Based on our view that we have progressed well in achieving this 

pillar, we have now recalibrated this ambition to ‘accelerate new 

growth areas’. 

“We want to continue to play 
a key role in driving healthcare 
and education inclusion as 
well as enabling smallholder 
farmers to become wealthier and 
commercially sustainable.”

“During the reporting year,  
we reached the milestone of  
30 million monthly active M-PESA 
customers in Kenya.”



10 |   SAFARICOM SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS REPORT 2022

KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS

Partnerships are a key strategic enabler underpinning this 

ambition. This is highlighted by our collaboration with the 

Central Bank of Kenya to implement merchant interoperability 

between the various mobile money networks in the country. 

Customers can now pay merchants regardless of which network 

the latter use – a development which benefits both merchants 

and their customers and aligns with yet another of our strategic 

pillars of being a ‘financial services provider’.

Consumers want to be able to shop and pay anywhere, anytime, 

safely and at a low cost while also being able to spend and 

send money internationally as easily as at home. Safaricom 

has already transformed how money moves in Kenya. We are 

excited to be working with Visa to develop new and innovative 

payments products and services that can eliminate barriers to 

global commerce for merchants and consumers in sub-Saharan 

Africa, through Visa’s global footprint. We launched the M-PESA 

GlobalPay Visa Virtual Card in June 2022 to support international 

online payments.

I am optimistic that our strategic partnership with Visa will go a 

long way in opening the global e-commerce market to Kenya's 

significant unbanked and underbanked population. 

In July 2020, we partnered with Google to empower Kenyans to 

acquire smartphones that they can pay-as-they-use. Since then, 

over 600 000 Kenyans have benefitted from our Lipa Mdogo 

Mdogo initiative to enjoy the transformative power of the internet. 

Yet again, this partnership demonstrates our commitment to 

bridging the digital divide and providing our customers with 

relevant solutions that enable them to unlock opportunities.

DECREASING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL 
IMPACT
The world has seen unprecedented climate events in the last few 

years. Climate change is having a growing impact on the African 

continent, hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to 

food insecurity. 

We take our commitment to SDG7: Affordable and Clean Energy 

very seriously and are committed to becoming a net zero emitting 

company by 2050. We are achieving this in several ways which 

include solarising sites, modernising power systems and moving 

away from fossil power. Against the backdrop of rapidly rising 

energy costs, this makes sense from a financial, as well as an 

environmental perspective.

Our view is that environmental sustainability will boost our growth 

in various ways and positively impact our customers and the 

communities in which we operate. 

Environmental consideration is strongly linked to our purpose. 

One of our ongoing priorities is our carbon offset reafforestation 

programme which aims to plant five million trees by 2025. In 

partnership with local communities and Kenya Forest Services, 

we planted 372 000 trees in FY22, bringing the total number of 

trees planted to date to just over one million. The programme is 

transforming lives through income generation, skills and climate 

mitigation.

REACHING OUT TO DROUGHT-
STRICKEN COMMUNITIES
As a purpose-led company, Safaricom cannot thrive when the 

communities around us are in anguish. Kenyans in 23 Arid 

and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) counties are suffering the effects 

of a prolonged drought. Accordingly, we launched the Pamoja 

“I am optimistic that our  
strategic partnership with Visa  
will go a long way in opening  
the global e-commerce market  
to Kenya's significant unbanked  
and underbanked population.”

“Our view is that  
environmental sustainability  
will boost our growth in various 
ways and positively impact our 
customers and the communities  
in which we operate.”

Tuungane campaign which aims to complement the Government 

initiatives in tackling famine by providing emergency food relief 

to Isiolo, Samburu, Marsabit and Turkana Counties. We set aside 

KSh 100 million for relief food to kickstart the campaign and have 

appealed to Kenyans to join us in this initiative. They can do so by 

donating their Bonga points which will then be used to purchase 

food hampers for distribution to the communities hardest hit by 

drought. 

EMPOWERING KENYANS TO DREAM… 
AND DREAM BIG
Under the auspices of the Safaricom Foundation, our Ndoto Zetu 

initiative partners with Kenyans to bring community dreams to life. 

I am inspired and humbled by the dreams Kenyans have for their 

communities. These range from beating stigma around cancer 

to providing equipment to youth clubs and schools enabling the 

differently abled to empowering young farmers, to cite just a 

few. Ndoto Zetu has reached approximately three million people 

over three years, with Phase 3 implemented in the reporting year 

benefitting approximately 1.2 million people.

Sport is another area where we encourage people to dream. Over 

the last 20 years, we have been one of the biggest corporate 

sponsors of sports in Kenya, investing over KSh 1 billion in sports 

ranging from football, athletics, motorsport and rugby to golf and 

charity runs. Our deep involvement has helped us recognise the 

role sports plays in empowering people. 

Against this backdrop, the Safaricom Golf Tour Series that kicked 

off in January 2022, seeks to demystify the game, long seen a 

sport for the elite and to make it accessible for all. The series has 

drawn over 9 000 participants who have participated in various 

tournaments, junior clinics, caddies’ tournaments, and outreach 

programmes dubbed ‘Golf Mtaani’.

Our aim is to inspire ordinary Kenyans to dream big and see that 

anything is possible. 

This aim was given further impetus in the reporting year when we 

added music to Baze, our subscription based mobile-first, video-on-

demand entertainment service. This has enabled Kenyan musicians 

to earn from their talent courtesy of a shared revenue model 

whereby 60% of income accrues to the artist. Baze has now joined 

Skiza Tunes as a key earning platform for content creators. The 

aim is to bring content to Kenyans by Kenyans for Kenyans and for 

creators to monetise their content.

PROGRESSING 5G AND OUR 
ETHIOPIAN EXPANSION
We were gratified by the granting of spectrum by the Kenyan 

Communications Authority to implement a commercial 5G 

network last year. The retail prices of 5G phones are more than 

KSh 100 000, putting them beyond the reach of most Kenyans. 

Until handsets that can receive 5G are at a sufficient scale from 

an individual mobile perspective, there is an insufficient need to 

have lots of sites that offer 5G. Accordingly, we decided to slow 

down the 5G rollout in Kenya and focus on the 4G network. 

However, we know that the 5G network heralds an era of 

intelligent connectivity and will be a key driver of our strategy 

going forward as we work to enable digital lifestyles for all 

Kenyans.

Across our borders, much of our Ethiopian infrastructure is already 

in place, including two data centres and a customer call centre, on 

track for commercial launch in 2022.

We expect to launch a phased national roll-out that will include  

25 sites by April 2023. 

We are excited for the opportunity to work with the people of 

Ethiopia to set up telecom networks to deliver a digital lifestyle, 

increase connectivity, provide best in class telephony services, 

create new digital businesses and generate new jobs. In past years 

in Kenya, we have seen the power of digital transformation and 

its impact on our customers. We believe that by working with all 

stakeholders in Ethiopia, we can deliver a similar transformation 

while achieving a sustainable return to our shareholders.

“Across our borders, much  
of our Ethiopian infrastructure  
is already in place, including two 
data centres and a customer call 
centre, on track for commercial 
launch in 2022.”

As one of the lead companies in the UN Global Compact, we are 

committed to integrating a purpose-based approach to sustainability 

and taking a shared responsibility for achieving a better world.

We continue to integrate nine material SDGs which are directly 

linked to our business growth strategy. Our priority SDGs have

meaningful impact in the communities we serve. Our alignment 

with our priority SDGs is detailed through this report.

OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY
Our strategic focus in FY22 was to establish a Customer 

Obsessed, digital first organisation – delivering double digit 

growth – by the end of FY22, in order to be a purpose-led 

technology company by the end of 2025. 

Given our progress in select digital ecosystems, we have now 

shifted the focus of our third pillar to accelerating new growth 

areas, delivering superior customer experience.

UNPACKING THE TRANSFORMATIVE PILLARS OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY

STRENGTHEN THE CORE

To strengthen the core, expand our existing data and voice 

product portfolio and manage the decline of traditional telco core 

revenue. Personalise offers for our customers and find new use 

cases for existing products under voice and data.

BE A FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDER

Develop and digitise select areas such as health, education and 

agriculture. Expand M-PESA into a global payment platform, going 

beyond borders through M-PESA Africa and move into new areas 

under financial services such as wealth creation and insurance.

ACCELERATE NEW GROWTH AREAS

Leverage our shared value partnerships within the context of 

national and local government priorities to further promote socio-

economic inclusion and address development gaps in agriculture, 

economic empowerment, education and health through our Agile 

methodology which allows quick turnaround and development of 

new products and improvements.

ACHIEVE COST LEADERSHIP

Drive economies of scale to offer our customers value for money 

across all products and services. Accelerate our cost optimisation 

journey to fuel new growth areas through smart procurement, 

digitisation and operating model transformation.

OUR CONTRIBUTION TO 
THE UN SDGS
OUR SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS STRATEGY
We commit to deliver connectivity 

and innovative products and 

services (SDG9) that provide 

unmatched solutions to meet the 

needs of Kenyans by enabling 

access (SDG10) through our 

technologies and partners 

(SDG17) and by exploring 

opportunities in health (SDG3), 

education (SDG4) and energy 

(SDG7). We will do so by 

managing our operations 

responsibly (SDG12) and ethically 

(SDG16). This will stimulate growth 

and generate value (SDG8) for our 

company, society and economy.

In 2016, we began integrating the SDGs into our business strategy. Since 2018, we have 

incorporated our priority SDGs into our performance objectives, both as a company and on 

an individual employee level. Each division is implementing projects or developing products 

and services in line with the SDGs. Reporting on targets related to the SDGs is now 

central to our ways of working, and we seek to empower all those with whom we work – 

employees, partners and other stakeholders – to set their own.

Safaricom management assumes the responsibility of implementing, monitoring and 

reporting on sustainability initiatives through seamless integration of the SDGs into the 

day-to-day operations and functional responsibilities of the business. The Board and 

management teams are further supported by a team of champions, who assist with the 

implementation, monitoring and reporting of SDG-related initiatives in each of the squads 

and teams within our newly implemented Agile working structure.

The four transformational pillars of our corporate strategy support our efforts to embed 

the SDGs into our everyday business activities, priorities and plans. The table alongside 

illustrates this by mapping the SDGs against our material topics.

TRUE VALUE ASSESSMENT
We continuously monitor and measure our contribution to 

Kenyan society. One of the ways in which we do so is by 

assessing our significant value to society. Since 2015, we have 

used a structured impact modelling tool – the KPMG ‘True Value’ 

methodology – to quantify the positive and negative impact of 

our organisation on society, the environment, and the economy in 

monetary terms. The following ‘True Earnings’ bridge highlights 

both our resilience as a business and our strong fundamentals 

by showing that the total value we created for Kenyan society in 

FY22 was KSh 727 billion, 10.4 times greater than the financial 

profit we made during the year. 

We remain committed to our purpose of transforming lives. Our 

latest True Value Report indicates that the true value to Kenyan 

society we created (the cumulative outcome of the economic, 

social, and environmental impacts highlighted on the True 

Earnings bridge) increased by 8% from FY21 to FY22. It also 

indicates that we contributed a total of 5.25% to Kenya’s gross 

domestic product (GDP).

As we continue our journey of becoming a purpose-led technology 

company, we continue to leverage the power of mobile technology 

to deliver shared value propositions that disrupt inefficiencies and 

impact lives positively in the health, agriculture and education 

sectors. The following is an independent analysis of Safaricom’s 

True Earnings by KPMG.

HOW WE ARRIVE AT THESE NUMBERS 
KPMG first performed a True Earnings exercise for Safaricom 

in 2015 to identify our most material socioeconomic and 

environmental impacts and to quantify these in financial terms. 

During that year, Step 1 of the True Value methodology was 

conducted to estimate our True Earnings.  Primary research 

enabled us to complete this exercise and to ascertain the social 

value created by M-PESA, in particular. To quantify this social 

value, principles from the Social Return on Investment (SROI) – an 

open source, principles-based methodology used to account for 

social impact – were used.

More detail regarding the 2014/15 True Earnings exercise can be 

accessed at: https://bit.ly/3SfoBzD

Since 2014/15, Safaricom has used ‘True Earnings’ as a way of 

understanding and expressing the value that we create for society.  

Various assumptions were adjusted to reflect changes in the 

operating context and product offerings. In 2020/21, the primary 

research was reperformed to ensure that the assessment accurately 

incorporates the impacts experienced by Kenyan society. 

Furthermore, the model utilises informed assumptions which are 

based on primary and secondary research. These assumptions are 

interrogated internally and confirmed to be the most appropriate 

within the specific Kenyan context. In future, we will need to 

continue to revise and update the model at specific intervals to 

reflect the changes in our operating context and the evolution of 

our product offerings. 

As climate change is a dynamic field, the KPMG methodology 

of quantifying the impact of environmental externalities such as 

waste, water and carbon emissions was updated for FY21/22.

economy are included, this number increases to over  
1 135 588.

UPDATES TO THE QUANTIFICATION 
OF SAFARICOM’S TRUE VALUE 
ASSESSMENT:

Carbon emissions: The reason for the increase 

in value erosion from carbon emissions is due to 

changes in the social cost of carbon which is set at a 

global standard. As climate change is a fluctuating 

scenario, the social cost of carbon used for True Value 

represents a best practice for quantifying the impact of 

CO2. To illustrate a comparative year-on-year result, 

the  impact of carbon emissions has been adjusted 

from FY19-FY22 (see table 'our True Value' on page 

30)

Water: All businesses consume water, which in many 

regions is an essential, increasingly scarce resource 

and has a social and economic value that exceeds 

the tariff paid for it. The True Value Methodology 

identified the commercial consumption of water as 

having a negative societal impact and analysed water 

consumption against the social cost of water, water 

scarcity and water stress, to quantify the value eroded 

through water consumption. The 2022 quantification 

of Safaricom’s water consumption has been updated 

to represent the social cost of water within Kenya 

based on recent literature.

Waste: Waste disposal has a negative cost to 

society. The quantification of this impact is based on 

the social cost of handling one ton of waste within 

a region. Although recycling allows for waste to be 

reused, there is still a negative cost to society related 

to the production of materials from recycled content. 

By analysing the waste categories applicable within a 

business, the KPMG True Earnings Bridge can quantify 

the value eroded due to waste generation. The 2022 

quantification of Safaricom’s waste consumption has 

been updated to represent the social cost of waste 

within Kenya based on more recent literature.

Definitions

True Value: A three-step methodology 
that enables companies to (i) assess their 
‘true’ earnings including externalities, (ii) 
understand future earnings at risk and (iii) 
develop business cases that create both 
corporate and societal value. 

True Earnings: The first step of the True 
Value methodology, which quantifies and 
monetises a company’s material externalities.  

Total Economic Value: The nature and 
magnitude of the contribution Safaricom 
makes to the Kenyan economy. 

Induced economic impact: Our 
operational and capital expenditure creates 
additional employment and benefits our 
suppliers’ employees.   A proportion of the 
additional income generated in this way 
is spent on the consumption of goods and 
services.  Through linkages and multiplier 
effects, this positively impacts the broader 
economy by stimulating additional demand 
for the products and services produced within 
the economy.

Indirect economic impact: Proposed 
additional direct expenditure also adds 
more widely to economic activity in general 
through the additional inputs purchased from 
suppliers. The businesses impacted along the 
supply chain would then need to increase 
their production and employment, thereby 
also generating increased economic activity 
and employment and in turn stimulating 
additional demand for goods and services 
along their own supply chains and so on.

This chart demonstrates how all factors have contributed towards 

Safaricom’s ‘True Earnings’ for this period. Most noteworthy was 

the growing contribution from social externalities, particularly 

through the social value created by M-PESA which grew and 

evolved. Throughout the period, the greatest contribution to 

‘True Earnings’ came from the economic value created through 

Safaricom’s operations and capital projects, whereas the negative 

environmental externalities, though recognised as a material topic, 

continue to have minimal impact. 

The economic impact made through our operations is the greatest 

contributor to the value we create and has increased by 8.60% 

since FY21. The value created through operational expenditure 

increased by 9% in the year under review, with the value created 

by capital expenditure increasing by 13%. This was anticipated as 

the overall capital expenditure for FY22 increased by 13%.

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE-ADD
The overall negative environmental impact on Safaricom’s ‘True 

Earning’s increased by 25% from FY21. The largest contributor 

to value erosion was due to carbon emissions. This was due to 

infrastructure expansion and increased Scope 3 emissions as 

COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were lifted and business travel 

resumed. To align with best practice, the KPMG True Value 

Assessment also updated the social cost of carbon to reflect the 

latest climate change statistics.

During FY22, we increased the scope of reporting to the regions 

where our regional offices, retail shops and Mobile Switching 

Rooms (MSRs) are located. The KPMG True Value assessment 

further updated financial proxies to align to more a current 

representations of impact assessments related to water in Kenya.

In FY22, we recycled 88.1% of the solid waste collected from 

our own operations, including paper, organic and plastics. Of 

this amount, 11.9% could not be recycled as it included items 

like diapers and face masks which pose threats to health. KPMG 

updated the quantification of waste based on best practice. Waste 

quantifications were based on the social cost of handling one ton 

of waste within a region. Although recycling allows for waste to 

be reused, there is still a negative cost to society related to the 

production of materials from recycled content. 

OUR IMPACT ON SOCIETY
Regrettably, there were two recorded third-party fatalities in FY22. 

Our thoughts and condolences go out to the grieving family and 

friends of the deceased. We had five fewer lost-time injuries as 

compared to last year. 

M-PESA continued to create value for society with a 14% increase 

in societal value Y-o-Y. The KSh 275 billion worth of societal value 

created by M-PESA stems from our constant efforts to increase the 

positive impacts to society of the offering and provide relevant 

solutions to our customers. The social value of M-PESA remains 

a significant creator of value for Kenyan society, increasing by 

14% in FY22. The major drivers of this growth were the increase 

in the numbers of customers and agents, a significant increase in 

the number of merchants, the increase in the average number of 

transactions per customer, as well as the increase in the average 

value of transactions made per customer. The greatest value

continues to be felt by customers, who benefit from their improved 

ability to manage and save money together with lower transaction 

costs and reduced levels of theft, and the wellbeing that comes 

with access to goods, services and opportunities, and increased 

safety as well as security.

We aim to further transform lives by improving the wellbeing 

of our customers, agents, and merchants as the M-PESA service 

evolves over time. 

OUR ECONOMIC VALUE-ADD
The economic impact of the estimated KSh 298 billion in annual 

revenue generated from Safaricom’s operations resulted in an 

estimated KSh 625.9 billion contribution to Kenya’s Gross Domestic 

Product (GDP). This impact can be separated into a direct impact of 

KSh 172.9 billion, an indirect impact of KSh 110.2 billion and an 

induced impact of KSh 342.7 billion.

The total economic impact of Safaricom’s KSh 39.3 billion 

capital expenditure resulted in a total estimated GDP contribution 

of KSh 22.77 billion. This GDP impact can be separated into a 

direct impact of KSh 9.5 billion, an indirect Impact of KSh 3.7 

billion and an induced impact of KSh 9.6 billion.

The ‘Total Economic Value added’ on the Safaricom True Earnings 

Bridge only includes the direct and indirect GDP impact associated 

with Safaricom’s operations and capital expenditure. Each 

year, a portion of the economic value generated by Safaricom 

is lost owing to corruption in Kenya. It is important to note that 

this is not directly connected to Safaricom’s activities, but rather 

acknowledges the unfortunate reality that not all this value is 

retained.

The graph below provides a high-level overview of the annual 

contribution we made to employment. The numbers are derived 

from a Kenya-specific Economic Impact Assessment (EIA) model 

and include direct and indirect contribution to employment, as 

well as the induced wider effects of employment in the economy. 

The positive social impact associated with the direct and indirect 

jobs sustained because of Safaricom has been included in the 

True Earnings bridge. All financial information can be found in the 

2022 Annual Financial Report, including taxes paid and actual 

direct employment. Both capital and operational expenditure 

have been processed via the Kenyan national economic impact 

assessment model, structured to incorporate the economic structure 

of the communications industry according to the Kenyan Social 

Accounting Matrix (SAM).

KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR BUSINESS OUR MATERIAL TOPICS

ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
TRANSPARENCY 
Our robust corporate governance framework ensures accountability 

and transparency, aligning the interests of all stakeholders and 

helping us to transform lives. Our strong governance structures 

include a governance code, an ethical culture and a risk 

management framework underpinned by our ethical practices.

To strengthen our focus on Customer Obsession, we aim to build 

a strong reputation, enhance customer trust and provide 100% 

assurance on all our products, projects and systems to ensure we 

have a simplified, secure customer journey.

We ensure the availability of our systems under our business 

continuity plan and continue to implement robust assurance 

programmes and platforms. Our priorities in terms of governance, 

business ethics and risk in FY22 were to:

• Stay ahead of cyber threats: We build networks and 

infrastructure with security in mind and apply layers of security 

control to all applications and infrastructure. Our Cyber 

Defence Centre, which operates 24/7, reinforces strong cyber 

security controls and next-generation security technologies. In 

addition, we conduct regular reviews of the most significant 

security risks affecting our business and develop strategies to 

detect, prevent and respond to these. 

• Maintain data privacy: Our privacy statement as published 

on our website for our customers and tailored to our investors, 

suppliers and employees on their respective portals, explains 

how we manage privacy at Safaricom and uphold the 

rights of data subjects. Privacy by design is incorporated 

into 100% of our products before roll-out; a dedicated team 

deals exclusively with data protection and there are clear 

communication and complaints channels for customers to 

report any data protection concerns. In addition, we establish 

Data Processing Agreements with key partners who have 

access to any personal information.  In FY22, we conducted 

an online teach and test data privacy training and awareness 

of staff (79%). Other stakeholders in the Safaricom ecosystem 

including suppliers, MPESA agents and dealers, as well as CSP 

partners were also trained on their responsibility to safeguard 

privacy  (100% completed through bulletins, portals and SMS). 

In order to embed a culture of privacy across the business, 

we have trained over 80 Data Protection Champions who 

promote discussions, reinforce guidelines and seek advice 

for their teams from the data protection office, as necessary. 

Benchmarking across the Vodafone Group was conducted 

on data privacy practices to help ensure the maintenance of 

world-class standards.  

• Proactively manage fraud, particularly in the light 

of ever-changing social engineering schemes: We 

continued to conduct training for staff through fraud awareness 

sessions, together with fraud training for our M-PESA agents, 

dealers and suppliers. We also continued to help customers 

safeguard themselves from fraud by educating them on how 

to protect themselves on the network by safeguarding and 

protecting their data and sensitive information. In addition, we 

provided tips on common fraud schemes. We communicated 

through media campaigns on radio, TV and digital channels; 

as well as SMS broadcasts, fraud tips on USSD menus and the 

addition of a fraud awareness page to the corporate website. 

 A highlight in FY22 was the introduction of the *106# service 

which aims to tackle identity theft. The service allows customers 

to confirm their numbers and report unknown numbers. It also 

helps with managing identity theft cases and provides fraud 

tips on one of the sub-menus.  

OPERATING IN A DYNAMIC RISK 
ENVIRONMENT
The environment in which we operate is dynamic. The nature of 

the products and services we provide, particularly mobile money, 

requires that we comply with a wide range of laws and regulations. 

Our risk identification and mitigation processes are designed to 

respond to our ever-changing operating environment proactively. 

We classify our risks as strategic (regulatory, economic, market and 

political) and operational (data privacy and cyber threats).

Our whistleblowing policy 
encourages anonymous and  
open reporting. It also prohibits 
retaliation and protects those making 
reports in good faith or after raising 
an issue on the basis of reasonable 
belief of a violation or unethical 
activity. www.safaricomethicsline.com

Our focus is on identifying and embedding mitigation actions for 

material risks that could impact our current or future performance, 

and/or our reputation. Our approach is holistic and integrated, 

bringing together risk management, internal controls and business 

integrity. This ensures we prioritise risks with the greatest potential 

impact on the business. We regularly review and refresh our 

principal risks, appetite, and approach to risk management. 

Our aim is to ensure that we have taken all reasonable steps to 

mitigate, but not eliminate, our main risks. 

Our framework is a blend of both the ISO 31000 Risk 

Management Standard and COSO (Committee of Sponsoring 

Organizations) Enterprise Risk Management framework. This blend 

allows us to identify, measure, manage and monitor strategic and 

operational risks across the business.

TRAINING OUR PEOPLE AND OUR 
BUSINESS PARTNERS ON ETHICS
Our strong ethical culture creates awareness and understanding 

of the negative impacts of non-compliance, enhances trust and 

creates a sense of accountability and transparency. It also 

empowers staff to address any potential risks in their respective 

roles. We reinforce our culture through ongoing annual ethics 

awareness and employee anti-corruption training programmes.  

An independent ethics perception survey monitors the effectiveness 

of these programmes. 

In FY22, we reached our ethics training target, with 98% of our staff 

covered. The training was conducted via webinars supplemented by 

e-learning for those who did not manage to attend.

As our business partners – suppliers, dealers and M-PESA agents 

– play a key role in upholding our brand and our reputation, we 

continued to promote ethical business practices through ethics 

sessions and fraud training. Topics covered included: ethics 

and risk management best practices, regulatory requirements 

regarding key elements, common fraud types and fraud prevention 

tips, reporting obligations and channels, cyber and information 

security, as well as physical security for businesses.

• Conduct risk assessments twice a year in conjunction with 

business units and other stakeholders.
• Ad-hoc risk assessments in response to a constantly changing 

operating environment.

MEASURE
• Standardised risk measurement process considers the 

probability of occurrence and references risk appetite set by 
the Board.

MANAGE
• Implement the appropriate mitigations and controls to mitigate 

risk and reduce risk likelihood. 
• Test effectiveness of risk controls and oversight across the three 

lines of defence.

OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

OUR HIGHLIGHTS

• Achieved a 98% approval rate of 
business tariffs, promotions, and product 
applications.

• Secured 5G spectrum and an extension 
of the emergency Covid-19 spectrum to 
support post-pandemic recovery.

• Attained 95% Quality of Service 
assessment, surpassing the regulatory 
measure of 80%.

Increasing access 
to information and 
communications technology 
(SDG9) while ensuring 
sustainable consumption 
and production patterns both 
within our own organisation 
and amongst our stakeholders 
(SDG12), are key factors 
in transforming lives. We 
collaborate with regulators 
(SDG16 and SDG17) to 
achieve this. 

AN EVOLVING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
Our regulatory universe helps us to improve compliance monitoring. Our main 

regulator remains the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA). In total we 

engage with ten regulatory bodies (see page 79 of this report) in a constantly 

shifting ecosystem as we expand our products and services to prepare for 5G, 

artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Within this context, we 

are constantly looking for ways to strengthen our engagement with regulators to 

ensure the highest standards of transparency and protection of consumer rights. 

The Regulatory and Public Policy (RPP) team is a department within the Corporate 

Affairs division, comprising six streams: public policy and market, technical 

regulation and infrastructure business, government relations, competition, 

regulatory compliance and interconnect, together with international business.

In the past year there were several key developments in the regulatory space. 

However, through proactive engagement, we maintained our mutually respectful, 

cordial relationship with regulators as we collaborated to connect people and 

facilitate online learning, remote work, e-commerce and financial services. We 

continued to file our quarterly compliance returns with the Communications 

Authority (CA). Our aim, in engaging with regulators on draft regulations, 

guidelines, and bills, is to ensure a positive outlook and favourable consideration 

of our products and services. 

Refer to the accompanying appendix for a view of some of our key sustainability 

reporting standards implemented to guide business and ecosystem operations 

in support of our strategy - "Accelerating new growth areas delivering superior 

customer experience in order to be a purpose led technology company by 2025”.

COOPERATING WITH REGULATORS
In a positive development, we were allocated 60MHz of spectrum in the 

2600MHz band by the CA, which will be used for 5G. This heralds a new era 

for Safaricom as we prepare to roll out this technology for various use cases that 

will benefit our customers.

We worked with the Central Bank of Kenya to implement merchant 

interoperability between the various mobile money networks in the country. 

This means that customers can now pay merchants regardless of which network 

to which they subscribe – a development which benefits both merchants and their 

customers and aligns with one of Safaricom’s strategic pillars of being a ‘financial 

services provider’.



40 |   SAFARICOM SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS REPORT 2022

KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR BUSINESS OUR MATERIAL TOPICS

In 2020, together with other industry members, we collaborated 

on a Tax Study conducted by the GSMA who presented 

the report to National Treasury and engaged with the latter on 

the report’s findings and recommendations. This led to a stay on 

further tax increases in FY21 and FY22. However, in FY23, we 

anticipate the signing into law of the Finance Act, 2022 and this 

could negatively impact digital inclusion and the telecoms sector. 

Kenya's Universal Service Fund (USF) aims to extend 

broadband to underserved areas. The CA has been working 

to close the digital gap between urban and rural areas of the 

country, largely relying on the USF. This supports the updated 

national broadband strategy, which aims to:1

• Make a 10Mb/s service available to all schools, healthcare 

centres and government facilities by the end of 2022.

• Provide a broadband service of at least 3Mb/s to 90% of the 

population by 2023.

• Deliver a 10Mb/s service nationally and a 100Mb/s service to 

80% of the population by 2030.

1  https://www.centralbank.go.ke/uploads/press_releases/1691854698_Press%20Release%20-Mobile%20Money%20Merchant%20Interoperability.pdf

Eleven companies participated in the tendering process. Safaricom 

was one of five companies who tendered successfully and was 

awarded the contract by the CA. We will now be playing a key role 

in rolling out mobile network infrastructure to un-served and under-

served areas in the country under phase 2 of the USF. The tender 

was structured into multiple bidding lots. Companies were either 

awarded tenders for active or passive components and then tasked 

with deploying the infrastructure components within 24 months. We 

were awarded the bulk of the active component tender and have 

been commissioned to provide a minimum of 3G technology.  

Kenya’s national plan of action to tackle Online Child Sexual 

Exploitation and Abuse (OCSEA) is under development by the 

CA and the Ministry of ICT. It aims to guide Government, industry, 

policymakers, civil society organisations and communities to take 

the right measures to ensure the internet is safe for children by 

mitigating the increase of online sexual exploitation and abuse. 

Recognising that this issue impacts 63% of children in Kenya, we 

joined other stakeholders in championing and participating in the 

plan’s development. (See page 75 of this report for details of our 

partnership with UNICEF: Spot it! Stop it!)

Other activities included input into the Central Bank of Kenya 

(Amendment) Bill 2020, which seeks to regulate digital money 

lenders and defines a digital money lender as “an entity that offers 

credit facilities in the form of mobile money lending applications”. 

The final document incorporated our recommendations. 

We also engaged with the Office of the Data Protection 

Commissioner (ODPC) regarding data protection regulations, 

provided input to the proposed amendments to the Kenya 

Information and Communications Act (KICA) regulations 

on electronic signatures and provided feedback on the 
Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) co-regulation 

framework for audio-visual content classification for broadcast 

and over the top (OTT)/video on demand (VOD) services.

Given our emphasis on being a responsible corporate citizen, 

we welcomed the approval of the National Sustainable 

Waste Management Bill 2021 by the National Assembly and 

Senate (expected to be ratified by the President after the end of 

the reporting period). The regulation seeks to address the issue of 

solid waste through the adoption of a waste hierarchy based on 

waste prevention, minimisation, reuse, recycling and composting. 

“Without merchant  
interoperability of mobile  
money services, customers were 
forced to use alternative payment 
methods, including making 
transfers across networks, when 
making payments to merchants 
that are on different networks. This 
new service will further deepen the 
digitalisation of payments to large 
and small businesses using the 
already extensive mobile money 
rails, and therefore enabling 
customers to conveniently make 
payments.”
Central Bank of Kenya1

KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR BUSINESS OUR MATERIAL TOPICS

Dumpsite waste disposal, including residual waste, has been 

capped at 10%. The bill sets out the need for waste to be 

segregated at source and carries fines for non-compliance. We 

also support the new Extended Producer Responsibility 

regulations which mandate all producers (including the 

importers of goods) to establish schemes for all products 

and packaging in all phases of their life cycle to enhance 

environmental sustainability.

To reinforce our focus on Customer Obsession, we engaged the 

Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) who trained our 

staff on consumer protection during the Annual World Consumer 

Rights Day celebrated annually on 15 March. The training 

focused on consumer protection in the digital age through the 

lens of the regulatory expectations of a digital-first technology 

company prioritising the customer. We anticipate that the training 

will reduce consumer complaints and enhance our net promotor 

score (NPS).  

OVERCOMING CHALLENGES
In January 2022, the United States (US) Federal Aviation 

Administration issued a warning that 5G could interfere 

with airline safety. Consequently, the National Environment 

Management Authority (NEMA) solicited comments from the 

Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) on our proposed 5G 

projects. This negatively impacted the timelines for acquisition 

of the 5G rollout licence. We continue to work closely with the 

KCAA to ensure that necessary awareness is created on 5G.

In a move to accelerate the fight against identity theft and 

improve data accuracy, in September 2021 the CA directed the 

country’s mobile operators to ensure that the personal details of 

their subscribers were fully updated in compliance with prevailing 

laws by 15 April 2022. The directive also provided for the 

deactivation of any SIM cards that continued to be non-compliant 

after the deadline. Registration had to be done in person at the 

respective mobile operators’ retail outlets. However, faced with 

long queues at outlets, mobile operators lobbied the CA to allow 

online registration and to extend the deadline by six months. The 

CA granted both requests. Our level of compliance at the end of 

March 2022 was 60%. 

FUTURE FOCUS

• Monitor the Finance Act 2022 – which introduces 
several changes that aim to raise additional revenues 
as well to align tax legislation to government 
development priorities. 

• Attain 100% subscriber verification compliance.

• Realise positive outcomes from the review of the 
KICA regulations, which we see as an opportunity 
to improve on the subscriber registration regulations 
that currently necessitate in-person registration. This 
has continued to be a hindrance, especially in the 
evolution of a digital marketplace where customers 
are increasingly adapting to remote and online 

access to goods and services.

OUR PLATFORMS

Our strong partnership ecosystem 
(SDG17), high levels of connectivity 
and technology, together with our 
innovative products and services 
(SDG9), help us to create and 
strengthen business opportunities 
(SDG8), thereby driving inclusive 
economic development (SDG10).  

IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS’ DATA 
EXPERIENCE
Our networks are critical in enabling stakeholders across Kenya to 

connect and share information seamlessly. The roll out of 5G proved 

to be more challenging and complex than expected, necessitating a 

high level of financial investment, and involving diverse stakeholders 

including government, regulatory authorities, network vendors and device 

manufacturers. While the initiative was hampered by the significant lack 

of 5G devices, we continue to anticipate growing adoption by customers 

across all fields.

Our key focus in FY22 was improving customer data and network 

experiences by increasing radio capacity and network coverage. This 

was achieved by capacity expansion, particularly in the radio network, 

as well as connecting sites to fibre especially in the rural areas. We 

upgraded a total of 1 100 and 1 000 4G and 3G sites respectively and 

rolled out 495 new sites. In addition, we integrated new 4G spectrum 

into 1 800 sites. Core capacity was increased to enable a 60% increase 

in data traffic, while voice-over long-term evolution (VoLTE) capacity was 

enhanced by 80% to cater for five million users. 

Densification of high-rise buildings especially in urban centres has 

resulted in challenges related to indoor coverage. Accordingly, we 

focused on improving indoor coverage particularly in densely built-up 

areas in Nairobi. Our efforts resulted in an improvement in network 

experience at approximately 200 indoor locations – evidenced by 

positive feedback from customers and internal business partners, 

increased traffic of up to 40%, together with both higher revenue 

trends and Net Promoter Scores (NPS).  

As indicated in the table on the following page, the fuel shortages 

experienced at national level impacted backup power supply through 

generators, hence the negative impact noted in the increased Service 

Unavailability Rate (SUR). Network congestion on the radio network 

was a challenge. We are addressing this through the rollout of new 

technology to cater for fixed wireless access and 4G home customers, 

thereby relieving radio capacity on the 4G network for consumer 

customers. On the positive side, data speed increased due to our major 

focus on congestion. 

Safaricom retained the leading position by providing ongoing network 

improvement initiatives including capacity enhancement, network 

optimisation and Customer Obsession.

OUR HIGHLIGHTS

• Launch of the M-PESA super-app.

• Free tariff for interaction between M-PESA  
and banks. 

• Merchant interoperability which allows all 
customers to pay for goods and services at any 
merchant outlet regardless of the network they use.

• Over 500 new sites – mainly 4G – rolled out to 
improve broadband coverage. 

• New 4G spectrum was also integrated in 1 800 
sites to increase radio capacity.

• 100% increase in backbone capacity and 
improved traffic flow within the backbone links.

• Core capacity was increased to handle 60% 
increase in data traffic.

• Improved indoor coverage.

• Rolled out cumulative 10 880 km of fibre. 

• Increased focus on deployment partners led  
to the achievement of all targets.

LOOKING FORWARD
Despite the challenges associated with 5G, we continued to go 

beyond by:

• Deploying the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded SIM 

(eSIM) cards.

• Activating innovative features such as VoLTE and voice over 

broadband (VoBB); VoLTE now has 700 000 daily active users 

accounting for 6% of total voice traffic.

• Focusing on cost reduction and reallocating costs to more 

critical areas. Cost reduction was achieved through contract 

negotiations with our vendors and partners.

• Using data insights to further delight our customers through 

revamped customer experience tools and crowdsourced data 

via Facebook and NetPerform to gather data and understand 

our customers' experiences with our network. This has enabled 

us to anticipate the needs of our customers better.

• Monitoring new services recently rolled out, such as fibre to the 

home and fixed long-term evolution (LTE) fixed wireless (FWA) 

access and migrating FWA customers to 4G time-division 

duplexing (TDD) and 5G networks, thereby freeing up the 

existing 4G radio network to fully cater for mobile consumers 

while the FWA enjoy the superior experience of 4G TDD and 

5G networks. 

• Successfully trialling VoWiFi which enables fibre to the 

customer’s home/building to make voice calls using fixed 

network. Roll out to customers is currently underway.

• Building on the launch of the Mtandao mobile app, which 

empowers Safaricom customers using android devices to 

monitor their network experience easily and conveniently. We 

will achieve this by integrating Mtandao into the MySafaricom 

app as a channel for customers to raise network complaints.

INCREASING OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS
Since 2007, M-PESA has grown to be Kenya's leading household 

mobile money transfer platform, an alternative method to access 

financial services and save (not store), transfer and borrow money 

through their mobile phones. As a result, those who had been 

previously excluded from formal financial activities (for example, 

saving and sending money) have been able to participate actively 

in the financial industry for the past 15 years.

We launched a new M-PESA super app to cater for subscribers’ 

digital lifestyles and empower businesses through the mini apps 

programme (where over 32 mini apps have already been loaded). 

During the reporting period there were over 2.7 million 30-day 

active users with 1.1 million transacting and 249 000 business 

app downloads. Advantages of the super app include:  

• Using and completing transactions without bundles or even 

when offline.

• Downloading ‘mini-apps’ within the app to complete tasks like 

ticket booking, deliveries, shopping, licence applications and 

insurance from businesses, government agencies, utilities and 

other firms. 

• Fingerprint, face unlock, transaction authentication and 

detailed usage statements.

• An M-PESA ‘Send to Many’ option where customers can make 

multiple transactions to different recipients but only need to 

enter their PIN or authentication once. 

• Requesting a specific amount from a friend or family member 

or someone who owes a user money, with the sender only 

needing to confirm the transaction by keying in their PIN.

To drive inclusivity and promote the inclusion of unserved markets, 

we developed Halal Pesa, a shari'ah-compliant digital product 

for savings and credit. There were over two million opt-ins during 

the reporting period.

In line with our focus on expanding our customers’ digital lifestyles, 

we introduced the M-PESA Global Pay Virtual Visa Card 

linked to customers’ M-PESA accounts. The M-PESA GlobalPay 

virtual card enables payments to International online merchants for 

goods and services using the virtual card details. 

M-PESA statements for customers and merchants now have a 

Safaricom e-stamp on every page. This eliminates the need 

for travelling to retail shops to get statements stamped. The service 

incorporates a unique alpha-numeric code at the bottom of every 

page, empowering banks, Savings and Credit Co-operative 

Societies (SACCOs) and financial services institutions (FSIs) to 

confirm the statement's validity.

Fuliza M-PESA is a service that allows M-PESA customers to 

complete their M-PESA transactions when they have insufficient 

funds in their M-PESA accounts. We have opened lines of credit 

by enabling customers to use Fuliza to buy airtime via M-PESA. 

Fuliza M-PESA enabled a total of 1.4 billion transactions  

totalling KSh 502.6 billion in value. 

Our Pochi La Biashara product allows for a second wallet 

attached to small business owners’ M-PESA lines. This enables 

food vendors, small kiosk owners, boda-boda operators, and 

second-hand clothes dealers to receive and separate business 

funds from personal funds on their same M-PESA line. This 

service now has over three million signed-up micro businesses 

with more than 170 000 monthly active users. Revenue 

generated in FY22 was KSh 80 999 088. 

The Business Transacting Till is an extension of the existing 

Lipa na M-PESA Buy Goods Till that enables small business owners 

to collect payments on their till and use this money to make other 

payments directly from their till. Such payments include wages/

salaries, the withdrawal of funds from an M-PESA agent, the sale 

of airtime to customers and the earning of commission without 

needing to go to the bank or phone as was the case with the 

original Buy Goods Till product. During the reporting period, there 

were 169 763 monthly active users and we achieved revenue of 

KSh 827 018 589, with values for these secondary transactions 

growing by 85% year-on-year.

PROMOTING FINANCIAL INCLUSION
As indicated in the table on the following page, M-PESA revenue 

grew because of increased customer uptake of Pochi la Biashara, 

Business Till, increased usage of Fuliza and the roll-out of the 

M-PESA Super App and its continued growth. 

However, M-Shwari revenues declined. This was due mainly to 

increased credit offerings in the market and the conservative bank 

approach to lending due to non-listing of low value loans, based 

on the government directive not to list loans below KSh 3 million.

OUR DIGIFARM PLATFORM
Launched in 2017, DigiFarm, a Safaricom subsidiary, is an 

integrated mobile platform offering digital services targeted at 

farmers who can access advisory services, market linkages, 

inputs, input credits and crop insurance through a basic feature 

phone. Platforms include USSD *944# for farmers, an app and 

WhatsApp4Business for smart phone users, portal for buyers and 

a free call centre 944 for agronomy and vet advice.

Since launch, DigiFarm has registered over 1.4 million registered 

users, of whom 117 000 were active in the reporting year. With 

additional features, it has become a one-stop shop for Kenyan 

farmers.

DigiFarm’s platform model opens the marketplace for farmers to 

access products and services from financial institutions, agri-input 

providers, and other value-added service firms, enabling farmers to 

easily source, transact, learn and grow. 

Over time, additional services have been added onto the platform, 

including the recent introduction of DigiSoko, an open marketplace 

for agricultural produce.

Research has indicated that a few key features of access to credit 

and input that farmers value most include:

• Affordable prices

• Access to credit when it is urgent (cannot afford to miss the 

time window for planting seeds or adding fertilisers)

• Access to quality inputs (better than inputs they get from other 

sources)

• Flexible repayment structure, being able to repay from revenue 

earned from selling farm products via Digifarm

However, there are challenges with the initiative, including the 

need for customised information. While farmers believe insurance 

is important, a lack of knowledge on how DigiFarm insurance 

works undermines its usage. Access to market and limited value 

chains are other areas of concern. In addition, farmers have 

indicated that they would like to sell non-crop products via 

DigiFarm, such as vegetables, dairy products, and livestock.  

Importantly, in-person contact is highly preferred and valued in 

the onboarding process. In addition, follow up is believed to be 

essential for not only addressing technical challenges but also for 

demonstrating a sense of care to users.2

The key overarching challenge is that commercial viability and scale has yet 

to be achieved. Going forward, our corporate social investment strategy will 

focus on addressing this and we are currently assessing ways of overcoming 

issues and challenges. This includes establishing partnerships with others in the 

development field as set out below:

FUTURE FOCUS

• Accelerate cost leadership by negotiating 
better terms firm-wide for purchasing 
equipment for radio, core and transport 
networks.

• Develop in-house capability for 
crowdsourcing that can offer flexibility  
in analysis.

• Address the challenge of indoor coverage 
caused by the densification of high-rise 
building in urban centres.

• Roll out our new technology for FWA 
support and 4G home customers, thereby 
relieving radio capacity on the 4G network 
for our consumer customers.

• Transform M-PESA into an open platform 
where people can innovate and extend its 
capability. 

• Redesign the customer journey to improve 
user experience and awareness of 
the Pochi la Biashara wallet services 
for merchants through customer value 
management (CVM) and targeted 
campaigns.

•   Develop a refreshed healthcare model 
to facilitate ease of access by customers 
from a wide platform of service providers, 
thereby reducing costs and increasing 
access to options for medical services.

• Recertified to ISO 14001:2015  
and ISO 50001.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

We continue our commitment to being 
a net zero emitting company by 2050, 
planting five million trees (SDG7), 
solarisation and modernisation of 
our BTS sites to achieve our NetZero 
ambition (SDG 7) and partnering 
with various stakeholders (SDG17) to 
achieve our environmental goals and 
embed environmental responsibility 
and circularity (SDG12) across the 
value chain.

PRODUCING AND CONSUMING 
RESPONSIBLY
Based on the principle that what is not measured cannot be 

monitored, managed and mitigated, we track our environmental 

performance carefully. The metrics we track include greenhouse 

gas (GHG) emissions; energy efficiency, resource consumption and 

cost; waste and e-waste, together with emissions reduction. We 

make use of environmental impact assessments and audits, together 

with international third-party standards such as the ISO 14001 

environmental and ISO 50001 energy management systems. This 

approach enables us to establish both negative and positive impacts 

and implement mitigation measures where required. It also ensures 

we are producing and consuming responsibly.

In FY22, we achieved ISO14001:2015 (environmental management) 

and ISO 50001: 2018 (energy management) recertification. 

As indicated in the table below, we audited the impact of our network 

through EIAs and EA, completing 31 EAs and undertaking 487 

audits (BTS, offices, data centres and retail outlets). The reduction in 

the number of EIAs and EAs is a result of adopting a leased model 

for Base Transceiver Station (BTS) sites as opposed to the previously 

owned model of operation.

WASTE COLLECTED AND RECYCLED (KG)

Consistent with the principles of the circular economy, we focus on 

reducing, reusing, recycling and repurposing our waste. 

In FY22, we recycled 88.1% of the solid waste collected from our 

own operations, including paper, organic and plastics. Of this 

amount, 11.9% could not be recycled as it included items like 

diapers and face masks which pose threats to health. In a positive 

move, we reduced our use of paper by adopting modern, digitised 

ways of working. This meant shifting from physical paper signoffs 

to electronic signoffs and adopting digital ways of bypassing use 

of paper.

Organic waste increased due to our introduction of a hybrid 

working model. This led to the reopening of the cafeterias which 

had been closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Electronic, or e-waste, is a growing problem around the world. 

Kenya is no exception. It is estimated that Kenya generates an 

average of 3 000 tons of e-waste each year from computers, 

monitors, printers, mobile phones, fridges, batteries and other 

devices.3 E-waste is hazardous because the components used to 

make devices such as laptops, cell phones and televisions, contain 

metals and chemicals known to harm human health.

We collected and safely disposed of 196 tonnes of e-waste 

through the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) 

Centre, the e-waste handler certified by NEMA.

Underscoring our commitment to SDG12: Responsible Consumption 

and Production, resource usage is monitored and managed. 

Fuel usage reduced due to several initiatives including the 

migration of sites to external parties in the build-to-suite business 

model. This model leverages third parties in the maintenance of 

BTSs. Electricity consumption increased as we built more BTS 

sites.

There was an increase in water consumption because we 

increased the scope of reporting to the regions where our regional 

offices, retail shops and Mobile Switching Rooms (MSRs) are 

located during FY22. 

Engaging with our 
stakeholders

In response to stakeholder concern 
about electro-magnetic fields 
(EMFs) and 5G, we conducted 
a nationwide sensitisation 
programme involving workshops 
and the publication of an 
educational booklet. We received 
16 complaints related to EMF which 
we addressed. The workshops, 
which dispelled myths about BTS's 
effects on human health, were 
attended by over 236 residents 
across the Nairobi, Mombasa, 
Kiambu and Kajiado Counties. We 
also revised and enhanced the EMF 
booklet which provides information 
about mobile phone, base stations 
and health. The EMF booklet 
was converted into an industry-
standard booklet incorporating 
knowledge from the CA, NEMA, 
the Kenya Alliance of Residents 
Association, Global System for 
Mobile Communication (GSMA) 
and Strathmore Business School.

PRIORITISING CLIMATE ACTION
Even though Kenya contributes less than 0.1 percent of global 

greenhouse gas (GHG) missions annually, the country is feeling 

the impacts of climate change in the form of drought and shifting 

rainfall. 

The graph below summarises the absolute reductions we need 

to implement to achieve this. These reductions were calculated 

using a compound average growth rate interpolation between 

our 2016/17 baseline year and 2050 according to the United 

Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth 

Assessment Report of the (IPCC AR5) for the Organisation 

for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) region. 

Currently, we are off target by 36%, as we stand at 64 757 tCO2e 

for Scope 1 and 2, against our target of 45 081 tCO2e. Based on 

the existing technology we estimate that we will be able to reduce 

our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 74% by 2050.

We increased our overall emissions by 0.80% from 66 032.7 

tCO2e to 66 562 tCO2e. As indicated in the table alongside, we 

managed to reduce our Scope 1 emissions by 12% through efforts 

with KPLC to ensure stable grid power in our BTSs, MSCs and 

facilities. This has enabled us to use fewer gensets and associated 

fuel. Our Scope 2 emissions increased by 11% due to our shift 

from generator sets (Scope 1) to grid power (Scope 2). While grid 

power is largely based on renewable hydroelectricity, the increase 

was due to infrastructure expansion in the form of BTS sites. Our 

Scope 3 emissions increased by 2% as COVID-19 lockdown 

restrictions were lifted and business travel resumed

To ensure we meet the targets going forward, we are:

• Expanding our renewable energy solutions by implementing 

Energy as a Service (EaaS) and mini-grid programmes 

to stabilise the remote cluster, thereby improving service 

availability and NPS. In addition, we are currently assessing 

an energy services companies (ESCO) model with three 

partners. 

• Transitioning 310 (cumulative total) of our sites to renewable 

and hybrid energy sources. We aim to transition 4 200 sites 

by 2025. Our efforts were delayed by supply chain issues in 

FY22. Macroeconomic developments like COVID-19 and the 

war between Russia and Ukraine led to escalating fuel costs, 

fuel supply shortages and delays in supply chain, all of which 

impacted our planned energy efficiency projects. However, 

the supply chain situation has now been largely resolved and 

we expect to make significant strides in solar installations 

by September 2022. The project has already resulted in 

the reduction of 25% energy consumption per site and the 

reduction of 200 litres of fuel per site, leading to a reduction of 

six tons of annual carbon emissions per site per annum. Other 

benefits include a 20% improvement in network resilience, 

67% reduction in maintenance costs and the switchover of 14 

sites from fossil fuel generators to renewable sources of energy.

• Modernising power systems by replacing lead acid batteries 

with lithium ones (see page 55).

• Increasingly transporting freight via sea rather than air, thereby 

reducing supply chain emissions.

Disclosing our climate impacts through CDP

We disclose our climate impacts 
through the CDP platform, making our 
response publicly available. CDP is a 
global environmental impact non-profit, 
providing a platform for companies, 
cities, states and regions to report 
information on their climate, deforestation 
and water security impacts. Currently, 
over 13 000 of the world’s largest 
companies, representing over 64% of 
global market value, disclose information 
on climate change, deforestation and 
water security through CDP. 

In 2021, we received a score of ‘C’ 
for our climate change submission. 

This is lower than the regional average 
of ‘B’. Our lowest scores were in risk 
management and disclosure, as well as 
energy. We have noted the insights and 
are using them to focus more closely 
on climate-related risk and energy 
usage. We were rated ‘B-‘ for Supplier 
Engagement on Climate-related issues. 
This score accords with the average 
scores for organisations in Africa and 
the rest of the world. Going forward, 
we will continue submitting to the 
CDP and hold ourselves accountable 
as we implement climate actions and 
benchmark with the best in the industry.

Offsetting carbon by planting trees

We are cognisant of the far-reaching 
effects of human activities on climate 
change and the need to plant trees to 
offset our CO2 emissions. Accordingly, 
in 2018 we entered into a partnership 
agreement with the Kenya Forest 
Service (KFS) to implement a tree 
growing and forest conservation 
programme aimed at improving 
Kenya’s forest cover.

The long-term objective of the 
programme is to work in collaboration 
with the KFS and Community Forest 
Associations (CFAs) to plant five million 
indigenous trees in five years, leading 
to the rehabilitation of 5 000 hectares 
of degraded forests.

Between October 2019 and July 2021, 
the three partners worked together 
to plant over 750 000 trees on 750 
hectares of land in three sites – South 
Marmanet in Laikipia County, Kieni 
Forest in Kiambu County, and Kimondi 
in Nandi County. KFS allocated tree 
growing areas in these gazetted forests 
for the Safaricom programme, and 
provided technicalsupport on suitable 
tree species and best planting and 
growing practices. CFAs are involved 
in the establishment of tree nurseries 
and the nurturing of seedlings in 
readinessfor planting. CFAs also 
provide labour for site preparation, 
planting and maintenance that includes 
security to ensure the growth of the 
planted seedlings.

The tree growing programme  
provides both adaptation and 
mitigation benefits. Tree growing 
increases the resilience of Kenya’s 
forests to climate change impacts. In 
addition, forest products can provide 
safety nets to local communities 
when climate change causes crop 
failures. In terms of mitigation, tree 
growing reduces the harmful effects of 
greenhouse gas emissions by creating 
carbon sinks and helps to offset the 
CO2 emissions from Safaricom’s 
operations.

In partnership with local communities 
and the KFS, we planted 372 000 trees 
in FY22, bringing the total number of 
trees planted to date to just over one 
million. We are behind in our planting 
target largely due to the destruction of 
young trees by wildfires and livestock 
as most of the forests are not fenced. 

We are now working with the KFS and 
CFAs to educate and sensitise local 
communities, thereby mitigating these 
challenges.

Connecting community-led 
forestry projects with global 
markets

Despite their strong climate-positive 
impacts, most small projects do not 
attempt to access global climate 
financing markets due to the complexity, 
cost and time involved. Safaricom is 
collaborating with 4R Digital to test a 
new way of overcoming the challenge. 
4R Digital’s Carbon Value Exchange 
(CaVEx) is an innovative digital platform 
that enables carbon offsetting and 
sequestration activities from a wide 
range of micro-small projects in the 
global South to be digitised, tracked 
and sold in voluntary carbon markets. 

Using technology advances in remote 
sensing, device connectivity and digital 
payments, the platform will increase 
diversity of choice for carbon buyers 
and enable micro-small projects to be 
rewarded for undertaking clean activity 
in a digital, and highly transparent 
manner. 

To participate in CaVEx, carbon 
reduction/removal forestry projects 
must follow strict data protocols specific 
to their use case, approved by an 
external auditor. Only when protocol 
requirements are fulfilled, and data is 
flowing from remotely sensed devices 
into the CaVEx platform, can the 
project start generating carbon credits. 
The carbon credits created follow all 
relevant ISO standards (14060-series) 
and AI-enhanced data screening ensure 
validity. This data-centric approach 
lowers costs and includes smaller 
projects to the market.

EXPANDING OUR USE OF CLEAN 
ENERGY 
Energy security and availability, together with the cost of 

energy, are critical for our platforms. In an increasingly 

carbon-constrained world, expanding clean energy usage is 

key to playing our role in mitigating climate change. We made 

several positive moves to enhance security and availability, 

reduce carbon emissions and bring down costs by:

• Increasing the percentage of base stations connected to the 

KPLC grid, capping diesel purchases and expanding our 

use of solar. 

• Modernising our battery storage system and increasing 

energy efficiency by replacing over 500 lead acid storage 

banks with hybrid lithium solutions which charge faster 

and discharge over a longer period. This has enabled us 

to reduce diesel consumption by between 40 – 50% in the 

completed sites.

• Increasing power resiliency in 20 data centres / MSRs and 

over 6 000 access sites by installing air conditioner fan 

boosters, reducing temperatures by as much as 5o C and 

deploying smart power solutions and deep battery cycling.

• Piloting a radio access intelligent shutdown system based 

on machine learning that helps to ensure idle cells /layers 

are shutdown while maintaining stability and saving 

energy. We worked with two third-party service providers 

to demonstrate proof of concept, in one instance, we 

achieved 20% energy savings across 36 sites and savings 

of 16% in the other. 

• Automating energy reports by leveraging the Microsoft 

Power BI application – this level of oversight enables us to 

respond quickly to any outages.

• Deploying data centre infrastructure management (DCIM) 

tools in two data centres to monitor, measure, manage and 

control energy consumption of all IT-related equipment and 

facility infrastructure components and give a consolidated, 

remote view in real-time.

• Establishing Power Purchase Agreements and Independent 

Power Product partnerships with three different parties, two 

of whom we are currently onboarding. We are working 

with these companies to develop renewable energy for the 

sites, thereby enabling a move away from fossil-based fuel 

and grid power.

that enable the broader strategies for these ecosystems and deliver sustainable 

mobile technology innovations.

While our aim is to solve societal issues, we are always mindful that our solutions 

need to be commercially viable. Accordingly, we leverage digital marketing tools to 

reduce the cost of go-to-market activations.

PARTNERING IN HEALTH SOLUTIONS
The Kenyan Government’s Primary Care Strategic Framework 2019-2024 prioritises 

community-based primary health care. We have aligned with this vision through the 

following initiatives:

• Medical records portability and enabling the health ecosystem during COVID-19 

was a key interest area. This led us to develop Afya Moja, a medical records 

health portability platform, in a consortium partnership (with Savannah 

Informatics Ltd, Intellisoft Consulting Ltd). The service provides a continuum of 

care by creating the ability for patients to coordinate care across various health 

service providers. Afya Moja is a simple, mobile-based digital health passport 

that receives and securely stores patient information. The system allows users 

to access a copy of their own health data and share it with trusted healthcare 

providers. Doctors, upon consent, can act on the data and respond to patient 

needs. A total of 3 627 patients and 109 practitioners signed up during the pilot 

phase.

• We piloted an AI symptom checker and telehealth service known as ‘Byon8’ in 

partnership with BYON8 AB. The service seeks to make high-quality healthcare 

more accessible, affordable and equal by digitalising healthcare on an 

individual level. There were over 60 consultations and over 10 000 downloads 

in the pilot period.

• Building on experience gained through the provision of the COVID-19 helpline, 

we supported the 1195 gender-based violence (GBV) hotline by 

providing airtime for tele-counsellors to provide psychosocial support for GBV 

victims/survivors.

We transform lives 
particularly in terms of 
healthcare (SDG3) and 
education (SDG 4). To do 
so, we co-create innovative 
solutions (SDG 9) by 
leveraging our expertise, 
technology, and partnerships 
(SDG17). 

OUR HIGHLIGHTS

• Launched the ‘One Health’ Afya  
Moja initiative.

• Zeraki Learning launched to 
complement Shupavu 291.

• Piloted ‘Byon8’ an AI symptom checker 
and telehealth service in partnership 
with BYON8 AB.

• Partnered with World Vision to enable 
fundraising of their Angaza programme 
through Bonga points.

• Increased the number of connected 
schools in the Last Mile Connectivity 
Project for primary schools which 
accelerates digital learning. 

• Leveraged Agile methodology to deliver 
on our mandate.

• There are enough ambulances to service Kenyan citizens, but 

the challenge is that there are sometimes too many in one area 

and too few in another. In other words, it’s all about logistics. 

Accordingly, we have begun the development process of an 

ambulance aggregator initiative. This consolidates all 

available emergency responders into a single map, letting 

dispatchers instantly find the best and closest provider as 

well as track all rescues in real time. The research phase 

for the project is now complete, the business case has been 

established, we have identified a partner and are testing the 

product.

• In partnership with the M-PESA Foundation, Gertrude’s 

Children’s Hospital and the County Governments of Samburu, 

Baringo, Lamu and Homabay, we launched the Daktari 

Smart telemedicine programme. Daktari Smart is a kit 

comprising electronic medical devices which monitor patients’ 

vital signs and enable remote consultation.

• We established a partnership with the Kenyan 

Healthcare Federation (KHF) and the Ministry of 

Agriculture (MoA). The Federation’s vision is to create 

an enabling environment that supports quality, affordable 

healthcare for all, while the Ministry of Agriculture is focused 

on food security. The KHF and MoA continuously engage the 

Government of Kenya and government agencies on issues 

relating to health policy, taxes, regulations and pricing. 

The membership has enabled us to contribute to the Public-

Partnership Agenda through its projects and partnerships in 

healthcare.

PARTNERING IN EDUCATION
Kenya provides education services for over 16 million children 

and youth, with almost 500 000 teachers distributed in close to 

90 000 schools. The country is generally acknowledged to have 

a high standard of education. Nevertheless, there are challenges, 

which we address in the following ways:

• Ask A Mentor, which was designed to complement Shupavu 

291, resulted in at least tripling of the utilisation of the latter. 

We closed the pilot and are leveraging the lessons learnt to 

scale other education products.

• Under the Last Mile Connectivity Project for primary 

schools which aims to accelerate digital learning, we increased 

the number of connected schools from 70 to 88.

• We partnered with Zeraki Learning to provide secondary 

school learners with access to affordable education services 

from well trained teachers leveraging informative video lessons. 

This digital platform, which complements Shupavu 291, seeks to 

provide topic-by-topic assessments and powerful metrics to help 

students diagnose their weaknesses and track their progress.  

A touchpoint within our data services USSD platform, 

*544*14# will enable students, parents, teachers, or guardians 

to subscribe to the service for as low as KSh 20 a day. The 

amount can be deducted from customers’ airtime. Approximately 

150 000 learners have downloaded the Zeraki Learning app.

“Our investments in education,  
both from a solutions and 
philanthropic perspective, are 
geared towards addressing 
current gaps and boosting youth 
employability. Through the 
partnership with Zeraki Learning 
we want to ensure that the platform 
makes digital education accessible 
and affordable. For parents, Zeraki 
gives them access to their child’s 
academic record which they can use 
to support their decisions.”
Peter Ndegwa, CEO: Safaricom  

“We are glad to be able to  
extend our services to Safaricom 
customers in a bid to make learning 
accessible to students from all 
backgrounds. By leveraging on 
Safaricom’s technology and platform 
and pairing it with our services, 
we will provide a solution that we 
hope will have a positive impact in 
Kenya.” 
Isaac Nyangolo, CEO: Zeraki Learning

PARTNERING IN HUMANITARIAN AID
We leveraged our shared value partnerships to deliver 

products and initiatives that were geared towards supporting 

social protection programmes and mitigating disasters:

• In partnership with the Kenya Red Cross, we sent out over 

9.7 million messages to alert citizens in various counties on 

heavy rainfall, indicating where to access assistance.

• We partnered with World Vision to enable fundraising 

of their Angaza programme which supports children and 

families in the Salgaa community through Bonga points.  

• Under our strategic partnership with UNICEF, we have 

cross-pollinated various initiatives. The partnership aims to 

bring together UNICEF’s technical expertise and advocacy 

work with Safaricom’s range of products, services and its 

ability to communicate with large audiences. Specifically, 

the partnership aims to: 

- Ensure children receive access to quality education

- Protect children, especially the poorest and most 

marginalised from violence and abuse. (See page 75 

of this report for further details).

- Help children and families receive assistance during 

emergencies such as droughts, floods and disease 

outbreaks. 

In addition, by leveraging Safaricom’s technological capability 

to reach many people, the partnership sent out 849 698 SMSes 

reaching over 88 000 young people. The SMSes covered 

topics like climate change, school connectivity, health insurance, 

social protection and violence against children. 

PARTNERING IN IOT AND ICT
Our aim is to become the leading IoT and ICT solutions 

provider in Kenya. Creating a dedicated IoT and ICT tribe with 

two commercial lead roles for IoT and ICT is helping us build 

the right organisation and drive transformation from product 

sales to insight-led solutions. In terms of IoT, we developed four 

enterprise-to-enterprise (E2E) solutions for telematics, water 

and cold chains through various partnerships. For ICT, we 

successfully recruited four global security partners and closed 

agreements with key global partners for Cloud (Amazon Web 

Services, Google, Microsoft, Huawei).

CONSUMER CUSTOMERS 
GROWING OUR CUSTOMER BASE

Our move to Agile methodology, the establishment of tribes within the consumer 

team and consumer offerings based on individual usage all had a positive 

impact in the year under review. This was reflected in the increase in the active 

customer base to 32.8 million, as well in growth in terms of digitising our 

customers as indicated in the table on the next page. 

Growth in mobile data revenue increased from KSh 44.8 billion in FY21 to  

 KSh 48.4 billion – good performance in a year in which consumers faced 

economic pressure generated by the challenges of COVID-19 and escalating 

food costs. Additionally, our total market share increased to 65.3%.

We connected 16 226 homes and noted six million customers daily engaging 

on the reverse call service. Under Storo Bonus, a popular service that rewards all 

pre-paid customers for their loyalty, we engaged two million customers daily.

To drive Customer Obsession further, we implemented a unified Customer 

Value Management (CVM) platform –  UNICA – which uses machine learning 

to give customers personalised offers based on real-time resources available 

in their mobile wallets. These offers were based on individuals’ usage pattern 

and capability and aimed to cushion them from the harsh economic realities 

experienced in FY22.

ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS
We categorise our enterprise customers into three main groups: 

Large Enterprises (LEs) – more than 50 employees; Small-to-

Medium Enterprises (SMEs) – between 10 and 50 employees and 

Small Offices-Home Offices (SOHO) – less than 10 employees. 

Our target was to grow our SOHO number customers by 92% 

in the reporting period and that target was met as indicated in 

the table below. Revenue for SME, SOHO and large enterprise 

customers increased significantly.

Our adoption of Agile methodology has led to the creation of 

cross-functional tribes to lead product and go-to-market solutions 

which has enhanced product and services delivery.

GROWING OUR ICT PROPOSITIONS

We grew our ICT propositions around security services (cyber 

security, video management and storage), digital transformation, 

interactions and cloud services. We also launched cyber security 

customer and cloud services, with 220 customers onboarded. 

One of our most successful initiatives in the year under review was 

the Cloud migration of AAR Insurance company to the Amazon 

Web Services Cloud, resulting in 99.99% availability. Our video 

management system platform that enables our customers to store 

their recorded video surveillance footage in the Cloud, thereby 

reducing the risk of tampering or erasure was equally successful. 

We have 59 cameras onboarded actively storing this footage on 

the Cloud.

In addition, we implemented several telematic solutions with White 

Label GPS software, including cold chain with Vodafone Innovus, 

LPG with IoT.NxT and Smart Water with Earth-view. We also 

completed phase 1 of the SME digital hub DIY customer discovery 

portal fully optimised for a mobile experience.

RESPONDING TO OUR CUSTOMERS’ NEEDS

We enhanced the digital customer experience for interacting 

with our products and support. We focused on digital self-service 

channels for SMEs and SOHOs as they, unlike our LE customers, 

do not have the benefit of an account manager and a named 

support engineer. 

Recognising that customers need accurate and easy to understand 

bills delivered on time, we focused on enhancing billing 

transparency in line with our Customer Obsession strategy. 

Customers are looking for internet reliability (fibre and wireless) 

which we have achieved by building the resilience of our network 

to ensure that we have redundancy. We also worked with local/

government areas to proactively move fibre cables from road or 

water construction areas to avoid fibre cuts and ensure power 

back-up across all our sites during main power downtimes. 

To ensure customer access to support and quick resolution of 

issues, we upskilled our support teams and expanded self-service 

options through USSD, web and app. Value for money is another 

key customer issue. Accordingly, we rationalised prices across key 

products to ensure that they meet customers’ needs. We have also 

crafted solutions that address specific segments instead of a one-

size-fits-all. For example, we developed voice and data products 

that address the communication needs of SOHO and some SME 

customers. We achieved this by providing a solution that allows 

the small business owner to buy and manage affordable voice 

and data bundles on behalf of their staff. We also addressed 

connectivity needs by introducing a 3Mbps fixed data proposition 

for SOHO customers.

We provide support through dedicated queues for fixed data, 

merchants, and mobile voice/data. This means that our customers 

receive 24*7*365 round-the-clock access to support. We leverage 



66 |   SAFARICOM SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS REPORT 2022

KPI SUMMARYOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS OUR STAKEHOLDERS

key insights based on customer feedback from these channels to 

help drive our improvement initiatives. In the reporting year, these 

included:

• The revision of criteria for building acquisitions

• We realised that many newly onboarded customers were 

churning after the first month because they did not understand 

the bill and did not clearly understand the escalation matrix. 

Accordingly, we introduced a FTTB (Fibre to the Business) 

‘kindergarten’ programme which included SMS communication 

and calls to customers from our telesales teams. This was 

very successful, with churn in the first month reducing from an 

average of 26% to 13%. 

• We worked with various government departments to send 

out SMS messages which publicised the available M-PESA 

payment options for the various services provided by 

Government on the E-Citizen platform. 

• Together with other stakeholders we established and managed 

a platform which enables customers to book and pay for 

their SGR (Standard Gauge Railway) railway services tickets 

through M-PESA.

Brand Consideration 63 70 81 80

Understanding the extent to which we are delighting our customers 

underpins our Customer Obsession journey. Accordingly, 

we continue to use the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Brand 

Consideration (BC) scores to monitor customer satisfaction. Our 

ambition is to be number one in NPS in our peer group. NPS 

measures the likelihood that a customer would recommend 

Safaricom to other customers, family or friends, based on their 

overall experience. BC measures the likelihood that a customer 

will purchase a particular brand based on their perceptions of that 

brand. Both NPS and BC are primarily determined using customer 

surveys.

Safaricom brand love and brand power grew notably in the 

past year (Q4’21 vs Q4’22). The growth in these metrics is 

attributable to sustained, diverse brand building activities which 

addressed customer pain-points. Network, mobile money and data 

packs together with offers and promotions were the underlying 

perceptions driving these improvements.

BC and value remained stable during this period, as our peers’ 

scores declined due to market factors such as increased excise 

duty which led to upward price adjustments across providers. 

Customers are cognisant that Safaricom services are priced higher 

than other players, but highlight quality of network (availability, 

reliability and speed) as a key reason they feel our services are 

value for money.

ENGAGING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS

ZURI is now available on Messenger, Web, Telegram and

attributable to the expansion of self-service options to address 

key demand areas, migration to AWS to support scalability and

efficiency and ensuring faster turnaround.

• Grow our digital engagement with our customers 
by providing a full end-to-end self- service option.

• Ensure that our platform strategy for IoT and ICT 
can meet customer needs in various sectors of 
the economy to become the trusted partner on 
technology, financial services and connectivity for 
enterprise.

• Become a platform of choice for SMEs and 
be the digital transformation partner of choice 
for enterprise customers through provision of 
professional services and managed services.

• Position the public sector unit as the trusted 
partner of choice for technology, digital literacy 
and financial services for Government ministries, 
departments and agencies, counties and NGOs.

OUR HIGHLIGHTS

• Accelerated Learning Programme benefitted  
over 25 271 learners.

• 2 050 youth received digital skills training through 
the Wezesha initiative.

• Supported 412 initiatives across 47 counties through 
the Ndoto Zetu Phase 3 initiative, benefiting over 
1.2 million people.

• Expanded our telemedicine initiative.

ISSUES FOR SOCIETY

• Ongoing negative impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

• Drought in certain parts of Kenya, rising cost of 
living.

We have co-created several strategic 
programmes with various partners 
(SDG17) including maternal, neonatal 
and child health programmes (SDG3); 
as well as child and online safety 
(SDG3) and educational and training 
initiatives targeting all levels of society 
(SDGs 4, 8 and 10).

SOCIETY
UNDERSTANDING AND RESPONDING 
TO NEEDS
Kenya’s country blueprint development programme, Vision 2030, 

aims to transform the country into an industrialised, middle-income 

country providing a high quality of life and a clean and secure 

environment for all its citizens. This vision underpins our work to 

transform lives. Our corporate social investment programmes aim to 

transform lives. We work to achieve this through our Safaricom and 

M-PESA Foundation programmes which are aligned with our priority 

SDGs and focused on key themes: health, education and economic 

empowerment. Our collaboration with various partners, including 

county and national government informs this work. We engage 

formally and informally with all levels of society, particularly the most 

marginalised, to understand and respond to their needs.

Engagement also informs the Foundations’ ongoing assessment 

of the effectiveness of social impact initiatives, generally by using 

third-party evaluators. Gaps identified and key learnings are then 

used to improve on the design and implementation, as well as the 

scale and sustainability of subsequent initiatives. In broad terms, 

some of the lessons we have learnt include the need to bring other 

funding partners on board to scale initiatives; ensuring government’s 

ownership to promote sustainability and increasing investment in the 

Ndoto Zetu initiative which has proven to yield immediate, direct 

changes in people’s lives.

Funds are disbursed according to the regions mapped in terms 

of Safaricom’s trading zones. Our employees play a key role in 

engaging with the communities to prioritise needs. They make 

recommendations related to each region’s community needs and 

to our strategic themes. They also act as change champions, 

monitoring the progress of the projects during their day-to-day 

interactions. 

Initiatives under these themes are set out on the following pages.

#MyLittleBigThing

Inspired by Nobel laureate, the late 
Wangari Maathai’s ‘Little Thing’ of 
planting trees, #MyLittleBigThing is an 
initiative by MK-Africa, a woman-owned 
SME based in Nairobi, Kenya. MK-Africa 
trains, mentors, and supports young 
people through #MyLittleBigThing’s 
partnerships with Safaricom, the 
Cambridge Institute for Sustainability 
Leadership, PKF, South African Airways, 
and Crew 2030, innovating and 
establishing social enterprises based 
on the SDGs and sustainable business 
practices.

Safaricom has invested approximately 
KSh 3 million in #MyLittleBigThing since 
2017, further championing the SDG 
agenda.

The partnership has contributed to  
the development of innovative ideas  
around the relevant SDGs and the 
setting up of SDG clubs in Kenyatta 
University, Jomo Kenyatta University of 
Agriculture and Technology, University 
of Nairobi, Moi University, Catholic 
University of Eastern Africa, Jaramogi 
Oginga Odinga University and 
University of Eldoret. 

In 2021, #MyLittleBigThing held a 
competition, the winner of which was 
Pine Kazi, an eco-friendly Kenyan fashion 
company established in 2019 with an 
aim of making the fashion industry 
greener. Pine Kazi recycles pineapple 
post-harvest waste into a sustainable 
pineapple textile which is further used 
to craft a range of eco-friendly fashion 
products like shoes and bags.

EDUCATION
According to the World Bank, education expenditure in Kenya 

has reached international benchmarks, both as a share of total 

government expenditure and as a share of GDP.  

However, the pupil-to-teacher ratio remains at an average of 56 to 

1, in some counties as high as 77 to 1 and there is a low rate of 

transition from secondary to tertiary institutions. 

We work to redress this balance through several key initiatives. 

• The aim of the Accelerated Learning Programme (ALP), 

implemented together with our partners, was to improve the 

learning outcomes (numeracy and literacy competency) for 

learners lagging in these skills. The programme aimed to 

support learners to read with comprehension and be able 

to reason with numbers. The initiative focused on schools 

in Bungoma, Turkana and Tana River counties, which had 

been ranked as counties lagging in matters of learning. 

Implementation at the county level was through local 

organisations, with a programme support team overseeing 

implementation. By the time the grant ended in April 2022, the 

programme had benefitted 25 271 children whose learning 

outcomes had improved. 

• The Safaricom Foundation Scholarship (SFS) 

Programme is a Technical Vocational Education and 

Training (TVET) programme implemented together with our 

partners and the Ministry of Education. 

 SFS seeks to contribute significantly to Kenya’s economy 

by injecting skilled human resources in the hospitality and 

construction industries through providing training scholarships 

for at least 1 000 needy and vulnerable youth across Kenya. 

In FY22 we exceeded this goal, providing 1 027 scholarships. 

The programme’s aim is that at least 60% of the beneficiaries 

should be young women from needy backgrounds and at 

least 5% of the trainees should be Persons with Disabilities 

(PwDs). By December 2021, the programme had enrolled 820 

trainees in two cohorts. During the year, we also implemented 

quarterly capacity enhancement workshops and meetings for 

the managers of Vocational Training Centres.

 A key learning from the programme was that PwDs require 

additional support to transition from one term to the next. They 

also needed support in taking up opportunities in industry. 

More importantly, because of the stigma and/or related 

‘challenges’ of accommodating employees with disability, 

the best transition path for PwD beneficiaries is to link them to 

entrepreneurship opportunities. The Zizi Afrique Foundation 

(ZAF) has collaborated with the Kenya Institute of Special 

Education (KISE) to run a programme to link PwDs with 

procurement opportunities through the Access to Government 

Procurement Opportunities (AGPO) Policy.

• SFS also participated in and sponsored certain aspects 

of the Hands on the Future Skills Show run by the 

Permanent Working Group on TVET, in collaboration with 

the State Department of Technical and Vocational Training of 

the Ministry of Education and the TVET authority. The event 

showcased Kenya’s technical and vocational education and 

training institutions. It also highlighted the entrepreneurship and 

life skills training opportunities for youth to help guide them to 

the world of work through the appropriate skills. 

• The Digital Skills Programme Improving Teacher 

Competences for Improved Education Outcomes 

in Kenya is managed in partnership with the Ministry of 

Education, Teachers Service Commission (TSC) and the 

Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology Education in 

Africa (CEMASTEA). The programme is aimed at overcoming 

the challenges of inadequate digital skills for teachers and 

insufficient digital structures in teacher training colleges which 

lead to poor education outcomes. Targeting new teacher 

graduates and their tutors in all public primary and secondary 

training colleges in Kenya (35), the programme seeks to 

ensure that 75% of new teacher graduates and all tutors have 

the digital skills that enable them to complement learning in 

primary and secondary schools in Kenya, thereby improving 

educational outcomes.

• The Safaricom Foundation supported the African Braille 

Centre (ABC) which distributed braille, audio materials 

and assistive devices to schools targeting learners with visual 

impairment. The beneficiaries in this project were 2 648 visually 

impaired learners, with the number of indirect beneficiaries 

(parents/guardians, siblings, caregivers etc) estimated at  

28 422.

HEALTH
There are three main delays to healthcare – seeking, reaching 

and accessing care. To help overcome these challenges, we 

are aligned with key national Government initiatives including 

the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF), Universal Health 

Coverage (UHC) and Linda Mama (free health insurance for 

pregnant women). Given that healthcare is devolved, we also 

work closely with county governments. In terms of government 

initiatives, our aim is to ensure the ultimate beneficiaries are linked 

to these schemes to enhance sustainability.

• Non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension and 

others are on the rise in Kenya. According to the Ministry 

of Health, NCD-related deaths have risen from 27% in 

2014 to 39% in 2021. The Safaricom Foundation’s Non-

Communicable Diseases Programme initiative in 

Garissa County promotes early detection for diabetes and its 

complications for children. This is achieved through awareness 

creation and sensitisation of health workers, improved 

comprehensive diabetes care for children and young adults, 

as well as strengthening of the healthcare system through the 

provision of medicine and equipment. To date, 435 children 

have benefitted. 

• Shortly after the reporting period, the Safaricom Foundation 

donated a water ambulance to King Fahad Referral 

Hospital in Lamu County to help respond to medical 

emergencies. The ambulance will link over 150 000 people 

from sub-county hospitals, dispensaries and other health centres 

to referral services at the hospital. The ambulance, which uses 

a toll-free number for emergency services, is also fitted with 

emergency equipment to treat patients needing critical care 

and is estimated to be able to conduct 50 referrals a month. 

• The Usamaria initiative provides medical funding, with 

each case reviewed by the Usamaria committee. The Usamaria 

Committee is mandated by the Safaricom Foundation to 

consider and support medical assistance cases from the less 

fortunate in the society. The Committee reviews and approves 

medical support requests; monitoring and reporting on the 

outcomes of the funding/support. 

• In sub-Saharan Africa, the average for female genital fistulas 

is one to two for every 1 000 deliveries, where the woman 

survives. Approximately 4 000 – 5 000 new obstetric 

fistulas occur in East Africa annually. Targeting women and 

girls in five counties, the Female Genital Fistula (FGF) 

programme:

- Operated on 180 women with FGF at five hospitals over 

one year

- Trained four local specialists on FGF-repair through the FGF 

camps held in these hospitals. 

- Conducted on-the-job training for local doctors, clinical 

officers and nurses in pre- and post-operative care and 

follow up of patients with FGF

- Raised awareness about the FGF problem and mobilised 

women with FGF to come forward for surgery through talk 

shows and seminars/ workshops

- Sensitised health workers, organised groups, government 

and NGOs on the prevention of FGF 

- Analysed post-operative outcomes and shared lessons 

learnt

- Documented risk factors and regional prevalence and 

incidence variation.

• The Uzazi Salama (‘Safe parenting’) initiative aims to 

strengthen the county’s health systems to support the delivery of 

quality reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent 

healthcare. In November 2021, the M-PESA Foundation in 

partnership with other stakeholders including the Homabay 

County government, Amref Health Africa, Action-aid, 

PharmAccess and Pathfinder launched the project in HomaBay 

County. Homabay was targeted as it is one of 15 counties 

in Kenya with poor maternal, child and adolescent health 

indicators. 

• In partnership with Gertrude’s Children Hospital, the M-PESA 

Foundation also launched the Daktari Smart telemedicine 

programme. This is part of a larger telemedicine initiative that 

targets over 32 000 children in four counties. To improve 

maternal health services, the Foundation equipped the 

hospitals with delivery and post-natal rooms with a capacity of 

eight beds, as well as a consultation room. Other equipment 

included wheelchairs, delivery coaches and baby weighing 

scales as well as laboratory tools. The construction of a septic 

tank has improved sanitation standards at the health centre, 

while the installation of an ablution block, and an underground 

water tank has enabled the hospital to meet its water needs for 

effective service delivery.

ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
Youth account for 35.4% of Kenya’s population and 80% of the 

country’s unemployed are young people aged between 15–34. 

Against this backdrop, we focus on opening opportunities for 

young people through upskilling and entrepreneurial initiatives.

• The Wezesha initiative trains cohorts of potential digital/cloud 

workers, introducing them to the gig economy, improving their 

soft and hard skills, thereby enhancing their employability. This 

initiative, which supported 2 050 youth in FY22, was closed 

out in May 2021.

• The Wezesha Generation Programme aims to solve the 

problem of skills gaps on the one hand and youth unemployment 

on the other and aims to and provide unemployed youth aged 

18–35 across the country with job-ready skills. We achieve this 

through programmes across five sectors: financial services sales, 

distributed sales, retail and restaurant, customer service agents 

and sewing machine operators. As at the end of May 2021 

when the project was closed, we had graduated over 8 600 

youth, 56% of whom were women, across 53 training locations 

in 18 counties in Kenya with 14 of these centres located in 

public and private TVETs. 

• The Wezesha Agri initiative which was first piloted in 2018, 

aimed to empower the youth and women by supporting them 

with access to farm inputs, learning content and the required 

land infrastructure. We faced certain challenges, key among 

which was the lack of market linkages for produce and the fact 

that experiential, rather than digital, learning was preferred 

by those involved. We are now looking at a partnership with 

the German development agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für 

Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ) and with Digifarm 

as technical advisors to establish demonstration farms. We 

believe this will motivate young people to take up farming and 

help them develop their skills in this area.

SAFARICOM PLC INITIATIVES
The initiatives set out on the following pages take place under the 

auspices of Safaricom PLC.

SAFARICOM WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY (WIT) 

Our Women in Technology (WIT) programmes aim to help 

the next generation of students and youth onboard, build and 

retain women in STEM careers. This is achieved through six key 

programmes aimed at reaching out to the girl child at various 

stages of her education cycle by continuously providing support 

through coaching, mentorship, exposure to evolving technologies, 

technical platforms and networks. 

• The Kids-Go-Tech initiative strategically engages children 

in science-based experiments using interactive kits to simulate 

real world applications. Despite the challenges of a long 

school break related to COVID-19, WIT partnered with 

Code Yetu Kids and successfully executed a virtual session 

for kids focusing on Agile for kids which is based on the 

Agile methodology we are currently employing; Scratch (a 

programming language); making art, web development and 

the MIT app inventor, a tool that facilitates easy app creation 

while teaching computational fundamentals.

• Through the 47/47 High School programme we reach out 

to 47 schools in each of the 47 counties, inviting one school 

per county or a one-day workshop at our regional Safaricom 

offices. The young girls attending are shown the technical 

basics to spark their interest for the science-based courses 

and are also mentored and counselled on various life issues 

affecting them at this stage by the WIT champions. 

• The Tech-novation Challenge targets high school girls 

aged 14 to 18 who submit apps addressing identified 

community problems. This usually spans over four months of 

team formation, intense research, business proposal, coding 

and presentations at various judging stages. All this is done 

under rigorous coaching and mentoring of the students by 

tech-novation coaches (volunteer individuals obtained via 

other WIT programmes). One of the teams was recognised on 

International Youth Day by UNESCO, showcasing the Kazi 

kwa Wote app to connect youth in Kibera to jobs. 

• WIT’s campus outreach programme ensures women are 

on track for employment viability, growth into management 

and have the necessary skills in place to maintain a work-life 

balance in STEM professions. Under the programme in FY22, 

there were 10 webinars which had average attendance of 370 

students from 36 universities across Kenya. The programme 

is helping to create a talent pool and promote Safaricom's 

growth as a brand.

• The WIT Technology Academy programme provides 

added value internship for a period of three months through 

placement within various teams in Safaricom PLC based on the 

skillsets required and offered. 

• The WIT internal & networking programme provides 

a platform from which women can build their professional 

networks and which provides work/life support.

Enabling and empowering communities

Serving the community of Kilimani in 
Turbo Sub-County, Uasin-Gishu County 
and established in 2019, the mandate 
of Kilimani BUDA community-based 
organisation (CBO) is to promote youth 
talent, skills development and economic 
empowerment. Joblessness, poverty, crime, 
drugs and substance abuse, as well as early 
pregnancies motivated the organisation 
to establish a community resource centre 
called ‘Kituo cha Uradi’. The centre, which 
aims to train 1 500 young people a year, 
enables school pupils and youth (under 35) 
in the community to acquire computer skills 
at vastly reduced rates.

Through the Ndoto Zetu initiative, the 
CBO received a grant which enabled the 

purchase of 10 computers and  
the establishment of ICT infrastructure. The 
CBO has trained 160 community members 
on computer packages and short courses 
in ICT, while another 15 have been trained 
in Kenyan Sign Language. The centre also 
offers linkages to the government-sponsored 
AJIRA network that creates an environment 
for skills development and job creation.

When the centre is not being used for 
training, it serves as a library for research at 
minimal cost per hour. This has contributed 
greatly to literacy levels of the community 
members who access the centre.

Spot it, Stop it!

Safaricom partnered with UNICEF and 
the Directorate of Children Services 
to launch 'Spot it, Stop it', a campaign 
to promote awareness about violence 
against children and to advocate for 
change. The campaign, which targeted 
all 47 counties, was initiated in Nairobi 
County in October 2021 with sensitisation 
forums for various stakeholders including 
children, education stakeholders and 
county government officials. 

The campaign aimed to raise awareness 
on how children can be safe both online 
and offline and how to prevent violence 

against children by identifying and 
addressing the underlying causes. The 
campaign also calls for cases of violence 
against children to be reported to the 
relevant authorities by contacting the 
toll-free numbers provided or to child 
protection offices. As part of the campaign, 
children were also informed on how to 
identify and report online abuse through 
a child-friendly booklet distributed by 
the Directorate of Children Services and 
UNICEF relating to violence against 
children.

SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFORMING TO AGILE
Our transformation to an Agile organisation, supported by two Centres of 

Excellence, is enhancing the levels of responsiveness our stakeholders expect 

from us as we become a purpose-led technology company by 2025.   

The adoption of Agile as a way of working has enabled us to progress our 

Customer Obsession journey. It has also meant less specialisation and greater 

synergy across teams. It continues to allow us to meet our stakeholders needs and 

expectations more strategically. Our people are now better engaged and feel 

empowered in contributing to realising our mission and delivering on stakeholder 

needs. 

In FY22 we launched the second wave of Agile tribes with 29 squads and nine 

Exco-led workstreams. We also operationalised the Transformation Office and 

Agile studio.

BUILDING VALUE THROUGH AGILE SPRINTS
The merging of business and technology resources has connected the requisite 

people from different domains, enabling them to work together on tasks, boosting 

cross-team collaboration, as well as the pace of execution and productivity. Work 

has been broken into small, time-bound sprints designed to deliver an outcome. 

As a result of these quick sprints, time to value has accelerated, with each sprint 

building value on the achievements of its predecessor.

The first quarterly business review (QBR) was held in August 2021 and has 

been adopted as a critical planning process aligned to our Agile mission, with 

regular quarterly reviews taking place. The QBR sets the main organisation-wide 

priorities for the quarter to achieve our mission and facilitate any required resource 

allocation. It also extracts learnings from the previous quarter and defines the tribe/

unit plans for next quarter, which cascades to squad and team backlogs

NURTURING AGILE TALENT 
Our employees remain an integral part of our success and we 

continue to drive the Spirit of Safaricom while nurturing critical 

talent. We have anchored our people strategy on four key pillars: 

• Accelerate the delivery of diverse talent and future-ready skills. 

• Orchestrate an Agile and efficient operating model.  

• Foster the purpose and Spirit of Safaricom 

• Create a digital, personalised employee experience. 

We have also instituted various models for contribution-based 

careers, performance management, employment contracts and 

remuneration, as well as incentives. These four elements are aimed 

at supporting collaboration, flexibility, growth and craftsmanship 

as well as establishing a bias towards doers.

All job profiles are linked to specific business KPIs. Each role 

has a mapped contribution level aligned with craft, people and 

mindset, business and customer. Every employee is assigned 

objective key results which align with the overall business 

mission. These are documented and reviewed through:

• Regular weekly retrospect meetings

• Monthly check-ins

• Quarterly business reviews 

• 360 degree review sessions for agile teams 

• Bi-annual and annual reviews. 

To enhance engagement, we held 11 CEO town halls, 33 weekly 

staff webinars, four Leadership Forums and five Agile townhalls. 

We also held safety culture and performance reviews, as well as 

COVID-19 and wellbeing sessions across the organisation.  

We achieved a Digital Maturity Index (DMI) of 3.1 through our 

efforts in simplifying, automating and digitising our processes. The 

DMI describes the digital effectiveness of an organisation, together 

with how well digital contributes to an organisation’s performance. 

The highest point on the DMI is 5. Globally, advancing and 

leading organisations achieve a score of 4 and above. We have 

deployed initiatives to achieve this score.

PROMOTING DIVERSITY
We are an equal opportunity employer, actively recruiting talent 

from diverse backgrounds to ensure a workforce reflective of the 

communities we serve. We strive to create a work environment 

where employees are empowered to thrive and grow regardless of 

gender, disability, race, age, or any other dimension of equality. 

While we maintained gender representation overall, at senior 

leadership, female representation declined by 1%. This was 

attributable to the creation of a new division with a male chief.

We achieved our training hours and investment targets, with the 

result that the training index (percentage of staff who attended 

training during the year) increased by 4%.

In a further drive to promote diversity, we onboarded 33 PwD 

interns from the IT Bridge Academy which trains young people with 

disabilities in information technology. We waived their degree 

requirements and upskilled them with digital skills. This was the first 

group of the talent pipeline from a consortium of partners led by 

Sight Savers who have been our partners for the last three years 

and who have supported us in raising awareness particularly, in 

empowering our line managers on disability etiquette and how to 

lead inclusive teams.

We also trained over 100 retail franchise employees on sign 

language to remove communication barriers for our deaf 

colleagues and customers. The training involved a structured 

basic sign language module with content relevant for day-to-day 

communication aligned with business operations. In addition, 

we ensured communication within Safaricom was inclusive by 

providing captions during online meetings and having sign 

language interpreters during all in-person meetings. 

As indicated in the table on the following page, we are well on 

track to achieving our target of 5% PwDs in the workplace by 

2025. We continued to provide assistive technologies and devices 

to support our staff with disabilities. In line with this inclusive 

approach, we also distributed about 2 000 white canes across the 

country. 

To support PwDs further, we partnered with the Malaika Awards 

and Safaricom Foundation to host a forum where PwDs showcased 

their talents in various economic fields and the winners were given 

spot awards to boost their economic status.

BUILDING WOMEN LEADERS
Given that promoting gender equality is a key priority, we 

continued to focus on building a healthy pipeline for our women 

leaders through our Safaricom Women in Leadership Programme 

that saw 50 women graduate from the programme in FY22. 

Conducted with an external third party, Safaricom Mowgli 

Mentoring encourages mentees to explore ideas, set clear goals 

on career growth and take steps towards realising them. Our 

Safaricom Mowgli mentorship programme has now supported over 

100 women grow in their careers and improve their performance 

in the different roles they execute for the business

Lean-in circles for our female employees provided psychosocial 

support and engagement even as we transitioned back to work 

post COVID -19. These circles covered issues like breakthrough 

leadership for women and achieving a balance between work and 

home. Through initiatives such as Women in Technology (WIT) 

(see page 74 of this report), we hope to create a talent pool of 

women opting for technology-based careers.

EQUIPPING OUR PEOPLE WITH SKILLS
Our progress in creating a future-fit organisation was highlighted 

by the fact that we achieved a career development index of 76% 

in our FY22 employee survey, indicating that 76% of our staff 

believe their career goals can be met and achieved at Safaricom. 

As indicated in the table on the following page, we achieved our 

training target of 40 hours, with the decrease from the previous 

year attributable to the introduction of hybrid ways of working.

We implemented the following skills initiatives in FY22:  

• Our #1MoreSkill campaign, aimed at accelerating the delivery 

of digital upskilling and reskilling across the business, saw 

90% of our employees completing at least one digital learning.

• Following a skill audit exercise for our Technology teams, 

80% of our employees’ individual development plans realised 

through various learning channels.

• A total of 4 407 employees (80% of our staff) completed Agile 

101 courses, with 247 employees certified in Agile-related 

courses.

• Over 300 employees completed the Digital Academy, a 

re-skilling initiative to accelerate future digital skills readiness 

across the business as we transition into a purpose-led, 

Customer Obsessed, digital-first technology company. 

The programme comprises a blended, staggered learning 

approach encompassing a mix of self-paced learning, 

peer learning, experiential learning, mentorship and virtual 

classroom training. It is delivered in an Agile manner and the 

participants are expected to work on projects that address 

real business problems. Of the employees participating in 

the initiative, 95% were upskilled and reskilled in software 

engineering, cloud, cyber security, IoT, AI and machine 

learning. Nanodegree upskilling for 48 of our data scientists 

and data engineers also took place.  

• Approximately 23 000 functional courses (courses that are 

mapped to an employee’s role and the function in which they 

work) were completed on the Safaricom Business School with  

2 477 employees attending instructor-led training sessions.

ENGAGING OUR EMPLOYEES
Our target for FY22 in terms of the employee and manager 

engagement indices respectively was 90. However, we did not 

achieve this, with the employee engagement index standing at 85 

and the manager engagement index at 89. However, these scores 

are within the Kenyan national norm and are best-in-class. 

The increase in staff turnover is attributable to increased demand 

for talent in the tech and fintech spaces in the local market which 

saw Safaricom lose many more employees in these skill pools as 

the year before.

KPI SUMMARYOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Following the launch and adoption of the Agile people model, our 

agility index is at 78%, indicating how our people view us as an 

Agile organisation – a result which puts us at the ‘Walk’ stage. 

88% of people feel that prioritised goals are consistent with strategy 

and 87% believe that leaders set direction and empower teams to 

deliver. However, only 58% believe that hierarchy is less important 

and views at all levels can be expressed.

Views on total reward have declined, both on career prospects 

(-8%) and fair compensation (-8%), and equality of opportunity (8%). 

People want more support during periods of change, down by 

-7%, four out of 10 people do not feel they can speak up and raise 

different views. Respondents were asked whether the Thrive initiative 

has enabled them to meet their body, mind, heart and soul goals. 

Their responses indicate that the effectiveness of this initiative has 

declined.

This is the first time scores have dropped significantly, reflecting 

a typical pattern seen through times of organisational change. 

COVID-19 regulations meant working from home and placed 

increased demands on employees’ time. The pandemic also led to 

a lack of engagement opportunities related to fitness and wellbeing. 

Our focus is now on re-engaging employees quickly.

EMBEDDING A CULTURE OF ZERO 
HARM
Our aim is to embed a culture of zero harm by eliminating or 

controlling risks associated with our operations and delivering 

holistic employee wellbeing. As a result, we have embedded the 

Safaricom Absolute Rules (see below) in our ways of working to 

focus attention on the three high risk activities associated with our 

business, which are driving, working at heights and working with 

electricity. We know from experience that failing to follow basic 

health and safety standards, leads to our people, the people we 

work with, and the people exposed to our activities being seriously 

injured or killed. By following these simple life-saving rules, we can 

help ensure everyone goes home safely every day.

Tragically, there were two fatalities in FY22, one involving a car 

accident and the other related to an electrocution event when a 

third party undertook unauthorised electrical pole installation. As 

indicated on the next page, this translated into a 33% reduction in 

fatal incidents which was accompanied by a 78% reduction in lost 

time injuries. 

SAFARICOM ABSOLUTE RULES

When working at 
height, ALWAYS wear 

protective gear, attach a 
safety harness & use fall 
protection equipment!

WE ALWAYS drive safely 
and legally: we never use 
a handheld mobile device 

when driving!

NEVER carry out work on 
any electrical equipment 
unless you're qualified!

WE NEVER work under 
the influence of alcohol or 

drugs!

WE ALWAYS drive safely

wear a seatbelt!

WE ALWAYS drive safely

obey the speed limit!

When working in proximity

maintain the required safe 
distance & use the correct 

insulated equipment.

NEVER undertake any

We took the following actions to embed our safety culture further 

across the organisation:  

• Implemented measures to improve driver behaviour by 

addressing driver competency (expect the unexpected) and 

defensive driver training, attestation to the Absolute Rules 

and developed a driver data analytics tool to monitor driver 

behaviour and proactively support drivers to become safe on the 

road. 

• Increased the frequency of engagements with staff and suppliers 

to foster an environment of sharing and learning. 

• Engaged with supply chain management and technology 

business leaders to ensure a collaborative approach to 

managing safety by supporting suppliers to accelerate their 

safety maturity. 

• Appointed internal audit to perform an advisory/oversight role 

to ensure accountability, monitoring and measurement of our 

health, safety and wellbeing performance and culture.

• Developed and launched the Zero Harm Mission on World Day 

for Safety and Health at the Work CEO webinar where our 

members of staff pledged to deliver on Zero Harm as a personal 

commitment.

• Nominated and involved eight Exco Absolute Rules champions 

in Absolute Rules engagements and webinars. 

• Reinforced the importance of safety to employees through 

monthly safety webinars.

• Increased the number of health, safety and wellbeing staff from 

four to seven, thereby enabling a more granular approach to 

overseeing safety. 

• Expanded the incident reporting channels that were created as 

a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This, together with the 

positive, non-punitive behaviour-based safety approach has not 

only helped to increase the accuracy and frequency of reporting 

but has also enhanced transparency related to safety issues.

ROAD SAFETY
Addressing occupational road risk was and remains our most 

challenging initiative. Following national trends, we saw an 

increase in road-related accidents, especially those involving 

pedestrians and motorcyclists. We have taken several steps to 

mitigate this. 

For example, we launched the Vodafone Drive-Safe App during 

the Zero Harm Mission Staff townhall to condition users of the app 

to safe behaviours on the roads. In July 2021, in collaboration 

with the Fleet Team, we launched the Qlik Sense Driver Analytics 

Tool. This enables data driven insights into driver behaviour across 

our authorised drivers, thereby enabling targeted interventions 

to enhance safety on the roads. We also introduced fitness to 

drive assessments across Safaricom which incorporated a health 

surveillance questionnaire, cognitive assessment and clinical 

assessments for 768 out of 800 drivers tested, resulting in five 

identified unfit cases. We also trained 744 drivers on defensive 

driving techniques and held in-vehicle camera engagements with 

drivers.

We were recognised by the 
Directorate of Occupational  
Health and Safety Services for  
being an event sponsor of the  
World Day for Safety and Health.

FOCUSING ON WELLBEING

Partnering with the National Transport  
and Safety Authority (NTSA)

In December 2021, we partnered with the 
National Transport and Safety Authority 
(NTSA) to provide training to boda boda 
riders on road safety rules as part of 
efforts aimed at reducing the number of 
road accidents experienced during the 
festive season.

The training, conducted in conjunction 
with the National Boda Boda Association, 
was aimed at promoting responsible 
and proper usage of the road by all 
road users and sensitising riders on the 
importance of possessing insurance 
cover.

The campaign also focused on promoting 
awareness of key safety areas, including 

the need always to obey traffic lights, 
avoiding speeding or overtaking on the 
wrong side of the road and availability of 
helmets for boda boda riders and their 
passengers.

“Kenya’s boda boda industry has 
grown to become an integral part of the 
transport sector, and it also provides a 
livelihood for many. However, it has also 
become a leading cause of road-related 
incidents, and we want to play our part, 
however small, in creating awareness and 
driving a Zero Harm agenda, such that 
no one is harmed while on the roads.”

• Onboarded 1 900 M-PESA super-agents.

• 35 million customer KYC documents processed. 

ISSUES FOR SOCIETY

• Suppliers: Delayed communications on tender 
outcomes and lags in payment processing.

• Dealers: KYC regulations.

• Agents: Arbitrage claw back commission.

We champion compliance with safety, 
remuneration and human rights 
issues (SDG8) and reduce inequality 
(SDG10) by promoting diversity 
and inclusion throughout our value 
chain and ensuring that minorities 
are represented in our business 
relationships.

UPHOLDING OUR REPUTATION AND 
BRAND INTEGRITY
Our business partner network comprised 799 suppliers, 435 dealers 

and 262 000 M-PESA agents. We rely on our network to uphold and 

enhance the Safaricom brand which is synonymous with integrity and 

innovation. Our business partners help us increase brand awareness, 

expand our customer base and create positive relationships with 

current and potential customers. We work them to meet governance, 

environmental and social needs.

SUPPLIERS

MAINTAINING A STRONG RELATIONSHIP

Our strong relationship with our suppliers is based on ongoing, open 

engagement. A centrally managed, dedicated helpdesk responds to 

supplier queries, with suppliers also making use of emails and other 

direct forms of communication. A strong induction framework is in 

place, with inductions held quarterly. Shortly after year-end, we held 

the Supplier Recognition Awards where we honoured 19 suppliers 

in seven categories. We used this opportunity to communicate our 

strategy/company mission, operational updates, Occupational Health 

and Safety (OHS) updates and developments from our Customer 

Obsession cascade journey. We also shared feedback from the 

Satisfaction Survey.  

The negative economic impacts of COVID-19 impacted consumers 

and hence, our suppliers. Despite these challenges, our relationship 

with our suppliers remained strong as we responded to their needs: 

During the pandemic, we helped to ensure our suppliers’ businesses 

stayed afloat by making exceptional earlier payments, including 

continued payments to retainer accounts to cushion the businesses 

for two quarters and providing hygiene packs to our contingent 

workforce. We also reinstated payment cycles twice a month, one 

at mid-month, one at the near end of the month, to enhance timely 

settlement. In addition, purchase order (PO) suppliers can now 

invoice online, which has accelerated the payment process. We have 

continued accelerating the digital agenda to create efficiencies in all 

our operations to the extent that we now have over 90% touchless 

POs. Regarding suppliers’ concerns, tender feedback is available in 

real time on the i-supplier portal.



91PARTNERING FOR GROWTH: TRANSFORMING LIVES   |   

KPI SUMMARYOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS OUR STAKEHOLDERS

In response to suppliers’ requests, we initiated a supplier self-

assessment survey. This highlighted gaps in OHS administration 

in areas such as documentation, health and safety policy, vehicle 

roadworthiness and lack of vehicle tracking units. We conducted 

forums every quarter to address these issues, together with those 

raised based on supplier feedback. We also looked at the 

implementation of the Data Protection Act, which prohibits transfer 

of personal data to third parties unless the data subject has given 

prior consent.  

To support our suppliers further, we continued to collaborate with 

financial institutions in Kenya including ABSA Bank Kenya (ABSA), 

Citibank Kenya, and Equity Bank and most recently with Kenya 

Commercial Bank (KCB) as regards local purchase order (LPO) 

financing and invoice discounting to provide financial backing. 

This will broaden financial access to women, youth and PwDs, as 

we continue signing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with 

other several financial institutions.

To facilitate continuous improvement, we commissioned a 

survey in February 2022 which gives us a Net Promoter Score 

(NPS) indicating supplier levels of satisfaction and confidence 

in Safaricom. The supplier NPS was 68%, a slight decrease but 

still a commendable score in NPS market scores. Our positive 

relationship was also reflected in a score of 91% in the overall 

supplier satisfaction index (2021: 93%).  

Key findings from the surveys were that Safaricom emphasises 

quality and is clear in the quality specifications of goods and 

services; service levels are clearly defined, and payments are 

prompt. Further indications are that Safaricom commands a 

significant level of trust – indicated by the high likelihood of 

recommending Safaricom to other potential business partners.

As indicated in the graphs on this page, the total number of 

suppliers was down by 5%, with spend increasing slightly. On the 

downside, the number of local suppliers – whom we continue to 

support where feasible – reduced marginally by 5.7%. However, 

spend with this group increased by 3%, attributable to increased 

activity in certain categories, particularly marketing, catering and 

events following the easing of COVID-related restrictions.

ASSESSING SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE

The number of evaluations, which take place on a quarterly or 

bi-annual basis, has been steadily increasing over the past four 

years. We have instituted a process whereby we assist suppliers 

whose performance is below the required threshold (<80%) with 

customised performance improvement plans (PIP) and mentoring.  

Given our commitment to SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, 

remuneration that at least aligns with the minimum wage, as well 

as the provision of appropriate personal protective equipment 

(PPE), are contract stipulations. We also conduct ongoing supplier 

compliance checks on human rights and labour compliance. In 

the period under review, we carried out onsite audits and ad-hoc 

checks on 20 high-risk contracts. Of these, 35% were found to be 

non-compliant and 86% of the non-compliance issues were closed 

by end of the financial year.

We insist that all suppliers sign up to our Supplier Code of 

Conduct. The number of suppliers who had signed up to the Code 

of Ethics for Business in Kenya was 71% in FY22. 

Of the 29% flagged as having not signed up to the Code, 60% no 

longer have active engagements with Safaricom.

WOMEN IN BUSINESS

Our target is to ensure women-owned businesses account for 

10% of procurement spend. However, progress in achieving our 

Women in Business (WIB) targets remained slow. The number 

of women participating in tenders as a percentage of total 

tender participants declined from 71% to 55% year-on-year. 

Recognising that one of the key barriers is access to finance, we 

have established MOUs with ABSA, Citibank, Equity Bank. Kenya 

Commercial Bank and Safaricom Sacco for supply chain finance 

which benefits women suppliers.

Women winners: Safaricom Supplier Recognition Awards

We were very encouraged by the number of women winners in this year’s awards:
• The winner in the Sales and Marketing category was Larger 

Than Life, a woman- owned business which demonstrated 

exceptional capabilities in providing high quality décor that 

brings event themes and products to life, while maintaining 

an impeccable record on health and safety with best 

practices clearly visible.

• The first runner-up in the technology networks category 

Telenor Services Ltd, is a 100% Kenyan owned 

telecommunication Infrastructure construction company, with 

the majority shareholding comprising women. The company 

was recognised for the excellence of its base transceiver 

station rollout, ensuring continuous service availability and 

exceeding Safaricom’s expectations.

• The first runner-up category in enterprise business was 

Fireside Group Limited, a women-owned and women-led 

organisation supplying Safaricom with fixed data customer 

deployment and support. There have been no escalations 

during their two years’ service due to their quick response 

and proficiency in resolving fixed data issues. 

• The Optimax Group Limited were second runner-up in the 

enterprise business category on their basis of their excellence 

in providing Safaricom with fixed data customer deployment 

and support. The company went the extra mile by educating 

customers on fixed services, thereby creating more 

awareness of Safaricom’s products and services, upselling 

products in the process. 

• The second runner-up in the Sales and Marketing category 

was Party Lounges. This women-owned, highly trained team 

provides bespoke, high-quality décor which brings the 

Safaricom brand to life in a meaningfully differentiated way. 

They were commended for the way their flexible operating 

model drives significant cost efficiencies.

DEALERS
Our physical engagements with our dealers increased following 

the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and this has further enhanced 

Safaricom’s relationship with them. We engaged with 435 dealers 

in six virtual forums in the first half of the year and following the 

easing of COVID-19 restrictions, with the same number in face-

to-face forums in the second half of the year. Changing consumer 

behaviour saw increased digital airtime consumption rather than 

physical consumption and this positively impacted dealers as fewer 

resources were required to deal with consumers.

creating more touch points for consumers where they can 

resolve issues. We also conducted training and in certain 

instances, pay a high percentage of our dealers’ salaries. 

• Facilitating opportunities for dealers as regards Lipa Mdogo 

Mdogo phones, to the extent that sales increased by 20%, with 

over 300 000 devices sold through the dealer channel. 

• Continuing to digitise and streamline dealer processes, rolling 

out digital airtime distribution across the dealer network and 

helping to facilitate digital customer acquisition. 

• Supporting dealers in meeting regulatory subscriber 

requirements with our Know Your Customer (KYC) awareness 

campaign and the Jiandikishe KYC app. A total of 30 000 tills 

are now on the KYC app, with 35 million customers reached. 

• Opening market device sales within dealer outlets to help 

increase dealer revenue without their having to open new 

outlets.

• Providing the financial support for the branding on all 850 

dealer vans. 

• Supporting dealers with 5 000 MobiGo 2 devices. This 

subsidised, affordable smartphone has no calling functionality, 

but enables dealers to connect to the internet. 

• Onboarding new banks (ABSA, Cooperative and Family Bank) 

in addition to Stanbic and the Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) 

to facilitate dealers’ access to funds.

• Training 465 dealer staff on customer handling skills and 

systems training, including CRM, M-PESA and Bonga.

AGENTS
Our agents act as brand ambassadors, helping us to reach a wide 

range of customers. Our network of agents is primarily involved 

in M-PESA, facilitating deposits, withdrawals and registration. In 

FY22, we increased the number of agents active on the subscriber 

registration app to 33 000, empowering an additional 370 

M-PESA head offices to sell devices. We also added 1 900 super 

agents to the network. 

In response to agents’ requests, we reviewed the Bloom financing 

matrix – which complements agents’ e-floats at an average of three 

months of their commission amounts – to allow more agents to 

access the revolving fund of KSh 1 billion. A further 136 agents 

made use of this option, bringing the total number of agents 

financed under this scheme to 1 236.

Our incentive programme Stawisha Biashara (‘enhance/grow your 

business’), whereby agents receive a point for every 1 000  

transactions conducted, continues to grow from strength to 

strength. In FY22, agents redeemed KSh 337 641 000 under the 

scheme. We strategically supported 319 agents by linking them 

with Stanbic Bank which provides unsecured short-term loans for 

dealers and agents (head offices) covering airtime, floats and 

device purchases. We also onboarded Equity Bank and Co-

operative Bank as an M-PESA holding account.

Our geo-locking feature for agents restricts operations that are not 

within the agent’s assigned locality. In addition, we send weekly 

alerts to tills suspected to be committing arbitrage, advising them to 

desist. Safaricom’s compliance department also visits and refunds 

genuine agent tills confirmed not to have committed arbitrage.

FUTURE FOCUS

• Fortress our core business, with an intentional focus to 
drive 4G device attachment and enable data usage.

• Accelerate new business growth areas in fixed fibre 
for home and business, WiFi, Pochi La Biashara and 
Lipa na M-PESA.

• Step change our customer experience by enabling 
care desks across all partner channels.

• Transform our Route to Customer (RTC) to deliver an 
unmatched omnichannel experience.

•  Embed digital at the core of all our customer 
engagements.

PROFILING OUR SHAREHOLDERS
As indicated in the table below, foreign corporates' shareholding of the free float 

declined from 45.6% to 43.7%. This is attributable to several factors, including foreign 

investor sell-off in emerging markets, uncertainty about the upcoming August general 

elections, depreciation of the Kenyan Shilling, rising interest rates in developed markets 

and investor jitters about the Russia/Ukraine crisis.

Domestic investors have been supporting the stock amidst the foreign investor sell-off. 

Following increased engagement with local funds, the local corporate share of the free 

float increased from 39.4% to 41.2%.

BUILDING TRUST
Recognising that trust is underpinned by transparency, we work hard to build legitimacy 

with our shareholders through transparent information that addresses their concerns. 

Retail investors’ major concerns are the amount and timing of dividend payments. In 

FY22, we paid an interim dividend of KSh 0.64 per share amounting to KSh 25.64 billion 

(2021: KSh 18.03 billion) and a final dividend of KSh 0.75 per share, amounting to 

KSh 30.04 billion. These dividends were approved by shareholders after year end. This 

brought the total dividends for the year to KSh 55.69 billion (2021: KSh 54.89 billion), 

representing KSh 1.39 per share for the financial year ended 31 March 2022 (2021: 

KSh 1.37 per share).

We continue to liaise closely with our company registrar, Image Registrars and the 

dividend disbursing bank to ensure timely dividend payments. 

Analysts and investment funds want information that enables more accurate valuation 

of the Ethiopian business. We have responded to institutional investors’ concerns by 

enhancing disclosures related to the expansion and giving investors greater levels of 

visibility into M-PESA operations.

96 |   SAFARICOM SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS REPORT 2022

KPI SUMMARYOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Most institutional investors are concerned about increased regulatory 

risk, especially the mobile termination rate (MTR) and impact of tax 

changes on the earnings. Other areas of concern for institutional 

businesses include the macroeconomic environment, particularly the 

increased depreciation of the Kenyan Shilling and the concomitant 

inflationary pressures on business and consumer wallets. 

We address these concerns through close engagement: Following 

the government’s partial lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in October 

2021, we increased investor engagements via virtual conference 

calls and one-on-one physical meetings, meeting with 236 funds in 

FY22 in a hybrid mix of virtual and physical meetings. We ensure 

that our investor relations dashboard is up to date so that investors 

can easily access the latest financial statements and other earnings 

materials. We have also established dedicated contact channels 

whereby we respond to shareholder telephonic, email and message-

based enquiries within set timelines of 24 – 48 hours governed by 

internal Service Level Agreements. 

In our interactions with investors, we explain our four key strategic 

pillars which are the foundation of transforming into a technology 

company by 2025:

• Strengthen the core: Management’s initiatives focus on 

defending voice through CVM initiatives, democratising data 

through driving affordable 4G devices (a significant opportunity 

to grow mobile data) and evolving channel roles to serve 

customers better by aligning with their needs.

• To be a financial services provider: The focus under this 

pillar is now pivoting to financial health more than financial 

inclusion. Investors can see management initiatives to enhance 

financial inclusion as we now explore the next growth phases 

going forward and evolve M-PESA into a broader digital 

platform, offering universal payment network and integrated 

business solutions. To achieve this, we plan to roll out products 

that promote a savings culture, provide working capital to 

consumers and businesses, and increase access to insurance 

and wealth creation subject to regulatory approvals. 

• Accelerate new growth areas: Management is proactively 

allocating investment and resources to scale new growth 

opportunities not just in Kenya but beyond. These new areas 

include digital business, IoT, ICT, M-PESA and DigiFarm 

acceleration as well as the Ethiopian expansion. 

• Achieve cost leadership: Management’s initiatives are 

increasing and enhancing productivity. As we transform into a 

technology company, our Agile transformation journey offers 

an opportunity to revisit our processes and operating models. In 

pursuit of this, we have realized operational efficiencies and cost 

savings from smart procurement, and these savings will go into 

fuelling growth into new areas.

EVALUATING OUR ESG PERFORMANCE
Our shareholder base has been growing each year with intensified 

interest coming from impact investors who use an ESG lens as part 

of their analysis process in stock and portfolio selection, as well as 

in assessing risk control. Our alignment with the UN SDGs, nine 

of which we have prioritised, is of particular interest to impact 

investors. 

Against this backdrop, we commissioned S&P Global to conduct 

a valuation of our ESG performance which we are currently 

reviewing. We have also engaged extensively with this group of 

investors regarding the Environmental, Social and Governance 

Disclosures Guidance Manual published towards the end of 

2021 by the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). The manual 

provides a granular, tactical approach to ESG reporting that meets 

international standards on ESG reporting, ranging from expectations 

related to the responsibilities of the Board, Chief Executive Officer 

and sustainability managers, to guidelines related to stakeholder 

engagement, the principles of materiality and the incorporation of 

key performance indicators into reporting processes.

FUTURE FOCUS

• Give more visibility to investors on our Ethiopian 
expansion by enhancing our disclosures.

• Publish a fully integrated report by ensuring the timing 
of data collection/writing of the sustainability report 
coincides with the publication of the annual report. 
This will enhance ESG disclosures further in the 
annual report. 

• Promote clarity of understanding of our strategy, 
business and expansion into Ethiopia to investors by 
hosting our first Investor Day. 

•  Grow our shareholder base by targeting tech, 
ESG-focused investors and local investors.

MAINTAINING A POSITIVE WORKING 
RELATIONSHIP
The media landscape in Kenya has shifted slightly with many global companies 

setting up sub-Saharan African headquarters, the decline of certain print media, 

a proliferation of digital channels and the convergence of news desks across all 

types. We are still gauging the impact of the latter development, particularly on 

our media relationships. 

Our positive working relationship with the media was enhanced when COVID-19 

restrictions were eased and we could engage on a personal level. We continued 

to engage virtually, with our hybrid model enabling us to reach a wider 

audience. Our media team worked closely with our marketing team to facilitate 

a targeted focus on issues of interest. The team also used third-party experts 

like media lecturers to help us develop various narratives. We work with news, 

features, court, parliament, business and sports desks depending on the stories 

we promote. 

In support of several campaigns across the country which focused on Customer 

Value Management, we leveraged the power of radio to communicate across all 

68 local languages. 

Our relationships with sports journalists were further entrenched with the 

Safaricom Golf Tour (see side bar) and our KSh 25 000 sponsorship of the Uhai 

Festival – a sports event for PwDs that was started by sports journalists.

Generally, our conversations with media on brand, assets and sustainability 

were positive. The exception was confusion caused by the SIM validation 

deadline whereby Safaricom’s customers were requested to go to outlets to have 

their photos taken under the CA directive. This caused long queues that were 

negatively reported on all media before the CA allowed online registration.

KPI SUMMARYOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS OUR STAKEHOLDERS

INCREASED MEDIA INTEREST IN 
SUSTAINABILITY
Increasing media attention on sustainability-related issues is 

evidenced by the significant increase in PR value of issues 

focused on sustainable business from KSh 98 806 935 in FY21 

to KSh 270 088 495 in FY22. Health initiatives related to 

SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing, received high levels of 

coverage, closely followed by stories which focus on women and 

youth, as well education and economic empowerment initiatives. 

We engaged with education media to showcase offerings from 

our enterprise business unit targeted at the health and education 

sectors, tech media to cover the M-PESA Super App and health 

and with business media to cover M-PESA@15, M-PESA Global 

Visa Pay launch and our last financial year results announcement.

LEVERAGING ELECTRONIC MEDIA
The significant increase in total website users and the number 

of page views is because we redesigned our journey to make it 

easier for users from an experience perspective. We have linked 

the website to our digital transaction sites. Leveraging monthly 

analytics which indicate the most visited pages, we have also been 

updating the site regularly. We also made extensive use of social 

media for sim card registration.

a Junior Golf Day; a Caddies Golf 
Day and golf clinics targeted at 
students between the ages of 6 to 
18 years old, from schools around 
the golf clubs where the tour is 
taking place. 

FUTURE FOCUS

• Monitor the media landscape to target information  
more accurately.

•  Promote CEO and Exco interaction  
with the media.
