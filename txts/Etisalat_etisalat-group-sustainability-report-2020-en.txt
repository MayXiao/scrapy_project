The COVID-19 pandemic has 
shown the pressing need for 
robust digital infrastructure and 
reliable connectivity to build 
resilient societies; allowing 
millions of people to work, buy, 
socialise, access medical care, 
and learn, all without leaving 
their homes.

Etisalat’s 2020 Sustainability Report will highlight how 
the company has been a catalyst for other sectors and 
foundational in building resilience of communities 
across operating markets, hence, driving sustained 
business growth. 

We believe in the positive impact that technology 
can bring and strive to adopt technologies that 
ensure long-term benefits to our environment and 
the climate. Sustainability remains at the core of our 
strategy and operations. In this report we showcase 
our strategic direction aligned with UAE Vision 2021 
and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(UN SDGs). Our sustainability framework directs our 
efforts towards maximising the telecommunication 
sector’s contribution to national and global sustainable 
development objectives. 

On the other hand, our 2020 financial results were a 
testament of resilience and agility, we have adapted to 
the new normal and were able to envision a new future 
with various opportunities, hence, setting the company 
on a growth track and ensuring sustainable value 
creation to all stakeholders.

Moving forward, I am confident that we will 
continue to play a major role in the new world; 
we are committed to providing safe, efficient, and 
environmentally responsible ICT services, and will 
always strive to preserve the planet for future 
generations by lending the power of technology for the 
greater benefit while maintaining sustainability goals 
as a guiding compass. 

Jassem Mohamed Alzaabi
Chairman - Etisalat Group

2020 will be seen as a defining 
year in history, with the 
pandemic making it clear that 
telecom and digital technologies 
have had a profound impact on 
societies across the globe.

With the world beginning its recovery from the 
pandemic, it will be essential to do so in a manner 
that creates the jobs of the future, builds strength 
to face all crises, restores nature and leaves no one 
behind. The 2020 Sustainability report focuses on the 
accomplishments and efforts to support all segments of 
the society in the face of uncertainty, hence, affirming 
Etisalat’s position as a world class telco. 

Sustainability is at the core of everything we do. We 
strive hard to operate responsibly and transparently by 
living our inspiration ‘Together Towards a Sustainable 
Future’. Our strategic framework focuses on five key 
pillars of accountable business practices, marketplace 
and customers, connecting communities, environmental 
management, and our people. Our sustainability plans 
and efforts are aligned to support the ambitious goals 
of UAE Vision 2021 and the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals as well as our commitment to the 
GSMA initiative to move the entire mobile industry to 
net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our sustainability 
commitment predicates upon the principle that 
technology can help solve the biggest challenges and 
promote a true digital culture that provides everyone 
with access to services that improve the quality of life.   

Digital transformation plays a key role and has always 
remained at the core of our strategy encompassing a 

broad spectrum of initiatives. This includes the new 
cloud-based products and services, the enhancement 
and development of our digital channels and 
automation of internal as well as customer-facing 
processes through the adoption of Robotic Process 
Automation (RPA) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven 
platforms.  Our position has allowed us not only to 
achieve our vision of digitalising and empowering 
communities, but also ensuring sustainability 
throughout our endeavours. 5G will be a new 
cornerstone for building a digital society bringing a 
new era of digital economy providing new solutions 
to challenges faced by all mankind in the pursuit of 
sustainable development and value creation.

Thanks to our stakeholders including employees, 
customers and shareholders for their support and trust 
in our transformation journey of resilience and change. 
Looking onto the next year, we hope for a prosperous 
future for humanity and for our planet.

SUSTAINABILITY 

02

Sustainability is at the core of 
everything we do. We strive 
hard to operate responsibly 
and transparently by living 
our inspiration for ‘Together 
Towards a Sustainable Future’. 
We are committed to having 
a positive impact on our

time maintaining sustainable 
success.

progressive roadmap to 
monitor, benchmark and 
continuously enhance our 
economic, environmental, and 
social performance.

Stakeholder Engagement

Materiality Assessment
To conceptualise sustainability, we rely on our 
sustainability framework for defining and managing 
our environmental, social, and economic impacts. Our 
framework has five key pillars: Accountable Business 
Practices, Marketplace and Customers, Connecting 
Communities, Environmental Management, and Our 
People. We believe that an effective framework, 

supported by progressive improvement programmes, will 
help us achieve our strategic business objectives.

This report provides our disclosure and progress against 
each of these areas. We have grouped our material 
topics into the five pillars of Etisalat’s sustainability 
framework:

We continuously seek to identify and respond to existing 
and emerging global and regional matters that present 
risks as well as opportunities for our business and key 
stakeholders. To identify key material issues, we:

1. Identify a list of potential material issues through 
desk-based research, including a review of peer 
companies, industry standards and employee 
interviews.

2. Prioritise stakeholders (both internal and external 
groups) and topics to rate material issues in terms 
of their perceived importance.

3. Review results internally within Etisalat 
management and the sustainability team. This 
review ensures the list of material issues captures 
and is inclusive of all stakeholder perspectives.

In 2019, we reviewed our material topics and 
refined them to ensure they accurately reflect our 
understanding of the significance of each topic in 
terms of significance to stakeholders and significant to 
organisation. Reporting on our priority material topics 
has continued for 2020. The findings of our materiality 
assessment are presented in our materiality matrix.

Digital Innovation03
MARKETPLACE 
AND CUSTOMERS 

Digital transformation is the at the core of our strategy and encompasses a broad spectrum of initiatives, 
including new cloud-based products and services, the enhancement and development of our digital channels 
and the transformation and automation of internal as well as customer-facing processes through the adoption 
of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) or AI-driven platforms. Digital channels such as mobile apps, websites or 
customer portals will continue to play a major role in both distribution channels and the maintenance of our 
brand relevance. 

DIGITAL OPEN 
INNOVATION CENTRE
In 2020, the Etisalat Digital Open Innovation Centre 
continued to serve as our key sales enabler and saw 
many achievements over the year. It was one of the 
first locations in which customers could experience 5G 
through holographic communications, and the Etisalat 
Video Cloud Platform was displayed for the first time. 
During the Etisalat Innovation Month in February, we 
invited several universities and organisations to explore 
innovation in today’s business environment. In March 
2020, we shifted the experience to a virtual digital 
online platform, due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The Etisalat Digital Open Innovation Centre received 

180 visits in 2020, of which 77% were virtual tours, and 
27% were returning customers. Since opening in 2018, 
we have received a total of 812 customers of which 
63% of visitors were C-level executives during 2020. 
Overall, the centre has received positive feedback of 4.9 
out of 5, demonstrating the interest on the platforms 
and initiatives/technologies showcased.

Our plan is to digitise traditional human-supported 
customer care channels with AI-Driven Virtual Assistant 
Bots, Self Help Etisalat Mobile App and “Be-Proactive” 
channels.

OUR AMBITION

Etisalat is committed to accelerating 
digital innovation in the marketplace 
towards a more sustainable economy.

ETISALAT BUSINESS MOBILE APP, 
CONSUMER MOBILE APP, BUSINESS 
TO BUSINESS (B2B) PORTAL AND 
CONSUMER WEBSITE 
We continued to digitally transform the end-to-end 
customer experience in the Etisalat Business Mobile 
App. This includes digitisation of processes, product 
integration, and new features within the app.  The App 
has an integrated Central Feedback Management system, 
with a rating above 4.6 on Google Play and Apple Store.

Through our self-serve options our customers can control 
their usage and consumption of data and minutes as 
well as set limits and data caps. We also made digital 
payments the preferred channel for our customers due 
to the introduction of friendlier billing and payment 
options.

In our drive to inform our customers on the self-care 
options available to them, we encourage the use of 
alternative channels such as the B2B Portal, Etisalat 
Business Mobile App, and the Etisalat Consumer Mobile 
App. Upon assisting customers with their needs, our Call 
Centre Agents educate the customers on the self-care 
features available to them online and encourage them to 
use these services. 

By 2020, we achieved a total of 300,000 users registered 
on the Etisalat Consumer Mobile App, 321,000 users 
registered on the Etisalat Business Mobile App and 
55,000 new users on the B2B Portal. Each year, we 
continue to enhance the functionalities of the Consumer 

digital channels. Our emphasis has been on driving 
online sales, which has showed a remarkable increase of 
more than 100% compared to the previous year. In 2020, 
we launched the “Online is Better” awareness campaign, 
which highlighted the benefits of Etisalat’s digital 
channels that enable customers to avail a wide range 
of services including promotional discounts and deals. 
For information regarding our customer care digitisation 
efforts, refer to Digitisation

DIGITAL SOLUTIONS
The COVID-19 circumstances have heightened the demand for digital solutions across various areas of businesses 
and processes. In 2020 we launched a series of tools and services to cater to the market demand and provide means 
to ease activities and processes through digitisation efforts. 

AI- DRIVEN VIRTUAL ASSISTANT BOTS
In 2020, we introduced the AI-powered virtual agents, 
whereby 100% of the Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SME) segment customer’s calls, as well as consumer 
segment calls, engineering, and Central Information 
Technology (CIT) related calls, were handled by a virtual 

agent. In 2020, the virtual agent achieved a 71% success 
rate in handling end to end transactions, and as such 
the number of calls transferred to a live agent reduced 
by over 18%. The Etisalat AI-powered virtual agent is 
capable of handling 1.5 million transactions on monthly 
basis.

CLOUDTALK MEETING PLATFORM
Due to the high demand 
for teleconferencing and 
videoconferencing tools, we launched 
the CloudTalk Meeting platform which 
provides completely secure virtual 
meetings and online collaboration 
sessions. During these unprecedented 
times, the platform aims to help 
companies maintain business 
continuity by collaborating from 
any device, location, and network in 
the country. It also enables business 
operations to remain uninterrupted 
with CloudTalk’s unlimited video 
conferencing feature and online 
collaboration sessions.

BUSINESS EDGE
In 2020, we also launched Business 
Edge, which is an innovative and 
adaptable platform offering a 
variety of essential products and 
services such as smart connectivity 
tools, communication and 
collaboration mechanisms, office 
productivity tools, security and 
analytics, business devices for 
employees, and digital marketing 
solutions, which are all designed to 
strengthen the various aspects of 
any business. 

TELEMEDICINE PLATFORM
We introduced a cloud-based 
Telemedicine Platform which 
provides solutions by integrating 
essential functions within a 
patient-doctor journey, such as 
secure video, audio, and chat 
over internet protocol to support 
the entire workflow from patient 
registration, appointment booking, 
payment collection and remote 
medical consultation. American 
Hospital, one of the leading 
hospitals in the region was the 
first to utilise the platform hosting 
more than 2,000 teleconsultations 
with more than 100 doctors 
activated to date.

MALAFFI SOFTWARE-DEFINED 
NETWORKING IN A WIDE AREA 

NETWORK (SDWAN)
Malaffi is the region’s first 
health information exchange 
platform that safely and securely 
connect all public and private 
healthcare providers across the 
Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Malaffi 
enables healthcare facilities and 
professionals to access and share 
patients’ medical information 
to significantly improve patient 
care. Etisalat has taken up the 
ambitious task of connecting 
2,000 clinics in Abu Dhabi on a 
single SD-WAN fabric.

ETISALAT CLOUD EXPRESS
We pioneered the Etisalat 
Cloud Express which is a secure 
private connection between the 
customer’s corporate network 
and their public clouds, in 
partnership with Amazon Web 
Services and Microsoft Azure. 
The service enables secure 
transfer of critical data and 
select a preferred public cloud 
service provider with a variety 
of connectivity options from 
Etisalat to build a high-speed 
hybrid network for businesses.

UAE TRADE CONNECT (UTC)
We introduced UTC, a trade 
finance platform to address 
the risk of double financing 
and fraud across the UAE. 
The joint venture currently 
includes eight local banks, 
including Abu Dhabi Islamic 
Bank (ADIB), Commercial 
Bank International (CBI), 
Commercial Bank of Dubai 
(CBD), Emirates National Bank 
of Dubai (NBD), First Abu 
Dhabi Bank (FAB), Mashreq, 
National Bank of Fujairah 
(NBF) and National Bank of 
Ras Al Khaimah (RAKBANK) 
to develop a new blockchain 
based trade finance solution.

AMAZON WEB SERVICES (AWS) 
DIRECT CONNECT PARTNERSHIP

Etisalat has partnered with AWS to 
offer secure and private connectivity to 
customers for accessing Direct Connect 
in the UAE region. Businesses in the UAE 
can now transfer critical data directly 
to the cloud using AWS Direct Connect 
from their data centre or colocation 
environment and bypass the public 
internet. As AWS is the key enabler 
of hyper-scale computing, Etisalat’s 
customers will experience an optimum 
level of throughput performance and 
high availability when using AWS 
Cloud. Etisalat will deliver high-speed, 
dedicated connectivity ensuring low- 
latency, consistent network experience, 
and robust security for customers.

SMILES APP
The Etisalat Smiles App is a powerful 
loyalty programme offering reward points, 
discounts and deals across a wide range 
of brands and outlets from categories 
like Dining, Shopping, Travel, Wellness, 
Entertainment as well as Telecom services.

Our ambition is to make the Smiles App 
the most widely used lifestyle application 
in the UAE. To achieve this, we launched 
a block-chain powered rewards exchange 
feature enabling customers to keep track 
of their loyalty points and exchange points 
between one another. As of the end of 
2020, the Smiles App exceeded two million 
unique users and has continued to expand 
its reach with over 1,000 partners across 
4,000 different outlets in the UAE.

ROBOTIC CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE

Innovation is embedded in our operations and is an integral element in providing a digital experience to the 
consumer. Etisalat’s Robotic Centre of Excellence is aimed at delivering a wide variety of automated solutions to 
boost efficiency and improve productivity leading to greater customer satisfaction.

The centre currently has 141 robots, compared to 122 in 2019, which have saved over 171,000 manhours. The 
introduction of robotic process automation is part of Etisalat’s endeavour to drive the digital future and empower 
society in line with the UAE Vision 2021. 

As we move further into the digital age, there is a growing need to turn towards emerging technologies to streamline 
operations and inject greater efficiency into our business processes. The opening of Etisalat’s Robotic Centre of 
Excellence addresses the evolving needs of our customers, with robotic process automation services improving overall 
efficiency, speed, and accuracy of our back-office teams, with the aim of further enhancing customer satisfaction.

Robotic process automation releases back-office agents from repetitive, mundane tasks to concentrate on high value 
activities that cannot be robotised. Software robots are supporting back-office agents to complete repetitive tasks 
70% faster.

DIGITALISATION AMIDST COVID-19

In 2020, the acquisition of digital and cybersecurity 
assets increased, in response to customers’ needs 
during the lockdown. This improved Etisalat’s digital 
capabilities, which will eventually lead to new digital 
offerings. We are also investing in AI tools and data 
analytics to improve business operations and increase 
organisational agility.

The demand for digital solutions, data centres and 
cloud computing increased for both corporate and 
government entities. We are leveraging our existing 
capabilities and broadband connectivity to provide 
more comprehensive solutions to these segments.

As part of our digitisation efforts, we have set the 
following targets to achieve by 2021:

• 55% of orders raised via our digital channels.
• 90% of digital payments allocation.
• 35% reduction in calls landing to agents by 

implementing digital self-serve options.

Our customer satisfaction is measured by TRIM Scores 
and the Retail Satisfaction Score. TRIM is a satisfaction 
tool that measures organisational performance and 
customer preference in terms of index points.Our TRIM 
Scores have shown consistent improvement year on 
year, with the 2020 scores being higher than 2019 by 
1%. The retail satisfaction score refers to the customer 
satisfaction across the Etisalat retail stores. It is also 
captured on a 5-point scale (extremely dissatisfied to 
extremely satisfied). This year our retail satisfaction 
score was 4.24 on a 5-point scale. Furthermore, the call 
centre productivity achieved 83.7% in the number of 
first call resolutions compared to its target of 81.3%.

We work tirelessly to meet and exceed our customers’ 
expectations. We are always striving to improve and 
simplify our processes to serve customers better, provide 
multiple channels for convenient access to services, and 
attend to customer needs in a timely manner.

Our Customer Experience (CX) Committee is dedicated 
to enhancing customer experience. Etisalat Chief 
Executive Officers (CXOs) serve on the committee 
which annually reviews customer related projects, 
known as Go to Market (GTM). We set targets against 
key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer 
segments, customer touch points and processes and 
systems and technologies to continually improve our 
performance and the satisfaction of our customers. 

In the year 2020, the CX committee and GTM has 
focused on the digital transformation initiatives to 
introduce a wide range of products and services on 
Etisalat’s digital channels that can be provisioned on 
an end-to-end basis. This allows us to monitor trends 
related to customer experience and satisfaction and 
develop strategic plans to ensure that we meet and 
exceed our set targets. 

To ensure our offerings address our customers’ needs, 
the Etisalat Product Marketing team consistently 
analyse global telecom trends, customer usage 
behaviour and sales performance analytics to design and 

update new and existing features. Sales representatives 
undergo regular training to ensure that best practices 
are followed and implemented. 

At the Etisalat customer-facing channels such as sales 
agents are trained to explore customer needs and 
requirements before recommending the best-fit product 
or service. The Etisalat Customer Journey guidelines aid 
sales agents by utilising the Sales Excellence 5-point 
framework, which aims to provide an effective and 
efficient customer experience. This requires sales agents 
to be completely transparent when they discuss key 
terms and conditions with customers. 

We deploy a “Customer Feedback Management System” 
which measures customer satisfaction across customer 
care, sales, digital and self-serve channels, and technical 
performance. Feedback can be collected via SMS,

SMART STORES

Our Smart Store initiative has digitally and 
ergonomically transformed existing stores and those 
opening in new locations across the UAE. Since its 
launch, it has focused on offering customers a more 
personalised experience whilst improving the quality 
services. In 2020, our aim was to provide a brand-
new retail experience with a strong focus on self-
service to ease the convenience for our customers. In 
2020, we enhanced the digital capability of our smart 
stores to allow for automated Subscriber Identity 
Module (SIM) replacements, and the generation of 
new prepaid lines, digitally.

Our next generation digital concept stores 
incorporate multiple digital touchpoints, empowering 
customers to explore and subscribe to Etisalat 
products and services. These stores allow our 
customers to undertake end to end transactions 
digitally, while enjoying a unique shopping experience 
via our latest digital touch points. Turning the store 
from its traditional common setup of fixed counters 
into a totally new experience built on mobility is 
a real breakthrough in telecom retail industry and 
breaking the traditional boundaries. In 2020, we 
opened 10 new digital stores across the UAE.

MYSTERY SHOPPING PROGRAMME 

The Etisalat Mystery Shopping Programme is continual 
improvement plan to enhance Etisalat customers 
experience through the evaluation of the entire 
customer journey process including the evaluation 
of the quality of products and services, facilities, and 
operation across all types of customer touch points 
(direct channels, indirect channels, and customer 
care).

The Programme measures compliance of retail store 
staff against the Etisalat Customer Journey guidelines. 
Mystery visits to Etisalat stores are carried out by 
undercover staff to assess performance based on 
the staff members compliance with the Etisalat 
Customer Journey guidelines. This Programme allows 
us to better understand our customers’ needs and 
meet their expectations. In 2020, we also monitored 
the implementation of the COVID-19 precautionary 
measures in place across our retail stores to ensure 
the safety of our people and our customers. We have 
also created a dedicated Retail Quality Field and Retail 
Quality Management team which are responsible for 
monitoring and ensuring adherence and compliance 
with the guidelines, standards, and policies of Etisalat 
across our retail stores.

In 2020, the mystery shopping average score was 
92%, whereas in 2019 the average score was 91%. 
The Mystery Shopping Programme has a pre-
determined set of goals and objectives concerning 
enhancement of customer experience. The aim of the 
Programme is to achieve continual improvement to 
enhance Etisalat customers experience throughout the 
evaluation of all customer journey stages.

ADDRESSING CUSTOMER 
ISSUES

To ensure our customers receive the support they need, 
we ensure that customer complaints can be received 
through various accessible channels, including retail, 
inbound voice calls, and inbound non-voice calls, which 
include chat, email, and social media platforms. All 
complaints are registered in the Customer Interaction 
Management System (CIM), and the relevant data is 
collected and verified.

Complaints are classified into three categories – 
Technical, Billing and Customer Service. Technical 
complaints are further classified into fixed and non-
fixed. Non fixed technical complaints are transferred 
to the expert desk for faster resolution. Fixed technical 
complaints are shared with engineering team for 
corrective action. For each category of complaint there 
are standard operating procedures to be followed as per 
the nature of the issue. In all cases, the resolution is 
communicated back to the customer, and once satisfied, 
the complaint is closed in the CIM.

The number of customer complaints continue to 
fall year on year. In 2020, the number of customer 
complaints decreased by 7% from the previous year, 
with over 94% of customer complaints resolved. 

COVID-19 CUSTOMER  
ENGAGEMENT RESPONSE

Considering the COVID-19 circumstances and 
to ensure the satisfaction of our customers, we 
implemented a series of initiatives to assist our 
customers in adapting to the new circumstances. 

Etisalat’s website and Mobile App were upgraded to 
accommodate customers’ requirements through the 
digital platform, with various sales features available. 
Customers were provided access to numerous services 
through the digital channels, offering a customised 
sales approach. Purchases, smart pay options and 
exclusive promotions were made available through 
these channels. 

The customer experience was also improved through 
several online tools such as an interactive voice 
response (IVR) messaging service, which encourages 
usage of the mobile app. Tech support and self-service 
options over IVR are helping to sustain very high 
call centre traffic volumes. Customer care enabled 
smart services to empower customers via AI virtual 
assistance and automated self-support. For more 
information regarding these features, please refer to 
Digitisation.

We offered our customers free upgrade options for 
higher connectivity packages, free access to superior 
entertainment options, complimentary access to 
educational websites and remote learning applications 
for students, waving of internet calling plan fees, 
and a wide array of attractive new Smiles App offers 
aimed at encouraging people to stay indoors. Through 
these initiatives we provided over AED 2.5 billion 
worth of value to market and communities. 

Overall, Etisalat demonstrated resilience and ensured 
uninterrupted delivery of high-quality services 
during an unprecedented global pandemic. We found 
meaningful ways to contribute to the societies. The 
pandemic forced Etisalat to adapt to the new market 
environment quickly and to tap into new business 
opportunities with customers, vendors, government 
authorities and co-workers. One of the opportunities 
that emerged during this time was the need for digital 
internal processes and reporting. This digital adoption 
was accelerated during the year and is expected to 
improve efficiency and cost savings over the long 
term. Customer behaviours and preferences also 
changed significantly because of the lockdown. Digital 
channels became the primary means of engaging with 
customers during the pandemic. The shift to more 
online sales will improve the customer experience and 
ultimately result in fewer shops and points of sale 
(POSs).

Customer Privacy 
& Data Security

Etisalat management understands the importance 
of information security and has made it a strategic 
objective to protect our customers’ personal information 
and maintain their privacy. Our Privacy Policy has been 
formulated to assist customers in understanding how 
their personal information is treated in Etisalat.

To measure and ensure compliance, we have several 
privacy and security KPIs set across the various domains 
and departments, including the maintaining of 100% 
availability (‘uptime’) of security controls, maintaining 
zero open Critical and High-Severity vulnerabilities, and 
maintaining zero security attacks and breaches that 
could impact Etisalat business (such as revenue loss, 
reputation impact and service availability).

INFORMATION SECURITY STEERING 
COMMITTEE
Our long running executive-level “Information Security 
Steering Committee” oversees information security of 
Etisalat and ensures the continuous enhancement of 
cyber security controls to protect customers’ data and 
protect the wider business. The committee is responsible 
for suggesting new security controls, creating, and 
updating security policies and arranging for security 
training and awareness for our staff. Essentially, 
the committee is responsible for managing six main 
functions, which include IT security, network security, 
physical security, personnel security, security, and 
security policy development and implementation. 

The Etisalat Chief Information Officer (CIO) leads the 
Information Security Steering Committee and provides 
guidance and support to the committee’s members. 
The role of the Etisalat CIO includes the approval of IT 
security budgets to enhance the security infrastructure 
and guide the security team in implementing new 

Sustainability Report 2020 25Together Towards a Sustainable Future24

https://www.etisalat.ae/en/footer/privacy-policy.jsp


projects and initiatives. The CIO also approves new 
security training and awareness programs for IT 
staff and established IT governance programmes to 
promote information security in alignment with the 
Etisalat corporate governance objectives. The CIO is 
ultimately responsible to ensure that all corporate and 
business projects and new systems are including and 
incorporating the required security controls as per the 
best security practices. 

In 2020, Etisalat management have updated the terms 
of reference for the security steering committee and 
added new groups: the Etisalat Cyber Security Advisory 
Board, where its members are the CXOs of the concerned 
technical and business departments and the Security 
Steering Committee Working Group, which include 
subject matter experts as members from the concerned 
departments.  The Cyber Security Advisory Board 
sets aligns and monitors security initiatives, security 
performance indices and approves security strategy 
and policies. The Security Steering Committee Working 
Group discusses the progress of security initiatives and 
challenges to safeguard customer’s data on a quarterly 
basis. 

Finally, employees who fail to comply with privacy 
policies and requirements disciplinary action. The 
data protection policy is clearly stated in our Code 
of Conduct and our disciplinary measures regarding 
employee personal conduct and disciplinary actions are 
clearly stated in the Human Resources (HR) manual. 
The significant aspects of these documents are publicly 
available on the corporate website. There are no cases to 
report on Data Privacy issues.

We ensure clear and transparent communication with 
all customers. Each customer reviews the terms and 
conditions outlined within their respective contracts 
prior to proceeding with any requests, changes, 
account creations, or any other account modifications. 
Our employees are trained to explain all the terms 
and conditions to ensure full visibility of agreements 
with customers prior to signing any agreements. 
All agreements are filed in the Etisalat system and 
a customer copy is shared electronically with the 
customer. Staff – customer interactions are recorded 

and monitored to ensure that all employees abide by 
the Etisalat rules, regulations, and standard operating 
processes.

This year, Etisalat announced the acquisition of Help 
AG, one of the leading cyber security companies in the 
MENA region. This move will enhance and diversify 
Etisalat’s security digital portfolio and will accelerate the 
growth of its existing cyber security activities.

SECURITY POLICIES
Etisalat’s corporate security policies address 
cybersecurity aspects related to our business 
environment which are reviewed on a regular basis. The 
Etisalat IT Security Management Framework covers five 
key focus areas including data security, access security, 
host security, network perimeter and security monitoring. 

The Information Security Steering Committee has 

developed a series of security policies covering all 
security domains to support our operations and ensure 
the protection of information assets in terms of 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The Steering 
Committee has developed 36 security policies covering 
all the security domains to enable Etisalat business and 
ensure the protection of the information assets in terms 
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In terms of 
data protection and customer privacy, Etisalat has the 
following 13 policies in place:

LOOKING AHEAD
The Etisalat cybersecurity team has set a series 
of ambitious KPIs to be implemented across the 
organisation in 2021, including: 

 � Maintaining 100% availability (uptime) of all 
security controls.

 � Maintaining zero open critical and high-severity 
vulnerabilities.

 � Maintaining zero security attacks and breaches 
that could impact Etisalat business (revenue loss, 
reputation impact, service availability).

 � Maintaining minimum time to respond and close the 
critical security incidents.

 � Maintaining a minimum of 90% security patch 
coverage.

ASSESSMENT AND COMPLIANCE 
Etisalat’s Privacy Policy and Etisalat’s Code of Conduct, 
include a dedicated section on customer privacy. 

To ensure the continuous effectiveness of Etisalat’s 
privacy and security management system, we undertake 
quarterly internal audits and penetration testing 
covering application security, security operation 
processes, penetration testing, effectiveness of internal 
and external security controls and user access reviews. 
We also engage a third-party firm to conduct external 
audits on an annual basis.

Across Etisalat, we ensure full compliance with the 
UAE cyber security standard developed by the Signals 
Intelligence Agency (SIA). The standard is comprised of 
188 controls covering all management and technical 
security controls. We regularly perform external and 
internal assessments of Etisalat’s cybersecurity protocols. 
We also comply with the Telecommunication and Digital 
Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA) requirements, 
National Cyber Risk Management Framework (NCRMF) 
and the National Electronic Security Authority (NESA) 
regulations and guidelines.

In 2020, the UAE Government initiated annual security 
audits for the telecommunication sector organisations, 
which is managed by SIA. The aim of the audit is to 

measure and assess the cyber security maturity of the 
organisations. The audit included external penetration 
testing, internal penetration testing and vulnerability 
assessment, compromise assessment, governance, risk 
and compliance assessment, physical and personnel 
security audits. 

We also receive regular incident information including 
potential threat attached around the world from the 
Dubai Electronic Security Centre (DESC) which allows us 
to take proactive measures to strengthen our security 
protocols and infrastructure systems. 

As part of Data Sovereignty Etisalat’s Smart Security Solutions Division mandates that all customer data shall be 
stored within the UAE country borders. We have signed partnerships with Oracle and Microsoft to establish their 
Public Cloud Data Centres in UAE to service Etisalat and its customers. 

In addition, Etisalat has implemented several controls to ensure customer data protection and privacy maintenance 
such as advanced threat protection, email anti-phishing, i.e., Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and 
Conformance (DMARC), privilege access management and mobile device management.

We provide employees with specialised training 
regarding privacy, including data protection, cyber 
security, information security, hacking, and cloud 
computing. Employees are made aware of information 
security guidelines and compliance. We take disciplinary 
action against employees who violate customer and data 
privacy.

In 2020, we conducted various awareness security 
campaigns our staff across the UAE, which included 
the annual security roadshow which involves 
external security experts, regular awareness raising 
communication for Etisalat employees regarding data 

protection and security measures and the early warning 
awareness messaging for global and international 
cyber security incidents. We also conducted site visits 
to workplaces to assess the staff security awareness 
and compliance and implemented a new system for 
simulating the email phishing attacks to measure the 
level of user security awareness and response across 
Etisalat.

We undertake various training courses and certification 
programs for all employees across both technical and 
non-technical areas, including:

Etisalat Digital Academy 
offering security data, 

operation and maintenance 
training, penetration 

testing and ethical hacking, 
security architecture,

DISASTER RECOVERY AND BUSINESS 
CONTINUITY REHEARSALS

We arrange annual campaigns for disaster recovery 
and business continuity rehearsals, focusing on our 
critical services and systems. The rehearsals include 
cyber security scenarios that simulate massive 
virus outbreaks, unavailability of data centres, 
infrastructure, and critical services. 

The outcomes of the rehearsals and simulations are 
shared with stakeholders with an action plan and 
recommendations for improvement.

To strengthen our defences and share resources and best 
practices, we partner with other organisations to address 
a range of complex challenges associated with security 
and risk management. Internally, multiple teams within 
Etisalat are responsible for monitoring, controlling, and 
preventing breaches or any attempts of breaches related 
to the customer privacy and confidentiality. We have 
a dedicated security operation centre monitoring user 
activity and any external potential threats.

We have participated in the Global Telco Security 
alliance along with other major telecom providers 
including Telefonica, Singtel, Softbank and AT&T. The 
alliance is one of the world’s biggest cybersecurity 
providers and it is aimed at transferring knowledge and 
sharing best practices in cyber security. 

In 2020, the number of attempted cyber-attacks 
decreased by 77% compared to the previous year, while 
actual number of cyber-attacks and data breaches 
remained at zero over the past three years. This attests 
to Etisalat’s processes and to the stringent measures 
in place to protect customer information and combat 
cyber-attacks.

COVID-19 IMPACTS ON ETISALAT CYBERSECURITY 

Etisalat was no exception to the challenges faced due to COVID-19. 
Several trials and tribulations were faced, that required immediate action 
for business continuity. As remote working came into play, all employees 
required corporate workstations that would be suitable for Etisalat business 
applications. Contact centre teams in UAE, India and Egypt required voice 
services while working remotely. We also had the imminent threat of 
cyber-attacks and email phishing – we detected several hacking attempts 
for stealing personal data of Etisalat customers. 

To overcome the COVID-19 challenges, Etisalat created several task forces 
and working groups to resolve the issues. CIT has had a major role in 
enabling Etisalat continues operations without any interruption. We were 
able to successfully provide secure and scalable remote access service were 
provided to up to 25,000 users concurrently. A Zero-Trust infrastructure 
was set up, using the concept of Secure Virtual Office (SVO) for running 
business applications remotely and securely. Additionally, we rolled out 
Microsoft Teams for all Etisalat employees to support remote audio and 
video conferencing services and, Cisco Jabber that enabled the employees 
to receive direct phone calls form clients. The well-established IT Security 
infrastructure and incident response procedures have successfully protected 
the organisation and achieved a record of zero cyber-attacks.

Etisalat is committed to creating an optimal governance 
environment for its business and activities by 
committing itself to the best local and international 
governance rules throughout its operations. The 
telecommunications sector is fast-paced and ever-
evolving, which is why Etisalat uses effective governance 
criteria that allow our operations to run smoothly with 
an integrated system of policies and mechanisms. 

Etisalat operates through several transparency 
platforms among which include the media and press 
announcements, the ADX disclosure website, and 
the Etisalat website which articulates the company’s 
information and disclosures as well as the Etisalat 
Governance Report. Etisalat’s Governance Report serves 
as the most important platform for transparency and 
interaction with the public. Governance is embodied 
in an array of rules and measures under which the 
company is run and controlled. It regulates the relations 
between the Board of Directors, executive management, 
shareholders, and other stakeholders. Moreover, 
governance handles corporate social responsibility with 
due attention. This report brings governance to the 
attention of the public and enables shareholders to get 
acquainted with the company. 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Eleven members make up the Board of Directors. All 
board members, including the Chairman, are non-
executive and independent. The Board members and 
their first of a kind shareholding is annually disclosed in 
the Etisalat Corporate Governance Report.

At Etisalat, we know how important it is to have 
a diverse Board of Directors. Currently, female 
representation at the board level stands at 9.1%. We are 
open to both genders’ nomination to Board directorship; 
however, there were no new female nominees during 
Etisalat’s Board election for its current term.”

This year, the Board of Directors held eight meetings. 
he Etisalat Board of Directors undertakes an annual 
evaluation including consideration of Etisalat Group’s 
performance which reviews ESG elements. 

We have a comprehensive set of policies that serve 
as the governance framework for Etisalat’s Board of 
Directors, including Board Membership Policy, External 
Auditor Policy, Insider Security Trading Policy, Policy 
of Holding Shareholders General Assembly, Dividend 
Policy, Board Members Conflict of Interest Policy, Board 
Confidential Information Disclosure Policy and Policy of 
Transactions with Related Parties. 

BOARD COMMITTEES
Three committees assist the Board of Directors to 
effectively run the company and allow for a streamlined 
management structure and approach. Each committee 
is governed by its own charter that defines functions, 
constitutional mechanisms, conditions governing 
meetings, meeting quorum and decision making.
 
Board remunerations are linked to targets of revenue 
compensation and set a ceiling for such remunerations 
so as not to exceed 0.5% of last financial year’s net 
profit after deducting the amortisations and reserves. 
The remuneration of Board members is a lump 
sum amount calculated in accordance with Board 
Remuneration Policy and submitted to the General 
Assembly for approval via Board recommendation.

Further, Etisalat makes various disclosures among 
which are.  the executives’ pay and the related party 
transactions. For this purpose, we have two platforms 
of disclosure which include the Corporate Governance 
Report and Etisalat Annual Report. The Etisalat 2020 
Corporate Governance Report provided the details of 
the first and second lines of executives’ pay and stated 
that no related party transaction were conducted in 
2020 in accordance with provisions that govern such 
transactions in Securities and Commodities Authority 
Chairman Resolution No. 3 (Chairman) of 2020 on the 
approval of Public Joint Stock Companies Governance 
Guide (“Governance Guide”). On the other hand. Etisalat 
disclosed in its Annual Report, the disclosure of the 
related party transactions based on the criteria that 
govern such transactions in IFRS.

Our commitment to combat corruption and bribery 
is reflected not only in the Code of Conduct, but also 
in the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gifts, 
Entertainment and Hospitality Policy, Conflicts of 
Interest Policy, and Due Diligence and Engagement 
Policy. All employees must attest to having read 
the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gifts, 
Entertainment and Hospitality Policy, Conflicts of 
Interest Policy, and Due Diligence and Engagement 
Policy. To ensure all employees are aware of, and 
understand the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, 
we launched an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
awareness campaign and developed an Anti-Bribery and 
Anti-Corruption e-learning module which all employees 
are required to complete. All new staff joining Etisalat 
are also required to sign the “acknowledgement and 
disclosure statement of conflict of interest and business 
ethics”. This statement includes a clause for employees 
not to commit or partake in any form of bribery and 
corruption. 

We also require our business partners to meet standards 
of all applicable laws and regulations as well as ethical 
principles. We strive to work only with ethical partners 
with good reputations.

We undertake risk assessments to ensure compliance with 
all rules and regulations that form part of applicable UAE 
and international laws within the scope of the Corporate 
Compliance program. 

In 2020, we conducted an Anti-Bribery and Anti-
Corruption risk assessment to identify the areas of 
Etisalat’s business that are most vulnerable to bribery 
risks. Our Corporate Compliance function works with 
high-risk business units to improve their controls and 
train employees in these business units to heighten their 
awareness of bribery and corruption issues. We carry out 
the risk assessment on a regular basis to ensure we are 
aware of new and emerging bribery and corruption risks in 
our business and supply chain. 

We have also launched a Gifts, Entertainment and 
Hospitality Register, and require all employees to 
log requests to give or receive gifts, or to provide 
entertainment or hospitality to guests. 

ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES
We promote fair competition and are committed to 
combat anti-competitive practices and behaviour in line 
with applicable legislations and regulations. In 2020, 
no claims were raised against Etisalat UAE for anti-
competitive behaviour, anti-trust, or monopoly practices.

In addition to the training and awareness sessions 
provided to staff as part of our compliance governance 
framework, we also conduct mandatory tailored 
awareness sessions and knowledge-based learning 
covering competition topics in line with fair competition 
policies, practices, and procedures which cover the full 
spectrum of the legal and regulatory landscape.

ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE
Corporate Compliance provides reasonable assurance 
with applicable laws and regulations including the Code 
of Conduct, Anti-Bribery & Anti-Corruption, Conflict 
of Interest, Gifts, Entertainment & Hospitality, Due 
Diligence & Engagement. The Corporate Compliance 
team also drafts, and updates polices, develops 
monitoring and control mechanisms, and training 
programs, to ensure Etisalat’s employees and third 
parties comply with ethical conduct.

We are fully committed to doing business in accordance 
with the highest standards of ethics and integrity, with 
professional business principles and in compliance 
with legal and regulatory rules and standards. To 
protect Etisalat’s reputation, foster business and stay 
competitive in markets in which we operate, we to 
national and international laws and standards. 

We provide all the necessary guidance to the Etisalat 
departments and employees on inquiries related to 
compliance topics. We regularly review, assess, and 
implement audits on control and risk management 
systems to ensure our policies are accurately 
implemented across the organisation. 

CODE OF CONDUCT 
Our publicly available Code of Conduct covers topics 
such as bribery and corruption, gifts, entertainment and 
hospitality, conflict of interest, and money laundering 
and is communicated to all employees. The Code 
of Conduct extends to everyone (including but not 
limited to employees, directors, contractors, suppliers) 
working for and with Etisalat, independent of role, rank/
responsibility requiring them to comply with the Code 
in their day-to-day operations and take actions that will 
preserve the trust that our customers and society place 
with us. All employees are required to attest to having 
read and acknowledge the Code of Conduct each year. 
We also conduct an online Code of Conduct awareness 
campaign each year to educate all our employees on 
the Code of Conduct. We expect our suppliers and third 
parties to uphold the same standards and to act ethically 
as set out in the Code of Conduct. 

We undertake risk assessments to ensure compliance 
with all rules and regulations that form part of 
applicable UAE and international laws within the scope 
of the Corporate Compliance programme. 

We have an ongoing and professional working 
relationship with the TDRA and all other relevant 
industry stakeholders. In addition, we participate in 
industry consultations and ensure that all departments 
are aware of any changes to the existing regulatory 
landscape. Moreover, we take part in industry group 
meetings with the regulatory authority relating to future 
market changes and developments.

Mandatory training sessions are regularly provided to 
all employees working in departments covering the 
legal and regulatory landscape, thus, helping us achieve 
greater awareness on the compliance governance 
policies and controls. To ensure awareness of compliance 
governance policies throughout the organisation we 
select Compliance Partners for each department at 
Etisalat and engage with them regularly throughout 
the year and through an annual Corporate Compliance 
Partner gathering. These Compliance Partners are in 
turn responsible for guiding their peers on compliance 
governance. We organised another edition of our annual 
Corporate Compliance away day, at which three highly 
respected compliance and investigations professionals 
addressed our entire Senior Management and several 
mid-level managers on topical ethics and compliance 
issues. 

TRANSPARENCY, ANTI-CORRUPTION AND 
ANTI-BRIBERY
Etisalat has zero tolerance for corruption or bribery and 
is committed to maintaining an effective compliance 
programme to address bribery and corruption risks. 

During 2020, Deloitte Audit and consulting 
completed an audit on behalf of Etisalat 
Internal Audit of the Anti-Bribery and 
Anti-Corruption (ABAC) program, across 
our operations.  The audit covered the 
comprehensiveness & completeness of 
policies & procedures, risk assessment, 
compliance maturity assessments, training 
& awareness programs, and reporting 
& investigation. Recommendations for 
improvement were provided and plans of 
action were put in place being monitored by 
Group Compliance.

Etisalat has a Corporate 
Compliance Steering 
Committee, which consists 
of 10 CxOs. The Committee  
focuses on all major ethics 
and compliance issues and 
meets on a quarterly basis.

Etisalat has in place a 
mandatory anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption training 
program focusing on ethical 
business conduct. As of 
March 2021, 85% of all FTEs 
and PTEs have completed 
the training. In addition, a 
mandatory refresher Code of 
Conduct Training Module will 
be launched in May 2021.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY 
VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES
Etisalat abides by the UAE TDRA regulations. Each year, 
the TDRA audits Etisalat’s operations and performance. 
In our latest audit, Etisalat scored excellently.  

Each year, the TDRA holds the Sada Al Barq exercise for 
the National Emergency Telecommunication Plan. This 
exercise comes under the framework of the initiative 
“Telecom business continuity in emergency, crisis and 
disaster”, which serves TDRA’s strategic goal in the 
UAE and helps implement a regulatory framework that 
stimulates competition and develops the quality of 
services provided. Sada Al Barq has gauged the sector’s 
readiness to handle unexpected, unusual, and concurrent 
events, to show efficiency of procedures and viability of 
operations with emergencies and crises and demonstrate 
the ability to deal with unusual and concurrent 

circumstances. In this year’s Sada Al Barq exercise, 
Etisalat achieved excellent compliance. 

In 2020, there were 36 incidents of non-compliance 
with telecommunications laws and regulations, which 
is a 33% decrease from the previous year. The fines 
and settlements relating to these violations amounted 
to AED 13 million – a 32% reduction compared to the 
previous year. Of the 36 incidents, 25 were related to 
non-compliance of mobile SIM registrations and the 
remaining 11 were related to the operations of retail 
channels, consumer protection regulations, mobile 
number portability, numbering, and other regulations 
to do with mobile device theft prevention, spoofing and 
mobile spam. Etisalat has allocated these resources to 
address the violations to the satisfaction of the TRA. This 
includes implementing adequate controls to eliminate 
recurrence of any such violations.

COMBATTING FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES
To prevent revenue leakages, Etisalat’s Revenue Assurance Function has a dedicated Fraud Management team, 
responsible for monitoring and addressing subscription fraud and revenue leakage. 

As part of the Anti-Fraud Programme, we conduct employee training and awareness campaigns that cover the risks 
of fraudulent activities and equip employees with the knowledge and skills to detect fraudulent transactions.

HUMAN RIGHTS

Etisalat is a UNGC signatory and upholds its support 
to the UNGC’s 10 principles that are derived from 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio 
Declaration on Environment and Development, and the 
United Nations Convention Against Corruption. 

We follow a zero-tolerance commitment with regards 
to human rights violation within our value chain. 
We reserve the right to terminate business with 
suppliers that breach these policies as well as suppliers 
that fail to take corrective action within an agreed 
timeline. Further information regarding human rights 
assessments in the supply chain are provided in Supply 
Chain Management.

Our regulatory and commercial functions operate on a continuous basis with cross-departmental teams dedicated 
to achieving on-going regulatory compliance requirements to the UAE Regulatory Framework. In 2020, the number 
of inquiries, complaints, or issues received by the legal and compliance office through an internal monitoring or 
reporting system dropped by 85% - with only two cases received, which were handled in accordance with Etisalat 
policies and management processes.

WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY

Our whistleblowing process monitors and reports any 
potential non-compliance incidents.It is a formal 
antonymous whistle blowing system with legal protection 
which include Board approved policies that guarantee 
complete anonymity to the whistle blower as protection. 
The policy is also in compliance to UAE laws and regulations 
including Federal Law no. 14 of 2020, which protects 
witnesses including those who are giving information about 
violations and crimes. The process promotes openness in the 
workplace and encourages employees to report instances of 
unethical behaviour, actual or suspected fraud, and violation 
of Etisalat’s policies, processes. The received information 
is classified to check for source, and frequency. In turn, 
this enables an appropriate and timely recommendation 
or remediation strategy. The process is outlined within the 
Etisalat Whistleblowing Policy which was reviewed in 2020 
to ensure compliance with organisational changes and 
current best practices.

Employees are encouraged to report on issues such as 
financial or non-financial maladministration or malpractice 
or fraud that has been or is likely to be committed, unethical 

behaviour, misuse of authority, leakage of confidential 
Information, non-compliance with laws and regulations, 
favouring a specific supplier/contractor, discrimination 
against any member of staff or customers on grounds of sex, 
race, or nationality. 

In 2020, a total of 52 reports were received by the Internal 
Control & Audit department through the whistleblowing 
channels, compared to 59 received in 2019 and 57 received 
in 2018. A total of 2 concerns were received by the legal 
department through an internal monitoring or reporting 
system, compared to 13 raised in 2019 and 24 concerns 
raised in 2018.

Sustainability Report 2020 41Together Towards a Sustainable Future40



At Etisalat, we recognise that the management of 
risk is fundamental to the way we do business We 
regularly identify, assess, monitor, and review the key 
risks that could materially affect our business, financial 
performance, and reputation in line with the well-
defined and established Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) framework. 

Through our ERM policy and Framework, we effectively 
manage and mitigate risk throughout the Group. The 
Board of Directors provide direction to the senior 
management by setting Etisalat Group’s risk appetite. 
The Board delegates the ownership and responsibility for 
operating risk management and control to the Etisalat 
Group CEO and senior management. 

The ERM function engages with teams across the Group 
to maintain risk management practices in line with the 
Board approved Group-wide internal control Charter, 
Policies, and frameworks. The Internal Control function 
provides management and the Audit Committee with 
reasonable assurance that the significant risks affecting 
the organisation are identified, assessed and where 
appropriate, mitigated. It allows the management and 
committee to increase efficiency and effectiveness of 
operations, assist in decision making and create greater 
risk awareness.

Annual internal audit plans are aligned with the top 
risks to ensure adequate assurance is provided in the 
fiscal year. The annual plan is reviewed and updated 
regularly through a formal process to address any 
changes to the organisation’s risk profile.

The ERM framework is aligned to international best 
practices. We follow the ‘three lines of defence’ 
model to define the roles and responsibilities for risk 
ownership and management. We also have a Risk 
Appetite statement that classifies and rates top risks 
facing our business. These risks, along with any new and 
emerging risks, are reviewed on a quarterly basis at the 
ERM Committee (ERMC) meetings. The ERMC, meets 
on a regular basis to review important risk-related 
information. Summary risk reports are given to the Audit 
Committee for consideration. 

BUSINESS CONTINUITY & ENTERPRISE RISK 
MANAGEMENT 

COVID-29 BUSINESS CONTINUITY 
RESPONSE

As COVID-19 continues to have unprecedented impacts 
on the global economy, we are compelled to rely on 
sustainable strategies for operations. Etisalat stands in 
support of the UAE government and the international 
community during these uncertain times.

At the start of the pandemic, Etisalat immediately 
reviewed its health and safety control measures to ensure 
that business and services could continue to operate, 
and customers remained served. Across Etisalat, we have 
achieved ISO 22301:2019 certification for Business 
Continuity, which allows the organisation to maintain 
operations during disruptions.

The necessary precautions and preventive measures 
were taken at Etisalat’s premises, and a remote working 
arrangement was implemented for staff. Etisalat’s shops 
were closed temporarily, and sales were moved online 
to digital channels. As restrictions started to ease, 
company-operated stores were gradually re-opened. A 
new touchless retail approach was instituted to ensure the 
safety of employees and customers.

Etisalat implemented the required precautionary measures 
in place in accordance with top management directives 
and in line with UAE Government guidelines. We also 
collaborated with NCEMA and the TDRA to review and 
enhance business continuity regulatory requirements. 
We also enhanced our technological infrastructure to 
facilitate remote working.

The following is a breakdown of some of the significant threats across Etisalat’s various operations and how these 
threats are being managed:

 Type Risk Description Management

Strategic 
Challenges

Geo-political 
Threats

Ongoing geo-political uncertainty pose 
continuous challenges. 

We manage this by leveraging local expertise and knowledge 
to combat these challenges. Moreover, the security of local 
employees is proactively managed.

Macro-economic 
Conditions

Changes in regional and global economic 
conditions within several markets continues to 
present challenges.

Fluctuating economic factors are considered during the annual 
financial budgeting and planning processes. Ongoing analysis 
and review of market conditions are regularly assessed within 
key markets.

Over-the-Top 
(OTT) Operators

The presence of OTT operators is a common 
threat across the telecommunications industry 
that affects mobile voice revenues in several 
Etisalat’s more mature mobile markets.

The increase in the use of VoIP applications is 
cannibalising traditional telecom operators’ 
revenues.

Various commercial strategies in response to such OTT threats 
are considered and implemented by respective commercial 
teams across Etisalat.

Operational 
threats

COVID-19 
Pandemic Risk

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the risks of its prolonged effects on 
Etisalat’s business operations

COVID-19 mitigation strategies are centrally coordinated and 
cover staff and customer safety, business continuity, social 
responsibility, and financial sustainability.

Cybersecurity
The threat of external cyber-attacks across 
the Etisalat network and IT infrastructure is 
ever-present.

Network and IT security teams proactively monitor activity 
across our networks to identify and mitigate possible 
cybersecurity threats and data privacy breaches.

Competition and 
Pricing Pressures

The markets in which Etisalat operates are 
characterised by high levels of competition 
(existing and new), pricing pressure, 
technology substitution, market and product 
convergence, and customer churn.

Etisalat closely analyses and monitors the trends within these 
markets and invests in its networks, products, and service 
offerings to compete effectively. The growth and development 
of digital products and services is a further means of managing 
diverse competitive threats.

Service Continuity

The sustained continuity of Etisalat’s network 
across all its operating companies is vital 
to its continued success. Etisalat faces the 
threats of disruption, malfunction, and loss 
or damage to network infrastructure due 
to natural disasters or other uncontrollable 
events.

Etisalat has established a Business Continuity Management 
team to develop and test business continuity plans and crisis 
management arrangements. Insurance policies are also in place 
to make provision for infrastructure property damage.

Compliance 
challenges Regulatory 

Challenges and 
Uncertainties

As the Etisalat Group operates in various 
diverse and developing markets, it faces 
ongoing regulatory and legal challenges. 
Governments and regulatory agencies 
can alter existing policies or implement 
new policies, which can significantly 
influence Etisalat’s operations and financial 
performance.

These challenges are managed by the respective Etisalat Group 
of Operating Companies (OpCos) regulatory departments, with 
support from the Group’s regulatory team.

Litigation

Just as any other organisation, Etisalat is 
subject to the risk of litigation by competitors, 
customers, regulators, and other parties. This 
can affect the financial performance and 
reputation of the Group’s OpCos.

Legal counsel within each OpCo oversees and actively manages 
such litigation cases. Where required, Etisalat Group’s legal 
team also provides support to the OpCos.

Financial threats 
Foreign Exchange 
Exposures

Etisalat is exposed to the uncertainty of 
foreign exchange rate volatility in some of the 
countries in which it operates. Specifically, 
this volatility may affect consolidated results 
and the overall value of Etisalat’s investment 
in overseas operations.

Group Finance has established policies, procedures, and tools to 
monitor, manage and report such exposures.

Other Financial 
Exposures

The Group’s financial assets and liabilities 
are exposed to additional financial threats, 
including interest rates, liquidity, and credit 
risks.

Financial risk management is discussed in greater detail in the 
Financial Instruments section of the 2019 Annual Report.

Sustainable Procurement Practices
At Etisalat, we are committed to maintaining a sustainable business model. Our supply chain is an essential 
aspect of our business model and business continuity. Therefore, we aim to maintain a strong and valuable 
relationship with our suppliers and vendors. 

LOCAL PROCUREMENT 
As part of our supplier selection process, preference 
is given to local suppliers. We aim to source locally 
whenever possible, in line with our commitment 
to positively contribute to the UAE Vision 2021. In 
2020, total procurement spending amounted to AED 
9.9 billion, of which 86% was spent on locally based 
suppliers.

Supply Chain Management
At Etisalat, all current and future suppliers must comply with our Standard Instructions of Condition for Etisalat 
Tenders (SICETs). We have three types of SICETs pertaining to different types of procurements and services: 

Our SICET’s include clauses relating to environmental and social aspects. In addition, we expect all suppliers and vendors to 
comply with applicable UAE laws and regulations.

All our suppliers and vendors must comply with our Code of Conduct. This ensures that not only Etisalat, but also its 
suppliers and vendors are fully committed to doing business in accordance with the highest standards of ethics and 

integrity, and legal and regulatory standards.

Etisalat assesses strategic suppliers based on different 
criteria in an annual supplier performance evaluation. Such 
criteria include size of business, quality of project and 
service performance, timeline on project, and compliance to 
Etisalat terms and conditions. Our suppliers must comply to 
the Anti-corruption practices as stated in our SICETs. Any 
breach in the practices would result in instant termination 
of the supplier contract with Etisalat.  The suppliers are 
expected to conform in all aspects to the laws, regulations, 
byelaws of all local and duly constituted authority. 

We engage with suppliers on an annual basis to reiterate 
the importance of economic, environmental, and social 
sustainability. In 2020, we held meetings with our top 
50 strategic suppliers to discuss areas for improvement. 
Our Evaluation and Negotiation Committee evaluates all 
vendors participating in our Request for Proposals (RFPs) to 
ensure compliance with our SICETs, prior to project award.

SUPPLIER AUDITS AND 
ASSESSMENTS
In 2020, we rolled out a Supplier Compliance and 
In-Country Value (ICV) survey, which assess supplier’s 
performance against ESG-related KPIs, including ICV 
certification. As part of the first stage of the supplier 
survey rollout, we focused on our top strategic suppliers. 

We plan to continue the rollout of these surveys to cover

In 2020, the key focus was proactively reshaping the 
people strategy to maintain business continuity and 
resilience in the face of the challenges presented by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Employee concerns were captured in an open and 
transparent manner, and in response to these insights 
and the restrictions incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
Etisalat expanded flexible work arrangements to allow 
employees to work remotely and safely. An employee 
wellbeing programme was launched to support a safe 
working environment as well as maintain individual 

and team performance and organisational efficiency. 
To protect employees who were required to be on 
site, comprehensive COVID-19 safety measures were 
implemented.

Alongside the wellbeing programme which focussed 
on overall health and safety during this time, efforts 
were made to keep employees engaged and motivated, 
including launching a revised communication plan that 
aimed to maintain collaboration and connectivity within 
our organisation.

We have a proud workforce of 5,863 people, of which 67% are on indefinite contracts and 33% are on fixed term 
contracts. Of the total workforce on indefinite contracts, 22% are female and 78% are male. 

Our talent management strategy focuses on hiring the 
right people, retaining key talents, and developing our 
people through effective succession plans. Our hiring 
process includes robust assessment and selection 
methods which also promote a diverse and inclusive 
high-performing culture throughout the organisation. 
In 2020, a full review of our employment policies was 
undertaken, and manuals were updated to reflect global 
best practices.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and containment 
measures led to a contraction across our workforce 
in 2020, with a higher-than-normal rate of employee 
turnover (both voluntary and involuntary). Although 
there were numerous global challenges faced by the 
economy, we managed to mitigate the impact, and were 
pleased to welcome47 new employees to our family.

Sustainability Report 2020 49Together Towards a Sustainable Future48



PEOPLE CAPABILITY 
BUILDING
Ensuring our people have the resources and skills 
to perform at their best is one of our key focusses. 
We provide our employees a comprehensive 
training and development programme to enhance 
their competencies and knowledge, building 
a technologically savvy workforce in line with 
our vision ‘Together Towards a Sustainable 
Future’. Reflecting Etisalat’s multicultural and 
multigenerational workforce, in 2020 we changed 
our organisational learning to a social, peer learning 
approach to better suit our workforce dynamics. 

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
At Etisalat, we have clear career pathways, and we 
encourage our employees to pursue certifications 
from top academic institutions to support their 
progression.

Each year, we conduct a Training Need Analysis 
exercise to determine our peoples’ development 
needs. In 2020, we successfully completed 96% of 
the Training Need Analysis requests with a training 
effectiveness of 3.79 out of 4.00.

In partnership with Edcast, we created an AI-
powered learning platform – known as iQra. iQra 
brings curated, personalised learning content to all 
our employees, and can be accessed on any device, 
anytime and anywhere. It is available to all Etisalat 
employees and has over 5,000 active users. It 
supports microlearning, gamification and encourages 
learners to become leaders with access to peer-to-
peer learning. 

In addition to our learning and development 
programmes through iQra, we provided our 
employees with virtual learning tools and 
experiences through the LinkedIn Learning platform 
and other online training courses. We also have the 
Online Learning Portal- Skillsoft, Pluralsight, and 

Linux Academy available for employees to learn and 
develop their knowledge and skills, at their own 
pace. 

In 2020 we also improved our Digital Academy 
offerings by incorporating skill sets and 
competencies required for the future with the aid of 
Digital Assessments. The Digital Academy offerings 
address topics including, but not limited to, design 
thinking, agile working, network visualisation, 
cloud, and Internet of Things (IoT), web design/ user 
experience design/ user interface data science and 
analytics, AI, robotic process automation, technical 
expertise related to 5G, cyber and network security 
and data privacy.

We also provide a series of learning and 
development programmes with a special focus 
on UAE nationals. For more information on these 
programmes, refer to Emiratisation.

Finally, we introduced a new ERP system designed 
to improve turnaround time, expediate processes, 
improve data analytics and improve functional 
support. By standardising our internal processes and 
streamlining vendor contracts we are able to ensure 
a better employee experience whilst optimising costs 
and improving quality. To support the new system 
Etisalat has specialised training academies including 
the Digital Academy, Sales Academy, Customer Care 
Academy and Finance Academy. 

This year, over 92,000 training sessions were 
undertaken, an average of over 15 sessions per 
employee, and a total of 4,132 employee sessions 
were delivered. This is a total of 209,659 training 
hours, amounting to an average of 50.7 training 
hours per employee of which an average 4.0 hours 
per employee was related to sustainability trainings.

YOUTH ENGAGEMENT
In line with the UAE Vision 2021, Etisalat aims to 
encourage youth employment, empowering young 
people through our Work-Ways model which offers more 
flexible working conditions including flexitime, flexible 
location and the option to work in shift roles, part-time 
roles, seasonal work during the summer months as well 
as work placements. In 2020, 36% of our new hires were 
between the ages of 18 and 30.

GRADUATE TRAINING AND 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
Etisalat recognises that the future is digital, and that 
new graduates are the embodiment of this future. 
Our graduate training and development programme 
focusses on fostering and empowering Emirati graduates, 
maximising their potential as digital natives to bring 
fresh ideas and technology-led innovative thinking to 
our business. 

The 15-month comprehensive programme includes 
induction, orientation, mentorship, training, rotation 
and on the job learning, ensuring they have every 

opportunity to fulfil their potential in their career with 
us. The programme includes five in-class modules, 
individual development plans, individual and group 
coaching sessions, learning projects and assessments, 
and e-learning and experiential learning events.

YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
The Etisalat Youth Development Programme (YDP) is the 
next phase of our Graduate Training programme for our 
best and brightest future leaders. The YDP is intended 
to embed and nurture leadership skills for confirmed 
graduate trainees to increase their leadership capacity 
for today and tomorrow. By focusing on hands on 
practice, applying what they have learned directly into 
their workplace, rather than heavy content and theory, 
we believe we can accelerate the development of these 
young rising stars. . The YDP journey is a combination 
of tested, principle-based solutions, selected to reflect 
Etisalat’s values and our updated Leadership Competency 
Framework, and includes in-class modules, experiential 
learning events, functional certifications, job shadowing 
(in a minimum of 10 critical meetings), one-on-one 
counselling, and assessments. 

ETISALAT YOUTH COUNCIL

The Etisalat Youth Council was established to help youth employees 
reach their full potential with a special focus on investing their 
capacities and capabilities in technology and digital development, 
ensuring they keep up to date with global telecom and digital 
expansions. The core strategic pillars of Etisalat Youth Council are:

DEVELOPMENT

Encourage youth self-development through various learning 
channels.

PROJECTS

Engage youth in selective projects related to their functional domain 
or cross – functional.

INNOVATION

Encourage youth to come up with innovative ideas whether business 
achievements or any relevant ideas under their domain.

Through the establishment of the Council, Etisalat aspires to achieve 
high levels of engagement, enthusiasm, and commitment from its 
youth employees.

ENGAGEMENT & 
SATISFACTION
At Etisalat, we believe that to lead in the era of digital 
disruption we must foster engaged, energised, and 
digitally enabled employees who feel valued and are 
willing to go over and beyond their core duties because 
they believe in and are united by our vision. 

We constantly challenge ourselves to look for new, 
innovative ways to keep our people motivated and 
engaged, recognising that it is key to overall business 
performance and achieving our corporate objectives. 

Throughout the years we have created an exceptional 
employee experience, based on promoting and driving 
a performance-driven culture where open feedback 

is encouraged and employees are given regular 
opportunities to voice their concerns, and have those 
concerns translate into concrete actions. To monitor 
employee engagement, we have partnered with external 
third parties to conduct engagement surveys and 
analysis; this gives us in-depth information on where 
and how we can improve our engagement strategy and 
understand what is working well. 

We are proud that in 2020 our efforts have paid off, 
with the overall employee satisfaction score increased 
to 75%. The Employee Engagement Index also increased 
from 85% in 2019 to 86% in 2020. The Performance 
Excellence Index stood at 89% in 2019 also improving 
from the previous year.

The most recent employee engagement survey results 
have shown that:

AI GRADUATE PROGRAMME 2020
As Etisalat, AI is at the very core of our business and 
our vision for the future, aligned with UAE AI Strategy 
2031. Our digital transformation has two key aspects 
- by reimagining customer experiences driven by 
personalisation, we aim to establish an “AI as a Service” 
model and by optimising our operations through a focus 
on agility and the ability to predict and prevent issues 
in advance, we hope to streamline costs and increase 
productivity.

We embarked on this journey of transformation by 
starting an AI Graduate Programme in 2020 where 
fresh graduate Emiratis are hired and assigned to a 
9-month AI developmental journey. These ‘AI Graduates’, 
go through various stages, including foundational and 
specialisation, leading them to choose various future 
tracks (e.g., Data Scientist, data Engineer, AI Engineer, 
and Advanced Python etc). We have partnered with 
Microsoft, Accenture, and Emirates ICT Innovation 
Centre (EBTIC) to build the right foundations for the AI 
Next Generation, providing coaching and training on a 
range of AI, data, and industry-centric topics.

As a part of the world’s first ministry on AI in the 
UAE and their flagship programme, BRAIN (Building a 
Responsible AI Nation), we intend to work closely on the 
national agenda. 

QADAT AL MOSTAQBAL (FUTURE 
LEADERS) PROGRAMME 
To enable the next generation of corporate leaders 
within Etisalat, we initiated the Qadat Al Mostaqbal 
(Future Leaders) Programme, with a special focus on 

UAE nationals. The programme is a 2-year learning 
journey designed in line with Etisalat’s corporate values 
and contextualised to cater to the specific leadership 
development aspirations of the nominated candidates, 
representing multiple leadership audiences across the 
organisation. The programme is aligned with our vision 
‘Together Towards a Sustainable Future’ as well as the 
Etisalat values. Participants are selected based on various 
factors such as high-impact and fast track employees, 
top performers, managers, and supervisory roles and 
the individual’s level of motivation and desire to grow. 
The programme includes six in-class modules, individual 
development plans, and coaching, Etisalat-specific 
case studies, action learning projects, assessments, 
engagement of alumni, impact measurement tools, 
e-learning, and business simulations. 

ETISALAT ASSESSMENT CENTRES
Etisalat has focused strategically to align learning 
needs, based on a competence model and assessment 
methodology, for the different companywide 
requirements. Currently, we provide not only Leadership 
Assessment & Development Centre for the purpose 
of recruitment, and career development, but also 
Progression & development training to assess candidates 
across various job levels. 

The ‘First Time Managers Assessment Model’ is our 
career progression model designed to aide staff to check 
their eligibility for managerial positions based their skill 
set, ability & knowledge. Candidates are gauged on their 
skills through online assessments and various training 
modules.

FEEDBACK MECHANISM, REWARDS AND 
RECOGNITION PROGRAMES
We invite employees to share their feedback through 
social media, focus groups, opinion polls and our very 
own Employee Ideation and Suggestion Scheme (Al 
Mawrid). The feedback is used to enhance, develop, 
and expand our operations and processes. For example, 
annual programmes such as Wellness Week, Spirit of 
Happiness Week, and Travel Week are made possible 
by the feedback received, in addition to mechanisms 
that provide employees with both incentive and non-
incentive-based rewards. 2,039 ideas were received 

through Al Mawrid in 2020, of which six ideas were 
awarded. For further details, see Employee Wellness.

Our rewards and recognition programmes focus on 
employee engagement and happiness that are aligned 
with our business objectives. These programmes create 
healthy competition among employees and assist in 
achieving business targets.

In 2020, 352 employees were awarded long service 
awards, 1,767 employees received monthly excellence 
awards and 207 customer experience awards were 
distributed.

At Etisalat we drive employee engagement through a

and reward and recognition programmes. We 
also launched the Continuous Feedback System

including an Employee Engagement Index and a

dashboards, we have been able to align employee 
engagement with business objectives. 

ENGAGEMENT CHAMPIONS
Our network of Engagement Champions is 
responsible for ensuring new innovative engagement

that fair and competitive compensation and benefits are essential factors in achieving this. 

We align key benefits and allowances to the market to ensure market parity and drive operational efficiency. Our benefits 

include, but are not limited to, health insurance, parental leaves, paid time off, and different paid incentives programs. In 

2020, salaries paid totalled over AED 1.9 billion, while benefits stood at AED 312 million. In 2020, the ratio of the average 

male to female salary was 1:0.78.

Sustainability Report 2020 59Together Towards a Sustainable Future58



FEMALE EMPOWERMENT
At Etisalat we empower women and promote gender 
equality, actively encouraging women’s participation 
across all business levels. Our equality policies ensure 
women rights are protected and exercised, and that our 
working culture supports female employees.

In 2020, our workforce was composed of 873 females, 
representing over 22% of the total workforce. 
Furthermore, 5% of the senior management is led by 
female employees, including a new female CHRO who 
joined in 2020 as an executive leader becoming our first 
ever female appointed C suite executive. 

Diversity & Equal Opportunity

INTERNAL GRIEVANCE MECHANISM
We aspire to provide all our employees with the opportunity to work in a supporting environment, that encourages 
and facilitates exceptional performance and achievement of business goals. Therefore, we developed grievance 
management guidelines to eliminate the possibility of any detrimental effects arising from unresolved grievances. The 
guidelines aim to ensure that all communication channels are open, and all employees have an adequate opportunity 
to express their grievances in a fair and transparent manner. 

This year, 52 female employees took parental leave, of which 41 returned to work; the remaining 11 female

Emiratisation

People operations digital transformation

Etisalat plays an important role in nurturing and 
developing UAE National talents. 

In 2020, UAE Nationals made up nearly 50% of the 
workforce, with the Emiratisation rate among senior 
management over 71% and over 48% among middle 
management. UAE National technical employees make 
up over 56% of the total technical workforce and 
76% of the total sales workforce; likewise, our female 
workforce is 74% UAE Nationals. 

Etisalat’s focus on UAE Nationals’ development and 
engagement strategies contributed to an exponential 
increase in organisational performance, and a significant 
cultural shift within the company with new corporate 
values.  We are committed to developing UAE National 
employees by encouraging them to continue their 
studies, providing them with extensive training, as well 
as tailored coaching and mentoring programmes. We 
also indirectly contribute to scholarship programmes as 
part of the ICT Fund under the TDRA.

Another distinctive and unique approach taken by 
Etisalat is the establishment of three call centres in 
Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain to offer new job 

opportunities for UAE Nationals close to their home 
Emirate. We hired UAE Nationals for part-time work 
and seasonal sales projects, civil projects, and the Al Ain 
project.

With each passing year, Etisalat has grown increasingly 
successful in attracting local talent and thus developing 
the national workforce at all levels, paving the way for 
our local graduates and young people to become future 
leaders. In 2020 we strengthened our network with top-
rated schools, colleges and universities across the UAE 
and participated in career fairs, recruitment campaigns 
and offered internship opportunities, work placements 
and summer placements and trainings dedicated to UAE 
Nationals. We also employed a unique digital approach, 
using social media platforms to attract local talent. 

Finally, we are dedicated to participating in Absher - a 
Ministry of Presidential Affairs Programme, Accelerator 
Programme- under the Ministry of Human Resources 
and Emiratisation, Wajehni - an initiative of the Ministry 
of Human Resources, Tamkeen, Overseas Hiring - 
Washington DC Initiative, Secondment Programmes in 
Etisalat’s International operations and more.

In 2020, we implemented first of its kind - integrated 
blockchain technology for people operations. The use 
of blockchain technology ensures that all employees 
have digital access to generate blockchain verifiable 
letters, while the concerned authorities can verify the 
data automatically, assuring a full end-to-end digital 
trail of genuine documentation without any manual 
intervention. 

We also launched the Etisalat HRConnect Mobile App 
which is equipped with a comprehensive set of resources 
available digitally for all our employees to readily access. 
We have adopted a series of other digital mechanisms to 
automate human resources-related processes to ensure 
an optimal and simplified employee experience.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

UAE VISION 2021 PILLARS

Etisalat is committed to managing its environmental 
impact and protecting natural resources. To that 
end, Etisalat devised an Environmental Management 
Policy that tackles environmental issues and focuses 
on energy and waste management. Moreover, Etisalat 
is ISO 14001:2015 certified for environmental 
management. Etisalat has ten High Rise Buildings 
(HRBs) across the UAE, and six of the biggest are ISO 
14001:2015 certified. 

Every year, we conduct regular environmental 
assessments across our branches and masts. We 
have an Environmental Management System (EMS) 
programme in place as well as a campaign that 
encourages internal collaboration between all teams 
to create initiatives that promote environmental 
protection. Across our operations, the Etisalat 
engineers continuously seek to adopt more ozone 
friendly efficient refrigerants to reduce GHG 
emissions, in line with the UAE’s commitment to the 
Paris Climate Change Agreement.

Sustainability Report 2020 65Together Towards a Sustainable Future64



At Etisalat, we acknowledge that urgent action is needed to address climate change and we are keen on playing 
our role in lessening our environmental impact. We recognise that we operate in an energy intensive sector, 
therefore, we concentrate our efforts to reduce energy consumption and implement initiatives that positively 
impact the environment. 

Climate Change and Energy 
Management

ETISALAT FIBRE OPTIC INFRASTRUCTURE
UAE is the leading country in the world in terms of FTTH penetration rate. Etisalat strategically invested in a fibre optic 
infrastructure as opposed to the traditional copper cable systems. This is in fact due to the numerous advantages both 
technical and environmental.

Fibre optic cables cannot only cover greater distances than the latter, but also have reduced cabling mass. Lower energy 
consumption, reduced waste and sustainable architectures are all characteristics that make fibre infrastructure an 
environmentally advantageous choice.

 Over the past 10 years, Etisalat has replaced all traditional copper cables to fibre optic cables. To date, Etisalat has 
deployed over 10,974,865 kilometres (km) of fibre optic cables, saving over 3,044 Gigawatt-hour (GWh) of energy per 
year. This has also resulted in the savings of over 1.8 million tons of CO2eq in greenhouse gas emissions annually.

ETISALAT ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMMES 

In 2020, Etisalat Digital expanded its current install base of connected 
buildings and continued to leverage the expertise developed over 
the years in predictive analytics, remote monitoring and continuous 
commissioning of the systems connected within those buildings, 
specifically for the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) 
systems and heat exchange machinery.

Cumulatively 9,404,362 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity were saved 
while displacing 5,548 tonnes of CO2 and saving 1,191 trees or 12,330 
barrels of oil.

Other energy conservation measures were implemented in the IoT 
based approach for energy automation included weather compensation, 
temperature set point reset based on load, fail over logic, variable 
frequency control of pump speed, run time equalisation and time 
scheduling of HVAC equipment based on buildings’ occupancy. 

Etisalat Digital has had the privilege of contributing to the UAE 
Government’s vision in developing a green print towards solving the most 
pressing sustainability challenges of tomorrow. At the same time, we 
stay focused on serving our customers to achieve their energy efficiency 
targets and operational cost optimisations. 

Etisalat also undertook a series of energy conservation mechanisms 
including installation of high-efficiency cooling systems at various 
Etisalat exchanges and data centres, high efficiency Light Emitting Diode 
(LED) lights and AI features at mobile access sites. To date, three of the 
Etisalat data centres are Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) certified, two of which have also received the Estidama Peral 1 
certification. We have also adopted condensate water harvesting and 
solar water heaters across one of our data centres. 

RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES

Etisalat is utilising renewable energy technologies since many years on its 
mobile sites and plans to continue this practice. Up till end of 2020, 110 
base stations are powered by renewable energy, while the sites running 
on diesel generators has also reduced from 372 to 368. Furthermore, 
other options such as use of solar air-conditioners were also explored, to 
further reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint.

Sustainability Report 2020 67Together Towards a Sustainable Future66



GHG EMISSIONS 

We have made considerable progress in reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This year, our total GHG 
emissions remained relatively stable, despite the expansion in infrastructure and increased electricity usage 
requirements.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION

This year, we maintained a relatively stable total energy consumption across the organisation.

The number of data centres and exchanges owned by Etisalat increased to 11 and 196, compared to 10 and 192 in 
the previous year, respectively. The number of base stations also increased by 4% from 10,644 base stations last year 
to 11,122 base stations in 2020. 

We run an energy optimisation programme called ZIBRA within administrative buildings, which automatically 
controls light schedules and Air Conditioning (AC) schedules. We are also insulating our high-rise buildings to 
reduce heat in the summer. At our data centres we have introduced containment solution to improve efficiency 
in cooling. Some of our data centres are also equipped with solar water heaters, Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)-
driven cooling architecture, condensate water, and load optimised performance operation scheme on dynamic rotary 
uninterruptable power solutions. 

We prioritise the use of clean energy sources such as commercial power, solar energy, and hybrid power systems. 
Hence, we are always pushing to lower the number of diesel generators running in the network, which is reflected in 
the increasing number of base stations powered by cleaner energy sources.

Water, Waste and Biodiversity

WASTE MANAGEMENT & 
RECYCLING

Etisalat strives to minimise its impact on the 
environment by ensuring sustainable consumption is 
the use of material products, energy, and immaterial 
services. We seek to boost our waste recycling by 
reusing equipment and the recycling of various types 
of waste including network waste, IT equipment as well 
as other office waste. Our Environmental Management 
System Policy has a specific section that deals with 
waste generation and recycling.

As part of our efforts to move towards a paperless 
environment, we have achieved many digitisation 
and automation initiatives including the switch of 
paper billing to digital copies as part of the Etisalat 
“Go Digital” drive. We also participated in the Earth 
hour movement in 2020. The Montreal Protocol 
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, any 

remaining Halon system within Etisalat are recovered 
and assigned for disposal as per the protocol. Expired 
fire extinguishers are also proper recycled by approved 
agents.

In 2020 we continued 100% e-billing to our customers, 
hence our paper consumption was significantly 
reduced, by 99% as we shifted towards digitalisation 
our operations and processes. In 2020, we achieved 
a remarkable 60% recycling rate. Furthermore, we 
deployed sustainable waste solutions by deploying 
sensors in the waste bins across our retail spaces which 
provide real-time monitoring of waste accumulation 
and allow for the efficient management and 
optimisation of the waste collection process. In 2020, 
we generated a total of 547,356 kilograms (kg) of waste 
of which 40% was recycled.

WATER MANAGEMENT
As most of our operations are run in water scarce countries, we strive to make efforts to reduce our water 
consumption This encourages us to do our part and Increase our efforts to use water more efficiently. We installed 
aerators for all water taps as well as capturing wastewater in more than one location and are reusing it for 
gardening in that same facility. In 2020, we reduced our total water consumption by 11%.

Through our operations we are determined to prevent a negative impact on biodiversity and ecological 
ecosystems.  We value environmental conservation and strive support and assist where necessary.

SCALEUP PROGRAMME: FUTURENOW

FutureNow is the innovation programme from Etisalat Digital that accelerates the adoption of the latest technologies 
through a collaborative platform of experts and capabilities to drive digital transformation. The programme has four main 
objectives: to co-create, accelerate, partner, and discover.

To accelerate the pace of open collaboration with agile companies around the world, the FutureNow Programme has 
launched 12 challenges in 2020 in the areas of AI, Cloud, Fintech, Robotics, AR, and digital payments. These open 
innovation challenges have been run by Etisalat Digital and in some cases with some of the most influential stakeholders 
including the Dubai Future Accelerators and the Fintech Hive, running the outreach, and receiving applications from more 
than 300 scaleups from the GCC as well as internationally, conducting interviews, shortlisting applicants, and managing the 
12-week cohorts to support the progress between the companies selected and internal champions leading the challenges.

The IoT Partner Programme is another strategic pillar to create innovative solutions and support the ecosystem of market 
leading IoT experts to extend the portfolio of Etisalat IoT digital solutions. This programme aims to establish long-term 
partnerships with major IoT players in the region and the world and accelerate the digital transformation of industries 
through disruptive IoT solutions. 

Following the launch of this programme in October 2019, the FutureNow team focuses on actively scouting and sourcing 
competitive technology companies across 5 IoT verticals; industrial IoT, Smart City, Safe City, Retail, and Mobility IoT. The 
result of these partnerships has accelerated business opportunities for major Etisalat clients. 

Another layer of the IoT Partner Programme is to innovate with developers through hands-on IoT workshops conducted and 
run for the community at large. The IoT workshops are open invitations to all developers to build, test, and integrate their 
applications on Etisalat IoT platform.

In 2020, 5 virtual FutureNow workshops were conducted and run remotely for more than 200 developers, students, and 
entrepreneurs to explore the potential of IoT with Etisalat Platform.

As a result of the programme, we have been able to accelerate the adoption of innovative solutions as part of the portfolio 
of Etisalat Digital; for instance, developing a Multicloud single pane-of-glass or providing facial recognition capabilities on
top of our proposition of video surveillance.

We established several effective activities aimed at 
encouraging digital inclusion initiatives and innovation, 
while setting a roadmap for future entrepreneurs and 
innovators. We seek to equip the next generation with 
technological solutions and provide them with insights 
into the future of technology and education.

Etisalat’s events and platforms aim to bring young 
people together, connecting them with relevant 
stakeholders, to transform new thoughts and ideas into 
reality. In return, these events and platforms provide us 
with insight into the next generation, and how, we can 
transform creative and innovative ideas into solutions 
that will bring value to our customers.

Our inspiration for ‘Together Towards a Sustainable 
Future’ is in alignment with the UAE’s commitment to 
innovation. To proactively adhere to customers’ ‘needs 
of tomorrow’ the Etisalat HR team dimensioned a new 

department – Etisalat Digital. This department is a 
roaring change agent to enable the economic backbone 
entities (SMEs, Government, Corporates, Enterprises) 
with state-of-the-art technology solutions.

SUPPORTING SMES
Etisalat recognises the importance of SMEs in the UAE 
and their role in driving innovation. As a result, our 
partnership with Microsoft rolls out several initiatives 
supporting innovation in the UAE. IoT field is one 
way we support the community of entrepreneurs and 
developers through events and workshops to facilitate 
hands-on access to the Etisalat IoT platform We are 
also collaborating with various start-ups to promote 
innovation via the Etisalat Digital portfolio.

We have also launched several initiatives aimed 
at supporting SMEs, including Hello Business Hub 
and the Hello Business Pitch competition. Hello 
Business is an innovative digital park for start-ups 
and SMB’s, a dedicated business hub offering tailored 
telecommunications as well as value added services 
while providing businesses the ease and flexibility of 
kick-starting their operations in the UAE.

5G and disruptive technologies are at the forefront 
of the transition in bringing new opportunities to the 
industry and the country. 5G has offered a step change 
in network performance and expectations are high for 
new 5G enabled applications and services. The network 
will also benefit from the use of AR/VR with advanced 
learning tools. 5G enabled wearables - particularly 
health devices and remote medicine/surgeries - can 
significantly improve the quality of healthcare for 
patients.

These milestones reinforce the reputation of the UAE 
in innovation and infrastructure. In addition, Etisalat’s 
5G network will provide the most advanced digital and 

telecom services to Expo 2020, its millions of visitors, 
and the UAE.

Etisalat is determined to expand its 5G network coverage 
to over 60% of UAE main cities by end of 2021. In 
2019, Etisalat set path to develop the skills of the UAE 
youth through employment related to 5G technology 
deployment. Etisalat is set to continue this path, as 
the 5G ecosystem matures. Building on the model of 
4G, Etisalat aims to use the new opportunities across 
the world, championed by young people to shape 5G 
maturity.

We are committed to the highest standards of health 
and safety in the workplace. Adhering to safe labour 
practices and laws to protect and ensure the wellbeing 
of our people. Our Health, Safety and Environmental 
(HSE) policy applies to all Etisalat UAE staff, contractors, 
suppliers, consultants, visitors and partners at Etisalat 
premises and its projects. All employees and third parties 
are expected to abide by the health and safety rules and 
report any violation of health and safety immediately, as 
expressed in our Code of Conduct.

We continue to implement and regularly update the 
Etisalat Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System which has been developed in accordance 
with the ISO 45001:2018 requirements. Selected 
business units and facilities are certified against the 
Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 
(OHSAS) 18001/45001/integrated management system. 
As part of improving HSE documentation standards, 
we work closely with the business excellence team to 
benchmark ourselves against global industry standards. 
We continued the implementation of the Empower HSE 
project to revitalise the HSE function within different 
departments, and to bring the safety culture of Etisalat 
to a new level. 

All site activities are controlled by the Permission to 
Work (PTW) system; therefore, permits are required 
before work is varied out on sites. Working at heights, 
confined space entry, working with live equipment and 
under extreme weather work exposure are some of the 
major risks associated in telecom day to day activities. 
Our team of experts always perform the task /job safety 
analysis prior to the task, to present the most effective 
health and safety control measures to limit the hazard 
exposure. 

In 2020, we implemented a work from home policy 
and guidelines to ensure the health and safety of our 
employees, considering the COVID-19 circumstances. We 
also carried out a mass COVID-19 testing programme 

and vaccination campaign for staff at our selected 
facilities.  

We are committed to improving our employees’ 
awareness of heat stress prevention through frequent 
seminars, training sessions and campaigns addressing 
the definition, types, symptoms, and precautionary 
measures on heat stress, such as our Summer Safety 
campaign. In 2020, we achieved zero heat stress events 
for the second consecutive year.

No fatalities were recorded in 2020. We also reduced 
the frequency of employee occupation illnesses to zero. 
The total recordable injuries for employees stood at 

Occupational Health & Safety

Health & Safety zero while there were two contractor injuries recorded 
in 2020. These incidents occurred when a window 
cleaning equipment malfunctioned outside the 20th 
floor at the Al Kifaf building, trapping two cleaners 
inside. Etisalat’s HSE and emergency management team 
closely interacted with the authorities to execute an 
immediate safe recovery plan for the affected staff. After 
the incident the process of preparing the equipment 
and operator for the activity was revised and site and 
machine specific unit trainings, and self-rescue trainings 
for the operators have repeatedly been delivered. 

We ensure that all personnel involved in the installation, 
operation and maintenance of base stations and 
equipment are both qualified and authorised. At the 
corporate HSE level we specify the products-make, 
model and compliance standards required to carry out 
activities. 

Our HSE team is responsible for carrying out inspections 
and audits for all critical facilities. As part of site visits 
and audits, we follow the Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA) protocol. Any instances of 
non-conformance are communicated to the concerned 

stakeholders and reviewed until a resolution is made 
or the risk is brought down to the acceptable level. All 
personnel undertaking work onsite must receive the 
Permit to Work (PTW). These personnel undergo training 
and regular toolbox talks to ensure that all work is 
carried out to the utmost safety levels. 

We have designed an HSE Governance Model for as part 
of our partnership with Expo 2020 and Dubai Airports. 
The model aims to not only meet but exceed the Quality, 
Health, Safety and Environment (QHSE) expectations 
of our partners. As part of our work with Expo 2020, 
we already began implementing the operational QHSE 
requirements set out by the HSE Governance Model we 
developed, which is 30% more stringent than the UAE 
requirements. 

In 2020, 12 emergency response drills were conducted, 
and 73 safety investigations were conducted and 
completed. Health and safety risks are assessed as part 
of the physical and environmental controls that are 
included in our general control reviews in the annual 
audit plan.

In working to train our employees to improve 
performance of health and safety systems, we conducted 
several awareness sessions. In 2020, 2.296 total training 
hours were provided to employees regarding health 
and safety, equating to 4.5 hours of HSE training per 
employee.

At Etisalat we recognise that the health of our 
employees extends beyond health and safety policies. 
We have identified areas to support our employees in 
their day-to-day activities in our holistic approach to 
health. We ensure all workstations procured and floor 
layouts are within Etisalat are ergonomically designed 
and fit for use. We also provide a tier-based health club 
membership programme to our employees. When the 
cafeterias were operational, there were HSE h respect 
to the Hygiene aspects. Staff awareness on stress 
management and wellness is always top priority Etisalat.

Regarding health and safety during the COVID-19 
pandemic, several safety measures were put in place to 
prevent the spread. We provided online trainings to all 
employees, on our newly launched learning platform 
iQra. Staff was able to access safety guidelines though 
the digital learning channel. We also provided clear 
guidelines for employees returning to offices, such as 
social distancing, office hygiene and sanitation. Health 
and Safety staff conducted regular checks to ensure that 
masks and social distancing requirements were being 
adhered to. A mandatory 14-day self-quarantine period 
was implemented for all employees who had travelled 
and were returning to the UAE. 

For high-risk employees and female employees with 
children, Etisalat provided a remote work option 
effective from August 2020. 

Etisalat UAE also conducted a COVID-19 Employee 
Survey during the peak of the pandemic to understand 
employee concerns. The results assisted the company 
to fine tune the precautionary measures taken to 
safeguard staff. The survey results should a 90% and 
above satisfaction with the leadership decisions taken 
regarding both the company and its employees.

In 2020 we continued with our successful Employee 
Wellness and Wellbeing programme, introduced in 2010 
conducted across the UAE. The programme encourages 
employees to find a balance between their working 
and personal lives. This year the programme focused on 
health awareness and work life balance seminars, such 
as free health screenings, healthy food awareness, etc. 
Every year new initiatives are added, and we ensure 
the programmes offer short, medium- and long-term 
benefits. 

Employee Wellness and Wellbeing As a result, Etisalat won the Best Employee Wellness and Wellbeing Programme. This award showcases a high-
quality employee wellness programme that not only works, but that also offers clear and measurable returns on 
investment. which recognises employers who place employee wellbeing centre stage within the organisation and have 
embedded a strong culture of health and wellness. We use metrics, staff feedback and case studies to strengthen the 
programme. To ensure a seamless implementation process, Etisalat added a group medical insurance policy covering 
all employees and their families residing in the UAE. 

The programme is incorporated the human resources vision, mission and strategic focus through the following five

We continue to give high priority to the health and safety of our 
valued customer base, as well as the people and larger communities 
that we serve. As such, we take all confirmed and potential risks 
seriously. Customer complaints concerning Etisalat product and 
services are managed by the customer care. By policy Etisalat is 
committed to assure the health and safety of its stakeholders from 
its operations.

There is an ongoing health risk perception of the emission of 
Electromagnetic Energy (EME) from mobile devices and base stations 
masts. There is a lack of conclusive evidence on adverse health 
effects caused by mobile phone usage. Nonetheless, Etisalat is 
committed to transparent communication regarding these public 
concerns and continues to comply with the laws in every jurisdiction 
that we operate.

Our telecommunication networks are built to follow TDRA guidelines 
on Non-Ionising Radiation Limits for Telecommunication Networks, 
which are in line with ICNIRP (International Commission of Non-
Ionising Radiation Protection) guidelines in terms of Specific 
Absorption Rate (SAR). The compliance and EME documents are 
communicated to all staff and vendors and followed throughout 
installations.

As a result of the COVID-19 circumstances, Etisalat reacted 
immediately to the situation by redesigning the customer safety 
journey to ensure the safety and wellbeing of both our staff 
and customers, while abiding by the UAE Government mandates 
and precautionary measures. Across our retail stores we have 
implemented touchless SMS tokens for customers. All staff employed 
across our retail offices are equipped with face masks and face 
shields. We have placed rope barriers to manage the traffic while 
maintaining a safe distance. We also introduced new floor rules 
for staff to enforce safety measures and guarantee a seamless 
experience.

Customer Health and Safety

WHO GUIDANCE ON ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AND 
PUBLIC HEALTH

As stated on WHO website “to date, the only health effect from 
radiofrequency (RF) fields identified in scientific reviews has been related to 
an increase in body temperature (> 1 °C) from exposure at exceedingly high 
field intensity found only in certain industrial facilities, such as RF heaters. 
The levels of RF exposure from base stations and wireless networks are 
so low that the temperature increases are insignificant and do not affect 
human health.

As part of our campaigns to raise customer awareness on electromagnetic 
field exposure, Etisalat participates in various local and international 
events.
