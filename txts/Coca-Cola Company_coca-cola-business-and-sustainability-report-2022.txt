The Coca-Cola Company’s  
purpose is to refresh the world and 
make a difference. 

We have remained true to that purpose for 137 years,  
and I am as encouraged today about the future of our  
business as I have ever been. 

Our strategy is clear. It’s centered around people— 
our consumers and employees—and driving sustainable 
solutions that build resilience into our business to respond  
to current and future challenges, while creating positive  
change for the planet.

GREAT BRANDS, BOLD EXPERIMENTATION
As a total beverage company, we are committed to offering 
people more of the drinks they want across a range of 
categories and in a variety of sizes. In 2022, we launched  
246 low- or no-sugar beverages and continued to see double-
digit growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which is now available  
in more than 170 markets. This helped to drive our volume of 
low- and no-calorie beverage sales to 29% of total volume. 

We’re driving the most significant marketing transformation 
in our history, focused on digital-first engagement with 
consumers. We’re combining partnerships, technology and our 
consumers’ passions to create unforgettable experiences in 
music, gaming and sports, including:

• �Coca-Cola�Creations: This global innovation platform lends 
the iconic Coca-Cola brand to new expressions, driven by 
collaboration, creativity and cultural connection. Launched 
in 2022, we introduced five limited-edition drinks that drew 
inspiration from music, gaming and culture. These were 
complemented with experimental packaging designs and 
various digital experiences.

•  Sprite�Limelight: A music and cultural extension of the 
brand’s global platform “Heat Happens,” Sprite Limelight 
aims to unite fans from different cultures and lifestyles by 
bringing together different artists from around the world.

We’re also experimenting with new drinks. We’ve launched 
Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola as a ready-to-drink cocktail through 
a relationship with Brown-Forman. This is one example of 
our ongoing journey to bring Coke to consumers in new and 
dynamic ways. We take the new responsibilities that come 
with our entry in this space very seriously. As a result, we’ve 
embedded our Global Policy on Alcohol Responsibility into our 
business processes to ensure we grow our alcohol brands in a 
responsible and sustainable way.

SUSTAINABILITY IS CORE TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
Water: Water is a priority for our company because it is the 
first ingredient in all our beverages and is essential to the 
communities we serve. As a local business operating in more 
than 200 countries and territories, we have a responsibility to 
help protect critical resources. 

Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing 
water security. We work with partners to provide access to a 
steady supply of clean water for people and ecosystems in the 
areas where we operate and source ingredients. We recently 
announced a more focused effort to prioritize the most water-
stressed regions. As we’ve done since 2015, we’ll continue to 
replenish the water we use in our finished beverages to nature 
and communities. In 2022, we replenished 159%.James�Quincey

Packaging: We seek to drive a circular economy for our 
packaging because this helps to reduce waste and carbon 
emissions. We’re working to use more recycled content in 
our packaging, to expand our use of refillable bottles, and to 
collect packaging for recycling through our World Without 
Waste initiative. We also partner to design new solutions for 
packaging. For example, we licensed our technology for a 100% 
plant-based plastic bottle to a company building a commercial-
scale facility in Germany. This bio-based plastic packaging  
has a lower carbon footprint than other plastics. While we’re 
making progress, we know there is more work to be done.  
In 2022, we collected 61% of the equivalent bottles and cans 
that we introduced into the market and used 15% rPET  
in our bottles.

To galvanize collective action, we invest in solutions and 
partnerships across industry, governments and society.  
In 2022, we became a Strategic Partner of the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation. This group includes companies within key industry 
sectors that can help drive the transition to a circular economy.

Climate: Our water, packaging and climate goals are 
interconnected. For example, by creating a circular economy  
for packaging, we can lower our carbon footprint.  
By approaching water stewardship from a basin perspective, 
we participate in initiatives that increase communities’ 
resilience to extreme weather events, alongside our partners. 
Our approach to climate is rooted in science, and we’ve  
set a science-based target to reduce absolute greenhouse  
gas emissions by 25% by 2030, against a 2015 baseline.  
As of 2022, we have reduced our emissions by 7% against  
this baseline.

A COMPANY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
We’re committed to creating a culture of inclusion and 
belonging and to driving meaningful change in our 
communities. By 2030, we aspire to be 50% led by women 
globally. Today, 39% of our senior leaders are women. 

The Coca-Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm of  
The Coca-Cola Company, contributed $94.8 million to 301 
organizations around the world in 2022 to help create a better 
shared future for the communities our business serves.

Our continued success would not be possible without our 
people. I am grateful for the company and system employees 
who live our purpose every day. Their collective passion  
and focus to build loved brands and make a difference in  
the world is how our business will continue to thrive for 
generations to come.

WATER LEADERSHIP PORTFOLIO: BEVERAGES FOR ALL
Water is a priority for The Coca-Cola Company because it is 
essential to life, our beverages and the communities we serve. 
We have operations nearly everywhere in the world—in more than 
200 countries and territories. That means we have a responsibility 
to help those who face water scarcity and to protect local water 
resources where we operate, especially in places with the 
biggest challenges. 

Our 2030 Water Security Strategy is focused on accelerating  
the actions needed to increase water security where we 
operate, source ingredients and touch people’s lives. We do that 
by contributing toward sustainable, clean water access that 
improves livelihoods and wellbeing while protecting against 
water-related disasters. We understand water challenges are 
different in each region, so we are focused on doing what matters 
most locally, where the challenges are greatest.

We�have�set�three�key�goals�designed�to�achieve�our�vision:

•   Achieve 100% regenerative water use across 175�of�our�facilities, 
identified as facing high levels of water stress by 2030.

•   Improve the health of 60�watersheds identified as most critical 
for our operations and agricultural supply chain by 2030.

•   Return a cumulative total of 2�trillion�liters of water to 
nature and communities globally over the life of our 
strategy, between 2021–2030.

1   Substantially all replenish data is internally validated and verified; the equivalent volume for 100% Replenish rate (182.9 Billion litres BL) is externally assured. Peer-reviewed 
methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project and operating unit for all externally assured data; one exception was approved for internally validated 
and verified data. The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long-term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies annually. Replenish benefits fall 
under three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (17.4 BL). Due to joint venture 
or merger and acquisition activities between 2019–2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless otherwise stated, in this report finished beverages is 
based on global sales volume. Approximately 13.5 BL (approx. 7%) of the water used in our beverages that we returned to nature and communities is from 7 projects located in 
Ukraine and Belarus where since May 2019 we have not been able to monitor projects on intervals aligned with internal guidelines due to COVID and the ongoing war. 

As a total beverage company, we are committed to offering 
people more of the drink choices they want across a range of 
categories and in a variety of packages. Evolving consumer tastes 
and preferences help steer our business strategy and shape the 
lineup of beverages we bring to market.

We take a disciplined approach to product innovation and 
portfolio management, ensuring we develop and deliver 
preferred, great-tasting beverages for all occasions and lifestyles. 
This includes offering drinks with reduced added sugar and more 
brands with nutrition and wellness benefits; providing small 
package options and clear nutrition information on packaging and 
in our communications; and marketing our drinks responsibly.

PACKAGING
We recognize our responsibility to help solve complex plastic 
waste challenges facing our planet and society. Our ambitious 
strategy to drive change through a circular economy for our 
packaging is called World Without Waste. This strategy is 
a global sustainable packaging platform focused on these 
fundamental goals: Making 100% of our packaging recyclable 
globally by 2025—and using at least 50% recycled material in our 
packaging by 2030 (Design); collecting and recycling a bottle or 
can for each one we sell by 2030 (Collect); and bringing people 
together to support a healthy, debris-free environment (Partner).

We are making progress against each of these objectives, 
which are embedded in how we operate as a business, and we 
take a transparent approach to reporting our actions, results 
and learnings. Local teams are executing in ways appropriate 
for their markets, and we are using a networked approach to 
deliver impact at scale.

In 2022, we avoided around half a million metric tons of virgin plastic 
usage through our efforts on lightweighting and use of recycled 
content with an incremental avoidance of over 50,000 metric 
tons compared to 2021. However, growth of plastic packaging has 
outpaced these efforts, so we did not reduce virgin plastic usage 
overall in 2022

By 2030, we aim to have at least 25% of our beverages

CLIMATE
Taking well-informed, decisive action to help address climate 
change is a priority for our company. Climate change poses 
risks to our business and our stakeholders. By implementing an 
interconnected approach across our priority sustainability issues, 
we are reducing the Coca-Cola system’s greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and building resilience in our business, value chain 
and local communities. 

We are working to reduce our carbon footprint in line with 
science to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. 
We do this by analyzing and prioritizing the sources of GHG 
emissions across our value chain and by partnering with 
stakeholders to drive down emissions.

As of 2022, we reduced our absolute emissions by 7% against 
a 2015 baseline, making progress toward our science-based 
reduction target of 25% by 2030 against the baseline. Our 
ambition also includes achieving net zero emissions by 2050. 
Several of our bottling partners and suppliers have set or 
committed to setting their own science-based reduction targets 
to drive climate action across our value chain.

SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE HUMAN RIGHTS
Our products and some of our packaging are made from a 
wide variety of agricultural ingredients, which we source from 
around the world. This complex global supply chain includes 
many kinds of suppliers, from multinational companies to 
smallholder farmers. Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture 
(PSA) communicate our expectations for environmental, social 
and economic performance to our agricultural suppliers at 
the farm level. The PSA, introduced in 2021, take a long-term 
perspective and reflect the most recent science, our total 
beverage company portfolio, and our increasingly diverse 
supply chain. The PSA are designed to encourage continuous 
improvement in farming practices and lead to more ethical and 
sustainable sourcing.

Our goal is to sustainably source all our ingredients over 
time—such as sugar cane, corn, fruit, coffee, tea and soybeans. 
Sustainably sourcing our ingredients increases the resilience 
of our supply chain, helps to conserve nature, and empowers 
producers and farm workers. In practice, we encourage 
and support our ingredient suppliers to drive continuous 
improvement in sustainable farming practices, based  
on our PSA.

READ MORE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE 

Respecting human rights is one of our core values.  
The Coca-Cola Company was among the first companies to 
commit to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business  
and Human Rights, and we have strived to inspire and drive 
responsible business practices ever since.

1  The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners are collectively 
known as the Coca-Cola system. The Coca-Cola Company does 
not own, manage or control most local bottling companies. 

The Coca-Cola Company markets, 
manufactures and sells:

•  Beverage concentrates and syrups

•    Finished beverages (including sparkling soft 
drinks; water, sports, coffee & tea; juice, value-
added dairy & plant-based beverages; and 
emerging beverages).

In our concentrate operations, The Coca-Cola 
Company typically generates net operating 
revenues by selling concentrates and syrups  
to authorized bottling partners.

Our bottling partners combine the concentrates 
and syrups with still or sparkling water  
and sweeteners (depending on the product),  
to prepare, package, distribute and sell  
finished beverages.

Our finished product operations consist  
primarily of company-owned bottling and 
distribution operations.

We also operate retail outlets through  
Costa Limited (Costa), which has nearly 4,000 
Costa coffee shops and over 14,000 Costa 
Express self-serve coffee bars worldwide. Costa’s 
portfolio also includes ready-to-drink and at-
home coffee solutions.

ON BOLD BEVERAGES AND  

NEW EXPERIENCES
We’re taking global innovation 
to the next level. In 2022, we 
combined partnerships, technology 
and our consumers’ passions to 
create unforgettable experiences in 
music, gaming and sports.

Coca-Cola�Creations
Coca-Cola Creations is a new global innovation platform 
that lends the iconic Coca-Cola brand to new expressions, 
driven by collaboration, creativity and cultural connection. 
In 2022, we launched five limited-edition drinks:  
Coca-Cola Starlight, Coca-Cola Byte, the artist 
Marshmello’s Limited Edition Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola 
Dreamworld, and Coca-Cola Soul Blast. Coca-Cola 
Creations draws inspiration from music, gaming and 
culture, and is complemented with experimental 
packaging designs, digital experiences and more.

“Recycled�Records”
Legendary music producers Mark Ronson and 
Madlib teamed up with Sprite, Fresca and 
Seagram’s to showcase the parallels between 
recycling sounds and beverage bottles. “Recycled 
Records” is an original EP created almost entirely 
from “recycled” sound samples captured during 
the PET bottle-to-bottle recycling process. The 
project is a creative, culturally relevant way 
to celebrate the brands’ switch from green to 
clear PET packaging.

Coke�Studio

Coke Studio expanded into a global, digital-first platform. 
Seven diverse artists from seven countries teamed up 
on a remake of Queen’s “A Kind of Magic” to kick off 
the platform. Coke Studio launched in 2008 in Pakistan 
as a TV series featuring live collaborations between 
established and emerging musical artists before growing 
into an international music franchise with editions in 
India, the Philippines, Africa and the Middle East.

Costa�Coffee�Smart�Café
Launched in the United States in 
2022, the Costa Coffee Smart Café 
delivers a range of more than 200 
drink options, from espresso to 
hot chocolate. These innovative 
touch-screen machines always 
use fresh milk and freshly ground 
Signature Blend beans.

A�Metaverse�Milestone
Coca-Cola thanked fans who participated in the 
brand’s journey into the metaverse with a special 
digital collectible drop on International Friendship 
Day 2022. The collectible, featuring a design 
inspired by the bubbles inside a Coke bottle as well 
as themes of connection and unity, airdropped to 
the digital wallets of Coca-Cola collectible owners in 
July. Recipients could share a second International 
Friendship Day collectible with a friend to build 
Coke’s community of fans.

Sprite�Limelight
Sprite Limelight launched as the 
music and cultural extension of “Heat 
Happens,” the brand’s global platform 
unveiled in 2022. Grammy-winning 
producer James Blake crafted a 
lyrical hook rooted in keeping life’s 
“heat” at bay, and three distinctive 
global artists—American rapper Coi 
Leray, African singer-songwriter and 
social media sensation Omah Lay, 
and Chinese pop/rock singer Hua 
Chenyu—used the hook as inspiration 
for their own original songs.

Lil�Nas�X�and�vitaminwater
Global superstar Lil Nas X teamed up 
with vitaminwater’s “Nourish Every 
You” campaign to showcase six videos 
featuring his unreleased track, “Give Me 
One Chance.” Each featured a unique 
vitaminwater flavor—focus, shine, energy, 
xxx zero, gutsy and ice—to create a fantasy 
world inspiring fans to nourish all of their 
“yous.” “Nourish Every You” was inspired 
by the insight that vitaminwater fans 
want to take care of themselves, but are 
living with fluctuating physical, emotional 
and spiritual needs.

POWERADE:� 
‘Pause�is�Power’
POWERADE celebrated the 
power of the pause—prioritizing 
wellbeing over winning—with a 
global communications platform 
featuring USA gymnast Simone 
Biles and other accomplished 
athletes and coaches spanning a 
variety of sports. The campaign 
kicked off in March 2022 
during NCAA March Madness.

NY including progress toward the company’s 

sustainability goals. The Committee assesses 
a range of issues relevant to the company’s 
business, our shareowners, the broader 
stakeholder community or the general public. 
This entails evaluating and reviewing information 
pertaining to social, political and environmental 
trends, in addition to oversight of the company’s 
sustainability goals and human rights practices.

The Corporate Governance and Sustainability 
Committee oversees our plans and strategies 
on climate-related issues. For a deeper dive into 
our climate governance, visit the Climate section. 
The Committee also oversees and reviews, 
at least annually, the company’s public policy 
agenda, its position on significant public policy 
matters, political contributions and lobbying 
activities. The Committee reviews shareowner 
proposals on sustainability issues to be included 
in the company’s proxy statements and makes 
recommendations to the Board. In addition, 
the Committee receives updates on priority 
sustainability issues, including actions and 
progress toward goals. 

The Audit Committee oversees certain processes 
related to external sustainability disclosures and 
works jointly with the Corporate Governance and 
Sustainability Committee to oversee sustainability 
risks facing the company. Finally, the Talent 
and Compensation Committee oversees the 
company’s human capital management policies 
and strategies. This includes talent management, 
leadership and company culture initiatives, 
such as those promoting diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI). This Board-level commitment 
and alignment drives top-down accountability 
toward our DEI goals and helps support a 
positive company culture.

To reinforce the importance of meeting our sustainability goals, 
the Talent and Compensation Committee approved plans to link 
sustainability performance to our annual and long-term incentive 
programs for executives in 2022. In the annual incentive program, 
we have reinforced our commitment to DEI by incorporating 
quantitative and qualitative components tied to our 2030 
aspirations to be 50% led by women globally and, in the United 
States, to align race and ethnicity representation to U.S. census 
data. Similarly, in the long-term incentive program, predefined 
goals related to our World Without Waste packaging strategy 
and our 2030 Water Security Strategy were incorporated into the 
2022–2024 incentive awards.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Coca-Cola Company’s innovative and 
collaborative culture is underpinned by a robust 
framework of policies and processes to promote 
ethical behavior, accountability and transparency. 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for 
overseeing our governance framework as part 
of its risk oversight function. Board Committee 
charters, our Code of Business Conduct, 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, Certificate 
of Incorporation and Corporate By-Laws can be 
viewed on our website.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE
The Board has delegated oversight of 
sustainability matters to its various committees 
in order to leverage each committee’s experience 
and subject-matter strengths in overseeing 
the varied and technical matters encompassed 
by sustainability. The Corporate Governance 
and Sustainability Committee has primary 
responsibility for overseeing the company’s 
sustainability strategies and initiatives—and 
related risks—that concern environmental, social, 
legislative, regulatory and public policy matters,

CEO MESSAGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCONTENTS AGRICULTUREPORTFOLIO DATA APPENDIXPACKAGING FRAMEWORKSWATER OPERATIONSCLIMATE PEOPLEOUR COMPANY

Learn about our  
transparent approach to 
stakeholder engagement  
and scientific research.

PUBLIC POLICY & POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT
Integrity, transparency and nonpartisanship 
underpin our approach to engagement in the 
public policy and political process. In the United 
States and Canada, we promote public policy 
solutions about key issues for our business that 
include environmental sustainability, consumer 
preference, tax and trade, and workplace and 
economic inclusion. Our advocacy often involves 
education, participation and thought leadership 
within industry, business and policy forums. When 
significant to our business interests, we share our 
policy positions through advocacy initiatives. 

Consistent with U.S. federal law, the company 
does not use corporate funds to contribute to 
federal candidates, political parties or political 
committees, or otherwise employ its resources, 
including in-kind, even when permitted by 
law. The company has a long-standing policy 
against use of corporate funds for independent 
expenditures or super PACS, including toward 
electioneering communications. Effective as 
of January 1, 2021, the company does not use 
corporate funds to directly support state or local 
political candidates, even if permitted by law.

OUR APPROACH TO DISCLOSURE
We have a comprehensive sustainability 
reporting process that spans many years, and 
we aim to provide stakeholders with complete, 
transparent and candid information in all our 
public communications. This is our fifth annual 
Business & Sustainability Report, which combines 
financial and sustainability performance in one 
publication. We also respond to the CDP climate, 
water and forests questionnaires and make those 
disclosures publicly available. 

We recognize there is a desire for standardization 
across reporting frameworks, and we’re 
continually evaluating reporting options and 
listening to stakeholder feedback. This report 
is prepared in accordance with the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, a globally 
recognized framework. In addition, we provide 
indexes for the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures, the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and 
the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting 
Framework (UNGPRF). We also submit packaging 
data to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation/UN 
Environment Programme’s New Plastics Economy 
Global Commitment, the WWF ReSource Plastic 
disclosure platform and the U.S. Plastics Pact.

The company follows all national laws regarding political 
engagement and discloses political contributions according 
to each country’s legal framework and through the relevant 
national regulatory authorities. In early 2023, the company 
enhanced its disclosures to include links to our non-U.S. 
political contributions.

The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee 
of the Board of Directors annually reviews our public policy 
agenda and advocacy program. These reviews ensure that 
our activities align with our business interests and serve 
the needs of our shareowners and broader stakeholder 
community. The North America Operating Unit Vice 
President of Public Policy, Federal Government Relations & 
Political Engagement is responsible for management of 
our public policy agenda and political engagement, in 
consultation with the North America Operating Unit Senior 
Vice President & Chief of Public Affairs, Communications 
and Sustainability, and the Legal Department. Our political 
participation is conducted in an open and nonpartisan 
manner and in strict compliance with the Code of Business 
Conduct, the U.S. Political Engagement Policy, and 
applicable laws and regulations.

The Coca-Cola Company was recognized 
as a Trendsetter in the 2022 CPA-Zicklin 
Index of Corporate Political Disclosure 
and Accountability. The Center for Political 
Accountability (CPA) aims to encourage 
responsible corporate political activity, 
protect shareholders and strengthen the 
integrity of the political process.

PIC
S During 2022, we undertook a comprehensive 

review of the highest priority topics for our 
company, system and stakeholders.

Identifying and prioritizing our material topics, in 
collaboration with a cross-functional internal team 
and key external stakeholders, is a foundational 
step in how we develop our corporate 
strategy, conduct and evolve our business, 
and report on progress.

Prior to 2022, our last comprehensive review 
was conducted in 2019, with refreshes being 
undertaken in 2020 and 2021 to establish closer 
alignment between priority topics and business-
relevant issues and practices.

Our 2022 review included a robust analysis and 
broader engagement guided by ERM, a leading 
sustainability consultancy. This was followed 
by interviews with more than 30 internal and 
external stakeholders and an online survey that 
had 90 responses from across the globe.

Stakeholders we talked to represent a diversity 
of views and have deep expertise across a range 
of issues and sectors. The stakeholders included 
investors and financial institutions, NGOs, 
bottling partners, trade and industry associations, 
business peers, customers and suppliers. 

Our comprehensive 2022 review process resulted 
in an updated priority topics matrix, which 
reflects adjustments to several key issues in 
response to feedback from both internal and 
external stakeholders. 

The updated matrix continues to demonstrate 
that our priority topics are Packaging & Circularity 
and Water Stewardship, followed by Health 
& Nutrition and Climate Change. Responsible 
Sourcing and Talent Attraction, Retention and DEI 
increased in importance versus the prior year.

We have implemented management initiatives 
to address these priority topics. We also 
continue to evolve our strategic approach to 
effectively manage associated business risks and 
opportunities in light of the ongoing changes to 
both our business and the external context in 
which we operate. This is detailed in the individual 
sections of the report.

As one of the world’s largest 
and most recognized companies, 
we have an opportunity to 
use our size and scale to help 
address global challenges. 

While we strive to make progress on our own,  
we are committed to fostering partnerships  
that drive collective impact in areas including 
water stewardship, packaging circularity, climate 
action and many more. As a global business  
that operates locally, we can extend our impact 
and reach because of the strength of the  
Coca-Cola system, which includes our 
approximately 200 bottling partners worldwide.

We engage with stakeholders, including 
governments, NGOs, communities, suppliers, 
investors, business partners, customers and 
consumers around the world and throughout  
our network, in many forums and formats. 
Feedback from our stakeholders allows us to 
learn and improve, and informs our business  
and sustainability strategy.

In all our engagements with stakeholders, 
we are committed to upholding the 
principles of transparency, consistency, 
accountability and integrity.

Partnership�Highlights

•   Coca-Cola Philippines and Indorama Ventures 
partnered to establish PETValue Philippines, 
a full operation recycling facility that is the 
first of its kind in the country. The facility is 
helping to drive collective action toward a 
circular economy for PET plastic, by providing 
more than 800 collection points for PET 
bottles in the country. PETValue’s projected 
capacity, or the amount of used plastic bottles 
it can process, is 30,000 metric tons per year, 
which requires around 2 billion PET bottles as 
input to be recycled.

•   In partnership with WWF-Pakistan, we are 
working to address water scarcity and quality 
issues for approximately 360,000 people in 
Lahore, Pakistan who rely on the Ravi River as 
a freshwater source. 

•    We partnered with the CEO Water Mandate, 
denkstatt and others to help build the 
business case for Nature-Based Solutions 
(NBS) by developing a standardized 
methodology to quantify the co-benefits 
of NBS projects and calculate the social 
return on investment. 

•    We joined the Supplier Leadership on  
Climate Transition initiative along with  
18 other companies to mobilize collective 
climate action by providing suppliers with 
resources, tools and knowledge to accelerate 
their decarbonization. Ten suppliers that we 
sponsored, who completed the program, 
have set or committed to setting emissions 
reduction targets through the Science-Based 
Targets initiative. 

•    We joined with the Business Coalition for a 
Global Plastics Treaty and the International 
Council of Beverages Associations in support 
of a UN Global Plastics Treaty. The Business 
Coalition is supporting the treaty negotiations 
around the vision of a circular economy 
in which plastic never becomes waste or 
pollution, and the value of products and 
materials is retained in the economy.

In 2022, as COVID-19 restrictions eased, we were able to attend several 
global events in person. We used these opportunities to engage with diverse 
stakeholders, to listen and to explore ways to drive collective action to 
positively impact people, communities and our environment.

the 2022 Middle East edition brought 
together over 300 women from top 
companies across the region to Dubai 
to learn, network, share and apply 
best practices on leadership, success, 
diversity and inclusion.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

OPEN�Conversation�

Coca-Cola Netherlands held its fifth OPEN 
conversation in October involving our local 
bottling partner and key stakeholders to 
discuss topics such as packaging, water, 
climate, diversity, equity and inclusion 
and how we can all contribute to a 
healthier living environment.

THE NETHERLANDS

The Coca-Cola Company 
became a Strategic Partner 
of the Ellen�MacArthur�
Foundation with the 
announcement shared 
during its annual Summit 
on July 5, 2022. The 
Foundation’s Strategic 
Partners include some of 
the world’s largest and most 
influential organizations, with 
transformative potential to 
demonstrate what’s possible 
to accelerate the transition 
to a circular economy.



1  The previously reported figure of 18.5 million people provided access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene since 2010, was through working collectively 
with The Coca-Cola Foundation, bottlers, implementing partners and other co-funders.

2   Substantially all replenish data is internally validated and verified; the equivalent volume for 100% Replenish rate (182.9 Billion litres BL) is externally assured. Peer-
reviewed methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project and operating unit for all externally assured data; one exception was approved for 
internally validated and verified data. The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long-term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies 
annually. Replenish benefits fall under three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and 
Sanitation (17.4 BL). Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities between 2019–2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless 
otherwise stated, in this report finished beverages is based on global sales volume. Approximately 13.5 Billion liters (approx. 7%) of the water used in our beverages 
that we returned to nature and communities is from 7 projects located in Ukraine and Belarus where since May 2019 we have not been able to monitor projects on 
intervals aligned with internal guidelines due to COVID and the ongoing war.

3  Many of our water replenishment projects are funded by The Coca-Cola Foundation.

SECTION SCOPE: In this section our 
water leadership work refers to actions 
by the company, The Coca-Cola 
Foundation as well as our owned and 
independent bottling partners and our 
independent suppliers and partners.

Water  
Leadership
Water is a priority for The Coca-Cola Company 
because it is essential to life, our beverages and the 
communities we serve. It is also critical to public health, 
food security, biodiversity and the climate crisis. The 
world is experiencing increased water insecurity, which 
is evident through water scarcity, with demands for 
safe, usable water exceeding supply in certain areas. 

We have operations nearly everywhere in the world—
in more than 200 countries and territories. That 
means we have a responsibility to accelerate our 
efforts to help address water stress, protect local 
water resources and help build community climate 
resilience—communities’ ability to adapt to these 
changing conditions. That’s why our 2030 Water 
Security Strategy is focused on accelerating the 
actions needed to increase water security where we 
operate, source ingredients and touch people’s lives.1

2030 WATER SECURITY STRATEGY
Vision: Our 2030 Water 
Security Strategy is focused on 
accelerating the actions needed 
to increase water security where 
we operate, source ingredients 
and touch people’s lives. We 
do that by contributing toward 
sustainable, clean water access 
that improves livelihoods and 
wellbeing while protecting 
against water-related disasters. 
We also work to preserve 
nature and biodiversity as well 
to promote advanced water 
management practices.

Our�2030�strategy�is�grounded�in�the�fact�that�water�is�a�shared�resource.� 
As�such,�our�work�is�organized�to�address�water�security�in:

Over the last couple of years, we followed a process to segment and prioritize our 
operating facilities, commercial regions, sourcing regions for global priority ingredients, 
watersheds, and communities based on those with the highest water-related risks 
(read more on the following page). As a result of this work, we have set three key goals 
designed to achieve our vision:

OUR  
COMMUNITIES

GOAL 1

Achieve 100% regenerative  
water use across 175 of our 
facilities identified as facing 
high levels of water stress  
by 2030.

GOAL 2

Improve the health of  
60 watersheds identified  
as most critical for our 
operations and agricultural 
supply chain by 2030. 

GOAL 3

Return a total of 2 trillion 
liters of water to nature

26THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

CEO MESSAGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCONTENTS AGRICULTUREPORTFOLIO DATA APPENDIXPACKAGING FRAMEWORKSWATER OPERATIONSCLIMATE PEOPLEOUR COMPANY

In 2022, we completed our analysis of water-
related risks in areas where we can make 
the greatest impact1. We prioritized our 
operating facilities, commercial regions, 
sourcing regions for global priority ingredients, 
watersheds and communities. 

Operations�
We analyzed water sourcing risks across 
approximately 700 operational locations (mainly 
concentrate plants and bottling facilities) and 
mapped the minor river basins and sourcing 
basins of these facilities. We catalogued these 
locations based on the detailed mapping 
and results from an Enterprise Water Risk 
Assessment from the World Resources Institute’s 
Aqueduct 3.0 tool and from Facility Water 
Vulnerability Assessments—our site-level, 
internal proprietary tool.

As a result, each facility has been placed within 
one of three categories: 

•  �LEADERSHIP�LOCATIONS: Approximately 
25% of our facilities face the highest level of 
water-related risks and are on a path to 100% 
regenerative water use by 2030. 

•   ADVANCED�EFFICIENCY�LOCATIONS: System 
facility locations in a water-stressed context 
that will drive advanced water efficiency 
improvements in operations.

•   CONTRIBUTING�LOCATIONS: System facility 
locations in areas with low water-related risks. 
These will contribute to water security overall 
by implementing the Coca-Cola system's 
Water Resource Sustainability Standard, 
achieving industry benchmark water efficiency 
and 100% compliance with wastewater 
discharge standards.

Watersheds
Similarly, we undertook a comprehensive process 
to identify priority watersheds across our system. 
These include our Leadership Locations and 
their water sources, where we source global 
priority ingredients, key growth markets and 
priority communities. 

Communities
We also began mapping priority communities, 
based on their lack of access to water, sanitation 
and hygiene (WASH) and resilience to water-
related impacts of climate change (e.g., floods 
and droughts), with a focus on communities 
close to our facilities, and/or in urban growth 
centers where we sell our products, and/
or in rural farming communities where 
we source ingredients.

By mapping and overlaying our priority facilities, 
watersheds and communities, we have developed 
a framework of prioritization and a deeper 
understanding of risks, which will help us 
develop holistic, integrated and context-based 
approaches to help increase water security 
where it matters the most in our business, 
operations and supply chains.

Defining�Regenerative�Water�Use�

Regenerative water use means facilities 
must reduce, reuse, recycle and replenish 
the water used in operations in the local 
correlated watersheds for beneficial social, 
economic and/or environmental uses by 
other stakeholders and nature.

1  During the course of implementation of our 2030 Water Security 
Strategy we will review our prioritization periodically, as risks 
evolve and/or new data emerges. This may lead to changes in 
the prioritized facilities, watersheds and communities.

PRIORITIZING OPERATIONS, COMMUNITIES AND WATERSHEDS

Making�the�Greatest�Impact�Where�It�Matters�Most�by�Doing�What�Matters�Most

Prioritizing operations, watersheds and 
communities in Türkiye

In Türkiye, we identified an operating facility located in a water-
stressed area as a priority facility (Leadership Location) in the city 
of Bursa in the north-west of the country. The facility is owned and 
operated by our bottling partner Coca-Cola İçecek. Further, we 
identified the Bursa/Balikesir watershed as a priority because it 
not only serves as a water source for our facility but also because 
it supports the growing of apples, peaches and nectarines 
that we source as ingredients in our products. In addition, we 
identified seven farming villages in the same province as priority 
communities, based on their location in ingredient sourcing and key 
market growth regions. 

The watershed faces high levels of water scarcity and pollution 
of water sources from local industries, including textiles and 
agriculture (e.g., use of insecticides). Rural farming communities 
have relatively low levels of access to clean water.

The operating facility is driving water efficiency improvements  
by conducting a gap assessment against the Coca-Cola system’s 
Water Resource Sustainability Standard compliance process 
and working with a third-party consultancy to screen options 
for improving water efficiency in our operations. We developed a 
watershed stewardship plan which includes supporting farmers 
to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water contamination, 
reforestation efforts to help filter water pollution and regulate 
precipitation and evaporation flows, and helping communities to 
install rainwater harvesting systems.

In this way we are working to help improve water security by 
focusing on actions we can take both within and outside our 
operations to help improve water efficiency and watershed 
health as well as support local communities and farmers through 
interventions that are relevant to the local context.

See the Sustainable Agriculture section for more details on how we 
are supporting farmers to improve water management in growing 
our ingredients in this region.

CEO MESSAGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCONTENTS AGRICULTUREPORTFOLIO DATA APPENDIXPACKAGING FRAMEWORKSWATER OPERATIONSCLIMATE PEOPLEOUR COMPANY

All our production operations  
will continue to implement 
the Coca-Cola system’s Water 
Resource Sustainability Standard. 

The purpose of this standard is to identify and 
reduce water quality- and quantity-related 
challenges for our operations.

To decrease water use in our operations, we 
use internal tools such as the Water Efficiency 
Catalogue, which assesses technical standards 
(e.g., on-line flow monitoring, water collection 
and reuse capabilities) and team culture (e.g., 
training and communication on the importance of 
water efficiency) regarding water efficiency in our 
production facilities and provides innovative best 
practices (e.g., water reuse for package rinsing 
and water-free lubrication of conveyor belts). 

In the development of new plants, we leverage 
our Sustainability by Design Tool to ensure that 
water-efficient processes are implemented and 
that we achieve best-in-class water efficiency.

We have set an ambitious target to reduce our 
water use ratio by 20% by 2030 from a 2015 
baseline for all operations across the system.  
We are focused on water efficiency improvements 
in Leadership Locations and Advanced Efficiency 
Locations that operate in water-stressed contexts, 
which has resulted in a water use ratio of 1.79 
liters of water used per liter of beverage in 
2022. This is our highest achievement in water 
efficiency to date and significantly better than the 
industry average for carbonated soft drinks of 
1.91 l/l of beverages.1

Cost�of�Water
We have partnered with denkstatt to develop 
a “Cost of Water” tool for our teams. This tool 
will help us get a better understanding of the 
cost of water by evaluating the costs associated 
with potential water risks in addition to the 

operational costs associated with water use. 
Better understanding of these costs will help 
strengthen decision making and the business 
case for investment in initiatives that respond 
to local challenges.  
 
In 2022, we also worked with Bluerisk and 
Valuing Impact and a number of peer companies 
to better understand how projects returning 
water to communities and nature help create 
societal value. Across the 22 projects analyzed, 
we learned that these projects not only generated 
210 million cubic meters of volumetric water 
benefits, but also delivered $39 million in 
societal value, with an average societal return on 
investment (SROI) of 3.9. 

We have a goal to achieve 100% regenerative 
water use in all our 175 Leadership Locations 
globally by 2030. In 2022, we included progress 
against water replenishment in Leadership 
Locations as a metric for the Long-Term Incentive 
(LTI) plan for our executive leadership team. Over 
the past year, our Talent and Compensation 
Committee approved the inclusion of a metric 
related to water replenishment in Leadership 
Locations in line with the goals of our 2030 
Water Security Strategy.

REDUCING WATER CHALLENGES IN OUR OPERATIONS IMPROVING WATERSHED HEALTH

Water�Stewardship�in�
Concentrate�Plants�

Within our 18 concentrate production 
plants, which produce the concentrates 
used to make many of our sparkling 
beverages, the company has committed 
to driving water efficiency improvements. 
In 2022, we achieved a 7% average water 
efficiency improvement across all our 
concentrate plants compared to a 2015 
baseline. These facilities have worked 
as a network to review and assess the 
implementation of best practices and 
governance of water use, known as 

“Water Efficiency Maturity Assessments.”

As an example, in 2022, one of our 
concentrate plants in Ireland reduced its 
water consumption by more than 13,000 
cubic meters compared to the previous 
year by implementing circular washing in  
its clean-in-place process. A monitor-to-
improve mindset in our local team  
is also key to achieving and sustaining 
this level of performance.

As a member of the Alliance for Water 
Stewardship (AWS), we are proud to be 
a part of a global movement to advance 
good water stewardship practices. The 
AWS certification confirms that the 
highest global standard for responsible 
water stewardship has been met in 
support of social, cultural, environmental 
and economic benefits at both the site 
and catchment level. We plan to certify 
all our 18 concentrate production sites 
against the latest AWS Standard by 2025.

We�have�continued�to�improve�the�
efficiency�of�our�water�use. 

10% IMPROVEMENT in water efficiency 
across all system operations compared  
to 2015.

In 2022, The Coca-Cola Foundation 
provided support to Ceres for the 
Valuing Water Finance Initiative to drive 
investor leadership on valuing water 
and to broaden investors’ perspective 
on the role that water plays in many 
industries’ value chains.

Watershed�Stewardship�Plans

MEXICO 
In Chihuahua, Mexico, we partnered with The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental 
nonprofit organization, to develop a watershed stewardship plan for the Lago Bustillo y de los 
Mexicanos watershed. It was identified as a priority watershed because it supplies water to  
a manufacturing facility owned by our bottling partner Corporación del Fuerte, which is  
a Leadership Location. In addition, the watershed includes orchards from which the system 
sources apples. The agricultural sector and the city of Cuauhtémoc are major water users.  
The watershed is forecasted to face increasing water quality and quantity challenges in the 
coming years due to population growth and rising temperatures. With funding from Fundación 
Coca-Cola Mexico, our projects in this watershed have helped to improve rural communities’ 
access to water, mainly through rainwater harvesting systems and check dams. The watershed 
stewardship plan completed in 2022 helped identify key context-specific interventions to 
consider for future projects including, reforestation, rainwater harvesting, dams, plant nurseries, 
conservation of springs and community access to WASH, as well as the need to strengthen local 
partnerships. These plans will also help us to track improvements in watershed health and co-
benefits of projects (e.g., enhanced biodiversity and carbon sequestration). One project currently 
in the pipeline is working with an agri-tech partner, Kilimo, to help local farmers save water by 
adopting technology-enabled irrigation management tools.

Protecting watersheds and recognizing the 
unique challenges and characteristics of water 
sources around the world has long been 
a focus of our work. 

Watersheds supply water for drinking, agriculture 
and manufacturing; provide habitat for plants and 
animals; and offer opportunities for recreation. 
Based on our 2030 Water Security Strategy, we 
are placing even greater emphasis on the holistic 
improvement of watershed health. We set a goal 
to improve watershed health in 60 watersheds 
identified as most critical for our operations and 
agricultural supply chain by 2030.

OUR AGRICULTURAL WATER FOOTPRINT
Producing the ingredients used in our beverages 
accounts for an estimated 92% of our total blue 
water1 footprint, which is the volume of surface 
water and groundwater consumed in producing 
our finished products (evaporated or embedded 
in the product). That’s why, in 2022, we expanded 
our analysis and prioritization to include 
watersheds that support our priority ingredient 
sourcing, in addition to our operating facilities and 
those necessary for key market growth.

Examples�of�Watershed�Projects�in�Priority�Watersheds

 Many projects have multiple locations. 

The Coca-Cola Foundation and the Coca-Cola system have 
a long history of watershed projects. A selection of these 
projects is shown below. 
These projects include support for nature-based solutions such as reforestation, wetland and meadow 
restoration, as well as irrigation system improvements, invasive species removal and check dam 
construction. Many of the projects work in agricultural contexts to improve availability of water for 
irrigation and more efficiently use water in agriculture.

Water�Quality�
We’re working with several partners, 
including the World Resources Institute 
(WRI) and The Nature Conservancy, to 
develop a Water Quality Benefit Accounting 
(WQBA) methodology that seeks to provide 
guidance on identifying shared water 
quality challenges, activity selection, and 
recommended water quality indicators and 
benefit calculation methods.

CEO MESSAGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCONTENTS AGRICULTUREPORTFOLIO DATA APPENDIXPACKAGING FRAMEWORKSWATER OPERATIONSCLIMATE PEOPLEOUR COMPANY

We adopt a human-rights 
based approach to water and 
communities. 

We recognize the connection between our 
social license to operate and functional, resilient 
water infrastructure. Insufficient access to water, 
sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure 
and poor water quality are key challenges 
faced by communities around the world. These 
challenges are being exacerbated by population 
growth, climate change, political conflict 
and forced migration. 

For more than a decade, The Coca-Cola Company 
has established strong leadership in community 
water programs with the support of The Coca-Cola 
Foundation and many nonprofits, governments, 
customers and other partners.

We are updating our reporting methodology 
for our community water programming data to 
align with our 2030 Water Security Strategy and 
upcoming external frameworks, and we will apply  
it to future data reporting when ready.

In 2022, our operating units began the 
identification of priority communities based 
on communities’ access to WASH and/or their 
resilience to the impacts of climate change (e.g., 
floods and droughts). We aim to support our 
priority communities in addressing shared water 
challenges by identifying and implementing 
interventions focused on:

1.    Improving access to safe drinking water, 
sanitation and hygiene.

2.   Enabling adaptation to water-related 
climate change impacts.

3.  Ensuring rapid recovery from crises.

The�Co-Benefits�of�WASH�Access
We’re working with WASH4Work, an initiative 
hosted by the CEO Water Mandate, to develop 
a standardized methodology of accounting for 
the co-benefits of WASH projects (e.g., health, 
income, nutrition, safety and security, and 
education) and strengthen the business case for 
investments in WASH programs.

INTEGRATING GENDER INTO WASH PROGRAMS 
Gender has always been a core focus for our 
WASH programs because we know that women 
and girls suffer disproportionately from poor 
access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene. 

In 2018, The Coca-Cola Foundation partnered 
with Global Water Challenge (GWC), USAID and 
Ipsos through the Water and Development 
Alliance (WADA) on a study across three countries 
in Africa—Nigeria, Rwanda, and Eswatini—of 
the impact of improved WASH on women’s 
empowerment. This “Ripple Effect” study found 
that improved WASH had positive impacts on 
a number of important facets of women’s lives 
including time savings. The research established 
that of women who utilized time savings for 
economic activities, 91% saw an increase in 
income. Providing women with greater economic 
opportunity helps build resilience in their 
families and communities.

In 2022, we were pleased to build on this work 
and help develop, along with WaterAid and 
Diageo, practical guidance to help companies 
and their implementing partners turn strategic 
commitments on community WASH and gender 
equality into integrated projects that result in 
better, more sustainable outcomes which are 
critical parts of the pathway to gender equality 
and women’s empowerment.

Aliados�por�el�Agua�(Allies�for�Water)

In Latin America and the Caribbean, 25% of the population lack access to safely managed drinking 
water services.1 Climate change, urbanization, accelerated water usage, and inadequate infrastructure 
are among the leading causes. In response to this, Coca-Cola Latin America, in alliance with the 
Global Environment Technology Foundation (GETF) and local civil society organizations, designed and 
launched a platform called Aliados por el Agua (Aliados) to help improve access to water, sanitation 
and hygiene (WASH) for 2 million people across 18 countries by 2030.

In 2022, Aliados implemented more than 30 projects across 12 countries, in partnership with  
26 civil society organizations, as well as local municipalities, utility providers and communities, and 
funding from The Coca-Cola Foundation.

In addition, Coca-Cola Latin America partnered with Global Water Challenge and its women for 
water platform to develop the�Women�for�Water�Framework�for�Action—which is based on the 
Ripple Effect Study—and helps to integrate gender and women’s empowerment into the Aliados 
por el Agua platform by focusing projects on three key areas: income generation, health and 
wellbeing, and resilience.

With our partners and support from The Coca-Cola Foundation, we are piloting the framework across 
four projects in Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil to empower women through water-related programming.

BUILDING COMMUNITIES’ WATER RESILIENCE

SPOTLIGHT: INVESTING IN NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS

1 Source: WWF-Philippines | Ipo Watershed

Recognizing that nature 
itself often offers the best 
mechanisms for restoring 
watershed health, the company, 
The Coca-Cola Foundation and 
our bottling partners invest in 
nature-based solutions (NBS), 
such as forest protection and 
floodplain management, which 
build on natural processes to 
manage water systems. 

Through our work, we have learned that NBS 
projects often have multiple co-benefits, such 
as better water quality, carbon sequestration, 
increased climate resilience, and enhanced 
richness and variety of life of natural 
habitats (biodiversity).

We worked with denkstatt to develop a 
methodology to help us quantify and test the co-
benefits of NBS projects. In 2022, we partnered 
with the CEO Water Mandate, denkstatt and 
others to help build the business case for NBS 
by developing a standardized methodology to 
measure benefit accrual and a means to value 
social return on investment. The methodology 
has been tested across several of our water 
replenishment projects in key geographies. 

This valuation methodology supports the broader 
Benefit Accounting of Nature-Based Solutions for 
Watersheds project, including The NBS Benefits 
Explorer tool, led by the Pacific Institute and 
CEO Water Mandate, in partnership with The 
Nature Conservancy and LimnoTech. Our aim is 
to support public, private and non-profit sectors 
in developing effective policies and programs 
to incentivize greater implementation of and 
investment in NBS because water is at the nexus 
of many goals, including protecting habitats, 
increasing biodiversity, sequestering carbon and 
promoting community resilience in the face of 
changing weather patterns.

Reforestation�Helps�Restore�Watershed�Health� 
in�the�Philippines

The Ipo Watershed in Bulacan in the Philippines supplies water to 
Metro Manila, the second most populous region of the country. Forest 
cover within the watershed has dramatically dropped from 85% to 
just 40% in recent years1 due to illegal logging and unsustainable 
forest practices, which has resulted in a reduction in the natural 
water storage capacity of the basin. Malnutrition is also a pervasive 
challenge in local communities. Since 2016, The Coca-Cola Foundation 
and Coca-Cola Foundation Philippines have worked in partnership 
with WWF-Philippines to protect rainforests of the area, replant trees 
and provide livelihood opportunities. The project has reforested 165 
hectares of degraded land in the watershed and supported local 
communities to start household gardens to grow food.

In 2022 the project was assessed using the NBS valuation 
methodology. Overall, the project provided a very positive return on 
social investment and its specific co-benefits included:

•  WATER�QUANTITY: The replenishment of approximately 400 million 
liters of water per year due to decreased runoff and improved water 
access for local communities. 

•  CARBON�SEQUESTRATION: Approximately 2,500 metric tons  
of CO2e per year from reforestation.

•  FOOD�SUPPLY: Household gardens helped to tackle food 
insecurity and some of the trees planted have edible fruits 
(e.g., rambutan, coffee).

  
In order to achieve large-scale impact 
globally, we partner with governments, 
NGOs, communities and other companies. 
We share resources to increase all our 
efforts and to generate a bigger impact. 
We encourage others to join us.”

LESS SUGAR, MORE CHOICES

1  Source: Nielsen IQ, U.S. All Measured Channels, 2022 full year

We support the recommendations 
of leading health authorities that 
individuals should consume less 
than 10% of their total calories 
from added sugar. That’s why, 
from 2017–2022, we removed 
more than 900,000 tons of 
added sugar from our global 
portfolio through more than 1,000 
beverage reformulations. 

We support more than 50 calorie and sugar 
reduction pledges globally, in collaboration with 
industry peers. In 2022, we joined an updated 
industry-wide pledge in Australia to reduce the 
sugar content in our portfolio by 25% by 2025. 
In Kazakhstan, we are among nine members 
of the national beverage association to sign an 
industry pledge to reduce average added sugar 
in our drinks by 10% by the end of 2026. And 
we support guidelines released by the Health 
Ministry of Türkiye and Federation of Food and 
Drink Industry Associations of Türkiye to reduce 
sugar in nonalcoholic beverages and certain food 
categories by 10% by 2025.

In Europe, we are leading the soft drinks industry 
in voluntarily committing to sugar reduction. 
Together with peers through the industry 
association UNESDA Soft Drinks Europe, we have 
reduced average added sugars in soft drinks by 
28.6% across the European Union and United 
Kingdom since 2000. In June 2021, as part of 
the EU Code of Conduct for Responsible Food 
Business and Marketing Practices, we joined a 
UNESDA Soft Drinks Europe pledge to reduce 
the sugar in our drinks by an additional 10% by 
2025, which will represent a 33% average sugar 
reduction when completed by 2025 compared to 
2000. The European soft drinks sector is the only 
sector to have made an additional sugar reduction 
commitment under the EU Code of Conduct.

EUROPE
By 2025, we aim for 50% of the 
drinks we sell in Europe to be 
low- and no-calorie drinks (we’re 
currently at 45%) in support of the 
EU Commission’s Farm-to-Fork 
strategy to accelerate the transition 
to sustainable food systems.

UNITED STATES
We’re offering more low- and no-
calorie options in more places. For 
example, 99.7% of U.S. outlets carry 
our low- and zero-sugar SKUs—and, 
on average, 24 zero-sugar sparkling

FLAVOR BREAKTHROUGHS
Several of our core brands took creative 
approaches to promoting zero-calorie choices 
to younger consumers in 2022 through flavor 
innovations, packaging designs and digital 
experiences. The global Coca-Cola Creations 
platform introduced a series of limited-edition 
offerings inspired by consumer passion points 
of music, gaming and sports—starting with the 
outer space-inspired Coca-Cola Starlight, which 
offered fans a taste of outer space. In the United 
States, a limited-edition lineup of mysteriously 
flavored Fanta beverages was anchored by 
a zero-sugar option.

SWEETENER INNOVATION
One of the ways we achieve great taste without 
sugar is by using low- and no-calorie sweeteners. 
We only use sugar alternatives that have been 
thoroughly tested through scientific studies and 
confirmed as safe by globally recognized food 
safety authorities, including the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), the European Food 
Safety Authority (EFSA) and Food Standards 
Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ). When used 
as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle, we believe 
the science shows that sugar alternatives can 
help meet public health recommendations to 
reduce added sugar. Additionally, food additives 
such as non-sugar sweeteners help make food 
systems more sustainable by both reducing sugar 
and lowering our carbon emissions.

Our recent efforts have focused on collaborating 
with an ecosystem of suppliers and research 
organizations to develop, continuously improve 
and commercially scale stevia and other naturally 
derived sugar alternatives. A global list of more 
than 70 published journal articles dating back to 
2008, reflecting research we have directly funded 
or authored, can be found on our website. 

We continue to use our marketing to drive 
growth of our low- and no-calorie portfolio. 
Coca-Cola Zero Sugar has delivered double-
digit volume growth in five of the last six years.

In 2022, several leading low- and no-calorie 
brands in North America launched consumer

legal purchasing age who choose to drink, 
and encouraging only drinking in moderation. 
This means our brands will never be directed 

to minors below the legal purchasing age.  
We run regular trainings for our people 
and our partners, and always apply the 
appropriate safeguards across all channels  
of communications and sales. 

In 2022, we joined the International Alliance 
for Responsible Drinking (IARD), a consortium 
of leading beer, wine and spirits producers 
committed to reducing harmful drinking 
and promoting moderation through robust 
responsibility standards. In Brazil, we are 
working with three NGO partners on the 
Pega Leve (“Take it Easy”) program, which 
promotes moderation by communicating 
the risks of drinking and driving and 
excessive consumption, with a focus on 
18- to 29-year-olds. 

The Coca-Cola Company is also a member 
of Drinkwise in Australia and Drinkaware 
in the United Kingdom and the Republic 
of Ireland, which are independent not-for-
profit organizations that work with partners 
and members to reduce alcohol-related 
harm in those countries.

MORE INFORMATION FOR  
MORE INFORMED DECISIONS
We are committed to providing transparent 
nutrition information about all of our products, 
in line with local regulations, so consumers can 
make informed decisions. We were the first 
beverage company to place calorie information on 
the front of nearly all our packaging worldwide. 
Today, we provide nutrition information on 
product labels, with the exception of certain 
returnable bottles, fountain beverages 
and waters (unsweetened, unflavored). For 
these beverage and packaging types, we 
offer nutrition information through websites 
and consumer hotlines. 

RESPONSIBLE MARKETING 
We respect the role of parents and caregivers 
as the primary decision-makers for what their 
children drink, and we do not market any of our 
products directly to children under 13, regardless 
of nutritional profile. Effective January 1, 2022, we 
raised the age threshold from under 12 to under 
13 and reduced the audience threshold from 
35% to 30%. This means we will not place our 
marketing or advertising in any media, platform 
or event where more than 30% of the audience 
is under 13. Our policy goes beyond media and 
includes packaging, in-store and point of sale. 
Our approach is consistent with the International 
Chamber of Commerce Marketing & Advertising 
Code and its Framework for Responsible Food 
and Beverage Marketing Communication. 

We hold everyone involved in our marketing  
and communications accountable to our  
Global Responsible Marketing Policy, from 
employees and bottling partners to agency and 
media partners. We are a founding member of 
the International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA), 
a group of leading companies that self-regulate 
globally on responsible marketing to children. 
Additionally, we collaborate with industry peers at 
regional and local levels to scale collective action 
in responsible marketing pledge programs.

SMALLER PACKAGING
People can enjoy our drinks in sizes that help 
control portions and added sugar intake. These 
include 7.5-oz. mini cans and 8-oz. glass bottles in 
many markets. We continue to expand availability 
of these packages and introduce newer offerings, 
including 150-ml mini cans and 250-ml slim cans, 
so people can enjoy the same great tastes in sizes 
that are right for them. 

In 2022, we kicked off a pilot of a Coca-Cola 
Freestyle compact fountain dispenser at on-the-
go and at-work locations in France, Belgium, Great 
Britain and the Netherlands. In addition to giving 
consumers an expanded array of personalized, 
on-demand beverage choices—including low- and 
no-calorie options—the innovation helps reduce 
our carbon and packaging footprints.

Responsible�Growth�Into�Alcohol

Today, about 44% of our sparkling 
soft drink brands come in packages 
of 8.5 ounces or less.

In North America, 10-pack mini cans 
grew 39% in 2022.

WORKING TOWARD A WORLD WITHOUT WASTE
We recognize our responsibility to help solve complex 
plastic waste challenges facing our planet and society. 
That’s why, in 2018, we launched an ambitious strategy 
called World Without Waste to drive systemic change 
through a circular economy for our packaging. 
World Without Waste is a global sustainable 
packaging platform focused on measurable and 
interconnected goals, each of which are supported 
by additional targets:

•    Making 100% of our packaging recyclable globally 
by 2025—and using at least 50% recycled material in 
our packaging by 2030 (DESIGN); 

•    Collecting and recycling a bottle or can for each one 
we sell by 2030 (COLLECT); 

•    Bringing people together to support a healthy, 
debris-free environment (PARTNER).

CEO MESSAGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCONTENTS AGRICULTUREPORTFOLIO DATA APPENDIXPACKAGING FRAMEWORKSWATER OPERATIONSCLIMATE PEOPLEOUR COMPANY

We are making progress against 
each of our objectives, which are 
embedded in how we operate as 
a business, and we are taking a 
transparent approach to reporting 
our actions, results and learnings. 

Local teams are executing in ways appropriate 
for their markets, and we are using a networked 
approach to deliver impact at scale. Our work has 
also shown us where the major challenges are, 
and some of our markets will have challenges 
meeting goals as quickly as others.

Because packaging accounts for approximately 
30% of our carbon footprint, nearly all of our 
World Without Waste efforts align with our 
2030 science-based climate target and net zero 
ambition. When we lightweight our packaging, 
incorporate more recycled and bio-based 
material, invest in local recycling programs and 
increase our use of reusable packaging, we 
can reduce both waste and our greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions.

WORLD WITHOUT WASTE: DESIGN

Our�Packaging� 
Portfolio�

We deliver our beverages in a variety  
of packaging formats—from glass and  
PET bottles, to aluminum cans, to 
refillable packaging. Just as we offer 
drink choices for a range of occasions, 
our packaging portfolio gives consumers 
multiple ways to enjoy our brands 
conveniently and safely. 

Since glass, aluminum and PET plastic are 
all recyclable materials, they all can play 
a role in a circular economy. Refillable 
packages, both glass and plastic, can 
have the lowest carbon footprints of our 
packaging options. PET packages with 
recycled content can have a lower carbon 
footprint than aluminum and glass, which 
require more energy to produce, recycle 
and transport.

•   In Scotland, Costa Limited (“Costa”) carried out 
a 14-store pilot of an on-the-go reusable cup 
scheme, which invited consumers to rent a cup 
by scanning a QR code before enjoying their 
drink and then returning the cup for it to be 
washed and reused. The effort supports Costa’s 
global goal for 25% of its drinks to be served in 
reusable or refillable packaging by 2030.

We tailor our refillable packaging approach by 
market, based on local conditions. In 2023, we 
launched an end-to-end refillables operations 
guide to help local teams implement more 
effective strategies and plans.

Our Design goals establish a foundation for 
enabling a circular economy for our packaging 
materials. Creating a circular economy requires 
designing out waste by using, collecting and 
reusing recycled materials, which have inherent 
value. It also means embracing refillable and 
fountain/dispensed packaging solutions.

REFILLABLE PACKAGING 
Reusable packaging can reduce single-use 
packaging waste. Expanding refillable packaging 
options helps ensure high levels of collection 
of beverage containers. In 2022, we were 
proud to announce an industry-leading goal 
to have at least 25% of our beverage volume 

worldwide sold in refillable/returnable glass or 
plastic bottles or in fountain dispensers with 
reusable packaging by 2030. 

We continue to test and scale returnable 
glass bottle (RGB) and reusable PET pilot 
programs, including:

•   In Latin�America, the “Let’s Be Different” 
campaign kicked off on World Environment Day 
2022, inviting consumers to trade any recyclable 
PET bottle for a refillable bottle of Coca-Cola 
Zero Sugar. In Brazil, returnable, refillable PET 
bottles of Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite can be 
returned, cleaned and refilled up to 25 times.  
The package gives shoppers an affordable option 
and drives repurchase rates. 

•   In France, a 250-ml returnable glass bottle 
(RGB) launched in hotels, restaurants and cafes 
for Fuze Tea, Tropico, Sprite, Fanta and Minute 
Maid. Additionally, Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola 
Zero Sugar are now offered in RGBs nationwide, 
eliminating more than 15 million single-use 
glass bottles in 2022. 

•   In the United�States, a 500-ml returnable 
glass bottle pilot program in approximately 
100 retail and foodservice outlets in El Paso, 
Texas, generated a 75% return rate, and we 
are exploring expansion capabilities in 2023. 
We also are working with Reuse Seattle to 
reduce single-use plastic waste by encouraging 
customers to transition to reusable cups for our 
dispensed products, as part of a broader multi-
stakeholder effort on foodservice packaging 
across the metro region.

•   In South�Africa, we extended the rollout of 
refillable 2-liter and 1.5-liter PET plastic bottles. 

•   In Sri�Lanka, we responded to the ongoing 
economic crisis by introducing the Large 
Returnable Glass Bottle (LRGB), nicknamed 
the “Big Buddy Pack,” to provide an affordable 
and returnable, mealtime-focused option for 
families. Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite are offered 
in the 750-ml bottles, which feature paper 
labels and aluminum caps.

•   In Sweden, we are collaborating with Reitan 
Convenience on a reusable packaging pilot in 
Stockholm. Shoppers who visit the sustainability-
focused PDX store can choose from more than 
60 fountain beverages, many of which are 
not available in bottles or cans. Shoppers are 
encouraged to bring their own refillable vessels 
or purchase a reusable stainless steel tumbler. 

•   In Hong�Kong,�China, we have installed almost 
100 Bonaqua Water Stations along hiking trails 
and in shopping malls and transportation hubs. 
Consumers pay a small fee to fill their own 
bottles with hot or cold Bonaqua water.

VIRGIN PET REDUCTION 
In 2021, we set a goal to reduce our use of virgin 
plastic derived from nonrenewable sources by 
avoiding a cumulative 3 million metric tons by 
2025 compared to 2020. We are pursuing this 
goal, which represents about 20% of our virgin 
plastic use, through more than 150 lightweighting 
projects and advancements on use of recycled 
and renewable materials.

In 2022, we avoided around half a million metric 
tons of virgin plastic usage through these 
efforts with an incremental avoidance of over 
50,000 metric tons since last year. However, 
growth of plastic packaging has outpaced 
efforts on lightweighting and use of recycled 
content, so that we have not reduced our use of 
virgin plastic overall.

MOVING TOWARD 100% rPET1

Demand for recycled PET plastic for food-grade 
applications currently exceeds supply, so we need 
to help build a sustainable pipeline of high-quality 
material. We work with communities to boost PET 
recycling and collection; collaborate with recycling 
partners; and secure rPET to help ensure material 
for our bottles is used again and again. 

In recent years, system partners and suppliers 
have announced significant investments, both 
individually and through joint ventures, to boost 
the global rPET infrastructure. Many investments 
are coming online in the next two years and will 
change the rPET landscape, particularly in Asia. 

We continue to work with industry peers to 
advocate for government regulations permitting 
the use of rPET in food and beverage packaging. 
Notable countries with food-grade recycled 
plastics acceptance standards for use in

this report to 100% Recycled PET, 100% rPET, or 100% Recycled 
Plastic Beverage Packaging, we are referring to the material 
from which the plastic bottle is made, not the cap and label.

beverages now include Bahrain, Bangladesh, 
Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi 
Arabia, South Korea, Thailand and Yemen. 

Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines Inc. and 
Indorama Ventures—the world’s largest recycled 
PET flake producer—began operations at the new 
PETValue recycling facility. The country’s first 
bottle-to-bottle production site will process  
2 billion clear PET plastic bottles into new bottles 
for Coca-Cola brands. Indorama Ventures will open 
a similar facility in Indonesia in 2023.

Around the world, many of our biggest brands are 
taking major steps to support a circular economy 
for plastic packaging. More than 40 markets 
currently offer at least one brand in 100% rPET 
packaging. A few highlights from 2022 include:

•   In the United�States�and�Canada, we recently 
began offering the majority of DASANI bottles— 
from 20-oz. and 1.5-liter singles to 10-oz. and 
12-oz. multipacks—in 100% rPET plastic. The shift 
supports the DASANI brand's pledge to remove 
the equivalent of 2 billion virgin plastic bottles 
from production by 2027 compared to 2021 
levels. The announcement followed the launch 
of 100% rPET bottles in New York, California 
and Texas, which also included Coca-Cola 20-
oz. bottles. Bold, on-pack labels drive consumer 
awareness with “100% Recycled Bottle” and 
“Recycle Me Again” calls to action.

•   Eight markets in Europe (Austria, Belgium, 
Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, 
Sweden, Switzerland) offer their entire  
locally produced portfolios in 100% rPET.

•   In Qatar, Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Arwa water 
were sold in 100% rPET bottles in FIFA World 
Cup 2022 stadiums and fan zones. This marked 
both the FIFA World Cup debut of the sustainable 
packaging format and the Middle East’s first 
100% rPET rollout. Dedicated recycling bins and 
on-site communication ensured proper collection 
of all bottles to be recycled and converted locally 
back into new ones, closing the loop and leaving 
behind a green legacy.

Building�a�Global�rPET�Supply�Chain�

Through joint ventures and long-term supplier agreements, our system is 
making strategic investments to boost recycling capacity, unlock new supplies 
of recycled plastic and scale new technologies.

•   In Vietnam, we launched 100% rPET Coca-Cola 
bottles, which is projected to avoid 2,000 metric 
tons of virgin plastic usage annually.

•   In Japan, we achieved our World Without 
Waste goal of 50% recycled material use in 
Q1 2022. Four brands are now offered in 100% 
recycled PET and supported by an educational 
marketing campaign. 

SPRITE TRANSITIONS FROM GREEN  
TO CLEAR PET
We continued to transition Sprite plastic bottles 
from green to clear PET to help increase the 
efficiency of recycling systems. The move, which 
the brand has completed or is in process in over 
100 countries, improves the efficiency of recycling 
systems and boosts availability of food-grade 
rPET. As one example, Coca-Cola North America’s 
entire green plastic portfolio—including packaging 
for Sprite, Fresca, Seagram’s and Mello Yello—
made the transition to clear PET in 2022.

Sustainable�Innovation

We continue to deliver breakthrough technologies 
to lightweight our plastic packaging:

Label-less�bottles are now available across 
a range of brands in Japan, South Korea and 
China. Laser engraving technology used directly 
on the bottle helps improve recyclability and 
reduce carbon emissions.

We licensed our technology for a 100%�plant-
based�plastic�bottle to a company building a 
commercial-scale facility in Germany, which is 
scheduled to deliver material in 2023. Bio-based 
plastic packaging has a lower carbon footprint 
than petroleum-based plastic packaging.

Bottles with tethered�caps, which enable 
bottles and caps to be collected together for 
recycling, are being piloted for our entire portfolio 
in Germany, Bulgaria and Italy. Additionally, 
a new lightweighted bottle neck finish in 
Europe will save an estimated 9,100 tons of 
plastic per year by 2024.

The KeelClip®1�packaging�solution made from 
recyclable cardboard replaces plastic rings for 
multi-packs. Following a successful rollout across 
Europe, the first-of-its-kind solution is being 
piloted in select U.S. markets.

As The Coca-Cola Company’s second-largest 
brand, Sprite is proud to demonstrate its 
commitment to circularity through our packaging 
by ensuring every bottle we make can be 
recycled and made into a new one. We can 
only achieve our World Without Waste goals by 
creating closed-loop packaging streams, and that 
starts with clear PET.”

WORLD WITHOUT WASTE: COLLECT

We work with partners across business, 
government and civil society to create or 
support closed-loop systems that ensure our 
packages are collected and recycled or reused. 
Delivering a circular economy will require 
significant and urgent improvement in waste 
management and recycling systems around the 
world. Preserving the inherent economic value 
of our packaging—and ensuring circularity— 
requires robust collection and recycling systems 
across packaging types. 

Collection challenges vary, as every country has 
unique governments, regulatory environments 
and consumer behaviors. Though some countries 
have high recycling rates across packaging types, 

in many regions the recycling rate for PET bottles 
lags that of some other materials.  While we 
continue to focus on national collection rates, in 
2022, with input from key external stakeholders, 
we updated our collection tracking guidance to 
account for material collected through system-
led efforts. Company and bottler teams in 
markets with limited recycling infrastructures 
(including parts of Latin America, Africa and Asia) 
are financing system-led collection initiatives to 
supplement national systems and are launching 
our own tracking systems. In 2023, we will start 
incorporating Coca-Cola system-led collection 
data into our aggregate numbers.

we seek ways to empower the informal waste 
collection sector in the circular economy. In 
developed markets, we are working with industry 
peers to build collection infrastructures—
including our more than 40 years of experience 
operating 40+ local Deposit Return Systems

2022�Worldwide�Collection�Rates1

We advocate for well-designed Extended�
Producer�Responsibility (EPR) schemes, in 
which companies that produce packaging fund 
collection, sorting and recycling with the goal 
of increasing recycling rates. Recognizing that 
industry cannot achieve a circular economy on 
its own, we are part of a Consumer Goods Forum 
(CGF) coalition of 40 companies supporting the 
development of EPR programs in collaboration 
with governments. The coalition has published 
guiding principles and key design parameters for 
optimal EPR programs. 

In the United States, we’re making progress 
one community at a time, through our industry 
initiative Every Bottle Back. As of November 2022, 
the initiative has launched over 25 projects which 
are projected to collect and capture nearly 700 
million pounds of PET over ten years. 

We also work with peers and partners to 
advocate for legislation that enables a circular 
economy, like a recent EPR law passed in 
Colorado and minimum recycled content laws 
passed in California, Washington and New Jersey. 
However, collection rates in the United States trail 
those of many other countries, and we know there 
is much more work to do.

Ensuring respect for the human rights of 
vulnerable workers in the informal waste 
sector is an important pillar of our Collection 
efforts. Over the last two years, we have 
partnered with industry peers and Tearfund, 
an NGO advocating for improved livelihoods 
for informal waste sector workers, on the Fair 
Circularity Initiative to develop human rights 
principles and guidelines for engaging with the 
informal waste collection industry. For more 
information, see the Human Rights section.

Additional�2022�highlights:

•   In the Philippines, we partnered with the 
Technical Education and Skills Development 
Authority  to pilot a certified skills training 
program for workers in the informal waste 
collection sector. These workers have access 
to training, tools and equipment for efficient 
waste collection and connections to materials 
recovery facilities (MRF) that buy the waste that 
is collected. We also are creating more than 
2,000 collection hubs in sari-sari (convenience) 
stores and other retail outlets where community 
members can drop off used, clear PET bottles 
in return for incentives. Participating retailers 
earn income from selling collected PET bottles 
to waste management companies and recyclers. 
Similar programs are in place in Malaysia, 
Myanmar and Thailand. 

•   In Brazil, SustentaPET collection centers take in 
more than 700,000 PET bottles a day to produce 
recycled resin that ultimately becomes new 
packaging. In its first three years, the program 
has recycled more than 83,000 metric tons of 
PET—and will expand to additional states in 2023.

•   In Egypt, we partner with BariQ, the largest 
bottle-to-bottle recycling plant in the Middle 
East, to recycle 14,000 metric tons of plastic 
waste annually to food-grade product compatible 
with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Egyptian 
Organization for Standardization (EOS).

•   In India, we’re teaming with bicycle grocery 
delivery service Zepto for the “PET Return and 
Recycle” initiative. Using the Zepto mobile app, 
consumers can return up to four empty PET 
bottles (across any brand) to be collected by 
Zepto riders during home delivery trips. Following 
a successful pilot in Mumbai, the program will 
expand to additional cities. 

1 These collection rates represent non-refillable PET packaging only.

WORLD WITHOUT WASTE: PARTNER
Tackling the global plastic waste crisis requires 
cross-sector collaboration and alignment on 
common principles and targets. We work with 
a range of stakeholders at a global, regional 
and local level. This includes partnering with 
governments and community organizations to 
strengthen recycling infrastructures and boost 
collection rates; collaborating with customers, 
peers and industry associations to shape public 
policy that supports a circular economy; and 
teaming up with suppliers, startups and R&D 
partners to fuel sustainable packaging innovation. 

In 2022, we enhanced our partnership with the 
Ellen MacArthur Foundation by becoming a 
Strategic Partner alongside some of the world’s 
largest and most influential organizations, 
with transformative potential to demonstrate 
what’s possible in the transition to a circular 
economy. As a Strategic Partner we support 
the Foundation’s mission to develop and 
promote a circular economy beyond our work on 
plastics and deepen our engagement globally, 
regionally and locally.  

We have been working with the Foundation  
on plastics across a range of projects and 
initiatives, including as a signatory to their  
Global Commitment in collaboration with the  
UN Environment Programme. In the past couple 
of years, we increased our ambition and set 
virgin plastics reduction and reusable packaging 
targets.

In September 2022, we also joined the Business 
Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty convened by 
the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and WWF, and we 
have an active role as a Co-Chair of the Coalition’s 
Policy Working Group. Over 80 organizations, 
including businesses from across the plastics 
value chain, financial institutions and NGOs, are 
supporting the development of an ambitious, 
effective and legally binding UN treaty to end 
plastic pollution—which will set common goals, 
rules and obligations for member states, and in 
turn, for businesses. Through a shared vision we 
believe that a legally binding treaty must set the 
right enabling conditions to successfully scale 
a circular economy for plastic and end plastic 
pollution, and in doing so, will level the playing 
field across countries and industries. This will help 
ensure all plastics users participate in the funding 
of collection systems and will set consistent 
targets for areas such as recyclability, recycled 
content and collection.  

We continue to play an active role in the AB�
InBev�100+�Accelerator�program, a global open 
innovation program committed to crowdsourcing 
and piloting sustainability-focused startups 
and solutions. The program’s 2022 cohort is 
supporting 46 startups with funding, training, 
mentoring and other hands-on support to execute 
pilot projects in a partner company’s supply chain. 
Within the Coca-Cola system, we are pursuing 
six pilot projects, building on the five pilots from 
last year. We have focused our investments 
in concepts that support a circular economy, 
water and climate. And while we are early in the 
process, we are seeing promise. Pilot projects 

from the last cycle (2021–2022) with ReciVeci 
(Ecuador) and RecyclePoints (Nigeria) resulted in 
ongoing partnerships that are helping to further 
our World Without Waste plans.

In the Philippines, we are partnering with Save 
Philippine Seas on a campaign to find and scale 
community-based plastic waste solutions. 
In 2022, five startups—Barrio Studios, Sagip 
Kalikasan, KAKASIE Eco-Park, #RefillNotLandfill 
and Alon and Araw—received grants from  
The Coca-Cola Foundation to advance their 
collection, recycling and education projects.  

In Morocco, we are collaborating with WWF on 
the Plastic Smart Cities project, which brings 
together cities and tourism destinations to fight 
plastic pollution. The partnership in Tangier aims 
to reduce leakage of plastic waste into nature by 
30%. In 2021 and 2022, the partners and the local 
waste management department have collected 
more than 3,900 metric tons of plastic waste.

We look forward to partnering with more like-
minded organizations and communities to make 
the vision of a World Without Waste a reality.

We now have five years of experience 
implementing the World Without Waste program. 
With targets for both 2025 and 2030, in 2023 
we are taking stock of our current status across 
markets to ensure our local teams have the plans 
and investments in place to continue to make 
progress. Our experience in a handful of markets 
that are already achieving high performance 
against specific goals, or the full suite of targets, 
indicates that these goals can be met. However, 
we are not currently on track to meet the World 
Without Waste targets for 2030. Package design 
and the use of recycled materials are areas 
that are ultimately in our control, but costs, 
quality, technology and consumer preferences 
are dynamic factors that affect our ability and 
timelines for implementation. The key challenge 
for us is collection for recycling of beverage 
packaging, which is the key step to ensure a 
functioning circular economy. 

We will continue to invest in innovation for  
the small percentage of our packaging that 
currently has recycling challenges, including juice 
pouches, opaque packaging currently used for 
dairy beverages, and cartons. And, we will invest 
in new recycling technologies for PET plastic  
and other packaging materials.

We see a significant opportunity to work more 
proactively with global and regional customers, 
many of which have announced their own 
sustainable packaging goals that can only be 
achieved in collaboration with key suppliers. 
Looking ahead, we will build on our longstanding 
relationships to make collective progress.

circular economy. Here are a few examples:

  
We have no time to waste. The need for global 
coordination to tackle the plastic pollution crisis 
has never been more urgent. A Business Coalition 
for a Global Plastics Treaty will push strongly 
for a framework that leaves the business-as-
usual approach at the door and ushers us into 
a new era where ending plastic pollution is 
finally within reach.”

2030 SCIENCE-BASED TARGET

PACKAGING 30–35%
A circular economy helps reduce GHG 
emissions. We are incorporating more 
recycled material, lightweighting 
our packaging, investing in recycling 
infrastructure and using more 
reusable packaging. In 2023, we are 
building our capabilities in life cycle 
assessment (LCA) to further drive 
synergies between our work on 
packaging and climate.

INGREDIENTS 10–15%
We work with our agricultural 
suppliers to increase energy efficiency 
and realize carbon sequestration 
benefits from Nature-Based Solutions 
(NBS). We also work with leading 
sustainable sourcing schemes to 
quantify the impact of sustainable 
sourcing on emissions reduction. See 
Sustainable Agriculture for more.

MANUFACTURING &  
OTHER FACILITIES 10–15%
We provide system guidance to 
improve energy efficiency and 
increase the generation and purchase 
of renewable energy. In 2022, there 
has been new renewable energy 
generation at system bottling  
plants in Europe, Latin America,  
the Philippines, India and the  
Middle East.

DISTRIBUTION 5–10%
We’re working to increase fuel 
efficiency and the use of hybrid and 
electric vehicles across the system. 
Coca-Cola Europacific Partners 
(CCEP) increased their use of hybrid 
and electric cars and vans in Europe 
from 12% in 2021 to 20% in 2022 and 
introduced 30 electric trucks to make 
last mile deliveries to customers in 
Belgium, covering approximately 40% 
of the country’s local delivery routes.

REFRIGERATION 30–35%
We are continuing to replace older 
equipment with hydrofluorocarbon 
(HFC)-free and more energy-efficient 
coolers. In 2022, 88% of all new 
coolers placed were HFC-free.  
This is an increase from 61% of 
coolers placed in 2016.

We are working to reduce our 
carbon footprint in line with 
science to avoid the worst 
impacts of climate change. 

We do this by analyzing and prioritizing the 
sources of GHG emissions across our value chain 
and by partnering with stakeholders to drive 
down those emissions.

As of 2022, we reduced our emissions across 
Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 7%,1 making progress toward 
our science-based reduction target of 25% by 
2030 against a 2015 baseline1. Our ambition is 
to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Several 
of our bottling partners have announced 
their own science-based targets and net zero 
pledges to drive climate action across the 
global Coca-Cola system.

In 2022, our scope 1 emissions were 4.4 million 
metric tons, scope 2 emissions were 3.5 million 
metric tons2 and scope 3 emissions were 57.0 
million metric tons.

Climate Business Network, we share best 
practices to drive collective ambition 
and scale action together. Participation 
in the Clean Energy Buyers Association 
(CEBA) allows us to help deploy market 
and policy solutions toward a carbon-free 
energy system. Membership in Ceres’ 
Company Network has helped to identify 
opportunities to drive further progress 
toward net zero emissions.

CLIMATE CHANGE GOVERNANCE 
The Corporate Governance and Sustainability 
Committee of our Board of Directors oversees 
climate-related issues. The Committee assists 
our Board in overseeing the company’s 
environmental, social, legislative, regulatory and 
public policy matters, including progress against 
our science-based emissions reduction target. The 
committee reports regularly to the full Board on 
these and other matters.

MANAGING CLIMATE RISK
Our Risk Steering Committee oversees regular 
system-wide risk assessments. We integrate 
climate risk planning into this cross-functional 
and cross-company Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) process. We regularly evaluate commodity-
specific risks and resilience associated with 
climate impacts on water and our supply chain. 

Risks that could materially affect our business, 
financial condition and results of operations 
are disclosed in the company's Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2022. This includes risks related to the effects of 
climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives 
to address climate change. Our management 
team works to mitigate these risks through, 
among other things, business continuity planning, 
setting targets that drive efficiency and making 
investments to improve our performance and 
increase resilience. Ultimately, the Corporate 
Governance and Sustainability Committee of our 
Board of Directors oversees climate-related risks.

The involvement of our bottling partners and 
suppliers is essential to achieving our science-
based target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 
3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030. The following 
are examples of how we are working on climate 
initiatives with partners across our value chain.

INCREASING RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY)  
IN MANUFACTURING
One critical strategy for reducing emissions in 
our system is the increased use of renewable 
energy in our manufacturing processes. 
Renewable electricity usage, which was third-
party assured for the first time in 2021, increased 
from 12% in 2021 to 21% in 2022. 

To build knowledge across our system and 
increase the generation, procurement and 
accurate reporting of renewable energy, we 
published a Renewable Energy Implementation 
Guidebook in March 2022. This guidebook 
provides a step-by-step process for associates 
across the system to implement on-site solar 
photovoltaic and solar hot water and steam 
systems, on-site and off-site renewable energy 
power purchase agreements (PPAs), coupled 
with energy attribute certificates to align with 
GHG Protocol Scope 2 quality criteria.

In addition to the guidebook, we launched a 
future-facing initiative called the Renewable 
Energy Project Pipeline in 2022, where we work 
closely with bottling partners to increase the 
number of renewable energy projects throughout 
our system. Approximately 20 bottling partners 
and 13 concentrate plants have developed  
2023–2025 renewable energy plans. As the 
number and scope of these projects expands, we 
will look for opportunities to collaborate  
and share best practices.

Coca-Cola�Europacific�Partners�
Signs�Landmark�Renewable�
Electricity�Agreement

Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) in 
Australia signed an eight-year agreement 
with Alinta Energy, which includes 
large-scale generation certificates and 
13,000 MWh per year of renewable 
electricity supplied from the Yandin 
Wind Farm. The long-term agreement 
started in January 2023 and will help 
CCEP move closer to its goal of using 
100% renewable electricity across all of 
its markets by 2030.

BOTTLING PARTNERS SET SCIENCE-BASED  
EMISSIONS TARGETS
Given the size of our network of bottling 
partners, they are critically important in making 
progress toward our climate ambitions. Our 
bottling partners have a major influence on 
emissions reductions based on what they buy, 
make and deliver for our shared customers  
and consumers.

In September 2022, Arca Continental committed 
to setting a science-based target. This adds to 
the growing list of our bottlers with approved 
emissions reductions goals through the Science-
Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This list includes 
Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (CCHBC),  
Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), AB Inbev, 
Swire Coca-Cola Limited and Coca-Cola FEMSA.

We will be working to grow this list in 2023.

ENGAGING WITH SUPPLIERS TO TAKE ACTION  
ON CLIMATE
We continue to find new ways to collaborate  
and support our suppliers to collectively  
reduce emissions.

In 2022, we joined the Supplier Leadership on 
Climate Transition (Supplier LoCT) initiative, led 
by Guidehouse along with 18 other companies 
to mobilize collective climate action by providing 
suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge 
to accelerate their decarbonization. As of the 
end of 2022, there were 94 suppliers to the 
Coca-Cola system participating in the initiative. 
The company is directly sponsoring 56 of these 
suppliers. The program is showing signs of 
success—10 suppliers that we sponsored, who 
successfully completed the program, have since 
set or committed to setting their own SBTi-
approved emissions targets.

In total, more than 160 of our suppliers have  
set or committed to setting SBTi-approved 
emissions targets. 

Reducing�Emissions�from�Coolers�

Coolers have long been a key opportunity 
because approximately one-third of our 
emissions comes from cold-drink equipment and 
dispensing. In early 2023, building on analysis 
we conducted in 2022, we published internal 
guidance for coolers used across our value chain. 
The guidance sets specific energy usage limits, 
which will require increasing energy efficiency 
between now and 2030 and help drive the 
replacement of older, less efficient coolers. 

We are also installing more “intelligent 
connected” coolers that can transmit data  
such as product throughput, maintenance  
status, temperature and energy use, which  
has operational benefits in addition to  
helping reduce emissions.

In 2022, 88% of all new coolers placed were 
HFC-free. This is an increase from 61% of coolers 
placed in 2016.

Taking�Action�Across�Our�Value�Chain

  
Thanks to The Coca-Cola Company, in April 
2022 we had the great opportunity to join the 
Supplier LoCT initiative. This program helped us 
to improve the way we calculate our Scope 1 & 2 
emissions and to calculate our Scope 3 emissions 
for the first time. Last November, we committed 
to setting a science-based emissions target.”

WHAT’S NEXT?

Accounting�for�Land�Use�Emissions

In line with the launch of the SBTi’s Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) requirements, we are 
working to update our current science-based target in line with this methodology and a more 
ambitious trajectory. This new target would consider emissions from land use change in our 
supply chain as part of our overall GHG footprint and would consider carbon sequestration 
from land-based projects we implement in our supply chain. While we already work closely 
with suppliers to engage on water and sustainable agriculture, accounting for land use 
emissions would require an even closer partnership with our agricultural suppliers. As we 
incorporate more work across the agricultural supply chain, this would also help us meet 
evolving climate risk and data disclosure requirements.

Coca-Cola�Ballina�Plant�
Recognized�by�World�
Economic�Forum

The World Economic Forum’s Global 
Lighthouse Network recognized The 
Coca-Cola Company’s concentrate 
manufacturing facility in Ballina, 
Ireland, as a manufacturer showing 
leadership in applying Fourth Industrial 
Revolution technologies at scale to 
drive step-change financial, operational 
and sustainability improvements by 
transforming factories, value chains 
and business models. Investments 
in the facility’s IT infrastructure, 
advanced technologies and employee 
training has led to a 6.8% increase in 
production in three years (2019–2022) 
and a 29% energy reduction, which 
brought emissions back to 2011 
levels. The Ballina team’s learnings are 
being shared globally.

IMPROVING DATA SCOPE AND ACCURACY
Gathering complete and accurate data is critical 
to identifying a path to achieving our science-
based target. We are continuously improving the 
scope and detail of our data collection to ensure 
all significant sources of emissions across our 
value chain are included in our inventory. We are 
updating our 2015 baseline data due to recent 
acquisitions. Improving our data helps us prioritize 
projects and programs with the greatest impact, 
including more detail on renewable energy usage 
and more data from suppliers.

Validate�Renewable�Energy�Claims

One area of focus has been to validate the 
accuracy and completeness of our renewable 
energy claims. We have done this through 
assuring our claims to the GHG Protocol. This 
work began in 2021 and continued through 2022.

Suppliers�Disclose�Data�and�Targets

Because approximately 85% of our total carbon 
emissions come from goods and services we 
buy, it is essential to engage with suppliers to 
accurately capture our full scope 3 emissions and 
ensure our suppliers join our decarbonization 
journey. Each year, we encourage key suppliers 
to complete CDP’s Supply Chain Climate Change 
questionnaire, which provides useful data on  
GHG emissions in our supply chain and 
information on supplier targets and initiatives to 
reduce emissions. In 2022, 378 suppliers provided 
climate data to CDP out of 495 requested,  
a 12% increase from 2021. 

Additionally, we are working to improve data 
accuracy in partnership with several major 
suppliers across ingredients and packaging, 
starting with sugar and aluminum, in order to 
develop supplier-specific emissions factors for the 
commodities we procure. This allows us to better 

understand our supply chain, drive change and 
more accurately track emissions reductions of 
specific suppliers and commodities in key areas.

Even deeper in our supply chain, work is 
underway to map and understand how land, 
water use and farming practices in our major 
agricultural sourcing regions both generate 
emissions and have the potential to reduce 
emissions. Costa began its own work in 2022, 
launching a Climate Smart coffee project in 
partnership with the Rainforest Alliance. Phase 
1 of the project has been to conduct a GHG 
feasibility study to better understand the carbon 
footprint of coffee farms from Costa’s key 
sourcing origins, including Colombia and Brazil. 
This study is being used to inform the design of 
scalable climate mitigation interventions.



1  Leader standard represents supply volume verified to a company-approved, third-party validation,

SECTION�SCOPE: In this section our 
Sustainable Agriculture work refers 
to actions by the company as well as 
our owned and independent bottling 
partners and our independent 
suppliers and partners.

Sustainable 
Agriculture
Our products and some of our packaging are made 
from a wide variety of agricultural ingredients which 
we source from around the world. Our goal is to 
sustainably source all our ingredients over time.  
We publicly report on our 12 global priority 
ingredients—such as sugar, corn, fruit, coffee, tea 
and soybeans. Sustainably sourcing our ingredients 
increases the resilience of our supply chain, helps to 
conserve nature and empowers producers and farm 
workers. In practice, we encourage and support our 
ingredient suppliers to drive continuous improvement 
in sustainable farming practices, based on our 
Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA).

for the G20 Presidency of Germany 

In 2022, 64% of our global priority ingredient 
volumes were sustainably sourced to our 
Leader standard, in line with our PSA. We 
currently only report our Leader-level volumes 
publicly. We do not currently report Mover or 
Improver volumes publicly.

Thriving farmers and farming 
communities are critically 
important for our supply chain. 
Our ability to deliver quality 
products depends on having a 
sustainable and secure supply of 
agricultural ingredients. 

Our complex supply chain spans the globe 
and includes many kinds of suppliers, from 
multinational companies to smallholder farmers. 
Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) 
communicate our expectations for environmental, 
social and economic performance to our 
agricultural suppliers at the farm level.

The PSA, introduced in 2021 to replace our 
Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP), 
take a long-term perspective and reflect the most 
recent science, our total beverage portfolio, and 
our increasingly diverse supply chain. The PSA are 
designed to encourage continuous improvement 
in farming practices and lead to more ethical and 
sustainable sourcing. 

The PSA framework for evaluating the compliance 
and performance of our supply farm base 
recognizes the on-the-ground realities in 
sustainable farming practices across a diversity of 
supply chains, farm structures and risk contexts. 
Based on the PSA framework, suppliers are 
designated as either a Leader, Mover or Improver.  

We are currently analyzing against the PSA 
framework the volume of the 12 global priority 
ingredients we procure. This mapping, which  
we aim to complete by the end of 2025, will help 
determine how we engage with suppliers to  
drive continuous improvement.

Our�long-term�ambition�is�two-fold:�

•    All of our agricultural-based suppliers will 
demonstrate continuous improvement and will 
be categorized by The Coca-Cola Company as 
either a Leader, Mover or Improver.

•    All of our global priority ingredient suppliers and 
their farm supply base will work toward achieving 
“Leader” status over time.

Based�on�the�PSA�framework,�
suppliers�are�designated�as:

• ���LEADER: Supply volume is verified to 
company approved standards, with third-
party assurance aligned with the PSA.1 

• ���MOVER: Supply volume is sourced from 
farms using other agricultural farming 
standards, effectively identifying and 
addressing key sustainability issues and 
advancing sustainable practices.

• ���IMPROVER: Supply volume is sourced 
from smallholder/small-scale producers 
participating in a support program 
to continuously improve their priority 
sustainability practices.

Irrigated agriculture remains the 
largest user of water globally, 
accounting for 70% of water use 
worldwide,3 and has significant 
impacts on watershed health. 

Agriculture is also one of the sectors most 
impacted by water stress and drought.

Water use within our agriculture supply chain 
accounts for the vast majority of the surface water 
and groundwater consumed in the production of 
our beverages. Therefore, we are working with 
our suppliers to help promote the long-term 
sustainability of water resources through the 
implementation of advanced water management 
practices at the farm level.

In addition, we are including our priority sourcing 
regions as part of our water replenishment 
programs. For example, in 2022, in partnership 
with Doktar, an agri-tech company, and with 
funding from The Coca-Cola Foundation, we 
launched a project in the regions of Bursa and 
Tekirdağ in Türkiye, which are priority sourcing 
regions for apples. The project aims to improve 
irrigation efficiency and agricultural practices on 
approximately 500 acres of land growing apples, 
peaches, nectarines and tomatoes, which are 
major water users. Sensors will be installed to 
monitor climate and soil moisture conditions and 
satellite data (Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope) will 
be used to calculate levels of evapotranspiration. 
All of this data will be combined to provide 
personalized irrigation programs for participating 
farmers and help to avoid excessive watering. 
Drip irrigation infrastructure will be built on 
selected sites, which helps to reduce water 
use, and artificial reservoirs will be constructed 
to capture and hold rainwater to be used for 
irrigation purposes. 

It is estimated that drip irrigation will lead to a 
20% increase in water efficiency for apple, peach 
and nectarine production and a 50% increase for

2022 Progress on Sustainable Sourcing2

tomato growing as farmers shift from a flood-
based irrigation system. We estimate the project 
will replenish approximately 500 million liters of 
water per year. The improvements in water-use 
efficiency are expected to help reduce costs and 
increase profitability for the farmers. 

Over the past year, we have worked closely with 
our suppliers to map our sourcing regions for our 
global priority ingredients. While we recognize 
that traceability is not always perfect, and our 
supplier base is dynamic, we have begun to 
understand sourcing regions for our global 
priority ingredients that are exposed to high or 
extremely high water stress. We are focusing 
on engagement with suppliers in these priority 
sourcing watersheds. 

In 2022 and early 2023, we approached more 
than 45 suppliers that source ingredients 
from regions facing high or extremely high 
water stress, to gather data on their water 
management practices. In 2023, we plan to 
analyze this information to develop a baseline 
that will feed a supplier engagement strategy and 
collective action plan.

  
This partnership has guided us with a focus on 
the right solutions for young farmers in highly 
water-stressed regions of Türkiye.”

For details on how we address human rights 
risks in our agricultural supply chain, see the 
Human Rights section.

For details on how we address deforestation 
risks in our agricultural supply chain, see our 
CDP Forests disclosure.

Smallholder farmers play an 
essential role in our supply chain. 

Their livelihoods can be particularly vulnerable 
because they lack the resources and scale of 
commercial farmers. We partner with a range of 
nonprofits, communities, industry organizations 
and other companies to support smallholder 
farmers in becoming more efficient and 
productive while improving water and climate 
footprints, managing soil health, maintaining 
crop protection, and respecting the human rights 
of their workforce and labor contractors. The 
“Improver” category of our PSA segmentation 
includes smallholders who may never be 
able to gain formal certification but who can, 
with appropriate support, contribute to more 
sustainable and regenerative agriculture while 
increasing their own incomes and resilience.

Applying�Compost�Drives�Positive�Outcomes� 
for�Egyptian�Vegetable�Farmers

Agriculture in Egypt faces many challenges, including water scarcity, water pollution, desertification 
and land degradation. Through a grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation to Global Water 
Challenge (GWC), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Egypt Network for 
Sustainable Development (ENID) implemented a project in the Qena governorate in Upper Egypt 
to demonstrate the value of using a greenhouse cultivation model to produce vegetables (e.g., 
eggplants and tomatoes), and the recycling and use of crop residues (materials left over after 
a crop harvest, e.g., stalks and stems) as compost on local farms. Local farmers and laborers 
received equipment and training in these improved farming techniques. 

The application of compost increased the soil moisture holding capacity on farmland and 
reduced the need for synthetic fertilizer. It is estimated that composting reduced the use of water 
for irrigation by as much as 23%. This decreased farming costs and generated an additional 
revenue stream for farmers. The recycling of crop residues provided income and short-term job 
opportunities for local residents along with longer-term employment prospects for approximately 
500 individuals, including almost 100 women, who received training in the production and 
application of compost. The project also reduced the need for burning, which is the traditional way 
of disposing of agricultural waste.

Regenerative agriculture is often 
referred to as a system of farming 
that focuses on positive outcomes 
that ensure the long-term viability 
of land to sustain production 
by working “with nature” 
rather than against it. 

A number of our completed and ongoing projects 
promote sustainable agriculture practices (e.g., 
use of cover crops) and contribute to positive 
outcomes, including reduced soil erosion and the 
buildup of organic matter.

We will use key learnings from these projects 
to inform the design of future projects 
and incorporate regenerative agriculture 
principles and practices.

As a founding member of the SAI Platform’s 
Regenerative Agriculture Framework, we are 
supporting the development of an industry 
solution for measuring outcomes of regenerative 
agriculture practices at the farm level. We are 
also actively involved with SAI Platform’s work 
on the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA), a 
global verification framework and benchmark 
reference designed to accelerate sustainable 
agriculture. The latest version, FSA 3.0, includes a 
self-assessment questionnaire and a continuous 
improvement module that offers guidance 
for developing, implementing and monitoring 
performance improvement plans.

Strengthening�Sustainable�
Production�of�Oranges�in�Brazil

We are working with partners to support 
smallholder farmers in Brazil’s citrus 
sector, which is the largest in the world. 
Many smallholder farmers in Brazil 
have struggled, particularly during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of an 
industry initiative named Fruto Resiliente, 
which began in 2019, we are partnering 
with Eckes-Granini, Cutrale, one of our 
citrus juice suppliers, Solidaridad and 
innocent drinks, with co-funding from The  
Coca-Cola Foundation, to support nearly 
500 smallholder farmers. The project 
aims to improve sustainable agriculture 
practices in the production of oranges 
by providing training to smallholders, 
including female farmers, in topics such 
as water, soil management and labor 
standards. Technical materials and 
resources (including booklets, podcasts, 
and videos) are shared for free online, and 
smallholders benefit from field visits to a 
demonstration farm operated by Sylvio 
Moreira Citrus Research Center (CCSM) 
of the Agronomic Institute (IAC). With 
project support, this state experimental 
farm reached the FSA/SAI gold level1. 
In 2022, the project directly assisted 
approximately 200 orange farms.

The Coca-Cola system and The Coca-Cola Foundation have a long history of supporting projects that help improve efficiency of water use  
in irrigation, promote advanced water management, and drive improvement in sustainable farming practices. Below is a snapshot of 
some of our projects.

Improving�Water�Use�in�Agriculture

Many projects have multiple locations, and many projects have the same description.
 Many of these projects support agricultural ingredients that are not tied directly to our 
supply chain.
  Many of these projects have been funded by The Coca-Cola Foundation.

Demonstrating�Sustainable� 
Sugarcane�Production

In partnership with Biofábrica Siglo XXI, 
an agro-biotechnological company, and 
Unión Nacional de Cañeros, A.C.–CNPR, 
one of the most important canegrower 
organizations in Mexico, we developed 
a project in 2021–2022 in Huasteca 
Potosina and the state of Morelos in 
Mexico to demonstrate the positive 
outcomes of regenerative agriculture 
practices in the production of sugarcane. 
Farming practices promoted include 
the use of biofertilizers—made from 
microorganisms—and compost. The 
24-month project is expected to show 
that such a production model can 
increase productivity, reduce the need 
for chemical fertilizer, improve soil health 
and increase carbon sequestration and 
retention. In 2022, the project was one of 
the winners of the Bonsucro Impact Fund.

OUR COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS
As a part of our Real Impact framework, we are 
renewing and refining our Human Rights Policy. 
The new Policy will draw on our stakeholder 
engagement and risk assessment to better 
align with the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises.

The rights underpinning our commitment  
are drawn from the International Bill of Human 
Rights, the ILO Core Conventions, and other 
instruments foundational to the dignity of 
vulnerable stakeholders. While we are committed 
to respecting all human rights, we have identified 
10 of our most salient issues: 

1.    Safe and healthy workplace 
2.   Diversity and inclusion 
3.   Freedom of association 
4.   Prohibition on slavery and forced labor 
5.   Prohibition of child labor 
6.   Work hours, wages, and benefits 
7.   Land rights 
8.   Water and environmental stewardship 
9.   Privacy
10.  Consumer wellbeing 

Our Human Rights Policy is embedded in 
expectations of our employees through the 
company’s Code of Business Conduct, and  
its precepts are extended through our 
supply chain through the Supplier Guiding 
Principles (SGP) and our Principles for 
Sustainable Agriculture (PSA). 

In line with the UN Guiding Principles, we carry 
out human rights due diligence across our value 
chain. We regularly assess our key human rights 
risks to ensure that we are taking sufficient steps 
to identify and address them and, if needed, to 
support remediation of impacts.

Respecting human rights is  
one of our core values. 

The Coca-Cola Company was among the first 
companies to commit to the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights in 2011, and we have strived to inspire and 
drive responsible business practices ever since, 
embedding respect for human rights across our 
business and value chain. 

REAL IMPACT: SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE FUTURE
The foundation of our human rights program is 
our commitment to continuous improvement. 
That’s why, in 2022, we engaged a human 
rights advisory firm to conduct a holistic and 
rigorous review of our human rights program 
to ensure that we remain at the vanguard of 
responsible business. 

The process included extensive engagement with 
internal and external stakeholders to understand 
their primary human rights concerns and their 
expectations of an industry-leading program. 
We also conducted a global risk assessment to 
identify salient human rights risks1 across our 
global value chain and evaluate the strength of 
our governance to meet future challenges. The 
aim of this extensive analysis was to establish 
a framework to drive meaningful human rights 
progress across our operations and value chain. 

The result of our year-long assessment is Real�
Impact, a new vision for the company’s human 
rights program. Our mission is to take actions 
that lead to a better tomorrow. We will take the 
lessons learned from existing programs and 
partnerships and seek to scale and adapt best 
practices across more geographies to deliver real 
impact to more people across our value chain. We 
will work to drive progress across our company, 
our industry and beyond through rigorous 
analysis, creative partnerships and constant 
innovation to turn commitment into action.

severe negative impact through a company’s activities and 
business relationships.

EMBEDDING HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS OUR NETWORK
Our industry-leading global audit program is 
a key component of our long-term, ongoing 
commitment to supporting human rights. We use 
the same rigorous SGP protocols to audit our 
own operations as we do our bottling partners 
and Tier 1 suppliers (packaging and ingredients). 
In 2022, we conducted 2,770 audits and found 
that 99% of our own operations, 93% of system 
bottlers and 91% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied 
with our SGP protocols. These audit results 
are reviewed by the Corporate Governance 
and Sustainability Committee of our Board of 
Directors on an annual basis.

While this process helps us hold our company and 
partners accountable, we also focus on building 
capacity to support respect for human rights 
across our value chain. This includes providing 
training and resources such as checklists, toolkits 
and guidelines. In 2022, we conducted bottler 
and supplier human rights-focused training 
across seven of our operating units, attended by 
over 1,000 participants.

COLLABORATING TO COMBAT FORCED LABOR
Forced labor is a human rights issue that plagues 
global supply chains and is a risk in virtually every 
company’s value chain. No company can solve 
this systemic failure alone—collaboration is the 
cornerstone of progress. We have joined with 
other companies as part of The Consumer Goods 
Forum to support its Human Rights Coalition 
(HRC). Serving as Co-Chair of the HRC,  
The Coca-Cola Company has helped 
HRC drive action to: 

•   Help make Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) 
the norm in our industry by implementing forced 
labor-focused HRDD systems; 

•   Implement HRDD systems in certain targeted 
high-risk supply chains, starting with palm oil in 
the People Positive Palm Project; and

•    Support the development of responsible 
recruitment markets through capacity building  
and government advocacy.

We also collaborate with leading responsible 
businesses as part of the Leadership Group for 
Responsible Recruitment. This business group 
works closely with international organizations, 
trade unions, and key NGOs such as the Institute 
for Human Rights and Business and Verité to 
eliminate all worker fees in recruitment, both in 
law and in practice, by 2026.

LIVING WAGE
As part of our commitment to respect human 
rights, we are actively engaging on the topic 
of a living wage. Over the past year, we have 
partnered with Business for Social Responsibility 
(BSR) to conduct a rigorous living wage gap 
analysis across our global offices and company-
owned manufacturing sites. While further 
analysis is needed, we are proud to meet or 
exceed the BSR living wage benchmark in the 
vast majority of our own operations. Where 
gaps exist, we will be developing a roadmap to 
progress toward a living wage. We have also 
been working with peers through AIM-Progress, a 
forum of fast-moving consumer goods companies 
enabling and promoting responsible sourcing 
practices, to advance industry understanding 
and progress toward living wages in global 
supply chains. Visit AIM-Progress for additional 
information about our work.

SPORTS & HUMAN RIGHTS 
The Coca-Cola Company is a long-time sponsor 
of global sporting events, including the Olympic 
Games and the FIFA World Cup. As a sponsor, 
the company has worked consistently with 
sport governing bodies, NGOs, governments, 
and unions to embed respect for human rights 
into the life cycle of these events. This work 
includes our leadership in the Centre for Sport 
& Human Rights, an organization that promotes 
human rights in the world of sport. We have seen 
progress in this space, including the International 
Olympic Committee issuing its first Strategic 
Framework on Human Rights, and FIFA adopting 
its own human rights policy and establishing 
a dedicated human rights program. Leading 
up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the 
company and other sponsors engaged with 
FIFA, the Government of Qatar, and NGOs to 
help improve labor rights in the country, with 
important developments including Qatar’s 

enactment of significant labor reforms and FIFA’s 
announcement of a Legacy Fund to establish 
a labor excellence hub in partnership with the 
International Labor Organization.

INFORMAL WASTE COLLECTION WORKERS  
& HUMAN RIGHTS 
The Coca-Cola Company has been a leader in 
driving ambitious sustainable packaging through 
our World Without Waste program. We have 
collaborated with peers across our industry, 
government, and civil society to tackle the issue 
of ocean-bound plastics. 

Informal waste workers—or grassroots recyclers—
collect and sort up to 60% of plastic waste that 
is recycled around the world.1 They are integral to 
the functioning of an efficient, circular economy 
for packaging. They are also extremely vulnerable 
to human rights abuse. The severity and 
complexity of human rights impacts on grassroots 
recyclers makes multi-stakeholder collaboration 
essential. In 2022, we partnered with other 
leading consumer goods companies and NGOs  
to launch the Fair Circularity Principles, which 
apply the expectations and responsibilities in the 
UN Guiding Principles to grassroots recycling.  
For more information, see the Packaging section.

HUMAN RIGHTS CONFERENCE 
In October, The Coca-Cola Company was delighted 
to host the 14th Annual Engaging Business Forum 
at our headquarters in Atlanta. Sponsored by 
the International Organization of Employers, the 
United States Council for International Business 
and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Forum 
has become one of the preeminent business 
and human rights conferences, where business 
leaders and experts from civil society, trade 
unions and governments hold candid discussions 
on business experience in respecting human 
rights across their operations and supply chains. 
The theme of this latest Forum was The Future of 
Responsible Business Conduct, with stakeholder 
panels discussing subjects such as the increasing 
regulation of human rights, grievance mechanisms 
and effective remedy collaborations, and the 
growth of investor benchmarks. 

Improving�Sustainable�and�Responsible�Labor�Practices� 
in�Our�Sugar�Supply�Chain�in�Pakistan�

Our company has been working with Bonsucro, a leading international NGO, as 
well as other local and international experts to address human rights risks in the 
sugarcane supply chain in Pakistan. Our partners include GoodWeave International, 
a non-profit with expertise in stopping child, forced and bonded labor in global 
supply chains, and AgNovate, a respected local organization and licensed Bonsucro 
trainer. This two-and-a-half-year project, which runs to the end of 2024, aims to 
improve the adoption of sustainable and responsible labor practices in sugar 
production and develop remediation plans to address child labor and forced labor 
prevalent in the industry. In November 2022, AgNovate delivered the first training 
session of the project to 31 participants, including managers of sugar mills. The 
training was based on GoodWeave’s best practices on ending child and worker 
exploitation. Gap assessments were then conducted of the six partner sugar mills 
and selected smallholder farmers on their compliance with the requirements of 
the Bonsucro Production Standard, which includes ensuring workers do not suffer 
from forced labor and there is no child labor. The project will support the mills to 
develop their own action plans toward continuous improvement and compliance 
with version 5.1 of the Bonsucro Production Standard.

Using�Technology-Led�Solutions�for� 
Deeper�Supply�Chain�Due�Diligence

The Coca-Cola Company has developed a digital platform 
that identifies recruitment-related human rights risks within 
supply chains together with our partners Diginex, an impact 
technology company, and Reckitt, another consumer goods 
company. The platform aims to improve respect for human 
rights in the hiring process through due diligence and 
ethical recruitment. 

The platform evolved to include a multilingual worker-
voice tool, diginexAPPRISE, which allows companies to 
conduct digital worker interviews in supply chains at 
scale, increasing transparency and preventing unethical 
recruitment practices. The use of smartphone technology 
allows a greater number of workers to be reached and 
helps ensure that foreign migrant workers with low literacy 
levels are included in the interview process. 

  
We were pleased to convene the Fair  
Circularity Initiative, which was launched by  
The Coca-Cola Company and three of their peers 
in late 2022. When companies adopt and advance 
the new Fair Circularity Principles in their value 
chains, engaging meaningfully with waste pickers, 
it will lead to human rights being respected, 
including better incomes and working conditions, 
and inclusion in decision-making processes  
that affect their lives.”

Zero�Is�Possible—Our�Safety�Framework

Our “Zero Is Possible” vision aims to identify risks and control 
preventable serious incidents in our system facilities, fleet 
and distribution operations. We are focused on creating 
safe and healthy workplaces and supporting a culture 
of continuous learning and improvement. Management 
commitment and strong employee engagement are 
foundational to establishing this culture. 

We have implemented comprehensive, preventative 
programs to further identify and mitigate the potential for 
serious incidents to occur in our facilities. We are integrating 
operational learning while also demonstrating progress  
and embedding safety as a key organizational value.

In�2022,�we�focused�on�three�key�pillars�of�our� 
safety�program:

•    CULTURE: We revamped our Safety Training Academy in 
2022, providing enhanced resources, tools and training 
which include operational safety and road safety programs. 
As part of our approach to safety culture across the 
Coca-Cola system, we incorporated a new Human and 

Organizational Performance (HOP) philosophy that focuses 
on critical and interconnected aspects including people, 
culture, equipment, work systems and processes.

•    SERIOUS�INCIDENT�PREVENTION: We expanded our self-
assessments and governance audits beyond production 
operations to include fleet and distribution operations 
(route-to-market). We continue our focus on identifying, 
implementing and strengthening controls to prevent serious 
injuries. We also continue to build unique solutions (i.e., 
toolkits, guidance) to enhance the capacity and capability of 
our system in identifying and mitigating risks.  

• ���TECHNOLOGY�AND�INNOVATION: We continued investing 
in new technologies and shared learnings across the 
organization. We completed more than 20 technology pilots 
globally, which are now being implemented by many of 
our bottling partners. These include AI technology camera 
systems to detect unsafe conditions and driver simulators to 
train and prepare drivers, among others.

OVERARCHING GOALS
Keep safety at  
the center 

Reinforce through  
leadership

Human�and�Organizational�
Performance

We have strengthened our health and 
safety strategy with multi-year purposeful 
actions across our end-to-end supply 
chain. We have committed to integrating 
the Human and Organizational 
Performance (HOP) philosophy into our 
operational learning processes; building 
an environment of active employee 
engagement; accelerating learning and 
improvement processes; building better 
controls based on work in practice; and 
supporting the right culture. 

Several of our bottling partners across 
regions have deployed HOP operational 
learning into their organizations.  
To date, over 100 operations across our 
system have begun integrating HOP 
principles with significant improvements, 
and this journey will continue in 2023  
and onwards.  

The Coca-Cola Company’s global 
Lost-Time Incident Rate (LTIR) was

Safe, high-quality drinks people can trust, and a

we have seen significant improvements in our 
safety performance, we know there is more 
to be done. By building capabilities across our 
system, identifying where we need to improve, 
leveraging industry best practices and engaging 
with our employees, we are working toward our 
vision of “Zero Is Possible” as it relates to serious 
injuries in the workplace.”

N As a purpose-driven company, 
we help create a better shared 
future for everyone our brands 
and business system touches 
by working to provide access to 
equal opportunity and fostering 
belonging both in our workplaces 
and the communities we serve. 

Together with global, national and local 
organizations—plus our network of bottling 
partners—we remain focused on investing to 
improve people’s lives, from our employees 
to those our business system touches to the 
communities we call home. While we continued  
to make meaningful progress in 2022, our 
work is an ongoing journey in an ever-changing 
landscape. That’s why we continue to prioritize 
listening and learning; executing our strategy 
consistently; and holding ourselves accountable 
for continuous progress. 

EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK
Pay equity is defined as compensating employees fairly and 
equitably, without regard to gender (globally), or race and 
ethnicity (in the United States). On an annual basis, we conduct 
audits to ensure our employees are paid equitably. Additionally, 
we are diligent and stay aware of the changing regulatory 
landscape. In 2022, we published our first-ever pay gap report 
for Coca-Cola Ireland. 

We are working to embed our philosophy into our business 
practices and processes, and to extend our analyses beyond base 
pay to broader aspects of our total rewards policies. Read more 
about our pay equity philosophy.

BUILDING AN INCLUSIVE CULTURE
In 2022, we added specific inclusion-related questions to our 
annual Culture & Engagement Survey. Responses serve as a 
baseline for an Inclusion Index reflecting employee sentiment 
about belonging, fairness, respect and psychological safety, 
as well as conditions and behaviors that create an inclusive 
environment at our company.

Our employee-led Inclusion Networks serve as valuable resources 
to both employees and our company by providing opportunities 
to connect with colleagues who share similar interests and 
backgrounds. They also create diverse sounding boards for 
business strategies and initiatives, capturing input on potential 
actions through the lens of diversity, equity and inclusion. 

These regionally structured, globally connected employee groups 
help build affinity and allyship that enhance our ability to recruit, 
retain, engage and develop diverse talent. Inclusion Networks 
enable associates to participate in professional and personal 
growth opportunities through training and education, community 
projects, networking events, cultural heritage month celebrations 
and management opportunities.

MIRRORING THE MARKETS WE SERVE

By 2030, we aspire to be 50% led by women globally and, in the United States, 
to align race and ethnicity representation to U.S. census data. While these metrics 
are important indicators of our progress, we are taking an iterative and holistic 
approach focused on continuous learning. Here’s a 2022 update on our progress 
against these aspirations:

CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO  
EMPOWER COMMUNITIES 
The Coca-Cola North America operating unit 
recently launched Asian Pacific, Black and 
Hispanic Equity Accountability Councils (EACs) to 
guide community engagement and investment, 
with an emphasis on economic equity. The 
EACs are designed to drive quality of life 
improvements in under-resourced communities 
through economic mobility, financial stability and 
the well-being of individuals and households. 
The councils will identify initiatives that reflect 
diversity in communities which have direct links 
to our DEI strategy.

DRIVING ACCOUNTABILITY
To continue progress toward achieving our 
sustainability goals, the Talent and Compensation 
Committee approved DEI links to executive 
compensation as part of the annual incentive 
for our executive officers, which will help drive 
our 2030 DEI aspirations. The links to executive 
compensation are based on achieving predefined 
qualitative and quantitative DEI components.

TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING
We believe in full transparency and disclosure. 
We share diversity metrics quarterly with 
senior leaders, and we externally publish 
our representation data annually by race/
ethnicity (U.S.) and gender (globally) for our 
overall workforce and leadership. We publish 
data submitted to the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEO-1 survey  
results) on our website.

our diversity hiring efforts through 
equitable recruitment, interviewing 
and onboarding processes. 

We expanded our partnerships with Historically

business management resources and coaching.

SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
Coca-Cola is working to maximize 
procurement opportunities  
and proactively engaging and 
building partnerships with diverse-
owned suppliers spanning a  
range of industries.

We are focused on increasing the overall diversity 
of our suppliers and are working to spend at 
least $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers. We 
aspire to join the Billion Dollar Roundtable—the 
gold standard of supplier diversity, currently with 
only 27 member companies.

In 2022, our supplier diversity team connected 
independent Coca-Cola bottlers in the United 
States and Canada with business partners 
to boost our overall impact via sponsored 
matchmaking events at the National Minority 
Supplier Development Council and Women’s 
Business Enterprise National Council conferences. 
The team is exploring ways to expand our supplier 
diversity program internationally.

$900M+

years and progress toward our  
$1 billion annual goal.

$200M 
of incremental spend with  
Black-owned enterprises in the 
United States, contributing to  
the company’s overall goal of 
$500 million.   

We share Rise Up’s mission to support businesses and 
underrepresented groups within the communities we 
serve. This much-needed resource can, in many cases, 
help small businesses scale up or expand their operations, 
open new locations and grow their brands.”

Coca-Cola�Backlot�Movie�Experience

For the sixth consecutive year, Coca-Cola sponsored Univision’s 
“Premios Juventud” awards show in 2022, expanding the Coca-Cola 
Backlot Movie Experience at La Marqueta in Puerto Rico. Attendees 
enjoyed Coca-Cola and Latin food pairings, cooking demos, live music 
performances and more.

Extending�Our�Partnership�With�ESSENCE
Coca-Cola returned for its 26th year as Presenting Sponsor of the 
2022 ESSENCE Festival of Culture in New Orleans as part of a five-year 
partnership extension with ESSENCE Communications, a leading media, 
technology and commerce company dedicated to serving Black women 
and communities. In 2021, we committed to doubling our spend with 
minority-owned media companies—to 8% of our total annual media 
budget—by 2024. By working with legacy partners like ESSENCE, along 
with new minority-owned and minority-led media companies, we are on 
track to meet this commitment.

Multicultural�Marketing
In 2022, our brands further expanded into diverse and inclusive 
marketing. In the United States, smartwater and vitaminwater launched 
brand ambassador partnerships with Zendaya and Lil Nas X, respectively, 
and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas (a Latin-inspired fruit drink innovation) 
partnered with Mexican NASCAR driver Daniel Suárez for a Hispanic 
Heritage Month activation. Sprite Zero Sugar teamed up with Marvel 
Studios’ Black Panther: Wakanda Forever on the “Infinite Potential.
Zero Limits” campaign, which highlighted underrepresented Black and 
Latino creators from STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and 
Mathematics) communities. Globally, our Coca-Cola campaign for the 
FIFA World Cup 2022™ was anchored by a multicultural music anthem 
recorded by female artists from the Middle East and Latin America.

tailored to local needs and nuances. This work 
builds on the momentum created by our  
decade-long 5by20® program, created in 2010  
to enable the economic empowerment of  
5 million women entrepreneurs. Together with our 
public and private sector partners, including our 
bottling partners and The Coca-Cola Foundation, 
we exceeded our target, enabling the economic 
empowerment of more than 6 million women. 

We have seen evidence that helping female 
entrepreneurs overcome social and economic 
barriers to success creates a ripple effect in local 
communities with both societal and commercial 
impacts. According to a 2015 McKinsey Global 
Institute report, if women were to play an identical 
role in the global labor market to that of men, it is 
estimated that $28 trillion could be added to the 
global gross domestic product (GDP).

While women’s entrepreneurship continues to 
play an active role in business sustainability, 
we are broadening economic empowerment 
efforts to help create shared value—and a better 
shared future—through training, networking 
and mentoring programs aimed at working with 
underrepresented groups. These programs focus 
on building financial and digital literacy and 
enabling access to opportunities through our 
supplier diversity work.

Economic empowerment is  
one of The Coca-Cola Foundation’s 
six new priority giving pillars.  
The Coca-Cola Foundation envisions 
inclusive economies around the 
world with expanded opportunities 
for shared prosperity, especially for  
the communities that face the 
greatest barriers to advancing  
their well-being.

KAZAKHSTAN 
The Belesteri (“Stepping Stones”) program  
has empowered more than 50,000 aspiring 
business owners in rural areas over the last  
10 years. An annual competition awards financial 
grants to women entrepreneurs to launch or 
expand their enterprises. The program, which 
is supported by The Coca-Cola Foundation, 
has helped create more than 300 jobs and 
has provided life-changing income streams for 
hundreds of families. More than 15,000 women 
were trained in 2022.

LATIN AMERICA
In 2022, the Coca-Cola system in Latin America 
continued to support small retailers to rebound 
from the adverse economic impacts of COVID-19 
through business and financial skills training 
programs in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, 
Mexico, Paraguay and Peru.

AFRICA 
Coca-Cola Beverages Africa recently expanded 
its approach to promoting economic inclusion 
across its value chain to include under-served 
women, youth and persons with disabilities. Our 
bottling partner has worked with local non-profits 
to launch entrepreneurship and employability 
programs in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, 
Tanzania and Uganda.

NEPAL 
The Saksham initiative has provided skills training, 
planning tools and networking opportunities to 
help over 1,000 small-scale women entrepreneurs 
from three provinces grow their retail businesses.

THE PHILIPPINES
An estimated 1,500 micro-entrepreneurs from 
Davao del Norte have completed iSTAR, an 
enhanced digital version of the Sari-Sari Store 
Training and Access to Resources (STAR) 
program featuring entrepreneurship training, 
access to financial resources and online 
business development tools. The collaboration 
with the Technical Education and Skills 
Development Authority (TESDA) and Tagum 
City Council of Women Foundation supports 
Coca-Cola Philippines’ broader economic 
empowerment strategy to break the cycle of 
generational poverty.

Empowering�Communities�Around�the�World

SECTION�SCOPE: In this section our 
economic empowerment work refers to

We worked with WWF-Pakistan to develop a watershed 
stewardship plan for the Ravi River watershed, a sub-basin of 
the Indus River Basin, and a priority watershed because it is a 
key ingredient sourcing (sugarcane) and market growth region. 
The river extends through both India and Pakistan and supports 
approximately 38 million people. Our analysis found that the 
river faces increasing water scarcity and quality challenges. The 
plan addresses infrastructure and ecosystems, community well-
being, information management, policy and regulations, finance 
and planning. One project already underway is a partnership 
with WWF-Pakistan to address the identified water issues for 
approximately 360,000 people in Lahore. Between 2022–2023, 
the project will install household rainwater harvesting systems, 
recharge wells to replenish a groundwater aquifer, reforest 
urban areas and construct floating treatment wetlands. The 
treatment wetlands will allow wastewater to be reused for 
agriculture purposes and remove pollutants and excess 
nutrients from village ponds.

Encouraging�Consumers�to�Shop�Local

Coca-Cola launched the “Little 
Giants” or “Pequeños Gigantes” 
campaign in Latin America to 
encourage consumers to buy 
from their local store or market. 
The project demonstrates the 
importance of these mini markets 
in every neighborhood and 

the role of consumers and companies to contribute to their 
growth. This campaign was launched in Colombia, Peru, Costa 
Rica, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and other countries 
in Latin America as part of our efforts to promote the economic 
development and empowerment of the traditional trade.

2022 HIGHLIGHTS
•   Coca-Cola Brazil joined the Yes to Racial Equality program run by the 

Identities of Brazil Institute to help generate opportunities for 3 million 
people in the coming years, and 10,000 new leadership positions for 
black people by 2030.

•   Coca-Cola Argentina and four bottling partners launched “Ruta 
Verde” or the “Green Road”, a recycling project that aims to increase 
the recovery of materials at collection points. This new project 
connects 28 municipalities across three provinces and helps more 
than 590,000 people access public places to recycle plastic, paper, 
cardboard, glass and cans.

•   In the face of the 2022 water shortage in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, Coca-Cola 
and its bottling partners responded quickly to implement additional 
measures including rehabilitating 15 public water wells, with the goal of 
expanding water access to families throughout the city of Monterrey and 
its more than 5 million inhabitants. We also continued to provide clean 
drinking water, at all times, free of charge, to local families through an 
outdoor faucet at the Topo Chico bottling plant. 

•   Funded by The Coca-Cola Foundation, the Safe Water project in 
Pucusana, Peru, focused on providing running water systems for the 
soup kitchens in the district, guaranteeing adequate hygienic conditions 
for meal preparation. The project installed elevated water tanks and 
piping for each community kitchen, allowing proper washing of the 
ingredients. Safe Water for Pucusana has installed 19 running water 
systems, guaranteeing safe meal preparation for more than 1,600 
neighbors and users of the community kitchens.

2022 HIGHLIGHTS
•   The company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink 

beverages for the year, driven by the continued recovery in away-from-
home channels along with strong performance in at-home channels for 
sparkling soft drinks and value-added dairy beverages. 

•   In 2022, Sprite began shifting all of its plastic packaging from green 
to clear, which helps with the recycling process and increases the 
material’s likelihood of being remade into new beverage bottles. 
Coca-Cola North America’s entire green plastic portfolio—including 
packaging for Fresca, Seagram’s and Mello Yello—is also making the 
transition to clear PET. 

•   The Coca-Cola Company donated $2 million to support the Smithsonian’s 
landmark new National Museum of the American Latino and Molina 
Family Latino Gallery. The museum will showcase Latino achievements 
and stories in U.S. art, history, culture and science, and will be built 
over a 10-year period. 

•   Minute Maid launched Aguas Frescas, a Latin American-inspired, 
noncarbonated beverage made with real fruit juices and natural flavors. 
The juice drinks deliver a bold, “refreshing AF” sensorial experience

SCOPE OF THE REPORT
This 2022 Business & Sustainability Report is  
The Coca-Cola Company’s fifth report to integrate 
overall business and sustainability performance, data 
and context, reflecting our continued journey toward 
driving sustainable business practices into our core 
strategy. This report has been prepared in accordance 
with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core 
option. In addition, we provide indices for the standards 
set by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures, the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC) and the United Nations Guiding Principles 
Reporting Framework (UNGPRF).

Limited assurance under attestation standards 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
over select sustainability metrics was obtained from 
Ernst & Young LLP (as indicated in the Independent 
Accountant’s Review Report).

Except as otherwise noted, this report covers the  
2022 performance of The Coca-Cola Company and the  
Coca-Cola system (our company and our owned 
and independent bottling partners), as applicable. 
Therefore, references to “currently,” “to date” or 
similar expressions reflect data and information as of 
December 31, 2022. Some initiatives that were launched 
in early 2023 are included to provide the most relevant 
information to stakeholders.

In this report, any use of the terms “material,” 
“materiality,” “immaterial,” “substantive,” “significant” 
and other similar terminology refers to topics that reflect 
important economic, environmental and social impacts 
of The Coca-Cola Company or the Coca-Cola system 
or to topics or standards designated as “material” or 
“substantive” under the GHG Protocol, GRI or SASB 
standards. These terms as used in this report are not 
used, or intended to be construed, as they have been 
defined by or construed in accordance with the securities 
laws or any other laws of the United States or any other 
jurisdiction, or as these terms are used in the context of 
financial statements and financial reporting.

The data presented in this report is collected using 
accepted and relevant scientific and industry accepted 
methodologies, which in some instances, are based 
on assumptions and estimates. Although our data has 
been internally vetted, there are inherent uncertainties 
and limitations in the collection and presentation of 
our data. For example, certain information in this report 
regarding  the Coca-Cola system’s progress against 
our sustainability goals comes from third-party sources 
and operations outside of our control. While we believe 
such information is reasonably accurate and is based 
on generally accepted principles and methodology,  the 
collection of this data is beyond our direct influence. In 
addition, the achievement of certain of our sustainability 
goals and targets that are discussed in this report are 
dependent on the actions of our bottling partners, 
suppliers and other third parties, all of which are 
outside of our control. 

Historical performance data may be revised due to 
reasons such as new data availability; industry-driven 
changes to methodologies; improvement in data 
collection and measuring systems; or activities such as 
joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions or divestitures. 
In cases where historical information is revised, we will 
footnote the change with a clear explanation. Statements 
about future developments and past occurrences are 
based on information and assumptions available as 
of the date of publication. While we are committed 
to providing timely updates, the company holds no 
obligation to update information or statements.

Reconciliation�of�GAAP�and�Non-GAAP�Financial�Measures 

The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP” or 
referred to herein as “reported”). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional 
meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Management 
also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the 
company’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company’s reported 
results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. 

For additional details regarding the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, see the company’s Current Reports on

1  This is the focused scope of Primary Consumer Packaging (PET, Glass, Cans, Cartons).
2  This number has been updated following the completed assurance process for the 2020 World Without Waste Report, which was completed post-publication of the 2020 Business & ESG Report.
3 Includes select Primary Consumer Packaging materials.
4  In 2019, we modified the methodology we use for calculating the amount of recycled material used in our Primary Consumer Packaging. These changes are designed to integrate a more accurate dataset, including 

primary data where it is available. Moving forward, we expect that these numbers will continue to evolve as data sources improve, at the same time that we work to increase rates of recycled material use.
5  We changed our method to track the packaging collection rate against our World Without Waste goal beginning with 2018 data. With better data available, we expanded the metric to encompass all of our packaging 

types, including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc.
6  Collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCS’s sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles 

and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year. Collection rates are determined by country for each packaging type based on either national studies 
(approximately 82%), plant standards (approximately 17%), and internal estimates (approximately 1%).

7 Only recyclable where infrastructure exists.

1  Substantially all replenish data is internally validated and verified; the equivalent volume for 100% Replenish rate (182.9 Billion litres BL) is externally assured. Peer-reviewed methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project and operating unit for all 
externally assured data; one exception was approved for internally validated and verified data. The replenish benefit is typically estimated as a long-term, average annual volume, but for some project activities it varies annually. Replenish benefits fall under three categories: 
Watershed Protection and Restoration (233.5 BL), Water for Productive Use (40.9 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (17.4 BL). Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities in 2019–2022, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless otherwise 
stated, in this report finished beverages is based on global sales volume. Approximately 13.5 BL (approx. 7%) of the water used in our beverages that we returned to nature and communities is from 7 projects located in Ukraine and Belarus where since May 2019 we have not 
been able to monitor projects on intervals aligned with internal guidelines due to COVID and the ongoing war. 

Note: Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities, certain brands may not be accounted for in The Coca-Cola Company-specific metrics included on this page.

1  Includes reports and allegations raised through The Coca-Cola Company’s Human Rights Policy reporting process. 
2  In 2019, Employee Relations redefined how cases were captured in the case management tool of record. Therefore, the reported figure includes only those allegations 

that required investigations only as opposed to generalized questions raised to Employee Relations. Please note, however, that all questions presented to Employee 
Relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation. While we previously reported on all cases and questions raised through our case 
management tool, we no longer capture that data. This helps us to ensure that we have more accurate visibility to annual Human Rights cases. This change accounts for 
the 2019 variance when compared to previous years.

GRI provides a globally recognized framework for companies to measure and communicate 
their environmental, economic, social and governance performance. We prepared this report in 
accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. This is the twelfth consecutive year that these 
reporting principles have informed our reporting process, and we regularly assess our progress 
against these guidelines. In this report, the GRI General Disclosures are solely for The Coca-Cola 
Company. For all other indicators, the scope is identified in the referenced documents. Beyond 
reporting on performance indicators required by the GRI, we report on additional indicators 
important to our broad range of stakeholders.

This report also meets the requirements of the UNGC Advanced Communication on Progress 
and aligns with the UNGPRF, which addresses reporting on human rights. We review our 
reporting regularly and aim to be as responsive as possible to our stakeholders’ feedback.
