Message from the Management
Dear friends, 

The world is changing with each passing day. As an extremely significant year in the 
history of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and our country, the year 2022 has 
witnessed the successful completion of 20th National Congress of the CPC, opening 
up a grand blueprint for fully building a modern socialist country and boosting 
the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in all aspects. In the meantime, as 
both the international environment and domestic situation are changing rapidly, 
transformation and adjustment of industries are accelerating evidently. In this year, 
we made constant progress and maintained our core advantages in the face of 
challenges, demonstrating GAC Group's leadership in sustainable development, 
and realizing synergistic development of the Company, nature and the society.

The Report of the 20th National Congress of the CPC indicates that "pursuing high-
quality development is our overarching task for building a modern socialist country 
comprehensively". Facing extremely serious risk challenges, GAC Group has firmly 
put manufacturing in the first place, spared no efforts to pursue stable growth, and 
promoted high-quality corporate development, by always sticking to Xi Jinping's 
thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era. Accordingly, the 
Group's competitiveness, influence, and risk control ability are fully enhanced, and 
its capability of independent innovation, brand image and comprehensive strength 
have risen to a high level, creating an excellent miniature and a strong evidence 
for the historic achievements and historic changes  of the CPC and our country in 
various undertakings. 

Respecting nature, adapting to nature, and protecting nature are the intrinsic 
requirements of building a modern socialist country comprehensively. As we know, 
GAC Group follows the idea of intelligent and smart, energy-saving and intensive, 
and green and low-carbon development. As guided by the  "new four development 
trends① ", GAC Group focuses on intelligent connected new-energy automobiles and 
is devoted to creating a  "technological GAC",  "digital GAC" and  "green GAC", to 
fully boost the Group's high-quality development.

①  The new four development trends are electrification,  intelligentization, connectivity, and shared mobility.

About GAC

Chronicle in 2022

Topic: Help and support each 
other and go forward with love

Shaping a "technological GAC" with the attitude of 
"making progress every day through daily study" and by 
striving for innovation.
Since its inception of the e-TIME in 2019, GAC Group has started to fully 
transform into a technological enterprise. In the field of new energy, GAC Group 
launched the  "new-generation super iron lithium battery built on microcrystalline 
technology (SmLFP)" on the 4th  "GAC Tech Day" held in June 2022, thoroughly 
improving the battery performance in the aspects of cell quality energy density, 
volume energy density, low-temperature capacity, fast charging, life cycle, etc., 
serving as an effective solution to the technological problem of  "performance 
balancing". In the field of intelligent connection, GAC Group has further developed 
the Psi OS (Psi Operating System) independently based on the X-SOUL 
architecture of GAC, effectively realizing connectivity of all scenarios, efficient 
cross-domain synergy, and seamless linkage between automobile and cloud 
data. The ADiGO intelligent and interconnected driving ecosystem of GAC has 
been upgraded to two systems, i.e. ADiGO PILOT and ADiGO SPACE, focusing 
on user experience in the core aspects of intelligent driving and intelligent cockpit. 
In 2022, the Group comprehensively deployed for the independent R&D of new-
generation technologies in the fields of cell and battery integration, electric drive 
and thermal management, etc., and successively established the GAC Energy 
Technology Co., Ltd. and Yinpai Battery Technology Co., Ltd, an independent 
battery brand and Ruipai Power Technology Co., Ltd., an independent electric 
drive brand. GAC AION, an independent brand, completed Round A financing 
in October 2022, with nearly RMB18.3 billion raised, RMB20.86 billion raised 
cumulatively throughout the year, whose estimated value is over RMB100 billion 
after investment. By capitalizing on technological innovation for high-quality 
development, the Group has embarked on a unique GAC road through transition 
and upgrade from a conventional automotive enterprise to a technological 
enterprise. In 2022, three companies under GAC, which are GAC AION, On Time 
Mobility, and Greater Bay Technology, ranked in the Forbes China Unicorn List 
2022.

Creating "Digital GAC" with digitalization and intelligence 
and by adhering to the concept of "Only change can bring 
forth  innovation, but change within boundaries". 
The Digital Accelerator GDA Project of GAC Group officially kicked off in April 
2020. For over two years, drawing on the launch of GAC Motor' and GAC AION's 
new models and support of the marketing  "Golden Triangle", the Group has 
committed to forming a new marketing service mode of  "connecting, serving 
and selling to customer directly". The practice of GAC digital transformation 
became a unique representative case of Guangdong Province selected as 
a benchmark project of State Council State-owned Assets Supervision and 
Administration Commission Management Benchmarking Initiative. By the end of 
2022, GAC Group has stepped into a new digital operation phase to build  "Five 
Transformations, Two Platforms and Three kinds of Ecologies". The digitalization 
of business and products are expanding from independent brands to joint venture 
brands gradually, from marketing, controlling areas to intelligent manufacturing 
and digital research and development field.

Develop low-carbon and build "Green GAC" with a 
determination of "Growth and development by accumulation". 
To achieve green and sustainable development, GAC Group published  "GLASS 
Plan (Green Low-carbon for Achieving Sustainable Success)" in 2021 and 
planned to reach the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. GAC Group will further 
increase the proportion of intelligent connected new energy vehicles and energy-
saving vehicles during the planning, research and development of the product. 
The plan that sales of the independent brand of new energy vehicles will account 
for 50% by 2025, is expected to be achieved in advance. In the process of 
production and manufacturing, GAC AION will achieve zero carbon emission 
in 2023. In the meanwhile, driven by the whole car factory, we will also build a 
green supply chain as planned. In 2022, by taking advantage of the "26 Energy 
Action" plan, GAC Group accelerated the establishment of a vertically integrated 
new energy industry chain layout of  "lithium mine + production of basic lithium 
battery raw material + battery production + energy storage and battery charging 
and swap service + battery leasing + battery recycling and gradient utilization" 
to realize the overall independent control of the industry chain. The Group set 
up GAC Energy & Ecological Technology Co., Ltd to speed up the construction 
of charging, swapping and storage energy replenishment ecology and battery 
recycling ecology. The independent power battery industrialization projects 
with a total investment of RMB10.9 billion, Yinpai Battery Technology Co., Ltd., 
successfully started construction, filling the gap of Guangzhou's research and 
production in integrated battery industry. The Ruipai Power Technology Co.,Ltd. 
set up by the Group will achieve the integration of R&D, pilot production, testing 
and mass production of autonomous electric drives. Meanwhile, in order to 
accelerate the extension of mine exploration and other upstream projects of 
industry chain and create the energy ecology in all aspects, GAC will further 
extend the industry chain based on the demands of supply chains and users.

The blueprint is shaped and endeavor is to be made at the 
right time! 
In 2022, GAC Group grandly published "Trillion GAC 1578 Development 
Outline" for 2023. Looking ahead, GAC Group will  "strive to achieve the goals 
of production and sales of over 4,750,000 vehicles, business revenue of RMB1 
trillion, profits and taxes of RMB100 billion by 2030 through boosting 5 areas, 
shoring up 7 segments and taking 8 actions", aiming to become a world-
class technology company with excellent products, outstanding brand, leading 
innovation and modern governance in the intelligent new energy automotive field. 
GAC Group will continue to insist on taking Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with 
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as its guidance, following the country's 
development and keeping pace with the times according to the "14th Five-
Year Plan" and "Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality Goal". While enhancing  
"internal drive", the Group will gather the power of the industry, and make down-
to-earth and unremitting efforts with harmony between human and nature as 
development strategy so as to make the grand blueprint come into a beautiful 
reality!

(I) Corporate Governance

1. Persistently strengthening political ideological guidance to ensure 
correct orientation of high-quality development. 
Guided by the "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era", the Party 
Committee of GAC unwaveringly implements the guiding principles of the 19th and 20th CPC National 
Congress, resolutely adheres to CPC's organizational line for the new era, holds steadfast to the "four 
synchronizations" and "four alignments", and comprehensively ratchets up the construction of the Party's basic 
organizations, basic teams, and basic institutions. While continuously beefing up the political and organizational 
functions of Party organizations, the Party Committee of GAC firmly pushes ahead with GAC's deepening 
reforms, constantly polishes up GAC's modern corporate systems with Chinese characteristics, and lays the 
political and organizational groundwork for GAC to grow stronger, more competitive and greater and to establish 
itself as a world-class conglomerate with global competitiveness. 
Firstly, by fervently studying and implementing the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National 
Congress, GAC stays committed to strengthening political ideological guidance and aligning its own 
development with the strategic objectives and expectations of the Party and the nation. GAC organized 
employees to listen to or watch the opening ceremony of the 20th CPC National Congress, developed a 
comprehensive study plan and held a mobilization meeting at the first opportunity, and vigorously communicated 
the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress to its employees and through its websites, thus quickly 
setting off a wave of learning. Focusing on the new mission and new tasks assigned to state-owned enterprises 
at the 20th CPC National Congress, GAC actively pushed forward with the mid-term adjustment of its "14th Five-
Year Plan" and set the ambitious goal of "Trillion GAC" for the near future. Furthermore, GAC firmly promoted 
technology-driven transformation by focusing all efforts on new energy vehicles and creating a green and low-
carbon new ecosystem that covers the entire industry chain from R&D to production, from purchase to use, 
thereby building itself into a world-class player. In 2022, GAC filed 3,255 new patent applications, including 1,316 
invention patents, accounting for 40% of all applications. 
Secondly, GAC places high importance  on publicity and insists on harnessing Party building to 
guide the cultural building of the Company and to consolidate the common ideological basis for all 
employees to unite into a whole and to strive for excellence. GAC drafts and implements a Work Plan of 
GAC Party Committee on Publicity on a yearly basis to fulfill its ideological responsibility, and regularly reports 
features about the unyielding combat against COVID-19, exemplary figures, governance integrity at GAC, and 
good family traditions to spread the positive energy of GAC, to promote spiritual civilization, and to advance 
the normalization and institutionalization of learning and implementing "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with 
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era". GAC AION's intelligent and eco-friendly factory has been named as a 
patriotism education base in Guangzhou. Aside from developing and implementing the "14th Five-Year Plan" for 
building the "ONE GAC" culture and the associated annual action plans, which are centered on creating a GAC 
community of shared interests, GAC has taken the opportunity of "GAC Tech Day 2022" to hold a retrospective 
exhibition on GAC's 25 years of technology innovation, in addition to hosting the Innovative Guangzhou 
Automobile (IGA) event annually. In 2022, GAC received over 480,000 proposals for improvements, with the 
number of QC participants over 70,000, and these proposals have generated direct economic benefits of more 
than RMB 1.6 billion.

Case

Case

By fervently studying and implementing the guiding principles of the 20th 
CPC National Congress, GAC stays committed to strengthening political 
and ideological guidance, and aligning GAC's development with the 
strategic objectives and expectations of the Party and the nation. GAC 
organized employees to listen to or watch the opening ceremony of the 
20th CPC National Congress, held a mobilization meeting and developed 
a comprehensive study plan at the first opportunity, and vigorously 
communicated the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress to  
enterprises, to workplace, to project and to websites, thus quickly setting off 
a wave of learning. GAC selected 27 speakers to launch the public speaking 
campaign to communicate the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National 
Congress. Additionally, GAC independently developed an online knowledge 
competition platform for communicating the guiding principles of the 20th 
CPC National Congress. Within 10 days of its launch, the platform attracted 
over 8,000 registered users and over 80,000 quiz response submissions. 
GAC went to extraordinary lengths to promote the 20th CPC National 
Congress with high standards and high quality, applying various means such 
as outdoor screens and bulletin boards to publicize the important themes of 
the 20th CPC National Congress through a total of 607 promotional sites. 

In 2022, GAC delivered a Party lecture entitled Learning from the 
Spirit of the Long March and Embarking on a New Journey of Supply 
Chain Stability, which was awarded the first prize in the second 
"Party Lectures Are Now in Session" event by the Guangzhou State-
owned Assets System. The lecture narrated the story of the Long 
March heroes, as well as the touching stories of GAC Party members 
leading the way, resolving crises, and breaking through obstacles. 
Through the art of storytelling, the lecture aimed to inspire the 
audience to understand, identify with, and carry forward the spirit of 
the red revolution.

2. Beefing up Corporate Governance
In strict adherence to the regulatory rules for listed companies of the State-owned Assets Supervision and 
Administration Commission, the Stock Exchange of  Shanghai and Hong Kong, GAC has put in place a full-fledged 
internal decision-making management system, to clarify the division of responsibilities among the shareholders' 
meeting, the Party committee, the Board of directors, the Board of supervisors, and the management team, thereby 
creating a modern corporate governance system with statutory and transparent powers and responsibilities, well-
coordinated operations, and effective balancing mechanisms.

During the reporting period, GAC strictly adhered to the requirements of relevant corporate governance laws and 
regulations, including the Companies Law of the People's Republic of China, the Securities Law of the People's 
Republic of China, the Code of Corporate Governance of Listed Companies, the Rules Governing the Listing of 
Stocks on Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Corporate Governance Code as well as the Listing Rules of the Stock 
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. GAC remains committed to improving its corporate governance structure, 
standardizing the operation of the shareholders' meeting, the Board of directors, and the Board of supervisors, and 
disclosing information in compliance with the law, in a bid to establish a sound, scientific, coordinated, and efficient 
modern corporate governance system.

Throughout the year 2022, GAC convened 21 Board meetings and 15 special committee meetings, reviewing 116 
motions items. GAC reviews and revises its internal management policies on a regular basis. During the reporting 
period, GAC introduced eight new policies and revised (abolished) 50 regulations, thus further beefing up its corporate 
governance. 

Consisting of 11 directors, including 4 independent directors, GAC's Board of directors places great emphasis on 
comprehensive consideration during member elections. Board members have diversed professional backgrounds, 
allowing the formation of a diversified Board with regard to age, professional knowledge, and industry experience. 

GAC has established relevant provisions in its Articles of Association and Regulations on Independent Directors to 
guarantee the special powers of independent directors and their right to express independent opinions on matters 
involving the rights and interests of minority shareholders at the institutional level. In 2022, GAC's independent 
directors fulfilled their independent responsibilities in strict compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including 
joining the Board of directors and its various committees to discuss and make decisions on major issues, providing 
suggestions on the standardized operation of the Company with their professional knowledge, reviewing the fairness 
and impartiality of related party transactions, and expressing independent opinions. Their acts were not influenced by 
GAC's controlling shareholders or other entities or individuals with interests in the Company. 

In 2022, all directors readily attended the training sessions on the governance of listed companies and directors' 
responsibilities organized by the stock exchanges or regulatory authorities. They also actively took part in special 
training sessions, lectures, conferences, and other events on economics, finance, and business management 
organized by industry associations or external organizations, allowing sustained improvement in their understanding 
of GAC's business development, competition, regulatory environment, and industry trends, and helping them get 
clued up on their responsibilities, make correct decisions, and carry out effective supervision. 

In terms of information disclosure, GAC strictly adhered to the information disclosure rules of the A-share and H-share 
markets, and upheld the principles of "truthfulness, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and fairness" to ensure the 
legality, consistency, and synchronization of information disclosure in both markets. In 2022, GAC disclosed 170 
announcements in the A-share market, including 4 interim reports, and 142 announcements in the H-share market, 
including 4 interim reports.

Mechanism" of the  HR efficiency management model, GAC has set 
up clear boundaries for the powers and responsibilities of the Board

market-oriented compensation and incentive systems, and strictly 
enforced performance evaluations and rewards to enhance the 
market competitiveness and differentiation of its compensation 
system. In 2022, GAC completed the selection and appointment

4. Complying with Compliance in Business Operations
Dedicated to identifying and complying with laws, regulations, and policies closely linked to compliance management, GAC persistently improves its internal compliance 
management system, optimizes the compliance management structure of the headquarters and its subsidiaries, and strives to build a compliance management system 
with comprehensive coverage and well-defined responsibilities. 

In 2022, to effectively implement relevant laws and policies such as the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People's Republic of China (2022 Revision), the Measures for the 
Compliance Management of Central Enterprises, and the Interim Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Investments and Acquisitions by Enterprises 
Supervised by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Guangzhou Municipal Government, GAC successively introduced and polished 
up internal management policies such as the Compliance Management Manual, the Regulations on Legal Affairs Management, and the Guidelines for Compliance 
Management of Automobile Sales and After-sales Services based on the actual needs of its business operations, in an effort to steer the Group away from legal risks and 
achieve efficient and stable operations. 

GAC categorizes the compliance management performance of GAC-invested companies into three levels: excellent, 
good, and average. By making periodic visits to these companies, GAC provides them with targeted suggestions on 
litigation management, data compliance, and anti-monopoly compliance based on their individual circumstances. GAC 
has conducted over 10 one-on-one coaching sessions and held 16 publicity and training events to promote compliance 
management, to provide legal education and to address their doubts. By carrying out corporate performance evaluation 
and strengthening compliance commitments, GAC utilizes a combination of systematic guidance and focused supervision 
to further promote the implementation of "One Set of Policies for One Company" and to drive up the effectiveness and 
relevance of compliance management. 

Taking into account trending regulatory focuses and the Company's own characteristics of business operations, GAC has 
deeply studied the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People's Republic of China (2022 Amendment) and the Measures for the 
Security Assessment of Outbound Data Transfer, in addition to kicking off a succession of special actions in the two key 
spheres of anti-monopoly compliance and data compliance and continuously bolstering the effectiveness of compliance 
management in key spheres. 

By reviewing laws and regulations related to tree protection, wastewater discharge, solid waste disposal, hazardous 
waste disposal, and various types of pollution, GAC has identified several environmental compliance risks and worked 
out the corresponding countermeasures. It has also introduced the Guidelines for Corporate Environmental Compliance 
Management for reference and adherence by GAC-invested companies, in an effort to keep environmental risk accidents 
at bay and to ensure their compliance with environmental laws/regulations and regulatory requirements and their 
fulfillment of corporate social responsibility.

The project has been selected by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology as an  "Excellent Innovation Case of the 2022 New IT 
Governance Year". Moreover, the Group organized and implemented the annual internal control assessment according to the Basic Standard for Enterprise 
Internal Control and supporting guidelines to strengthen the supervision and inspection of internal control and constantly refine the Company's internal control 
governance. Besides, the Group regularly monitored major business risks and issued special risk alerts to its affiliates. It also organized and implemented 
regular risk prevention and control, such as quarterly monitoring and special/joint inspection, to strengthen employees' awareness of risk prevention and control, 
thereby avoiding systematic and material business risks.

GAC Group has formulated regulations and policies such as the Code of Conduct on Integrity for Employees 
of the Headquarters and the Measures for Disciplinary Inspection and Supervision and strictly implemented 
the anti-corruption administrative system of the Company, thereby developing an integrity cultural atmosphere 
where employees" dare not, cannot, do not want to become corrupt".

GAC Group revised the System for Party Culture and Integrity Development and Anti-Corruption Coordination 
Team Meetings in 2022, in which it specifies the supervisory responsibilities of the departments of disciplinary 
inspection and supervision, audit, compliance, and risk control. By doing so, the Group coordinated and 
promoted the improvement of Party conduct for governance integrity and anti-corruption work. Additionally, 
the Group implemented the requirements of the Party Central Committee and the provincial and municipal 
government for deepening the audit of economic responsibilities by organizing the revision of the Group's 
Implementation Measures for the Audit of Economic Responsibilities of Leaders and Cadres from Affiliates. To 
achieve full audit coverage, the Group further extended the audit of economic responsibilities from its wholly- 
and partially-owned enterprises to joint ventures and the subordinate enterprises of major secondary affiliates. 
Moreover, the Group focused on the audit of in-tenure economic responsibilities, conducted early audits, and 
strengthened the supervision efficiency. The Group included the results of economic responsibility audits and 
problem remediation in the leadership's democratic events as well as duty and integrity reporting, and took 
them as significant references for the appraisal, appointment and removal, and rewards and punishments of 
audited cadres.

GAC Group regularly analyzes the Company's anti-corruption status, studies and improves the mechanism 
for joint supervision, and resolves major problems with the supervision through coordination, forming a 
whole-process supervision closed loop that covers ex-ante system and regulations, in-event follow-up and 
monitoring, and ex-post supervision and accountability and ensuring the Company's operation integrity and 
efficiency . Additionally, we emphasize on the building of corporate integrity culture. We conduct periodic 
special training and project research in the Group's headquarters and affiliates to urge leaders and cadres at 
all levels to be honest. We also constantly upgrade and transform the Group's digital platform ④ for disciplinary 
inspection and supervision and analyze, research, and judge the status of the Group's political ecosystem 
using big data and issue early warnings, thereby further improving the Group's anti-corruption efficiency.

The Group has further revised the Measures of the Disciplinary Inspection and Supervision Department for Complaints and Reporting based on the 
government requirements and its own operational status, in which it specified the responsibility of the disciplinary inspection and supervision department 
for accepting the complaints and the procedures for accepting, handling, and closing the complaint and reporting cases as well as the time of handling and 
closing the cases to promote the complaint and reporting procedures standardized, legal, and data-based. GAC Group handled and closed prosecution and 
accusation cases within the specified time in 2022.

Additionally, the Group emphasizes on the protection of the interests of whistle-blowers. We have specified in the Prosecution and Accusation Guide that 
information of whistle-blowers and the content reported should be kept strictly confidential. In 2022, we have further upgraded the Group's digital platform 
for disciplinary inspection and supervision and optimized the sub-module of  "Online report". As a  result, the content reported by the whistle-blower on this 
platform was viewed only by the staff member that accepts the report. Additionally, after the report is accepted, it will be reviewed and approved by the person 
in charge of the disciplinary inspection and supervision, and then assigned to the designated person for handling, which can protect the safety and privacy of 
the whistle-blower.

5. Analysis of Material Issues
In order to fully, accurately and comprehensively disclose the progress of the ESG management to internal and external stakeholders and respond to the 
demands of all stakeholders, GAC Group has set up a process for identifying and evaluating sustainable development issues. The process integrated 
national, Group, peer, capital market, disclosure standards and other aspects to select this year's  "material issues database", and interviewed a total of 12 
internal and external stakeholders through questionnaire surveys to form a  "material issues matrix", which will serve as important reference for the future ESG 
management work of GAC Group.

Take into account five major aspects, namely national policies, corporate development, disclosure standards, capital markets, and peer benchmarking, to 
identify and sort out important issues of the year from multiple dimensions and form the collection of important issues.

Based on the results of the above analysis, we identified 4 governance issues, 7 environmental issues and 11 social issues, totaling 22 issues with substantial 
impact on GAC Group. Taking into account the development trend of new energy vehicles and the focus of the capital market, the material issue of  "green 
technology and products" was added this year. Through an online questionnaire, the Group invited internal and external stakeholders to assess the 
importance of the issues and to comment on the Group's current CSR strategy, performance, reporting and disclosure quality.

In 2022, our stakeholder survey covered a total of 6,190 stakeholders, including the management (vice president and above), employees, colleges and 
universities or scientific research institutes, suppliers and partners, investors or shareholders, trade associations or chambers of commerce, governments or 
supervision institutions, charitable institutions or social organizations, media, consumers, residents in communities where we operate, and operational staff (such 
as drivers of the ONTIME platform).

Closely follow the national 
macro policies and 
regulatory requirements, 
thoroughly study national, 
provincial, and municipal 
policies and regulations, 
in combination with 
the industrial policies 
and regulations of the 
automobile, transportation 
and new energy industries, 
and analyze the sustainable 
development trend of the 
automobile industry.

Refer to the outstanding 
sustainability reports 
of our peers domestic 
and abroad to identify 
and determine the key 
issues concerned in 
the automobile industry 
and how to respond to 
stakeholders' concerns.

Refer to the GRI standards, the United 
Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD)' s Guidance 
on Metrics, Targets and Transition Plans, 
CASS Guidelines on Social Responsibility 
Reporting for Chinese Enterprises (CASS-
ESG 5.0), the Environmental, Social 
and Governance Reporting Guide of the 
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and other 
standards to grasp the latest management 
standards and information disclosure 
requirements for sustainability issues.

In accordance with the 
strategic development 
planning and annual 
business plan of 
GAC Group, identify 
key issues of great 
significance to the 
Company's strategic 
objectives.

Refer to the MSCI-
ESG ratings, Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indexes (DJSI), 
the sustainable development 
management standards of 
the Sustainability Accounting 
Standard Board (SASB) 
for the automobile industry, 
to extract the concerns of

6. Ability to perform responsibility
In 2022, GAC Group will take the "14th Five-Year Plan" Social Responsibility (ESG) Development Planning as a guide to carry out social responsibility 
management, fulfill the responsibilities as a state-owned enterprise and practice social responsibility.

The Group regularly collates and updates the list of ESG management issues, implements the issue management responsibilities of each executive level, and 
embeds social responsibility issues into the day-to-day workflow of all departments and investment enterprises of the Group.

The Group has officially launched and activated the digital information system for social responsibility (ESG) in December 2022, which can realize the 
classification and management of quantitative indicators of the Group's social responsibility (ESG), support functional departments and subordinate investment 
enterprises in ESG data distribution, filling, auditing and data management, and realize the common construction and sharing of social responsibility (ESG) 
information. By the end of 2022, Phase I of the platform had covered 25 functional departments of the Group's headquarters and 22 subordinate investment 
enterprises, and achieved online filling in the collection of quantitative indicators of social responsibility (ESG) of the Group in 2022. The platform can shorten 
the annual ESG data collection cycle time after it is launched. In the future, the information system will be continuously upgraded and optimized to gradually 
improve the efficiency of automated data collection, which is expected to meet ESG management needs, including ESG risk monitoring and supply chain 
management.

Before the start of the preparation of the social responsibility report each year, the Group holds a training session on social responsibility (ESG), taking into 
account the preparation of the Group's last annual report as well as the external requirements and trends of the current year, and invites leaders of the Group, 
social responsibility leaders in charge of various departments and offices in the headquarters and investment enterprises, coordinators and counterparts and 
social responsibility (ESG) experts to attend the session, and conducts joint discussions on such issues as social responsibility (ESG) policy trends, capital 
market competitiveness improvement, summary of previous years' reports and report preparation training.

In 2022, for the first time, the Group held an online  ESG report briefing after the 
official release of the report, with combined viewers of 642,000 people. At the 
conference, General Manager Feng Xingya explained the highlights of the Group's 
ESG reports in previous years, while representatives from the Group's headquarters 
and some invested enterprises shared the Group's experience and outlook for 
the future in the process of giving back to society, fighting against epidemics and 
disasters, and guarding the sustainable development of the environment, fully

highlights", devoted enormous resources to creating blockbuster models, improved product efficiency, and conducted products planning by centering 
on the development strategy driven by  "ICV+XEV/EV".

By continuously improving the rules of procedure, scope of 
discussion, and discussion procedures of the Self-owned Brand 
Product Committee, the Group, in 2022, established a product 
meeting mechanism of GAC's self-owned brands, which focuses 
on product success and centers on the Self-owned Brand Product 
Committee, special meetings on models, and the chief director 
mechanism of models, so as to strengthen the decision-making 
function of the Self-owned Brand Product Committee.

GAC AION Starts Building the First Zero-carbon WorksCase

GAC AION, in 2022, completed the development of the zero-carbon capability system and the expansion of the intelligent ecological 
plant II. It intends to build the first zero-carbon works in 2023 in GAC Group by substantially reducing the carbon emissions of the works 
through measures such as an increase in the proportion of clean energy, the construction of the photovoltaic project, the introduction 
of the high-power energy storage system, the application of the energy-conservation and emission-reduction technology, and the 
construction of the afforestation carbon sink.

The Phase-II Capacity Expansion of GAC AION's 
Intelligent Ecological Plant Is Completed

Increase the proportion of clean energy
GAC AION concluded a strategic agreement with CGN Power 
Sales Co., Ltd., by which, AION's zero-carbon works would 
replace the original power with clean nuclear power, thereby 
increasing the proportion of clean energy and reducing carbon 
emissions. GAC AION's annual carbon emissions fell by 74% in 
2022 by increasing the proportion of clean energy.
Construct the photovoltaic project
The photovoltaic roof of GAC AION's intelligent ecological plant 
has a construction area of 89,000 square meters, a total capacity 
of 17.1 MWp, and an annual power output of approximately 
18 million kWh, meeting 15% of the plant's full-load power 
consumption. Concurrently, the second phase of the photovoltaic 
roof has been under construction. After it is completed, the annual 
power output is expected to reach 21 million kWh, and 19,300 
tons of carbon emissions are expected to be reduced.
Introduce the high-power energy storage system
GAC AION completed the introduction of the 20 MWh high-power 
energy storage system in 2022 and plans to further introduce the 
20 MWh energy storage system in 2023. It strives to use flexible 
charging and discharging strategies for peak load shifting towards 
bottom and thus realizing the time-spatial transfer of power 
resources. Additionally, to respond to the grid demand, GAC AION 
established a new virtual power plant and utilized power resources 
efficiently, thereby contributing its due part to building an energy-
conservation and low-carbon society.
Apply the technology for energy conservation and emission 
reduction
GAC AION takes the initiative in carrying out energy conservation 
and emission reduction in production and manufacturing by 
advancing projects such as the integrated control of air-pressure 
cooling, the heat pump for the wet cycle in the painting process, 
and the recycling of RTO waste heat, thereby reducing energy 
consumption and carbon emissions throughout the production and 
manufacturing.

Protect the environment of the plant
The green and eco-friendly zirconium salt, low-density sealant, 
water-based damping material, and water-based paint are used 
throughout the procedure in the painting workshop of GAC AION's 
intelligent ecological plant, reducing the benzene and aldehyde 
VOC by 49%. This enables the plant to protect its environment 
as much as possible while producing eco-friendly bodywork for 
customers.
Create carbon accounts for vehicle consumers
GAC AION is exploring the creation of carbon accounts for 
vehicle consumers and afforestation carbon sinks. It plans to 
offset the remaining carbon emissions using its carbon sinks 
and gradually achieve the realization of individual consumers' 
carbon emission reduction transactions starting from enterprise 
incentives. Active carbon reduction can bring substantial economic 
returns to consumers while enabling them to fulfill their social 
responsibilities. This move will greatly strengthen consumers' 
enthusiasm for reducing carbon emissions and conserving 
energy in their lives, thereby contributing to the national "energy 
conservation and emission reduction" cause.

With the implementation of the "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality" goal, local governments will closely follow the central 
government to launch relevant plans. As Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Hainan announced that they would strive to be 
the first to achieve carbon peak, regulations in these areas are expected to be strengthened.

The SASAC has clearly defined the management requirements for state-owned enterprises, in terms of environmental and 
social responsibility, and it has incorporated social responsibility into the KPI assessment indexes of the main leaders in the 
company.

The implementation of  "dual control" action over total energy consumption and intensity was stated at the Fifth Plenary 
Session of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC, and the deepening of the energy conservation in the industrial and 
transportation sectors was announced in Guangzhou's  "14th Five-Year Plan" period. Therefore, the transportation sector has 
become a regulatory focus, leading to a potential rise in corporate compliance costs.

With the successive enactment of a range of policies including the "New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021-
2035)", higher requirements have been introduced for the proportion of electric vehicles. As a result, the sales volume of 
GAC's petrol-engined vehicles may be affected, thereby causing adverse effects on its financial condition.

Most advanced automobile enterprises have formulated strategic plans for green factories, and some of them have made 
major breakthroughs in energy conservation and emission reduction in production. If GAC Group fails to further strengthen its 
management of energy conservation and emission reduction, it may fall behind its peers and be at a disadvantage in market 
competition.

The wide application of energy management systems, the application of photovoltaic power generation projects, the 
application of advanced coating technology, and the development of VOCs discharge treatment technology provide a technical 
basis for the low-carbon development of the automotive industry.

Electric vehicles have more emission reduction potential than petrol-engined vehicles, and the electrification of China's 
automotive industry has been gradually shifting from being policy-oriented to demand-oriented.

Reducing vehicle weight is one of the methods with the highest input-output ratio to decrease fuel consumption, enabling 
energy conservation and emission reduction while lowering costs. Therefore, developing the lightweight production technology 
has become a popular direction for advanced automobile companies. GAC Group needs to increase the relevant R&D 
investment to maintain its competitive edges in the industry.

2. Strategy
GAC Group has considered China's  "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality" target and the impact of related policy changes on the industry when identifying the 
risks and opportunities involved, and divided climate risks into transition risks and physical risks based on the suggestion of TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures). Transition risks include risks related to policies and laws, technologies, market, reputation, etc. Physical risks result from extreme weather 
events and rising global average temperature, including acute risks (hurricanes, floods, etc.) and chronic risks (rising average temperatures and sea levels, etc.). 
In its  "14th Five-Year Plan" period for energy conservation and emission reduction, GAC Group identified the following risks and opportunities.

3. Risk Management

Global warming will increase extreme climates such as extremely high temperatures, extreme cold, heavy rain and flood, 
and typhoon. Additionally, rising sea levels may submerge some coastal cities. Located in a coastal city, GAC Group faces 
challenges in its asset security and industrial landscape.

GAC Group formulated management systems such as the Administrative Measures for Reporting Major Operational Risk Events (Interim) and the 
Administrative Measures for Internal Control and established a complete risk management framework. This management framework and related systems were 
used to conduct risk management and internal control assessments, and each business unit implemented relevant prescribed processes and policies during 
its daily operations and reported to the management regularly. The targeted internal control analysis and improvement were conducted by the management for 
each high-risk link and area. And the results of risk control, risk assessment and internal control assessment were communicated to the Board of Directors in a 
timely manner. The Group actively promoted and conducted climate change risk identification and assessment by continuously monitoring climate risks through 
risk management and kept updating climate risk management measures to improve the risk management level of the Group.

GAC AION implemented the  "26 Energy Actions" proposed by the Group and created low-carbon products by practical actions to promote low-
carbon travel. In terms of low-carbon products, GAC AION applied a variety of high and new technologies to its products in order to reduce 
energy consumption and carbon emissions. Such technologies as wind resistance braking and energy recovery system were adopted for 
the products to reduce energy consumption; a multi-sensor fusion sensing technology was employed  to enable the vehicle to automatically 
anticipate traffic conditions and take timely decelerations and brakes measures to reduce power loss during driving; and a number of lightweight 
products were developed by GAC AION to improve the vehicle energy utilization rate, including GEP 2.0, an all-aluminum intelligent pure electric 
vehicle platform, the magazine battery, and the  "three-in-one" high-efficiency integrated electric drive.

In terms of low-carbon travel, GAC AION and 
GAC Group jointly funded the establishment of 
GAC Energy & Ecological Technology Co., Ltd. in 
order to establish a charging and switching center 
as well as to build a sustainable energy ecology 
through the integration of photovoltaic power, 
energy storage, charging and swapping. 

In 2022, GAC AION accumulated more than 
320,000 car owners, with a total mileage of over 
18.7 billion kilometers, reducing carbon emissions 
by over 2.36 million tons, as well as creating 
more than 800,000 mu of green space, which is 
equivalent to planting 21.34 million trees.

Urtrust Insurance Helped GAC Group Prevent Climate Change RisksCase

Urtrust Insurance has enabled the expert database to provide professional suggestions for GAC Group in disaster and loss prevention, helping 
the Group identify and address natural disaster weather risks and reduce disaster accidents within the Group.

In March-April 2022, as part of an effort to prevent extreme weather events such as flood season and  "dragon boat water" strong convection, 
Urtrust Insurance and members from its expert database actively participated in the disaster prevention and mitigation inspection activities 
conducted by GAC Group. They conducted risk surveys and assessments for parking lots in nine affiliates including GAC Honda, GAC Motor, and 
GAC AION and four parts and components warehouses, and promptly investigated potential disaster risks.

On September 20, 2022, the risk map system for  disaster and loss prevention  developed by Urtrust Insurance was officially launched. Using 
information visualization technology, the system was able to identify natural disaster risks associated with each insured enterprise on a map, 
including rainstorms and typhoons. And the  "trinity system" of underwriting, claims settlement, and risk survey enabled online close-looped risk 
management. In this way, the early warning and prevention of climate risks were promoted in the Group.

2. Prioritize Health and Safety
Our commitment to work safety is deeply ingrained in GAC's safety-driven development philosophy, and we continue to work hard to deliver on that 
commitment as a responsible enterprise and a responsible investor. Taking risk management and hazard control as our top priority, we strictly adhere 
to national policies and regulations such as the Work Safety Law of the People's Republic of China and the Law of the People's Republic of China 
on the Prevention and Control of Occupational Diseases, and have established a comprehensive internal work safety management mechanism and 
set work safety goals in addition to communicating work safety protocols to employees, building a safe production environment and safeguarding 
employees' occupational health. In 2022, we invested a total of RMB1.742 billion in ensure work safety across the Group, and had only five work safety 
accidents in the year (resulting in five work-related injuries). There were no major work safety accidents, major traffic accidents with equal or greater 
responsibility, major fire accidents, or occupational disease hazard accidents. The work of work safety remained stable and orderly.   

Delivering on the safety commitment
In compliance with new laws and regulations such as the Work Safety Law of the People's Republic of China and adhering to the goal of establishing a 
comprehensive work safety responsibility system characterized by layered accountability, shared responsibility, and individual duties, GAC persistently 
polishes up its all-staff work safety responsibility system and breaks down work safety responsibilities at every single level. Additionally, GAC keeps a 
tight rein on the management of work safety targets by setting annual work safety targets, and categorizing and grading process supervision and target 
management assessments to ensure effective implementation of safety responsibilities. 

Polishing up the institutional system  
In compliance with the newly enacted laws and regulations such as the Work Safety Law of the People's Republic of China and the Fire Protection 
Law of the People's Republic of China, GAC has made necessary adjustments to its four work safety regulations -- GAC Regulations on Work Safety 
Management, GAC Regulations on Work Safety Management of GAC-invested Companies, GAC Regulations on Fire Safety Management, and GAC 
Regulations on Traffic Safety Management -- in a bid to enhance their legal compliance, applicability, and guiding role.  

Tightening up dual controls  
GAC stays committed to promoting the application and perfection of its dual-wheel drive model underlain by  "Tiered Risk Control" and  "Hidden Risk 
Management" and holds steadfast to the improvement of associated working mechanisms. In 2022, GAC utilized a comprehensive safety risk map 
to initiate the categorized and tiered management of 428 key risk points across the entire organization. These risk points include areas for storing, 
using, and disposing of hazardous chemicals, battery storage facilities, parking lots for finished vehicles, and rental properties. Additionally, sticking to 
the working mechanism of  "One Bottom-line and Three Musts", GAC strived to pin down major risks in key areas and exerted every effort to rectify 
potential hazards. GAC organized safety supervision checks approximately 139 times, identifying over 640 safety hazards, all of which were rectified 
on schedule to attain a rectification rate of 100%.

GAC AION has made adjustments to its Parts and Components and Direct Material Supplier Management Procedures, 
GAC AION Measures for Engineering Project Management, and GAC AION Measures for Goods and Services 
Procurement Management to boost the efficiency of internal supply chain management. 

Based on internal procurement regulations, newly introduced suppliers are comprehensively evaluated on production and 
operation qualifications, ISO qualifications, financial and credit status, technical strength, quality, and delivery capabilities. 
Only suppliers that have passed GAC AION's evaluation will be included in the qualified supplier pool. 

GAC AION signs procurement contracts with suppliers, stipulating terms related to transaction payments, quality 
assurance, intellectual property rights, claims, advertising, confidentiality, environmental protection, ethical conduct, and 
other aspects. By enforcing such contracts, GAC AION aims to standardize supplier behavior and mitigate potential 
environmental and social risks. Furthermore, GAC AION examines supplier qualifications and archives relevant 
certification documents to ensure that their environmental and quality systems meet national and legal standards.

3. Empower Dealerships
GAC is committed to achieving a win-win outcome with its dealers through measures such as promoting its marketing channels and dealership network, 
enhancing training and guidance, and continuously improving the service capabilities and business operations of its dealers. 

GAC AION has developed the Procedures for Periodic Evaluation of Parts and Components and Direct Material Suppliers 
to assess suppliers in the areas of quality, logistics, and procurement based on the previous month's supply figures. 
The evaluation criteria include supplier's defective rate, market complaints, supply and logistics packaging, attainment 
of business goals, and file standardization. If the evaluation result is grade C, the supplier will be required to make 
improvements. If the result is grade D, a yellow card notification letter will be issued, and a double inspection of parts will 
be implemented. Furthermore, the supplier's general manager will need to submit a special report, and its new vehicle 
model proposal will be stringently evaluated. If the supplier gets a grade of D twice or three times in six months, a red card 
notification letter will be issued. The supplier's general manager will need to submit a special report, new project inquiries 
and proposals will be suspended for one year, and the supplier's share of participation in any existing project may be cut 
down if necessary. After the one-year red card suspension period, the supplier will be reevaluated as a new supplier. 

GAC AION also signs a Supplier and Contractor Environmental Protection Commitment Agreement with its suppliers and 
contractors to ensure that the products or services supplied by its suppliers and contractors cause less environmental 
pollution during production, storage and transportation. Additionally, GAC AION sends environmental reminders to its 
suppliers every year and evaluates the environmental impact of suppliers that have a significant impact. 

GAC AION Empowers Dealerships for Development Case

In January, GAC AION launched agile organizational reforms and 
established a vehicle model project team to horizontally integrate 
resources from different business segments to boost vehicle sales. 
In February, GAC AION achieved digitalization of sales tools by 
integrating sales pitches, experiential guidance, images, videos, 
and other relevant information and tools into the GAC AION APP, 
which is open to and allows sales consultants to search for or 
consult common sales questions in the community, thereby rapidly 
bolstering the frontline staff's ability. 
In March, GAC established a general manager evaluation 
mechanism to evaluate the general manager's business performance 
and personal capabilities, in a bid to help dealers select good 
managers and lay the groundwork for improving dealership-side 
operations. 
In April, based on the "stable price, low inventory, high turnover" 
new marketing paradigm, it kicked off the third high-value marketing 
reform, released a new brand logo, upgraded the channel image, 
and exerted efforts in new media marketing to help dealers promote 
high-value marketing. 
In May, GAC AION improved its channel sales service system, 

optimized the dealership-side O&M implementation requirements for 
various positions, and kicked off network-wide training. 
In June, GAC AION held a network-wide sales skills competition to 
sharpen the sales skills of frontline sales teams through competition. 
In July, GAC AION introduced a dealership-side O&M digital 
management system to ensure that all operational indicators can be 
digitally monitored and that diagnostic reports can be generated to help 
dealerships identify strengths and weaknesses and make targeted 
improvements. 
In August, GAC AION reformed its regional structure, established a 
staff officer for the regional management team to comprehensively 
analyze regional market operations and characteristics, and formulated 
marketing strategies tailored to regions and cities to enhance the  
"combat effectiveness" of regional management teams.

㉓ Volume of finished vehicle products involved in the recalls announced by GAC Group's affiliates refers to the recall volume of vehicle products included in the recall announcements made by 
GAC's investees in the current year.㉔ Volume of recalled finished vehicle products of GAC Group's affiliates refers to the recalled volume of vehicle products included in the recall announcements made by GAC's investees in the 
current year.㉕ The charity expenditures of our controlling shareholder Guangzhou Automobile Industry Group Co., Ltd. are included.㉖ For better comparability of the data of the year, GAC Group unified the environmental data accounting methods in 2022 and updated the calculation of some environmental data of 2021.㉗ The significant increase in the waste water discharge during the Reporting Period was attributable to: (1) the new production lines of GAC Honda and GAC AION; (2) the waste water discharge 
adopted by the third production line of GAC Toyota as the new waste water disposal method in place of the previous method of drying by waste water evaporation; and (3) the new inclusion of GAC 
Motor in the sewage discharge data of factories in Hangzhou, Yichang, etc.㉘ GHG emissions of GAC Group mainly include carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion and purchased electricity. Specifically, direct GHG emissions (scope 1) include carbon dioxide from 
gasoline, diesel, natural gas and other fossil fuel combustion; indirect GHG emissions (scope 2) include GHG emissions from purchased electricity. GHG accounting of GAC Group in 2022 is based 
on the data calculation and target estimate methods specified in the 14th Five-Year Plan of GAC Group for Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction, while the convert coefficient of 0.6101tCO2/
MWh is adopted for converting the electricity consumption into carbon dioxide emissions.
