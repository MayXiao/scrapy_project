sustainability is driven through the Ramsay Cares 
sustainability strategy.

Ramsay Cares focuses on a broad range of meaningful 
goals to foster healthier people, stronger communities 
and a thriving planet. It reaffirms our intention to have 
a positive impact for current and future generations.

It covers material sustainability issues that could 
influence the value that Ramsay Health Care creates for 
stakeholders over the short, medium and long-term. 

This report has been prepared in accordance with 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core

“It has been a milestone year for our global 
Ramsay Cares sustainability program. 

In July, we announced a group commitment to 
achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2040. By setting ambitious, science-based 
targets to reduce emissions across our value 
chain, Ramsay is showing that we are serious 
about being a responsible and sustainable 
business and continuing to support the UN 
Global Compact and its ten principles.

Alongside the terrific work being done 
to reduce waste and consumption in our 
hospitals and services, I am proud to share 
some of the many meaningful ways our teams  
are supporting healthier people, stronger 
communities and a thriving planet.”

Craig McNally
Managing Director & CEO

The United Nations Global Compact calls on companies to align 
their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted 
principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and 
anti-corruption. Ramsay Health Care is also committed to driving 
action on the relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals, a 
global blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future.

Our values
The foundation of Ramsay Health Care and the strength of its culture are a source of pride and inspiration 
for our people. Underpinning our successful, long-standing values are Paul Ramsay’s enduring belief 
that ‘if you look after the people, success will follow’. To this day, Ramsay remains focussed on the best 
outcomes for our employees, patients, doctors and other significant stakeholders.

The Ramsay Way
People are at the heart of our success. 

As ‘people caring for people’ there are three key ways 
we approach our work every day.

“Right at the start I said, you’ve got 
to look after the patient and be the 
best at that. If you look after the 
patient, everything else will follow.” 

Paul Ramsay AO
Founder, Ramsay Health Care

 We value 
strong relationships

Healthy working relationships lead to 
positive outcomes for all. 

We look out for the people we work 
with and we respect and recognise 
them. 

Strong, healthy relationships are the 
foundation of our stakeholder loyalty.

We aim to 
constantly improve

We do things the right way. 

We enjoy our work and take pride in 
our achievements. 

We are not afraid to challenge the 
status quo to find better ways.

We seek to
grow sustainably

Maintaining sustainable levels 
of profitability is only part of our 
success. 

We prioritise long-term success over 
short-term financial gains because 
we care about our people, our 
community and our planet.

Our strategy
Ramsay believes a great company is one that 
makes the world a better place.

We are committed to making a meaningful, 
positive difference through our Ramsay Cares 
sustainability strategy, which focuses on action 
to promote healthier people, a thriving planet 
and stronger communities. 

The Ramsay Cares strategy is underpinned by 
The Ramsay Way (see page 4) and centres on 
three pillars of sustainability:

Material issues

In sustainability terms, the most pressing issues affecting an organisation are known as material issues. 

In addition to engaging our stakeholders to understand shared and emerging issues, Ramsay’s materiality 
assessment is informed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Materiality Map and the issues are 
reviewed annually by our Global Sustainability Committee. Our Sustainability Disclosures (see pages 38-42) explain 
how we manage our material issues and why they are important.

PATIENTS
Caring for our patients 
includes engaging 
with them in a range 
of meaningful and 
effective ways. 
We are focused on 
safeguarding safety 
and  clinical outcomes 
and maintaining 
excellent patient

as summarised below.

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  9

Partners for change
This year, Ramsay became a founding member 
of the newly created Asia-Pacific Chapter of 
Accounting for Sustainability (A4S).

A4S is a global network of Chief Financial 
Officers (CFOs) from large organisations 
who work together to develop and scale-up 
practical ways of embedding social and 
environmental risk and opportunity into 
strategic planning and decision making.

Ramsay’s group CFO Martyn Roberts said 
sustainability must be a collaborative effort.

“As a group, our aim is to transform finance to 
make sustainable business, business as usual,” 
he said.

“Ramsay wants to work more closely with our 
partners and suppliers on these important 
issues, particularly reducing emissions across 
our value chain.”

DOCTORS
We are a trusted 
partner for our doctors 
who help shape, 
develop and inform our 
healthcare services. 
We support and 
regularly engage 
with our doctors and 
clinicians and this year 
undertook a global 
doctors survey.

EMPLOYEES
We respect and 
recognise our large 
and diverse workforce, 
ensuring their voices, 
experience and 
expertise are reflected 
across Ramsay’s 
decision-making.

SUPPLIERS

Our complex global 
supply chain is 
supported by strong 
relationships at each 
regional level. 
We are broadening our 
supplier engagement to 
increase our focus on 
sustainability.

We recognise the 
important role we 
can play in local 
communities and 
society at large. 
Investing in research 
and development 
helps improve 
healthcare outcomes 
for our patients and the 
broader community.

COMMUNITY

Strong, productive 
relationships with our 
partners are fostered 
through regular 
meetings, briefings and 
consultation around 
health sector issues.

Our purpose 
Our purpose of ‘people caring for people’ is 
exemplified in our dedication to clinical excellence 
and outstanding patient care.

This commitment is critical to our success as a 
leading healthcare network.

This year, despite the ongoing challenges brought 
by COVID-19, we continued to grow specialist 
services needed in each region, with a global 
focus on four key therapeutic areas – cardiology, 
oncology, orthopaedics and mental health.

In addition, we have been  expanding our services 
and operational capabilities to deliver better 
healthcare for more patients, in more communities. 

Caring for our patients

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  12

Pandemic response
Ramsay people across the world continue to play a 
leading and active role in the COVID-19 response.

As well as delivering urgent care for COVID-19 
patients, our people have made significant and wide-
ranging contributions to combat the pandemic and 
protect our communities.

More than 10,000 COVID patients were treated at 
Ramsay Santé facilities in France including 4,500 in 
critical care.

Approximately 900,000 doses of COVID vaccine have 
been administered to patients in Sweden. Ramsay 
teams also managed nearly 20% of COVID-related 

hospital care in the Stockholm region.

Ramsay nurse immunisers, registered nurses and 
pharmacists volunteered at the Sydney Olympic Park 

mass vaccination hub, helping to administer more 
than 8,000 vaccines a day.

Supporting patients recovering from 
COVID-19 at Clinique Iris.

Many Ramsay hospitals also facilitated surgical care for 
public patients, alleviating pressure on public systems, 
and have come up with new ways of delivering high-
quality care to people in lockdown or isolation.

Our people redeployed to support the public health 
system in remote locations, testing clinics and other 
community health settings.

Ara Damansara Medical Centre collaborated with the 
Malaysian non-profit group OKU Sentral to open a drive-
through vaccination centre for people with disabilities.

Clinical excellence

Award winning care
Ramsay’s global focus on excellence and innovation 
has been recognised by numerous professional and 
industry bodies this year. 

Our flagship hospital in Malaysia, Subang Jaya Medical 
Centre (SJMC), won six Global Health Asia-Pacific 
Awards. Additionally, RS Premier Jatinegara was 
recognised as Hospital of the Year in Indonesia.

“The recognition of our accomplishments will spur us 
on to continue achieving the best for our patients,” 
Ramsay Sime Darby Health Care Group CEO Peter 
Hong said.

In January, Ramsay UK won the LaingBuisson 
Healthcare Outcomes Award. The judges were 
particularly impressed with the roll-out of Ramsay’s 
Speaking Up for Safety programme, which promotes 
a strong culture of professional accountability and 
freedom to raise safety issues. 

Collaborating on quality
Ramsay’s Clinical Excellence Agenda commits us 
to strive for the best in  

• clinical leadership, engagement and governance

• service design and patient experience 

• research, innovation and education

• quality and safety.

Our doctors, clinicians and nurses approach this 
commitment through collaboration, curiosity and 
trust to deliver coordinated, safe and efficient 
healthcare of the highest quality. 

This year, Ramsay’s first global Clinical Excellence 
Summit brought together senior doctors and 
executive leaders from across the group. We also 
established five global Communities of Practice in 
cancer, cardiology, mental health, orthopaedics 
and research.

These communities harness the deep knowledge 
of our doctors and other experts to accelerate  
innovation and clinical excellence across Ramsay.

Patient safety, experience and wellbeing

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  14

A patient’s journey is not just about achieving the 
best possible health outcomes - we want them to feel 
safe and have a positive experience overall. 

Our regional businesses and Global Executive closely 
monitor our quality and experience performance 
across the following areas and report to the Board or 
relevant Board Committee:

Clinical quality outcomes
Clinical excellence is fundamental to our business 
and each region has robust clinical governance 
frameworks and programs which focus on continuous 
improvement. We continue to demonstrate high-
quality outcomes (see Quality Scorecard, page 17). 

Privacy
Privacy is also an essential commitment to our 
patients. The number of notifiable privacy breaches 
has remained low across our regions (see Quality 
Scorecard, page 17). 

Accreditation
We take hospital accreditation very seriously in every 
facility. We go above and beyond to maintain quality 
and safety standards in order to pass stringent audit 
processes set by relevant jurisdiction authorities.

We also undertake thorough review processes to 
ensure our doctors and visiting medical officers have 
appropriate credentials and are operating within their 
allowed scope of work

Patient experience
We hold ourselves to high standards and regard 
patient experience as a critical measure of success. 
Feedback from our patients is routinely gathered 
in most of our regions using the patient experience 
measure Net Promoter Score1. This gathers input on 
areas such as comfort and staff interaction. 

We are committed to an excellent level of positive 
experience with the group meeting NPS targets 
in some, but not all, regions in FY22. However, 
we continued to deliver high scores across our 
operations: UK (82), Elysium (88)2, Australia (71), 
France (70), Sweden and Denmark (70). Ramsay 
Sime Darby Health Care also continues to show solid 
results: Malaysia (51), Indonesia (32).

Every patient counts
We respect and welcome patients without 
distinction and we provide transparency in terms 
of quality of care, providing a safe and inclusive 
environment and protecting our patients’ privacy. 

Ramsay’s enduring purpose of ‘people caring for 
people’ is fundamental to how we operate our 
business. Caring is not simply a value statement; it 
underpins the way we approach work every day to 
meet the expectations of our patients and partners. 

This year, we updated our Global Human Rights and 
Labour Policy to articulate Ramsay’s commitment to 
patients across five key areas: 

1. access

2. patient safety

3. partners in care

4. privacy and information

5. continuous improvement through feedback.

Focus on mental health

A safe place for women
Ramsay’s mental health services are expanding to 
meet growing demand in many regions.

Australia’s first women-only, standalone, trauma-
informed mental health facility opened this year. 

The 43-bed Ramsay Clinic Thirroul provides a safe 
environment where women can deal with trauma-
related mental health disorders through inpatient 
care and day programs.

Ramsay Australia Mental Health Director Anne 
Mortimer said it would also become a training 
centre for psychiatric, medical, psychological and 
other allied health and nursing students.

“This will help build a workforce for the future 
that is trauma-informed when managing complex 
mental health issues,” she said.

Ramsay treats more than 70,000 mental health 
patients in Australia each year and partners with 
370 visiting psychiatrists.

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  15

Building on six decades of mental health experience, 
Ramsay secured a strong foothold in the growing 
UK mental health market through the acquisition of 
Elysium Healthcare at the start of 2022.

Elysium is a leading independent operator of long-term 
medium and low secure hospitals and complex care 
homes for individuals with mental health conditions 
and has a strong partnership with the NHS. 

Elysium’s specialist hospitals, residential settings 
and community-based homes focus on personalised 
outcomes. 

Elysium clinicians and therapists work together 
to provide holistic, person-centred care as part of 
complete care pathway for individuals with diverse and 
complex needs. 

Mental Health - secure, acute and rehabilitation 
services for patients with acute mental health 
conditions or learning disabilities

Complex care - community residential services to 
complex patient groups with learning disabilities, 
autism and epilepsy

Neurological - neuro-rehabilitation services, typically 
in a nursing care home environment.

Ramsay Mental Health launched in Australia in 
February with a new strategy and distinctive new 
signage to make it easier for people to identify their 
local Ramsay Clinic and access high quality services.

Ramsay Mental Health has grown to 23 units offering 
care in standalone clinics and within Ramsay’s acute 
hospital settings, with 1100 beds for both private and 
public patients.

Our clinics treat a range of issues including addictions, 
mood disorders, eating disorders, PTSD and trauma. 

We also cater to Defence veterans at Greenslopes and 
Hollywood hospitals and Cremorne Clinic.

In a unique public-private trial partnership announced 
this year, Ramsay is working with the New South Wales 
government to provide additional inpatient and day 
program care for young people suffering from anxiety, 
eating disorders and complex trauma. 

In France, Ramsay Santé runs 35 mental health 
facilities, including Clinique Le Gouz which is solely 
dedicated to the psychiatric care of healthcare 
professionals.

Elysium Healthcare CEO Joy Chamberlain opens
a recruitment and training hub at Hatfield.

More choice and convenience

Improvement through innovation
Technology and innovation are giving patients more 
choice, convenience and control of their treatment 
and provider. To keep pace with these changes, 
we are growing our technological capabilities, 
developing new ways of working and creating the 
partnerships needed to make Ramsay a leading, 
integrated healthcare provider of the future.

Two senior appointments are leading this growth 
and transformation. Dr Rachna Gandhi, our new 
Global Chief Data & Digital Officer, is focused on 
using technology to support a world class patient 
experience and new models of care as part of a 
digitally enabled healthcare ecosystem. Dr Andy 
Jones, our first Group Chief Growth Officer, is 
leading work to expand Ramsay’s patient pathway 
and accelerate strategic projects.

patients and the general public.

Ramsay Services centralises access to digi-physical 
services such as preadmission, bookings and expert 
information, making it easier for more people to 
access a wide range of care. The app also supports 
medicine home delivery and an AI tool to help 
analyse symptoms and refer the user to the right 
health service. 

Ramsay’s home hospital service in Australia, 
Ramsay Connect supports thousands of 
patients with acute and chronic conditions 
using remote monitoring, virtual care and home 
visits to support access to safe, quality care at 
home or in community settings.

This year, Ramsay UK became the first independent 
healthcare provider in the UK to implement a system 
of this scale across all its hospitals. 

The EPR centralises and streamlines patient record 
keeping across our 35 hospitals to support modern, 
integrated healthcare.

The 2022 Ramsay Santé Innovation Awards received 
more than 100 nominations, with the winners from 
Capio Närsjukvård in Sweden recognised for creating 
an automated COVID-19 vaccination process.

Our hospitals in Indonesia have introduced numerous 
digital initiatives to improve patient care, including 
a WhatsApp Chatbot for making or rescheduling 
medical appointments and an inpatient meal ordering 
system that uses QR codes to provide patients with 
quick and easy menu options.

Quality scorecard

We believe that clinical quality is best measured in key patient outcomes and patient experience, which is why we include both in our Quality Scorecard. We continue to demonstrate high quality outcomes 
across both these aspects, showing our commitment to superior patient care. Our businesses operate in different local environments and have a varying patient mix in each region, which is reflected in the 
range of quality indicator results. We monitor clinical indicators closely and can demonstrate improvements across most indicators and all results within safe and acceptable standards. It is important to note 
that year-to-year movement in some measures does not necessarily reflect a lack of improvement or a decline in care. For example, an increase in the rate of return to theatre may reflect timely management 
of predominantly cardiac patients, where outcomes are improved by early intervention. We are very focused on wholly preventable Never Events, which reduced across most regions. Transparency around 
patient care is important and many facilities report quality and experience at a site level.

1. Never events for our acute facilities include: wrong implant/ prosthesis; iron infusion where there is evidence that policy and procedure was not followed; infant breastfed by wrong mother or breast milk given to wrong infant; suspected suicide of a 
mental health inpatient (where inpatient is on leave or absconded) and where there is evidence that policy and procedure was not followed. Never events for Elysium mental healthcare facilities include: misselection of a strong potassium solution, admin-
istration of medication by the wrong route, overdose of insulin due to abbreviations or incorrect device, overdose of methotrexate for non-cancer treatment, misselection of high strength midazolam during conscious sedation, failure to install functional 
collapsible shower or curtain rails, falls from poorly restricted windows, misplacement of naso- or oro-gastric tubes. In the Nordic region, these are called sentinel events, which are events that have caused or could have caused patient injury which are 
reported to the authorities in line with local legislation and results in root cause investigation to achieve relevant learning and take necessary corrective action.
2. France rates include planned and unplanned readmissions and are based in a fiscal year. Australian rates for unplanned readmissions and returns to theatre are calculated from the first six months of data, as H1 and H2 figures are not available for the 
second six months from ACHS at the time of reporting. Whilst readmissions occur in Elysium, these are typically either coordinated by agreement with carers or case managers or at the request of the NHS and are therefore not considered reportable as 
part of this unplanned readmission figure.
3. Elysium Healthcare Friends and Family Satisfaction Survey (88%). 

NOTE: While efforts have been made to compile data across regions on a consistent basis, there may be differences. The table does not include data relating to facilities in Italy. The figures in the Quality Scorecard for Ramsay Australia, Ramsay UK, 
Elysium Healthcare and Ramsay Sime Darby are subject to limited assurance, see page 46 for details.

Ramsay provides Continuing Professional 
Development in a range of topics in medicine, surgery, 
obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics and mental 
health. In-person and virtual sessions are offered 
in partnership with our specialists and other health 
professions.

Your views, Your voice
Our first global survey of doctors was held in early 2022 
to better understand the experience of specialists and 
clinicians working at Ramsay and help us to identify and 
share best practice across our clinical network.

Thousands of doctors provided useful feedback and 
the survey demonstrated strong awareness of and 
alignment with our Ramsay values.

Innovation in care

Groundbreaking treatment
A 3D chest implant has been used in ground-
breaking surgery to remove a large tumour 
wedged between a man’s ribs and near his spine.

The 23-hour procedure at North Shore Private 
Hospital was performed over two days by a team 
of five consultant surgeons, led by cardiothoracic 
surgeon Dr Michael Harden and two anaesthetists.  

“The tumour was enormous, between 25-30 
centimetres, and seemed to be attached to his 
chest wall and it’s that position that made it very 
difficult. It was in his back, nestled between three 
ribs and sitting very close to his aorta,” Dr Harden 
explained. 

“To prevent the patient’s chest from caving in after 
surgery, we engineered a 3D-printed, customised 
chest cavity. 

“I’ve never done anything like it ... the implant 
itself was unique and I think it’s amazing that we 
can do it here, using Australian technology. This 
was very personalised surgery.”

Subang Jaya Medical Centre launched Home Connect 
(home care nursing and rehabilitation services) and 
Teleconnect Centre (a dedicated healthcare hotline) 
this year, as well as implementing a real-time, digital 
tracking system for all surgical operations.

Hollywood Private Hospital has celebrated more than 
250 surgeries at its multi-million dollar, purpose-built 
theatre. Hollywood is the biggest centre in Australasia 
for hybrid catheter and surgical ablation (HyCASA).

Director of Medical Services John Maxwell said 
it s also the only private hospital in Perth with a 
multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation program to help 
patients through their recovery.

Capio St Göran’s Hospital is the first large hospital 
in Sweden to introduce a broad-based speech 
recognition tool which uses AI to record patient 
information so it can be recorded, retrieved and 
updated in real-time.

The Le Bois Private Hospital opened a state-of-the-art 
rhythmology room in January. 

Rhythmologist Dr Nicolas Détis said centralising the 
services would allow doctors to see more patients with 
shorter waiting times. 

“It also makes the hospital more attractive for 
recruiting new practitioners,” he added.

Our people are our success
The safety, satisfaction, wellbeing and inclusion of 
our people is essential to delivering high-quality 
patient outcomes and experiences. 

That is why our people are at the heart of 
delivering Ramsay’s purpose and values.

We invest in our people and want them to have 
fulfilling careers, with opportunities for learning 
and advancement throughout their working life. 

We make safety a top priority and integrate safety 
and risk management into our daily operations. 

We reward and recognise our people for their 
important contribution to our success through 
initiatives such as our  employee share program 
for eligible permanent employees in Australia.

Though the sector remains challenged by 
systemic workforce shortages and pandemic-
related absenteeism, we are proud to employ 
many of the brightest, most dedicated people in 
healthcare.

Caring for our people

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  20

Our group-wide People strategy revolves around 
developing capability, culture and the best people 
in healthcare. During the year, Ramsay established 
several global working groups to devise group-wide 
initiatives aimed at advancing our People strategy. The 
groups collaborated on several new projects, including:

Formulating a global Employee Value Proposition 
(EVP) that is unique to Ramsay and clearly articulates 
what we stand for, what we offer and why people 
choose to work with us. The global EVP is being 
augmented by regional EVPs to support relevant 
recruitment and retention strategies.

Establishing a Global Corporate Graduate Program 
with our first cohort of outstanding graduates 
undertaking an international rotation to learn in 
different parts of the Ramsay business.

Developing an Alumni Program Framework to 
leverage an additional recruitment and referral pool of 
former Ramsay employees.

Defining a Ramsay Leader to express the behaviours 
and skills we seek to advance for Ramsay’s success. 

Employee engagement
Thousands of our people shared 
their ideas and feedback in our 
2021 global employee survey and 
we saw improved engagement in 
six of eight countries.

The response has been used to 
develop regional action plans, 
focusing on local needs. 

Our people priorities include:

• providing more flexible working conditions

• offering accessible learning and training 
opportunities

• expanding our leadership programs

• investing in technology to simplify processes and 
allow employees to spend more time with patients.

Inclusive leadership
As an inclusive leader, you build trust 
and ensure a high level of 
psychological safety for our people. 
You are respectful, caring and 
authentic. You value diversity and have 
an open, communicative approach.

Developmental leadership
As a developmental leader, you 
encourage a learning environment 
and support our people to connect 
and interact, to grow professionally 
and personally. You make decisions 
that drive positive performance for 
our business and our people. 

Collaborative leadership

Our global workforce

World class talent
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated labour market 
pressures that have been a challenge for many years. 
Workforce shortages in the healthcare sector continue 
to be felt globally, with high rates of turnover in most 
regions (see page 24). 

As such, attracting and retaining our people remains 
an important focus. We are positioning our response 
to be agile, tailored and best fit for each service, 
region and circumstance. Our health workforce 
grew significantly over the year (11%) mainly through 
acquisitions, including Elysium Healthcare in the UK 
and GPH Specialty Care in Sweden. 

“Ramsay is proud to employ the best people in 
healthcare by offering a supportive culture, flexible 
conditions and outstanding career opportunities. 
We respect and support each other to do our best 
work in The Ramsay Way.”

Colleen Harris
Group Chief People Officer

Enterprise leadership
Our business leaders are focused on engagement, 
development, retention and attraction, while 
simultaneously managing waves of pandemic-related 
absenteeism, increasing turnover and higher costs. 

This year, our successful Executive Leadership 
Program, run through the Ramsay Leadership 
Academy, was offered to 49 emerging leaders. The 
cross-sectional program aims to activate the potential 
of our future leaders, to accelerate their growth and 
reinforce the value of global collaboration.

Work-life balance
Ramsay Santé has become the first European 
healthcare provider to sign a Quality of Life & 
Working Conditions (QLWC) agreement with all its    
union partners.

The agreement covers more than 25,000 Ramsay 
Santé employees in France and centres on ways to 
improve health and safety, work-life balance, family 
care and hardship provisions for our people. 

“We have developed this QLWC agreement with 
our social partners to reinforce a balanced, fulfilling 
and inclusive framework that will allow staff to grow 
within the company,” explained Ramsay Santé CEO 
Pascal Roché.

The agreement’s initiatives include a new hotline 
and education program to prevent workplace 
harassment, respecting work cycles and providing 
more childcare and accommodation for employees.

The first graduates of Ramsay Australia’s prestigious 
Nursing Leaders of Tomorrow program.

Hundreds of graduates and interns join Ramsay each 
year to experience a range of clinical settings. 

In FY22, Ramsay Australia lifted its graduate intake 
to over 800 people and launched a new cadetship 
program, while Ramsay Santé expanded a study 
grants scheme to support final year students who 
commit to working at Ramsay Santé facilities for at 
least 18 months after they graduate.

Investing in our people
Professional development and job satisfaction are 
important to the performance and wellbeing of 
our people and Ramsay has launched a range of 
training, upskilling and advancement programs to 
promote learning across the business.

From self-paced online courses to intensive, 
tailored on-the-job learning and executive group 
programs; our training and development offering 
encourages Ramsay people to be lifelong learners, 
to embrace challenges and realise their potential. 

This year, Ramsay Australia expanded its Nursing 
and Midwifery Academy, adding two new programs 

• Nurse and Midwifery Unit Manager (NUM) 
Leadership Pathway Program

• Undergraduate Cadetship Program.

“Ramsay nurses are committed to providing 
excellent health care for their patients and we’re 
committed to helping them grow their skills and 
excel in their nursing careers,” Ramsay Australia 
chief nurse Dr Bernadette Eather said.

The latest round of Ramsay Australia’s National 
Scholarship Program provided 33 employees or teams 
a share of almost $80,000 to help grow their careers.

The Ramsay Leadership Academy’s Executive 
Leadership Program brought together many of our 
global and emerging leaders to develop their skills and 
share experiences.

Ramsay Santé Block Managers complete a tailored 
certificate from ESCP Business School. The course is 
designed to advance their management, operational 
and communication skills.

Safety and wellbeing

Mental health first aid
Taking care of our employees enables them to 
take better care of our patients, colleagues and 
communities. That is why we promote better 
physical and mental wellbeing for all our people. 

As well as empowering our people to care for 
themselves and each other, we are building 
mental health literacy and support skills in the 
wider community. 

In Australia and the UK, we have trained 
approximately 300 people in Mental Health First 
Aid. The skills-based, early intervention training 
program equips participants with the knowledge 
and confidence to recognise, connect and 
respond to someone experiencing a mental 
health problem or mental health crisis. 

More than 2000 people, including many 
Ramsay employees, took part in the first Ramsay 
Australia Wellbeing Challenge during mental 
health week 2021. The community campaign 
provided daily tips and resources for building 
healthy habits and self care.

R U OK Day
We know that conversations can change lives and 
Ramsay is proud to be a founding partner of R U OK 
Day, a community campaign encouraging people 
across Australia to make time to check in with their 
families, friends and colleagues. 

Safety
We continue to make safety a top priority for all our 
employees and people who visit our workplaces or 
access our services. We integrate safety and risk 
management into our daily operations to ensure that it is 
central to our business culture. 

The ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic 
are still impacting our daily operations with high 
absenteeism rates in the regions (see page 24). Regular safety huddles are part of our focus on 

patient safety and clinical excellence.

Caring for our planet

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  26

Making the world a better place
We know that a thriving planet is interconnected 
with a healthy population and Ramsay is committed 
to making a positive difference in the world. Being 
environmentally sustainable is also critical to the 
resilience and success of our business.

Ramsay is focused on climate action and 
environmental performance across our value chain.

This year, we were proud to announce a group-wide 
commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2040.

Our science-based emissions targets reflect the 
commitments of the countries in which we operate 
and support the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals. 

We will commence a validation process for these 
targets with the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi). 

What does it mean? 

To achieve net zero emissions by 2040, we are 
proactively changing many facets of how we 
operate, the resources we use and our supplier 
relationships.

Our global net zero strategies include:

• switching to renewable energy sources

• maximising energy efficiency

• cutting waste and boosting recycling

• reducing anaesthetic gas emissions

• embedding sustainable design in new facilities 
and upgrades

• engaging with suppliers to reduce supply chain 
emissions.

Why is it important?
Being sustainable is a priority for our people, patients, 
doctors and business success. 

Being sustainable allows us to build a robust business 
that adapts to climate-related risks and takes 
advantage of opportunities from the transition to a low 
carbon economy. 

Who is responsible?
Each business in the Ramsay Health Care group 
is responsible for implementing the strategy and 
improving our sustainability performance.

The Group Sustainability Officer and Global 
Sustainability Committee provide support and 
guidance to the Global Executive and Global Risk 
Management Committee on our approach and 
progress towards our goals.

Our greenhouse gas emissions will be reported 
annually against our targets. Our targets will be 
regularly reviewed for consistency with the latest 
climate science and to reflect any significant changes 
to business or baseline emissions. 

“Global warming is exacerbating a wide range of 
illnesses, diseases and chronic health conditions, 
not to mention the impact on our mental health. 
I hope Ramsay’s action inspires other healthcare 
providers around the world to commit to net zero 
emissions.”

Environmental action

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  27

Switching on solar
Transitioning to renewable energy sources is part of 
our greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy. 

Ramsay UK and Elysium Healthcare have made the 
switch to 100 per cent renewable electricity, while 
Ramsay Australia is rolling out a significant solar 
energy program, already including over 5,000 rooftop 
panels across 16 facilities.

As at October 2022, one million kilowatt hours of solar 
energy had been produced at our sites since the start 
of the program.

Globally, we are also moving to install more energy 
efficient lighting, heating and cooling. 

Sustainable design
We are continuously improving and want to maintain 
development performance standards through 
Environmentally Sustainable Design.

As part of our net zero commitment, we are 
developing climate adaptation and net zero plans so 
all our developments are future fit.

For example, Elysium’s nurse-led community care 
homes for people with learning disabilities include 
energy efficient building materials, lighting and 
heating. The units use heat source pumps for warming 
and zoned lighting to reduce energy use.

All building materials have been chosen for maximum 
insulation and the apartments are oriented with 
bedrooms facing east or west, limiting the need for 
extra heating or cooling. 

In addition, at least 10 per cent of Elysium’s new 
parking spaces are built alongside electric vehicle 
charging stations.

Private Rehabilitation Hospital.

CLC roadmap
In October, Ramsay joined other leading Australian 
companies in the Climate Leaders Coalition (CLC) to 
release a roadmap for achieving significant emissions 
reductions by 2030.

Ramsay Australia CEO Carmel Monaghan said 
endorsing the CLC Roadmap to 2030 was part of 
Ramsay’s commitment to sustainability.

“Healthcare providers should not only prepare for the 
health emergency that will stem from climate change, 
we must also play a leading role in reducing our own 
significant use of resources,” she said.

Greenhouse gas emissions 
and energy 
We are committed to improving our reporting and 
have started including greenhouse gas emissions 
from anaesthetic gases in our Scope 1 direct 
emissions. 

The inclusion of anaesthetic gases plus emissions 
from newly-acquired businesses Elysium Healthcare 
and GHP Specialty Care contributed to an increase 
in our total group emissions. However, at a regional 
level the results varied.

As a group, our greenhouse gas intensity reduced 
by more than 4 percent in FY22 (excluding 
anaesthetic gases).

This was largely due to switching to 100 per cent 
renewable electricity in the UK and the roll out 
of energy efficiency measures. However, energy 
intensity was impacted by reductions in activity 
(patient days), particularly in Australia. 

Our results are expected to improve as key energy 
efficiency projects, such as the roll out of solar 
systems and energy efficient lighting, start to 
deliver full year savings.

Waste and recycling
Reducing waste and improving recycling has been 
challenging with the impacts of the pandemic. 

Our businesses in the UK, Australia and France 
saw good reductions in total waste generated. 
The UK and Nordics saw more material diverted to 
recycling or energy recovery, however in Australia, 
there was a drop in the proportion diverted to 
recycling.  



  28Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  28

Greener theatres
Anaesthetists are leading a ‘greener theatres’ 
campaign in hospitals across our network. 

At the centre of the change is a switch to more 
environmentally friendly anaesthetic gases.

A growing number of hospitals have committed 
to phasing out or reducing the use of desflurane 
(which has a higher global warming potential 
compared to other gases).

Our commitment to change includes:

• Choosing the least polluting anaesthesia gas, 
when possible

• Reducing the gas diffusion flow 

• Using the semi-automated functions available 
on new generation respirators.

Other green theatre initiatives include recycling 
batteries, PVC (e.g. masks and tubing) and medical 
plastics (e.g. bottles, syringes and trays).

Our hospitals in Australia are moving to replace the 
disposable blue plastic wrap that is typically used to 
protect sterilised surgical instruments. 

Instead, we are using rigid metal containers which are 
re-usable, more cost-effective and last for years.

And, as part of our container supply agreement, 
more than 400 trees have been planted in the Yarra 
Yarra Biodiversity Corridor - a reforestation project in 
southwestern Australia.

disposable hair nets with reusable fabric alternatives.

Green teams

Reduce, reuse, recycle
From investing in large-scale renewable energy 
systems to activating our local green teams, the 
Ramsay Cares sustainability strategy is coming to life 
across our global businesses.

Over the past year, Ramsay hospitals and services 
have made a concerted effort to reduce single-use 
plastic items and recycle plastic consumables, where 
possible.

Driven by our people and doctors, the campaign to cut 
waste is being supported by new purchasing practices 
and new monitoring and reporting processes. 

The result is a notable reduction in plastic waste going 
to landfill. For example, this year Ramsay Australia has 
avoided or replaced 38 million single-use plastic items, 
recycled more than 580,000 PVC intravenous bags 
and committed to removing single-use plastic water 
bottles from all sites.

Nature and biodiversity
We know that a thriving planet is important to our 
health and wellbeing and taking action to improve 
our environmental performance helps us and the 
broader community. 

A number of our facilities are incorporating nature 
and biodiversity into their operations.

From sustainable landscaping to vegetable gardens, 
insect farms and animal therapy, we are committed 
to learning more about nature-related risks and 
opportunities across our value chain.

Water 
Ramsay recognises that sustainable water use is 
important, particularly in regions that can become 
water stressed. 

We know that climate change will lead to increased 
variability in rainfall and increased demand for water, 
particularly where temperatures rise, so access to 
water will be a long-term issue. 

This variability was seen in our water usage over 
the past year, with some regions experiencing 
unusually dry conditions (e.g. UK) and others, such 
as Australia, having notably wetter weather.

Through our development activities, we are 
adopting more water-efficient fittings and sensors 
and are continuing work to benchmark our facilities 
to identify waterwise opportunities and priorities.

Ten hospitals within the Pôle Lille Métropole Ramsay 
Santé have launched a range of environmental 
initiatives including encouraging biodiversity with 
on-site beehives, insect hotels, fruit trees, vegetable 
gardens and eco pastures.

Ramsay Sime Darby Health Care (RSDH) has donated 
320 refurbished computers and laptops to schools and 
underserved communities in the Klang Valley. 

RSDH group CEO Peter Hong said repurposing the 
devices was good for the environment and the local 
community. 

“By recycling these devices, we can give back to 
society while reducing our carbon footprint,” he said. “It 
reflects our philosophy of ‘people caring for people’”.

GOVERNANCE STRATEGY

The Board and Management’s role in overseeing Ramsay’s approach to understanding and 
managing climate-related risks and opportunities as outlined in our sustainability governance 
approach (page 7).

Ramsay’s vision is to leverage our global platform to be a patient-centred healthcare provider of the 
future. The strategy balances the needs of all our stakeholders, taking into account the rapidly changing 
environment and the pressures this places on global healthcare systems. 

FY22 progress

• As part of our commitment to taking action on climate change, Board oversight included 
approving aligning with science-based targets and Ramsay Health Care’s commitment to 
near and long term targets to be net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 - our net 
zero governance and reporting approach is outlined on page 26. 

• GHG emissions reduction targets were included in FY22 STI scorecards for Executives, as 
approved by the Board on the recommendation of the People & Remuneration Committee.

• Management developed a Climate Risk Dashboard to assist with understanding physical 
risk at an asset level under different climate scenarios and timelines. 

FY22 progress
• Ramsay Cares Sustainability Strategy was incorporated into the Corporate Strategy as one of the 

organisational foundations (see Annual Report page 13).

• In FY21, a high-level risk assessment identified key common risk areas and the potential implications 
for strategic and operational areas, such as buildings and supply chain, and the need grow our 
understanding and identify actions (short- to medium-term risk focus) (see page 31).

• In FY22, we prioritised understanding the physical risks as we operate a large number of sites. We 
undertook a climate vulnerability assessment to explore how the physical risk exposure to different 
perils may change over time across more than 300 facilities (buildings) in Australia, Asia, the UK, France 
and the Nordic region (see page 31).

FY23 focus

• Monitoring progress against the Ramsay Cares net zero by 2040 targets.

• Continue embedding climate risk considerations into global strategy and key business 
decision-making processes.

FY23 focus
• Stress-test the corporate strategy under different climate scenarios and timeframes and focus on better 

understanding the related transitional risks (medium-term focus).
• Monitoring longer-term implications of climate change on our people and patients (long-term focus).

RISK MANAGEMENT METRICS AND TARGETS

• Climate change risks are managed within the Group’s risk management framework. 

• Risk and opportunity identification - A high-level risk and opportunity assessment 
undertaken in FY21 identified a range of physical and transition climate-related risks and 
opportunities which may impact the health industry globally under the globally recognised 
scenarios: 1.5-degree, Paris Aligned Scenario (aligned to IPCC RCP-2.6 and SSP1) and 
4-degree, business as usual scenario (IPCC RCP-8.5 and SSP5)1 and other relevant 
modelling.

• A Physical Climate Analytics Dashboard has been created, so we can continue to explore 
a range of different climate scenarios, hazards and how they may affect our operations in 
each region project focussed on how risk exposure to different perils may change over 
time (2050 and 2100) under different Physical Climate Change Scenarios under the latest 
IPCC Climate Scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP 2-4.5, SSP5-8.5).

Metrics
• Currently disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from use of electricity, 

fuel and Scope 3 emissions arising from major waste streams which is externally assured. In FY22, 
anaesthetic gases were included in Scope 1 emissions.

•  Scope 3 emissions were estimated based on spend as part of developing our Net Zero emission goals 
and we will focus on engaging our suppliers to improve the data over time.

Targets
•  As part of the Ramsay Cares Sustainability Strategy, targets were set to reduce GHG emissions and 

energy intensity and drive a roll out of renewable energy installs on-site at key hospitals. 
•  GHG emission reductions targets are embedded in sustainability linked loans for the Wholly-Owned 

Funding Group and Ramsay Santé. 
•  Near and long term targets were set as part our Net Zero 2040 commitment.
•  GHG emission reduction targets are included in Scorecards for our Executives.

FY23 focus

• Work with regional businesses, focusing on sites with highest exposure or biggest 
change in exposure to determine effectiveness of risk controls in place, need to 
introduce mitigating actions and update business continuity planning etc.

FY23 focus
•  Continuing to improve and report on our performance and metrics annually. 
• Working with our supply chain to grow our understanding of our Scope 3 emissions and abatement 

opportunities.

 Impact Report 2022  |  31

Climate vulnerability assessment 
of our buildings
In FY22, we undertook a climate vulnerability 
assessment to explore how the physical risk exposure 
to different perils may change over time across more 
than 300 facilities (buildings) in Australia, Asia, the UK, 
France and the Nordic region.

The project focused on how risk exposure may change 
over time (2050 and 2100) for different perils under 
the latest IPCC Climate Scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP 2-4.5, 
SSP5-8.5). To stress-test resilience, the focus was on a 
climate scenario (SSP5-8.5) where global temperatures 
increase by greater than 4 degrees.

The outcomes of the assessment are only directional 
in nature and will help us prioritise where we need to 
focus further work. The preliminary analysis suggests 
that inherent exposure to damage across the portfolio 
(i.e. before considering mitigants such as building 
design) does not appear to change substantially 
between now and 2050, with much of the increased 
exposure being felt in the later half of the century. 
The analysis also suggests that inherent exposure to 
forgone revenue is more significant between 2050 
and 2100. 

In the next phase we will focus on:

• Sites that are currently low risk and expected to 
see the biggest increase in exposure by 2050 
under a greater than 4 degree scenario. These 
include flooding in the UK and storms in Australia 
and France.

• Sites currently exposed to high levels of physical 
climate risk that are expected to see the biggest 
increase in a greater than 4 degree scenario. 
These include flooding in Sweden and heat in 
Australia and Asia.

Existing facilities and future developments
• Energy disruption increasingly a concern and 

associated volatility in energy pricing
• Business disruptions due to extreme weather (e.g. 

heat waves, storms and flooding) being seen more 
readily

• More frequent extreme weather (e.g. heat waves) will 
require building upgrades (e.g. heating and cooling)

• Regulation on energy efficiency and development 
controls impacting both existing (retrofit) and future 
buildings.

Opportunities - Transition to renewable or zero carbon 
energy sources and build more climate resilience into new 
developments.

Supply chain
• Disruption to supply chain due to climate is happening 

and will be exacerbated under warming scenarios. 
• Increasing expectations on voluntary disclosure of 

climate risk and emissions across the value chain.
Opportunities - To engage suppliers to reduce carbon 
emissions and build resilience into the value chain.

People and health care
• Patient quality and people outcomes already key focus 

for the business.
• Climate impacts on healthcare are expected to be 

significant; we need to monitor this for Ramsay and our 
patient mix. 

• Impacts on staff from extreme weather such as 
heatwaves likely to result in lower productivity, high 
absenteeism and increased mental health issues for 
employees and patients.

Opportunities - To collaborate with doctors and clinicians 
across the health care sector.

New and better healthcare

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  34

Ramsay Hospital Research Foundation 
The Ramsay Hospital Research Foundation (RHRF)  
supports high quality research projects that improve 
patient outcomes and address key determinants of 
health linked to intergenerational change.  

This year, the RHRF launched a new grants program, 
thanks to $25 million from the Paul Ramsay Foundation.

The new program will focus on research into cancer, 
mental health, cardiovascular disease and orthopaedic 
surgery and musculoskeletal injury. 
The RHRF has grown to support more than 1,000 
clinical research projects, with Clinical Trials Network 
at 16 sites.

Ramsay Australia promotes Research Month in 
September to highlight a range of clinical trials and 
projects engaging tens of thousands of patients.

Foundation CEO Nicola Ware said more than 500 
clinicians have been involved in research projects.

“Ramsay is committed to driving and participating in 
research that will shape the future of healthcare and 
improve methods of preventing, diagnosing, treating 
and controlling diseases,” she said.

Ramsay Santé Foundation
Fuelled by the adage that ‘prevention is better than 
a cure’, the Ramsay Santé Foundation promotes 
preventative health care and focuses on innovation. 

This year, the Foundation’s free incubator program, 
Prevent2Care Lab, expanded to include entrepreneurs 
and groups working in health prevention and e-health 
from Sweden and Denmark.

The Foundation also launched a website dedicated 
to answering common questions about preventative 
healthcare, while 20 health professionals, including 
four from Ramsay Santé, became the first cohort to 
complete a unique Diploma in Health Prevention 
offered by the University of Western Brittany in 
partnership with the Ramsay Santé Foundation.

The Ramsay Santé Research and Education 
Department is dedicated to the discovery of new 
diagnostic tools, treatments and therapies. In 2022, 
the department was awarded €13.5 million to support  
hundreds of clinical trials and scientific publications.

Health research
Our values motivate us to constantly improve and 
find new and better ways of caring. That is why 
we support a wide range of health and medical 
research aimed at elevating the health and 
happiness of our patients and society as a whole.

Investing in preventative healthcare and life-
changing research, teaching and training is 
part of our commitment to supporting stronger, 
healthier communities.

Across Ramsay, we encourage a positive culture 
of research that can explore ideas, communicate 
best practice and contribute to outstanding 
healthcare around the world.

This year, Ramsay established a global 
Community of Practice for our research 
leaders and experts to share their knowledge, 
experience, tools and approaches across our 
network of facilities and services.

“Research is global, it’s all about your 
collaborators, but what’s most important 
is that all research is meant to improve the 
lives of the service users that we have the 
privilege of treating.”

Stronger communities

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  35

People caring for people
Our responsibility goes beyond connecting 
patients to skilled practitioners. We have an 
important role in serving society-at-large. 

Ramsay supports local and global communities 
in a wide range of ways, including

• Making high quality healthcare more 
accessible through facilities in a growing 
number of regional cities and towns

• Providing local job opportunities, promoting 
economic growth and regional stability

• Contributing to scientific and medical 
research capacity, building knowledge and 
partnerships

• Supporting important community causes, 
charities, awareness and education 
campaigns.

The Care4Klang food bank initiative at Bukit 
Tinggi Medical Centre provided community 

support during COVID-19 lockdowns.

Ukraine aid
The conflict in Ukraine has mobilised teams across 
Ramsay. As well as giving financial aid to support 
the humanitarian response, we have donated vital 
medical supplies to Ukrainian hospitals and offered free 
healthcare to those fleeing the conflict. 

Operation Ukraine at Ramsay Santé’s Clinique 
des Cèdres sent pharmacy supplies to 
hospitals in Berdichev and Kremechuk.

Capio emergency doctor 
Jennifer Rosdahl worked 
alongside the Swedish 
Migration Agency to care 
for Ukrainian refugees 
arriving in Nynäshamn by 
ferry from Poland.

Ramsay teams came up 
with creative ways to 
raise funds in support of 
the humanitarian effort.

Flood relief
Extraordinary flooding in early 2022 sparked a quick 
response from Ramsay teams in south-east Queensland 
and New South Wales.

Our people stepped up to cover stranded colleagues 
and worked together to keep water out of our facilities.

Ramsay provided special grants worth $132,000 to 
help cover employees’ costs, such as emergency 
accommodation and food, and donated $50,000 to the 
Australian Red Cross flood appeal.

John Flynn Private Hospital put together 
hundreds of  first aid packs for flood victims.

Responsible sourcing

Ramsay Health Care 
 Impact Report 2022  |  37

Sustainable procurement
Ramsay is committed to ensuring our purchasing 
decisions have a positive impact on our people, the 
planet and the communities in which we operate. 

We are supported by a large and complex global 
supply chain of over 15,000 suppliers operating 
across more than 30 countries. 

We rely on suppliers to provide a broad range of 
goods and services such as 

• medical consumables and equipment 

• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

• laboratory and radiology services 

• vaccines and pharmaceuticals

• food and nutrition 

• linen services and textiles

• utilities and facility management

• travel and consultancy services. 

Ramsay is committed to responsible sourcing and a 
key method for us to communicate our expectations 
of suppliers is through the Code of Conduct for 
Manufacturers, Suppliers and Agents (Code). 

The Code clearly sets out expectation of suppliers in 
doing business with Ramsay regarding 

• business ethics

• human rights and labour standards

• the environment

• society and the communities we operate within. 

Ramsay is progressively incorporating contractual 
provisions into our standard supply and services 
agreements to require suppliers to comply with the 
Code and additional clauses to ensure compliance 
with relevant modern slavery laws. 

Working with our suppliers
The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic presents 
an ongoing risk to our supply chains. 

As our people and clinicians work hard to support the 
pandemic response, our businesses continue to focus 
on delivering high quality care and keeping our people 
safe by minimising the pandemic impacts on medical 
supplies and equipment. 

We manage these risks through our global supplier 
risk management framework, global supply chain and 
regional network of facilities. 

Our commitment to responsible sourcing is essential 
to maintaining a resilient supply chain that delivers 
quality medical products, devices and equipment.  

As part of our Responsible Sourcing Program, we 
have made a commitment that, by FY26, 80 per 
cent of our suppliers (by share of spend) will be 
assessed by an independent third-party, EcoVadis, 
for their performance against 21 Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) criteria, including modern slavery. 

We are on track to achieve this commitment, with 
over 20 per cent of suppliers (by share of spend) 
completing the EcoVadis CSR assessment in FY22. 

We are committed to enforcing the minimum 
standards expected of suppliers and working with 
them to implement appropriate business processes or 
corrective action plans to ensure their compliance.

Medical supplies are a large proportion of our 
purchasing and is largely made up of medical 
consumables, equipment, implants and 
pharmaceuticals. 

During FY22, we collaborated with our top medical 
suppliers in mapping our Tier 1 supply chain. These 
suppliers are global multinational organisations with 
complex and geographically diverse operations. 

So far, we have identified that about 20 per cent of 
our medical products (by share of spend) are sourced 
from over 290 supplier facilities across more than 30 
countries. 

Our FY22 Modern Slavery Statement contains more 
detailed information about our supplier mapping.

A significant proportion of our greenhouse gas 
emissions come from our supply chain. We recognise 
that our responsible sourcing practices have a critical 
role to play in tackling climate change and reducing 
our Scope 3 emissions.

To achieve Ramsay’s emissions targets, we must 
work in partnership with our suppliers and we are 
developing ways to encourage our suppliers to reduce 
their emissions in line with science-based targets. 

Ramsay’s supplies division, Linear Medical, donated 
35,000 face shields to help frontline healthcare 

workers dealing with COVID-19 in Papua New Guinea.

CLINICAL QUALITY & EXCELLENCE
Why it is important
Delivering high-quality, safe and effective clinical care is at 
our core. In addition to clinical quality, we are focused on the 
patient experience and working with our doctors to support their 
wellbeing and effectiveness. We invest in identifying the best 
patient outcomes through research and development. 

Our management approach 
Ramsay Health Care strives to deliver high-quality, safe and 
effective clinical care in an environment where risks and issues 
are anticipated, identified early and responded to rapidly. We 
work to do this through reviewing and improving our patient 
safety and quality system performance. Safety is everyone’s 
business and the cornerstone of quality. For this reason, 
we endorse accountability in this area at all levels of our 
organisation. 

The Ramsay Health Care Board and the Global Risk Management 
Committee embed strong leadership in safety and quality. 
This supports Ramsay Health Care employees and accredited 
medical practitioners in their efforts to provide safe, high-quality 
care and monitor and respond to the performance of Ramsay's 
patient care systems.

PEOPLE & CULTURE
Why is it important
Our people are our most important asset. We strive for 
excellence and continuous improvement in workplace practices 
and culture to promote a positive, harmonious and productive 
environment for all.

Our management approach 
Ramsay Health Care is recognised for its commitment to staff 
through professional development and fostering of a special 
culture known as The Ramsay Way. The Ramsay Way focuses on 
‘people caring for people’ and recognises that our people are 
the key to our success. The Ramsay Way means that, through 
our operations and through our policies and practices, Ramsay 
Health Care can make a genuine attempt to improve the quality 
of life of our employees, their families, the local community and 
society at large. 

Ramsay teams should work in an environment that is receptive 
and flexible. We want our facilities to be led by competent and 
experienced managers, with an ‘open door’ policy for doctors 
and staff. Ramsay empowers local facility managers to develop 
productive working relationships with our people, doctors and 
other stakeholders. We pride ourselves on the relationships we 
have built with these groups across the organisation. 

Our internal policies and processes aim to provide our people 
at all levels with career expansion, training and development 
opportunities. We invest in engagement and recognition and are 
keen to develop a global pipeline of talent, such as through our 
global Ramsay Leadership Academy.

DIGITAL & DATA
Why it is important
Expanding privacy and security regulations, and an increasingly 
hostile online environment, have made information privacy and 
cyber security an increasing concern. The digitisation of services 
and increasing use of data for decision-making are key drivers in 
the health care industry’s transformation.

Our management approach 
Ramsay Health Care recognises the significant importance 
of information privacy and cyber security to our business, 
particularly in an environment of expanding information privacy 
and security regulations, and an increasingly hostile online 
landscape.

Ramsay relies on its own and third-party vendor information 
systems to perform key functions essential to our ability to 
operate, provide care and manage patient admissions and 
patient data, inventory and administration. Each Ramsay regional 
business monitors cyber risks and data and privacy concerns. 
Each region has its own accountability framework to reduce 
risk, protect all data held and meet the regulatory requirements. 
As part of this, each region has dedicated data protection and 
privacy officers (or equivalent). Each region is responsible for 
delivering comprehensive training to staff as part of our continual 
improvement. 

Our approach is overseen by the Ramsay Health Care Board, 
the Board’s Global Risk Management Committee and the Global 
Executive.

returns. The Board has oversight of Ramsay Health Care’s 
business and affairs and, as such, is responsible for overall 
strategy, governance and performance. 

The Annual Report outlines our strategy and performance 
as well as our material business risks. Ramsay Health Care is 
implementing its 2030 strategy to position the business for 
growth, with a focus on delivering high-quality clinical outcomes, 
investing in data and digital and growing and developing our 
people.

Ramsay’s governance framework is designed to ensure that 
the company is effectively managed, that legal and regulatory 
obligations are met and that the culture of personal and 
corporate integrity – The Ramsay Way – is reinforced. Ramsay 
is steadfast in its commitment to maintaining the culture and

INTEGRATED QUALITY ASSETS & 
INFRASTRUCTURE

Why it is important
A key part of Ramsay’s business strategy is driving stronger 
growth from the core and developing new growth platforms. This 
includes a pipeline of developments and potential acquisitions of 
additional hospitals, health services or businesses with relevant 
adjacencies. Ensuring these assets and new infrastructure are 
efficient and future-fit is essential to maintaining a resilient asset 
base.

Our management approach 
Regional Development Committees are responsible for the 
development pipeline in our regional businesses. The Chief 
Business Development Officer sits on the regional committees. 
Significant projects are overseen and approved by the Group 
Development Committee at a global level. Major acquisitions and 
developments are provided to the Board for approval.

Ecologically sustainable development (ESD) requirements 
are considered on a case-by-case basis; we see this as a 
growing opportunity and a focus going forward. Innovation and 
new models of care are also important considerations in the 
development pipeline. 

CARING FOR COMMUNITIES
Why it is important
Ramsay has an important role to play in the communities we 
serve and society at large. Our focus on health care allows us 
to commit significant resources to medical research, clinical 
teaching and training. We take a global approach to health care 
prevention and supporting local communities. 

Our management approach
Ramsay makes meaningful contributions to local communities 
in a range of ways, including: 

•  Employment - our people often live near their patients. 

•  Regional and rural health care - we are often one of the 
largest employers in a locality.

•  Social infrastructure - through our investment in new 
hospitals and clinics. We are committed to investing in 
large-scale causes and local projects near our facilities.

•  Clinical outcomes - supporting medical research through 
the Ramsay Hospital Research Foundation in Australia and 
the Ramsay Santé Foundation in Europe.

CLIMATE ACTION & ENVIRONMENT
Why it is important
Ramsay recognises that conserving and protecting the 
environment is a critical issue. We are committed to working 
toward environmentally sustainable outcomes and achieving 
continual improvement in performance. We are focused on 
the key challenges of climate change, reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions, saving energy and water, reducing resource 
use where it safe to do so, increasing recycling and promoting 
sustainable development and procurement outcomes.

Our management approach 
The Ramsay Cares sustainability strategy includes the key pillar 
of Caring for our Planet. Each regional business is responsible 
for implementing the approach and improving our environmental 
performance. 

Our approach to sustainability and any material environmental 
risks is overseen by the Global Risk Management Committee.

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
Why it is important
Ramsay recognises the importance of improving social and 
environmental outcomes in our global supply chain. 

Our management approach
Ramsay’s regional businesses are responsible for 
procurement. Our direct supply chain consists primarily of 
medical consumables and associated capital equipment, 
pharmaceuticals, labour, food, linen services, energy and 
utilities. 

Ramsay is committed to ensuring our purchasing decisions 
have a positive impact on people, the planet and the 
communities in which we operate. In FY22, we procured goods 
and services from a large and complex global supply chain of 
over 15,000 suppliers in more than 30 countries. 

Ramsay continued to apply its Code of Conduct for 
Manufacturers, Suppliers and Agents (Code) which sets out the 
minimum standards we expect of our suppliers in key areas of 

- legal compliance 
- human and labour rights 
- business ethics 
- environmental impact. 

As part of our Responsible Sourcing Program, in FY22 more 
than 20 per cent of our suppliers (by share of spend) were 
assessed by an independent third-party, EcoVadis, for their 
performance against 21 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
criteria, including modern slavery. 

Ramsay is committed to enforcing the minimum standards 
expected of suppliers and working with them to implement 
appropriate business processes or corrective action plans to 
ensure their compliance. 

For more information about our supply chain, please see our 
Modern Slavery Statement.

Independent Limited Assurance Report to the directors and management of Ramsay Health 
Care Limited 

 

Conclusion 

We have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on Ramsay Health Care Limited’s (‘RHCL’) 
‘Subject Matter Information’ disclosed in RHCL’s 2022 Impact Report for the year ended 30 June 2022. 

Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that, the ‘Subject Matter Information’ is not prepared in all material respects, in 
accordance with RHCL’s Basis of Preparation, policies and procedures and definitions (the ‘Reporting 
Criteria’) detailed below for the year ended 30 June 2022. 

Subject Matter Information and Reporting Criteria 

The ‘Subject Matter Information’ for our limited assurance engagement for the year ended 30 June 2022 
is as follows:

Basis for Conclusion  

We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Australian Standard on Assurance 
Engagements ASAE 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information (“ASAE 3000”), issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.  

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
conclusion.  

Management’s Responsibilities 

Management is responsible for: 

a) ensuring that the ‘Subject Matter Information’ is prepared in accordance with the ‘Reporting 
Criteria’; 
 

b) confirming the measurement or evaluation of the underlying subject matter against the ‘Reporting 
Criteria’, including that all relevant matters are reflected in the ‘Subject Matter Information’; 
 

• Senior leadership (Group executive and 
direct reports)  

• Regional executive  
• Facility CEOs  
• Managers

c) designing, establishing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over its operations 
and financial reporting, including, without limitation, systems designed to assure achievement of its 
control objectives and its compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and 

 
d) the electronic presentation of the ‘Subject Matter Information’ and our limited assurance report on 

their website. 

Our Independence and Quality Control  

We have complied with the independence and other relevant ethical requirements relating to assurance 
engagements, and applied Auditing Standard ASQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and 
Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, Other Assurance Engagements and 
Related Services Engagements in undertaking this assurance engagement. 

Assurance Practitioner’s Responsibilities 

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on RHCL’s ‘Subject Matter Information’ as 
evaluated against the ‘Reporting Criteria’ based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence 
we have obtained. ASAE 3000 requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain limited 
assurance about whether, anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the ‘Subject 
Matter Information’ is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with  the ‘Reporting 
Criteria’.   

A limited assurance engagement in accordance with ASAE 3000 involves identifying areas where a 
material misstatement of the ‘Subject Matter Information’ is likely to arise, addressing the areas 
identified and considering the process used to prepare the ‘Subject Matter Information’.  A limited 
assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the 
procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. 

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are 
less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have 
been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express 
a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the ‘Subject Matter Information’ has been properly 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the ‘Reporting Criteria’. 

Our procedures included:  

• Inquiries with Subject Matter data owners and sustainability report responsible management to 
understand and assess the approach for collating, calculating and reporting the respective ‘Subject 
Matter Information’ across the reporting period ended 30 June 2022 

• Inspection of documents as part of the walk throughs of key systems and processes for collating, 
calculating and reporting the respective ‘Subject Matter Information’ for RHCL’s 2022 Impact 
Report. 

• Selection on a sample basis items to test from the selected sustainability performance indicators 
and agree to relevant supporting documentation. 

• Analytical reviews over material data streams to identify any material anomalies for the ’Subject 
Matter Information’ and investigate further where required 

• Agreeing overall data sets for the ’Subject Matter Information’ to the final data contained in RHCL’s 
2022 Impact Report. 

Inherent Limitations 

Because of the inherent limitations of an assurance engagement, together with the inherent limitations 
of any system of internal control there is an unavoidable risk that it is possible that fraud, error, or non-

 Impact Report 2022  |  49

 

compliance with laws and regulations, where there has been concealment through collusion, forgery and 
other illegal acts may occur and not be detected, even though the engagement is properly planned and 
performed in accordance with Standards on Assurance Engagements.  

Restricted use 
The applicable criteria used for this engagement was designed for a specific purpose of assisting the 
directors and management report on the ‘Subject Matter Information’ presented in RHCL’s 2022 Impact 
Report, as a result, the ‘Subject Matter Information’ may not be suitable for another purpose. 

This report has been prepared for use by the directors and management for the purpose of reporting on 
the ’Subject Matter Information’ presented in RHCL’s 2022 Impact Report.  

We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report to any person other than the 
directors and management or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.  

It is our understanding that the RHCL may publish a copy of this report on their website. We do not 
accept responsibility for the electronic presentation of our report on the RHCL’s website. The security 
and controls over information on the web site is not evaluated or addressed by the independent auditor. 
The examination of the controls over the electronic presentation of this Report on RHCL’s web site is 
beyond the scope of this engagement.
