Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

Important stakeholders
Consumers are the most important stakeholders 
concerning our business activities. It is important to 
foster empathy and action by creating consumer 
awareness using various means beyond utilizing 
different types of media and storefronts. These means 
include school education for the next generation and 
working with local governments and worksites to take 
initiatives toward a hyper-aging society.

Next-generation awareness raising
As part of our activities to educate the next 
generation, since 2009 we have been providing hand-
washing lessons as visiting classes for lower grades at 
elementary schools with our Bioré u brand, which 
promotes good physical hygiene.
 However, due to the ongoing effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, in 2021, as in the previous year, 
we provided free teaching materials for teachers to 

When it comes to Kao’s brand purpose, we refer to 
what positive impacts we can make on daily life, 
society and the Earth.
 The activities of our purpose driven brand include the 
following efforts: (1) an explanation of why the brand 
exists, (2) specific brand actions, (3) communication.
 During our first year of these activities in 2019, we 
focused on (1) an explanation of why the brand exists. 
From 2020 forward, we have been focusing on 
creating change in the world through (2) specific 
brand actions and (3) communication, becoming an 
entity that contributes to the solution of social issues 
in collaboration with consumers and society.

Education and promotion

Communication with consumers is essential for making 
a positive impact on daily life, society and the Earth. In 
order to achieve this, we provide educational training to 
staff in order to reconfirm the significance of our 
existence as a brand based on consumer perspective, 
working with ESG management and global unity.
 In addition, conveying brand attitude and participating 
in awareness-raising activities in order to create social 
change together with consumers is important. For 
instance, with Bioré u, we were able to develop a foam 
hand soap that makes hand washing easier, along with a 

conduct their own classes. In response to the 
pandemic, we developed a new hygiene habits 
program to help children in the early grades of 
elementary school enjoy learning the importance of 
hand-washing and mask-wearing, and acquire 
hygiene habits. We provided information about the 
program to approximately 20,000 schools nationwide, 
and more than 6,000 are using it.
 In addition, we developed a parallel program for 
children with hearing impairments, which we have 
been offering since September 2021, to help them 
acquire hygiene habits while having fun.

Initiatives for a hyper-aging society
In cooperation with local governments and worksites, 
we are working to extend healthy life expectancy 
through visualizing how much visceral fat they have at 
measurement sessions, encouraging citizens to walk 
and offering them healthy meal menus.
 Under the Healthya brand, through the LINE we 
are conducting a service that allows users to easily 
check their percentage of visceral fat.

Rapidly Transforming into the New, 
Strong and Agile Kao

To our stakeholders
The world today continues to experience great turmoil. 
Rising geopolitical tensions are fueling divisions 
among people, the pandemic is still with us, and 
environmental problems are increasing in severity. On 
the other hand, economic activities are necessary for 
people to continue living their lives. There have been 
long-running debates on how to balance human life 
and the economy, the environment and the economy, 

and so on. It is incumbent upon us to find this balance 
in the world in the 21st century. We have set our 
vision as “protecting future lives” in light of the 
tumultuous times that we are in, and have designated 
life, everyday lives and ecology as three areas where 
we will contribute to society. In the face of urgent 
environmental problems and complex social 
challenges associated with population aging and 
growing burden of health care expenses, Kao is more 
committed than ever to enabling healthy and 
sustainable everyday lifestyles.

Turbulent first year of the Kao Group Mid-term 
Plan 2025 (K25)
We kicked off K25, the new Kao Group Mid-term 
Plan, in FY2021. The strategic approach for K25 
consists of the following three parts with a focus on 
the year 2030.
 They are: (1) Become an essential company in a 
sustainable world, (2) Transform to build robust 
business through investment and (3) Maximize the 
power and potential of employees. In addition, we 
must achieve business transformation to a high-
revenue-earning business model in this tough 
business environment. From the starting year of K25, 
financial performance for FY2021 should and could 
have been stronger. While external factors including 
the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and hikes in raw 
material prices are certainly present, it is also a fact 
that we under-invested in parts of our business that

our business performance. We had advanced reforms 
through 2019 to transform the Cosmetics Business into 
a high-profit business, and as such the overall business 
impact was magnified because of the investment in 
business model transformation already underway.

Dual-track reforms to revitalize existing business 
and create new business
Since last year, we have been implementing dual-track 
reforms using the concepts of Reborn Kao, which aims 
to revitalize existing business, and Another Kao, which 
aims to create future focused new business. Just as 
the phrase implies, Reborn Kao is about reinforcing our 
current business with dynamic investments and 
fortifying our brand strategy, while Another Kao 
focuses on themes that we have not done, or have not 
been able to do, in the past. In order to deliver the 
dual-track approach, we have reset our innovation 
agenda and mobilized the team to ensure new 
business investments are highly leveraged against our 
current business competencies, capabilities and 
technologies. Optimizing synergies between our 
existing and new businesses to deliver maximum value 
is core to how we will lead the way forward. Our goal 
in this is stated in our Commitment to the Future.

Reborn Kao: Major reforms in manufacturing 
and marketing
The immediate priority to deliver on the Reborn Kao 
plan is to implement a series of significant 

manufacturing and marketing reforms.
 We will be making dynamic investments in 
category leading brands and deliver a dramatic shift in 
our approach to marketing. Marketing investment will 
be focused on creating strong ties with consumers 
and accelerate our rapid shift to loyalty and retention 
based relationship marketing. We need to have 
distinctive products that offer functional value to do 
this. Also important is offering value that touches 
consumers on an emotional level and has the power 
to make consumers want to tell other people about 
the products. New digital experiences, technology 
advancements and opportunities to maximize 
personalization are all key to success.
 Integrated into these priorities is the advancement 
of our ESG agenda, we will accelerate our proposals 
for ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri, which we define as 
“maximum value with minimum waste,” to contribute 
to a circular society. In products designed for the 
future, it is important that the various types of value 
they provide to consumers is long-lasting and strongly 
satisfying while minimizing the energy, substances 
and labor required to make them.
 Next, regarding globalization, we will distinguish 
ourselves in the global marketplace and avoid fierce 
competition of product and price, by ensuring we 
offer “only one” value to our customers. To 
compliment this, we are moving toward local 
production and consumption model, grounded in 
local value, cost performance and manufacturing.

needed more support. This is not an issue that has 
suddenly emerged, and it signifies that we must 
further increase the speed of our corporate reforms.

Our awareness of the issues 
After peaking in 2018, three factors have contributed 
to a sharp decline in our Economic Value Added 
(EVA®) result.
 The first is our delay in moving away from mass 
marketing in Japan. In the past, we have enjoyed 
best-in-market loyalty from consumers in many 
categories by leveraging our distinctive technologies 
and mass production capabilities. However, consumer 
needs are diversifying, and in some areas the speed 
and quality of our manufacturing has not kept pace 
with these expectations.
 The second factor is the collapse in inbound demand 
for disposable baby diapers, which accounted for a large 
share of our sales. Our category leader Japanese-made 
Merries had become so popular in Japan that consumers 
could not even find them in stock. The combination of 
being out of stock, with the emergence of local Chinese 
products, resulted in declining levels of our brand name 
recognition. It is fair to say that our delay in changing our 
business model in anticipation of those developments 
significantly impacted our EVA.
 The third factor is the contraction in the cosmetics 
market driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Makeup 
products account for an especially large share of our 
sales, and the contraction in demand severely impacted

 In the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa 
(AEMEA), our goal is to become the No. 1 brand in the 
target categories. In the salon hair color field for 
example, we have strengthened our global presence 
and success through distinctive and innovative product. 
In the body skin care field in AEMEA, we are rolling out 
products that set us apart from other companies.
 In the Chemical business, we already enjoy 
market leadership driven by unique and high 
performing products. Our focus is on driving forward 
and integrating ESG-based innovation to distinguish 
them even further.

Reborn Kao: Significant reform for high-profit 
businesses
We are also aiming to make a major pivot to a high-
profit business. To clarify our investment policy, we 
separated our business into three domains last year: 
Stable Earnings, Growth Drivers and Business 
Transformation. Stable Earnings relies on high margin 
category leading businesses where we lead in the 
industry. In Growth Drivers domain, we will accelerate 
our global growth through targeted investment and 
Business Transformation efforts will be focused on 
delivering increased profitability. We are currently 
pressing ahead with these reforms.
 In addition to these efforts will be a focus on 
purpose-driven brand management in our Consumer 
Products Business. We will design our distinctive 
brands to create synergies built around their brand 

purpose and leverage the authenticity and performance 
of our portfolio of brands to deliver growth.
 Last year, we saw growth in brands and business 
that digitized early. These were primarily in cosmetics 
and men’s facial cleanser in Japan, professional hair 
care in Europe, and body skin care in the Americas. 
We delivered new innovation in disposable baby 
diapers in China to positively support newborn 
development. 
 These diapers are resistant to swelling after 
urination, so they do not interfere with babies’ walking 
gait. Also, parents can use smartphones to monitor 
the development of their baby’s earliest walking 
movements, and we launched a service that provides 
advice based on the stage of a baby’s individual 
development. The diapers have been positively 
received in the market, and we are proceeding with 
local production. These are some of the ways in which 
we have moved the “yardstick” used to measure value 
with consumers, and evidence that we are increasing 
the value experienced by customers.

Another Kao: Create new businesses
Specific measures for Another Kao, which aims to 
create new business models, commenced in 2022. This 
business model mobilizes our deep expertise in 
monitoring technologies and allows us to deliver 
precise and customizable solutions. Generally speaking, 
for issues where the cause is clear, precise and 
effective product design is possible. There are many 

cases, however, where the cause is unclear, and often 
the solutions that are provided then need to be highly 
generalized. This then results in a sharp drop in the 
value that is experienced. Kao is well advanced in 
developing platforms to analyze causal relationships 
from easily obtainable data such as with sebum RNA 
monitoring and walking motion monitoring. This 
enables us to offer more precise and targeted solutions. 
These monitoring solutions are not done solely by Kao; 
anyone can use them and improve their applicability.
 We have also started utilization of the Virtual 
Human Body Generative Model this year, which can be 
versatilely applied to meet needs by estimating 
correlations even when causes are not identified. This 
model is able to utilize wide-ranging attributes that by 
their nature have been difficult to connect as input data, 
and is able to return estimated values for a number of 
requests. It can thus be utilized in cooperation with 
partners in many different industries and fields, and this 
year we have started a large number of collaborative 
projects. Preferred Networks, Inc., a company with 
some of the most advanced deep-learning technology 
in the world, was involved in the development of this 
model, which utilizes our unique data set.
 We are also deploying solutions in industrial fields 
based on Precision Monitoring in areas such as 
adjuvants (agriculture) and infrastructure (roads). 
These are a few of the advancements we are making 
to advance new business development in alignment 
with our ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri commitment.

People’s energy is our driving force 
The Kao Way, our Corporate Philosophy, was created in 
2004 and established part of our company culture and 
core DNA in order to spread our valued spirit passed 
down from our predecessors to all employees. 
Employees have put the Kao Way into practice as the 
cornerstone and the starting point of everything we do.
 In the midst of transformation, it is vital that our 
employees question the status quo. As part of this, in 
2021 we revised three points in our philosophy that 
we need to achieve going forward. The first is 

establishing our new Mission of “As one, we create a 
Kirei life for all̶providing care and enrichment for the 
life of all people and the planet.” Then we updated our 
Vision “To be closest to the individual and beyond 
their expectation,” and finally we added “We act with 
courage” to our Principles.
 The updated Kao Way was developed with input 
and ideas from employees all around the world. Our 
commitment to our core values of Integrity as the only 
choice, Yoki-Monozukuri in plan and action, and 
Innovation for today and tomorrow have not changed. 

In parallel with these updates, we implemented an OKR 
(Objectives and Key Results) system. We are already 
experiencing positive changes as employees are 
encouraged to set higher and more challenging goals.

In conclusion
As we declared last year, we will transform our 
manufacturing from an approach driven by 
consumption to one where resources are circulated. 
This represents a transition from a linear economic 
model based on units and volumes to a circular 
economy based on quality and human connections. It 
is a more just and sustainable business model for all, 
poised for success as we remain focused on serving 
fundamental human needs while solving for complex 
environmental and social problems. We expect to 
enact business reforms in FY2022 amid the 
challenging global business environment. We view 
the current turbulence as an opportunity to reform 
and, are fully committed to transform rapidly into the 
new, stronger and more agile Kao.

 This year, we reinforced our ESG governance 
structure by setting up ESG steering committees for 
four key areas. The Decarbonization Steering 
Committee will focus on accelerating actions toward 
our corporate decarbonization goals of becoming 
carbon zero by 2040 and carbon negative by 2050. 
Our ambition to become carbon negative will be 
powered by our ongoing development of technologies 
that aim to create raw materials out of carbon and 
apply them to our products. The steering committee 
focused on plastic packaging will drive actions toward 
a truly resource-circulating society. In order to create 
a foundation upon which all people and the planet 
can thrive, Human Rights and DEI, and Chemical 
Stewardship Steering Committees have been 
established.
 ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri, or creating our 
products and brands from an ESG mindset by design 
will unlock innovations for both positive social and 
business impacts.

Making a difference through partnerships and 
people
To make lasting and meaningful change, we will work 
across our entire value chain. Managing our high-risk 
supply chains, such as palm oil, is critical.
 We will work jointly with our suppliers, with a 
priority on securing traceability to protect both the 
environment and human rights. More recently, we 
stepped up our efforts with the Smallholder Inclusion 
for Better Livelihood & Empowerment program 

(SMILE), with our business partners.
 Partnerships will be key in building a resource-
circulating society. We will further our efforts by 
working with organizations in and outside our 
industries, and with both local and central 
governments, to explore and build novel systems to 
address the challenges of plastic waste.
 Most of all, ｗe will continue to engage with our 
diverse and dedicated employees that are the driving 
force behind our ESG actions.

Looking ahead
As a maker of everyday products that touch the 
homes and lives of millions of people around the 
world, as well as chemical products, we will 
accelerate our efforts in realizing a Kirei life for all 
̶providing care and enrichment for the life of all 
people and the planet, through our ESG Strategy, the 
Kirei Lifestyle Plan.
 Our purpose-driven brands powered by our R&D 
capabilities will help close the gap between intention 
to action amongst people, helping them to make the 
right choices that will create a truly resource-
circulating and sustainable society, now and in the 
future. Please join us in creating a Kirei life for all.

ESG at the core of our business
With our K25 mid-term business strategy’s vision of 
becoming a company that protects people and our 
world’s future by pursuing sustainability as the only 
path, we are putting ESG (Environmental, Social and 
Governance) at the core of our business. Our key 
approach of creating maximum value with minimum 
waste will drive ESG actions across our entire 
organization. 
 Guiding our ESG actions is our long-held value of 
Integrity, passed down from our founder. It enables us 
to be committed to doing what is right and not what is 
easy. This commitment to a purpose-driven business is 
rooted in our corporate philosophy: the Kao Way.

As one, we create a Kirei life for all̶providing care and 
enrichment for the life of all people and the planet
As one Kao, we work together with passion to provide comprehensive 
care and enrichment to create a Kirei life̶a cleaner, more beautiful, 
and healthier life for all people and the planet. Through innovation that 
provides excellent value, we share joy and create a safer, more 
harmonious world for all.

The Japanese word kirei describes something that is clean, well-ordered, and beautiful 
all at once. For Kao, this concept of Kirei not only describes appearance but also 
attitude̶a desire to create beauty for oneself, for other people, and for the natural 
world around us. At Kao, Kirei is the value we want to bring to everyday life through 
our brands, products, technologies, solutions, and services̶now and in the future.

The “Kao Way” embodies our corporate philosophy, and is the foundation of the business activities of the Kao Group. As our cornerstone, the “Kao Way” 
provides consistency to Group activities from the formulation of mid- to long-term business plans to each business decision that we make every day. 
Accordingly, it acts as a guiding principle for all of our members, bringing together the growth of our company and that of our individual members. As such, 
it is an essential element in making the work we do more rewarding and instilling in us a sense of purpose.

Kao Group companies and members share the “Kao Way” not merely as a manual or set of rules but as a foundation from which we are able to determine 
both the value of our work and the concerns that we face.

■ Mission

To be closest to the individual and beyond their 
expectation
By deeply knowing and understanding our world and its people, we 
aim to improve people’s lives beyond their expectations for a future 
where humans and nature thrive together.

Under the management framework established in 2021, we revised our vision for 2030 from “a company with a global presence” to “Make Kao a company with 
a global presence, valuable to society,” and will pursue sustainable growth by integrating ESG into the core of our management as we work toward this vision.
Our ESG Strategy, the Kirei Lifestyle Plan (KLP) released in April 2019, aims to enrich the lives of consumers, and as such is an ESG Strategy shaped from the 
consumer’s point of view and unique to Kao.
Through ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri based on the KLP, our ESG Strategy will lead to realizing sustainability for society and increased corporate value.

Philosophy supporting Kao’s 
ESG activities

The Kao Way
Since our founding, we have made it our mission to 
contribute to sustainability through our business 
activities. The Kao Way, our corporate philosophy, 
was updated in July 2021. In it, we define our mission 
as follows: “As one Kao, we work together with 
passion to provide comprehensive care and 
enrichment to create a Kirei life̶a cleaner, more 
beautiful, and healthier life for all people and the 
planet. Through innovation that provides excellent 
value, we share joy and create a safer, more 
harmonious world for all.”

Kao Group Mid-term Plan K25 and Long-term 
Vision K30
We have integrated ESG into the core of our 
management in order to make Kao a company with a 
global presence, valuable to society, as defined in 
What Kao Aims to Be by 2030 in our Long-Term 
Vision K30. The three objectives of K30 are (1) to 
become an essential company in a sustainable world, 
(2) to be a high-profit global company that also 
significantly contributes to society and (3) to provide 
returns to stakeholders according to levels of growth. 
We envision these goals resulting in sales of 2.5 
trillion yen. Developing our business for the purpose 
of benefiting society will grow our business as a 
result, and we will return the profits to society.
 We announced the Kao Group Mid-term Plan 
2025 (K25), which is focused on achieving K30, in 
December 2020. With the vision of “Sustainability as 
the only path” and the concept of “Kirei̶Making Life 
Beautiful,” K25 sets three objectives: (1) Become an 
essential company in a sustainable world, (2) 
Transform to build robust business through 
investment and (3) Maximize the power and potential 
of employees.
 To signal our resolve to implement ESG-driven 
management to achieve K25 on our journey to 2030, 
we have defined the ESG goals of “zero waste / 

Kao’s Corporate Philosophy

P8

carbon zero” for E, “one and only personalization” for 
S, and “one team with integrity” for G. We will build 
business with our new focus of “Save lives, protect 
people,” and undertake this effort in collaboration 
with like-minded stakeholders.

Kirei Lifestyle Plan, Kao’s ESG Strategy
Our ESG Strategy, the KLP, expresses the direction we 
are taking with specific ESG activities that put 
consumers in the driver’s seat as well as our 
ambitions for the future. The KLP consists of Kao’s 
ESG Vision and Kao’s ESG Commitments and Actions 
to achieve this vision.

Kao’s ESG Vision
Kao’s ESG Vision is based on the concept that our 
ESG activities are designed to help people around the 
world live more sustainably and benefit the wider 
society and the Earth.
 Our value of “walking the right path” is presented 
as the foundation of our ESG activities and embodies 
one of the core tenets of our founder Tomiro Nagase, 
“Good fortune is only given to those who work 
diligently and behave with integrity.”

Kao’s ESG Commitments and Actions
The KLP includes three main pillars connected to 
enriching the lives of people, namely “Making my 
everyday more beautiful,” “Making thoughtful choices 
for society,” and “Making the world healthier & 
cleaner.” “Walking the right path” is the foundation 
that supports these pillars.
 Kao Actions, our priority action themes, are set for 
each pillar as well as our 2030 Commitments, our 
ambitious goals to achieve by 2030.
 We believe that achieving K25 looking ahead to 
our vision for 2030 in the areas of society and the 
environment, where global-scale upheavals are 
anticipated, will require our resolve to transform 
ourselves to help bring positive transformation to 
society. As the importance of governance is growing, 
we will further strengthen the effectiveness of our 
governance in line with our core value of “walking the 
right path.”
 Individual mid- to long-term targets have also 
been set for each of the 19 Kao Actions to facilitate 
effective and reliable activities.

Business growth through the 
realization of the Kirei Lifestyle

K25 is based on the approach of developing our 
business for the purpose of benefiting society, and 
achieving business growth as a result. We believe that 

the lives of consumers and to society and 
environmental sustainability will allow us to gain the 
trust of consumers and a wide range of stakeholders, 
earn a strong reputation, and contribute to increasing 
our corporate brand value.
 One of Kao Actions, “Purpose driven brands,” 
strengthens brands’ reason for existing as well as 
contributes to product brand value. One example of 
the actions is the launch of sales of the brand MyKirei 
by KAO in the U.S in 2020 with the purpose of 
realizing the Kirei Lifestyle. The brand fully mobilizes 
technologies born from our Essential Research and 
offers a portfolio of products made with our 
exceptional considerations for the environment and 
society. Going forward, we plan to expand the brand’s 
availability in stages in Europe, Japan and other 
countries in Asia.
 The new Kao Group Mid-term Plan K25 as well as 
our new management framework and internal structure 
to implement K25 put in place in 2021 will further 
strengthen our purpose-driven, ESG-driven 
Yoki-Monozukuri. We believe that this will lead to Kao 
becoming an essential company in a sustainable world, 
development of business linked to contributing to a 
sustainable world, and business growth as a result.

our ESG actions taken with the goal of enriching the 
lives of consumers and realizing a sustainable world 
will result in business growth and creation of a cycle 
where generated profit is returned to stakeholders, 
consumers and the wider society. The KLP is the main 
driver to achieve this management vision, and ESG is 
therefore positioned as investment and the basis for 
our future finances.
 It is said that technological innovations are needed 
to address the severe social issues we are facing in 
the modern era and realize a sustainable world. We 
are focusing on Yoki-Monozukuri as the basis for the 
innovative solutions we offer, and we believe that 
ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri, which combines 
innovative technologies grounded in our Essential 
Research, will support our sustainable growth and 
can have transformative impacts on people, the wider 
society and the Earth.
 We will deepen our existing three business fields, 
Cleanliness, Health and Beauty, and expand their 
boundaries based on the KLP, thereby amplifying our 
transformative impacts on society, and at the same 
time, achieving business growth. Our plan to build our 
business with the new focus of “Save lives, protect 
people” set forth in K25 is part of this.
 The KLP will also contribute to increasing our 
corporate brand value and product brand value. The 
spirit of the KLP is also integrated into our products, 
campaigns, programs, communications and other 
activities. We believe that contributing to enriching

A Kirei Lifestyle means living a beautiful life inside and 
out.
A Kirei Lifestyle is full of compassion.
Where making your own life clean and beautiful never 
compromises the beauty and cleanliness of the world 
around you.

Kao’s ESG Vision

A Kirei Lifestyle is enjoying today, with the peace of 
mind that those joys will be there tomorrow.
It’s the chance to express who you truly are, with the 
confidence that you are walking the right path. Even 
in the smallest, everyday moments.
That’s why, at Kao, everything we do is in service of 

this lifestyle.
It’s why we do what is right, not what is easy.
We put our innovation and imagination to the task of 
enriching lives by finding ways for people the world 
over to live the Kirei Lifestyle.

Selection process for the Kao Actions as material themes

Kao selected the 19 Kao Actions in the Kao ESG Commitments and Actions through the following four steps.

Objectives of selecting the Kao Actions
1.  Targeted action in view of changing social circumstances and issues, and the 

changing expectations for Kao
2.  Strategic implementation of ESG activities based on Kao policy and changes in 

business environment and strategy
3.  Efficient investment and effective use of management resources

Selection process

Selection of Kao Actions implemented in 2018
1. Identification of candidate themes
1.1 Making a list of candidate themes
We used the following to help identify candidate themes:
• ISO 26000

• GRI Standards

• Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

• Evaluation items used by ESG assessment bodies

• Global mega-trends

• In-house workshops

• Materiality at other companies

• Third-party opinions

As a result of this process, 78 candidate themes (17 
environmental, 37 social and 24 governance) were 
selected.

1.2 Top management interviews
We held interviews with eight members of top 
management including representative directors, 
directors and managing executive officers, and 
compiled their thoughts and requests regarding Kao’s 
ESG Strategy.

1.3 Region-based workshops
Using a workshop format in the regions of Asia, the 
Americas and Europe, we identified activities that 
would simultaneously satisfy business needs, 
sustainability needs and customer and consumer 
needs from the viewpoint of our operational sites. We 
then identified elements in those activities that serve 
becoming a company with a global presence.

2. Prioritization
Of the 78 candidate themes identified in 1.1, we 
asked some external stakeholders and employees to 
rate their priority in growing our business and 
increasing our corporate value.

Evaluator attributes
•  External stakeholders: 32 (21 Japanese, 11 non-

Japanese)

•  Employees: 71 (39 Japanese, 32 non-Japanese)

External stakeholders who provided evaluations fall under 

the following groups:

• Consumers / customers

• Suppliers

• Local community members

• NGO / NPO representatives

• Academics

• Industry body / same industry representatives

• Shareholders / investors

We then organized the results of their evaluations in the Matrix of Materiality, which maps materiality along two 
axes: priority for stakeholders and priority for Kao.

The ESG Promotion Meeting, attended by division 
leaders, reviewed materiality based on the results of 
the evaluations and third-party opinions, and then 
selected the 19 Kao Actions.
 Themes that were not included in the Kao Actions 
despite being relatively highly rated in the evaluations 
will be managed and implemented under a separate 
organization. For instance, “Disaster preparation and 
reconstruction assistance” was highly rated externally. 
These themes have been and will continue to be 
implemented under the Responsible Care Promotion 
Committee.

3. Validation
The ESG Committee (now ESG Managing Committee) 
reviewed the 19 Kao Actions selected in the ESG 
Promotion Meeting, and the Board of Directors 
approved them.
 Based on this, divisions set their own targets and 
action plans to conduct ESG activities.

4. Review
The 19 Kao Actions will be periodically reviewed and 
revised using the selection steps 1 to 3. In addition, 
the actions are reviewed each year at a meeting of the 
ESG External Advisory Board.

ESG governance structure

We are building an ESG governance structure to realize more 
flexible and robust ESG activities so that we strengthen our 
resilience to the major changes taking place globally and 
ensure expansion of business opportunities. Characteristics 
of this structure include an organization with outside 
committee member participation that functions to provide 
oversight and advice, and the swift and targeted 
implementation of management decisions broken down into 
innovation and initiatives. 
 Our ESG governance structure functions under the Board 
of Directors and consists of the President and CEO and 
subordinate organizations. The ESG Managing Committee 
discusses and decides the direction of activities related to the 
ESG Strategy, and reports the status of activities to the Board of 
Directors. Comprising outside experts, the ESG External 
Advisory Board provides external viewpoints that are input into 
our ESG activities. The ESG Promotion Meeting works to 
achieve the ESG Strategy, and the ESG Task Force proposes 
activities for focus themes, while divisions implement activities.
 The ESG Managing Committee consists of members of 
the management team, and the ESG Promotion Meeting is 
attended by the heads of business divisions, regions, and 
functional and corporate divisions. These bodies are able to 

make swift management decisions on ESG matters, and the 
structure enables divisions to advance ESG activities. 
 To ensure that actions are quickly taken for priority issues, 
ESG Steering Committees were setup for the first time in 2022 in 
four key areas. The priority issues are decarbonization, plastic 
packaging, human rights and DE&I, and chemical stewardship. 
Under the committee owners, who are executive officers, the 
steering committees coordinate with the ESG Managing 
Committee and have the ability to make suggestions to divisions 
and group companies. We are building effective governance and 
integrating ESG into division policies, targets and plans by having 
divisions engage in ESG-driven operations based on divisions 
taking management responsibility and reporting lines in the 
organization. Divisions also conduct these operations for global 
Kao Group companies, with individual group companies 
conducting activities as appropriate according to the content.
 The ESG External Advisory Board is made up of external 
experts who provide advice and suggestions to issues raised 
by the ESG Managing Committee and offer outside 
viewpoints that are input into management.
 While the actions taken across the ESG promotion structure 
basically relate to all aspects of ESG, placing a primary focus on 
KLP actions drives strategic ESG implementation.
 Through this ESG governance structure, we gain an 
understanding of our global ESG activities and make 

management decisions on strategy, investments and other 
matters based on their impact on our business and society.
 In this way, we are interlinking the activities of the ESG 
Managing Committee, the ESG Promotion Meeting and the 
ESG Steering Committees, connecting the activities of the 
responsible divisions for the 19 Kao Actions and other 
divisions, and incorporating ESG activities into divisions 
including their global operations.
 In 2021, we introduced and began using a new evaluation 
framework that includes ESG perspectives. In the framework, 
called Objectives and Key Results (OKR)*, all employees 
including executive officers set a portion of their total targets 
as ESG targets, and they are evaluated based on the degree of 
challenge in the undertaken activities. Using this system is 
anticipated to result in all employees working together to 
tackle ESG issues and ramp up the level of activity.
* An objectives management system

Implementing the Kao Actions in the KLP
•  The responsible divisions design the details of the 

respective actions, devise the mid- to long-term 
targets, regularly consolidate data on division 
progress and manage company-wide progress.

•  The target divisions devise and implement their 
division targets and activity plan for each action.

ESG promotion at divisions
•  Each division creates its promotion structure. They 

devise their division targets and activity plan, and 
implement the PDCA cycle.

•  The progress of division activities is reported to the 
ESG Promotion Meeting, which then gives the 
divisions feedback including requests to revise plans.

•  Global implementation by divisions is the general 
rule, with support for implementation by individual 
Kao Group companies provided as needed.

•  The members of the ESG Promotion Meeting in 
each division give direction and guidance on 
incorporating the company-wide ESG Strategy 
into division strategy.

•  The level of ESG activities is ramped up by linking 
them with the OKR framework.

Over the three years I have been on the ESG External 

Advisory Board, Kao’s commitment to doing the right thing 

and solving problems that matter has been ever present.  

Across all of our interactions, there has been an abundance 

of science, facts, diligence and innovation that is refreshingly 

believable and confidence building. Whether I am working 

with the CEO, an executive or a regular hard-working 

member of staff, it is the same. Those qualities are in Kao’s 

cultural DNA in a way that seems effortless. 

It probably has a lot to do with its 135-year commitment to 

the values represented in the Kao Way. Not many companies 

maintain their founding values as they grow into a large 

global company. Most corporate cultures lose their way, 

forgetting what they believe in and what they stand for in the 

relentless pursuit of growth and narrow view of success. Kao 

has very uniquely held onto its values, and in the 21st century 

that is a huge competitive advantage.

Over the course of 2021 and with an almost limitless amount 

to do, impressive progress has been made to make the Kirei 

Lifestyle Plan a reality. Highlights include:

•  A holistic approach to decarbonization, zero waste and zero 

landfill targets̶demonstrating Kao’s commitment to 

operating in full harmony with nature; 

•  New and assertive efforts that go beyond preservation to 

focus on rebuilding biodiversity in product design, 

development and operations;

•  A step change in the emphasis on circular economy 

activities;

•  New forms of multi-stakeholder collaboration to increase 

positive environmental and social impact, including 

unprecedented collaborations with competitors;

•  Serious reflection on opportunities for greater progress 

with diversity, equity and inclusion targets; and

•  A diligent, smart and hard-working ESG team that is 

asking great questions and digging for answers in a 

collaborative and highly cooperative spirit.

It is clear that leaders at Kao are not just working toward 

incremental improvements. They are fundamentally looking 

for ways to wire the company to do exponentially more. To go 

beyond words to a place of ESG mindset and psychology. 

This is reinforced by the enormous effort currently underway 

to realign the company’s strategic planning for Objectives 

and Key Results (OKR). While it will take several planning 

cycles for this way of working to become second nature, it 

gives me great comfort that the ambitious targets set will 

have a chance to deliver at a very practical level.

The area of opportunity that will not be a surprise is time-to-

market. R&D breakthroughs and innovations already available 

to Kao that solve real-world human health, safety and 

wellness issues cannot come fast enough. Finding new ways 

to clear the path to market will be key to successful delivery 

of the K25 plan.

In everything I have had the chance to review and assess, it 

is clear that Kao is poised for a next-level trajectory of 

innovation, brand distinction and sustainable growth. It has 

been a privilege to be part of the Advisory Board together 

with Ms. Rika Sueyoshi. I am thoroughly excited about the 

portfolio innovations in Kao’s pipeline and have confidence 

that they will accelerate the strategic repositioning of Reborn 

Kao and open the new markets promised by Another Kao.

Feedback from Kao  

about last year’s message

In 2021, there was a request for us to take a more 

active approach in broadly communicating the 

concept, vision and objectives of the KLP both 

inside and outside the Kao Group. We introduced 

the OKR system to reform employee awareness 

about tackling challenges and increase the 

transparency of our ESG activities internally. 

Through this, we aim to markedly improve 

awareness for company-wide and individual ESG 

initiatives, and for our employees to more actively 

communicate and share targets and ideas and have 

them be more quickly achieved with fewer barriers. 

Going forward, we will regularly verify the progress 

of the OKRs and foster a corporate culture where 

new challenges are undertaken to achieve the Kirei 

Lifestyle around the world.

We will also further expand opportunities to 

form alliances and partnerships with outside groups 

in order to share our ESG targets and 

commitments.

The year 2021 was yet another challenging year for people 

around the world. While the concentration of carbon dioxide 

in the atmosphere has risen, plastic increasingly flows out to 

the ocean, and deforestation also continues apace, COVID-19 

has also caused poverty and starvation to worsen. Even in 

these dispiriting times, Kao has spent this year taking steps to 

execute its Kirei Lifestyle Plan (KLP) with enhanced drive and 

positivity. Even from my position as a member of the ESG 

External Advisory Board, seeing Kao employees working with 

sincerity to tackle challenges has been a moving experience.

First, what left an impression on me in 2021 was the 

announcement of the Supply Chain ESG Promotion 

Guidelines*, which create a higher level of engagement for 

Kao’s actions on the environment and human rights. After 

defining suppliers with inadequate due diligence in the areas 

of human rights and the environment as high risk, Kao 

prioritizes third-party audits of them. The potential suspension 

of business is raised in the case of violations of the supply 

chain guidelines, and at the same time, not only a strict 

suspension of business but also holding trainings for 

suppliers in coordination with NGOs. It is also a fact that 

many Japanese companies are now using Kao as their 

benchmarking standard in palm oil procurement 

management. I would like to give high marks to Kao for these 

points in particular. However, due diligence for overseas 

plantations that have multiple customers apart from Kao is 

not easy, and an ongoing period of trial and error to realize 

effective implementation of the guidelines will be necessary. 

To lead the world, it is important to use your company’s 

influence for example to achieve zero instances of human 

rights violations among suppliers (as a whole). The supply 

chain guidelines are a tool to achieve this kind of company-

led rule creation. As the skillful way the supply chain 

guidelines are put together allows us to now see whether a 

company’s activities are good or not, I am confident that this 

will lead to Kao earning the support of more consumers in 

the future due to requiring full transparency.

Next, to achieve carbon neutrality, new packaging initiatives 

that boost the velocity of eliminating the use of plastic bottles 

are incredibly important. Even looking around the world, only 

a few places are currently developing packaging based not 

on the concept of recycling but of reducing resource use. For 

packaging recycling, an essential first step to realizing a 

resource-circulating society is beginning to work together 

with local governments, competing companies, retailers and 

others instead of working alone. Going forward, I hope to see 

Kao focus on creating ways to spark change in social 

systems while working together with partners in wide-

ranging sectors and sharing its expertise.

While many Japanese companies are just trying to minimize 

the negative impacts of climate change, Kao’s visionary 

management plan thoroughly embodies the high-level 

concepts in the KLP and makes consumers the leading actor, 

which is truly unique to and characteristic of Kao. 

Meanwhile, to deliver the experience of things being good 

for you and good for the world in a real sense to consumers, 

all products and services that Kao offers need to eliminate 

external diseconomy (negative externality). It must be said 

that many things remain to be done to achieve this.

The word “compassionate” can be found throughout the 

Kirei Lifestyle Plan. I replace “compassionate” with “ethical” 

in my mind, but an even easier way to understand this idea is 

to connect it to the three correlated values care, share and 

fair. Seen through the lens of cultural anthropology, 99% of 

economic activity in the history of humankind has been 

based on the values of care, share and fair. Kao has 135 

years of history, and I look forward to seeing Kao become a 

leader embodying these three values.

Feedback from Kao  

about last year’s message

The 2021 message contained expectations for us to 

become a leader in creating a sustainable future 

based on full transparency and information 

disclosure. On this point, we have led our industry 

in releasing our Supply Chain ESG Promotion 

Guidelines*, and together with suppliers have 

strengthened initiatives to ensure traceability 

throughout the entire supply chain, conserve 

resources and the environment, ensure safety, and 

solve social issues such as human rights issues. 

Going forward, we will ascertain risks through 

dialogue at local sites, conduct initiatives to solve 

issues together with suppliers and NGOs, and 

release information on the progress we make.

Entering the third year of involvement as a member of the 

Kao Corporation ESG External Advisory Board, I am 

constantly amazed by the sincerity of Kao Corporation in 

upholding its sustainability principles and policies. It is clear 

that Kao Corporation understands the expectations of its 

global stakeholders, and has demonstrated performance that 

has not only met expectations but also, in several important 

respects, has exceeded those expectations.

As a member of the Advisory Board with a particular interest 

in issues related to climate change, I can state that Kao 

Corporation has provided excellent responses to the issues I 

raised throughout 2021.

In early 2021, I expressed my expectation that Kao 

Corporation would achieve, even exceed, its previous targets 

for climate change mitigation in response to further 

requirements from stakeholders, while sustaining high-level 

ESG performance on other material issues. Not only were 

expectations related to mitigation met, Kao even responded 

by formulating new targets to realize a decarbonized society 

and boldly declared that it would aim for zero carbon by 2040 

and achieve carbon negative status by 2050.

This target makes Kao Corporation one of the companies 

with the most ambitious targets among companies in the 

same industry. In order to achieve this goal, Kao Corporation 

has upgraded its target certification that was awarded by the 

Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to the 1.5°C target, 

which is strictly in accordance with the Paris Agreement as 

well as the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC.

Kao Corporation is also a member of RE100, an international 

initiative that brings together business operators to commit 

to the use of 100% renewable electricity. Thus, I believe, Kao 

Corporation will be able to continue developing products, 

services and technologies that contribute to the reduction of 

CO2 emissions throughout society and endeavor to achieve 

its climate goals.

However, as I have said, the expectations expressed are not 

only related to performance in dealing with climate change. 

On other issues, Kao Corporation has very clearly 

demonstrated performance that also exceeds expectations. 

Proof of this can be seen in Kao Corporation again being 

awarded a Triple A rating from CDP for Climate Change, 

Forests and Water Security. There are only 14 companies 

around the world who managed to get this rating in 2021, 

and of course this is a very proud achievement.

Several other awards Kao Corporation has received are also a 

sign of its commitment to sustainability, including maintaining 

its position on the FTSE4Good Index since 2008, the MSCI 

Leaders Index since 2017, the Ethibel Sustainability Index (ESI) 

Global Excellence since 2007, the Euronext Vigeo World 120 

Index since 2017, and many others that could be mentioned.

But Kao Corporation definitely will not be satisfied with its 

achievements to date. What makes me strongly believe that 

Kao Corporation will continue to improve its sustainability 

performance̶in social, environmental and governance 

aspects̶is the commitment of those who work for this 

company. As someone who has worked with many 

companies, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, I know that 

Kao Corporation has top and middle management teams 

who are fully committed to sustainability.

Feedback from Kao  

about last year’s message

The 2021 message contained expectations for us to 

maintain our high level of ESG activities while taking 

in additional requests from stakeholders and achieving 

ambitious targets to mitigate climate change. Last 

year, we established new targets for realizing a 

decarbonized society, and pledged to achieve net zero 

carbon emissions by 2040 and become carbon 

negative by 2050. With a focus on achieving these 

targets, we raised our emission reduction target to the 

1.5ºC level recommended by the Science Based 

Targets initiative (SBTi), and we are also participating 

in the international RE100 initiative, which seeks to 

have 100% of electricity used in business be 

generated from renewable energy. Going forward, we 

will also strive to achieve these targets by developing 

products, services and technologies that contribute to 

reducing CO2 emissions throughout society at large.

On the way to a sustainable future with a concept, a 
compass and concrete activities 
When it comes to concepts for achieving sustainability and 

circularity, it is worth looking back at wise people. The future 

depends on what we do today, Mahatma Gandhi said. 

Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals today requires 

initiative and courage. In this sense, Kao is a pioneer. To meet 

the major challenges of our time, such as climate change or 

supply chain management, and to successfully assume 

responsibility, companies need a sustainability-oriented 

compass that involves all employees. Kao is implementing 

this compass successively in dialogue and in an exemplary 

manner. Examples seen in 2021 include the renewal of Kao 

Group’s corporate philosophy, the Kao Way, and the revision 

of its corporate slogan, “Kirei̶Making Life Beautiful.” Good 

steps have been taken with the start of implementation of 

OKR activities by all global employees. 

Kao clearly addresses the desire for change in practice 
with its activities regarding raw materials
A good example is plastic or the plastic recycling activities for 

PET. From a global perspective, only a very small proportion 

of plastics have been used in a circular process to date. 

However, the development of PET plastics shows that 

circularity is possible. The topics of resource utilization and a 

circular economy are of central importance: Today, we do not 

know what happens to 90% of the materials, namely 90 

billion tons/year, that our throwaway society moves after use. 

Also, of the roughly 10 billion tons we know about, only 15% 

are part of the world’s global industrial raw materials, for 

which circular systems at least partly exist today (steel, paper, 

plastics, etc.). 

In a competitive market economy, Kao is driving change 

through networking activities. The described collaborations of 

2021 with other active companies in the branch 

(competitors), local governments and distributors are the 

direction to go. Activities such as collection and recycling of 

plastic packaging and containers, participation in recycling 

demonstration experiments, horizontal recycling of bottles 

and film containers and horizontal recycling of refill packs 

create an important foundation for the upcoming scaling 

tasks at the national level. 

Kao is a company in the plastics value chain. Structured 

and intensive dialogue in this chain is essential to the 

success of the desired paradigm shift. Using plastics as an 

example again, I would like to highlight four key areas of 

action that stakeholders such as Kao, an important industry 

player and frontrunner, can support in their respective roles 

addressing the technical, social, economic and 

environmental opportunities and challenges that this shift 

will bring: (re)organizing the plastics industry for circularity; 

making closed-loop recycling the responsibility of all 

stakeholders; creating regulatory incentives for a circular 

plastics economy; and designing products for circularity.

Kao is engaged at the different levels mentioned
On the one hand, there are the first very concrete individual 

measures such as starting to use 100% recycled plastic and 

chemical recycling of PET materials in product packaging 

and containers.  

On the other hand, there is the formulation of 

overarching long-term commitments such as the setting of 

new targets for decarbonization: zero carbon by 2040, 

negative carbon status by 2050 and support of Science 

Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to fulfill the 1.5°C target of the 

Paris Agreement.

Feedback from Kao  

about last year’s message

The 2021 message contained expectations for us to 

lead the creation of systems and become a game 

changer through our activities to realize plastic 

circularity for packaging and other plastics, as the 

responsibility of a company that offers household 

products. On this point, we have been conducting 

an initiative to collect and recycle plastics in 

collaboration with other companies in our industry, 

retailers, local governments and others, and are 

implementing horizontal recycling of plastic bottles 

and film type packaging. Going forward, we aim to 

expand the area where this initiative operates in 

collaboration with a greater number of partners and 

achieve Innovation in Recycling.

Employee engagement

We believe that it is essential that all Kao employees 
identify with and implement the Kirei Lifestyle vision, 
both as consumers and as employees, in order to 
achieve the goals set forth in K25 and our ESG 
Strategy, the KLP. For this reason, we continue to take 
steps to cultivate employee engagement, providing 
employees with information and inspiration that have 
the potential to take action on their part. In 2021, we 
improved and expanded the content of a program for 
employees to obtain the knowledge and globally-
minded approach that is required to implement ESG-
driven Yoki-Monozukuri. As a new initiative, we 
launched a project to gather and disseminate 
employees’ thoughts on and hopes for the Kirei 
Lifestyle.

Learning the “why” through the Kirei Lifestyle 
Plan Caravan
The Kirei Lifestyle Plan Caravan was conducted from 
2019 to 2020 primarily for divisions in Japan with the 
aim of deepening understanding of why Kao is 
pivoting to ESG-driven management. In 2021, we 
began holding Leadership Dialogue sessions with 
business leaders in other Asian countries, thereby 
fully launching the dissemination of such 
communication to all Kao Group companies in Asia. 
Through online sessions with key persons in each 
country, we have introduced the educational content 
and communication tools that have been developed 
for global use so far, aiming to further activate local 
employee engagement measures.
 Leveraging the shift to a predominantly remote 
working style due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we 
revised instructional video content developed in 2020 
to reflect the latest updates. The video covers several 
topics such as global trends surrounding ESG, the 
impact and significance of ESG on Kao’s business, and 
Kao’s potential opportunities for societal 
transformation, as well as a discussion from the Senior 
Vice President of Kao’s ESG Division on why Kao has 
pivoted to ESG-driven management and providing an 
overview of the KLP. The video is available in 
Japanese, English and Chinese, and is included in the 
training program for new global employees to ensure 
that the content is regularly incorporated in employee 
education.

Empowering all employees with the knowledge 
to create a foundation for the “how” in 
implementing the KLP
As a follow-up measure subsequent to studying the “why” 
in the Kirei Lifestyle Plan Caravan, since 2020 we have been 
developing the Kirei Lifestyle Plan Lecture, an e-learning 
program providing the knowledge needed to implement the 
KLP. The purpose of this program is to further educate 
employees about the background information of the Kao 
Actions in the KLP and related knowledge, about global 
perspectives and criteria, and about Kao’s activities, in order 
to better implement the KLP.
 To date, we have created a program on Decarbonization 
that was made available on our globally accessible 
e-learning platform. Following Decarbonization, in 2021 we 
developed and launched programs in Japanese and English 
on Lifecycle Assessment, Zero Waste and Water 
Conservation, which are foundational elements of our 
environmental actions, and a program on Human Rights, an

programs consist of short, ten-minute chapters filled with 
engaging elements that allow employees to easily study 
them throughout the course of their daily work. The 
programs cover not only general knowledge, but also the 
significance for Kao, and areas that should be addressed.
 As a result, the Kirei Lifestyle Plan Lecture has been 
offered in individual divisions in Japan as well as in 
other Asian countries, Europe and the Americas, 
resulting in the Japanese and English programs being 
viewed a total of 10,000 times.

Honing information sensitivity to ESG topics 
among all employees
Since December 2020, the ESG Trends Newsletter has 
been published every month on our internal portal, 
and e-mail distribution is being rolled out in phases 
globally to guarantee its communication to all 
employees. Designed to inspire the advancement of 
ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri, the newsletter features 
information on the latest ESG trends globally 
including perspectives from Europe, the Americas and 
Asia, as well as ESG activities at Kao Group locations 
and a message from the Senior Vice President of the 
ESG Division touching on the context of internal and 
external trends.
 New content featuring thoughts from leaders and 
employees from the genba, who take actions daily to 
achieve the Kirei Lifestyle has also been developed 
and is being communicated globally through the ESG 
Trends Newsletter. We have received messages of 
support from employees in Japan as well as Asia, 
Europe and the Americas. 
 As a result of these activities, the ESG Trends 
Newsletter is read by approximately 6,000 employees 
each month, who have provided feedback such as 
“It’s encouraging,” “I learned a lot” and “It has 
inspired me to be more proactive in ESG initiatives.”
 Going forward, we will carry out a questionnaire 
on our awareness-raising and communication tools 
for employees within and outside Japan, to identify 
issues and make further improvements. We will also 
plan and implement inclusive engagement activities, 

aiming to lead employees to take actions aligned with 
ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri.

My dream is for all employees to become 
Kirei Ambassadors

Employees’ voice

The key to becoming a company truly essential to a 
sustainable society is for all employees to embrace the 
Kirei Lifestyle vision as consumers themselves and take 
action as Kirei Ambassadors.

To do this, we strive to organize information and 
knowledge in ways that are easy to digest in light of 
rapidly shifting global ESG trends, with the aim of serving 
as a source of inspiration for all employees. We compile 
and release video messages and photos from our valuable 
employees around the world about their own views on the 
Kirei Lifestyle with hopes of fostering a sense of unity and 
increasing ESG engagement.

In doing this, we have received feedback from 
employees about how they have been inspired to learn 
about ESG as a community, understand it and become 
more actively involved in ESG measures. We will continue 
to adapt and innovate employee engagement measures as 
required and to encourage employees to become Kirei 
Ambassadors.

Mid- to long-term targets

Individual mid- to long-term targets are set for each of the 19 Kao Actions. Based on the mid- to long-term targets, divisions set sub-targets aligned with their business 
activities and conduct activities based on their plan.
To make even more contributions to society through our activities, in 2021 we continued to revise these targets through the ESG Managing Committee and ESG Promotion 
Meeting. As a result of this, we have added new targets and revised some of our mid- to long-term targets. The applicable targets are noted in the table.
We were not able to present some of the 2021 results due to delays in establishing the evaluation methods or framework for collecting results. For these targets, our 
anticipated timing for releasing the information is noted in the table. As described on p. 373–375 we set indicators for the three commitments in 2021, are gathering 
performance data starting in 2022, and will release the information in 2023.

Beneficial effects on business
1. Business growth
Beneficial effects of products made with 
sustainability in mind
In Consumer products, the 2021 sales ratio of 
products displaying the “eco together” logo 
(consumer products in Japan) was 29%, an increase 
of 1% from 28% in 2020. Our consumer business in 
Japan saw sales decline 5.3%, from 811.0 billion yen 
to 768.1 billion yen. While it did not lead to an 
increase in our overall sales, ethical consumption is 
expanding and our environmentally friendly products 
made a definite contribution to sales. 
 In addition to environmental areas, we also 
conducted activities in social areas that contributed to 
business in 2021. For example, we launched a product 
based on universal product design that contributed to 
business growth. With one pull of the lever creating a 
long-lasting spray, Bath Magiclean Airjet makes it 
easier to do housework and saves time. This product 
has successfully expanded its market share.
 Chemical actively rolled out ESG-focused products 
again in 2021. For example, its asphalt modifier to 
improve durability that uses waste PET contributes to 
environmental conservation not only by recycling 
waste PET but also by extending the life of roads 
approximately five-fold. Launched in December 2020, 
uptake of the product by distributors and local 

governments expanded in 2021, and we project that it 
will also contribute to business growth going forward.

2. Cost reductions
Economic effects as a result of environmental 
conservation measures
We received an economic benefit of 4.5 billion yen in 
2021. The largest factor was resource conservation, 
which contributed 2.9 billion yen.

3. Risk reductions
The global COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout 
2021, and with the emergence of highly contagious 
variants, our business connected to people going out 
and inbound demand was impacted.
 Meanwhile, during the pandemic we implemented 
rigorous risk management measures, continued to 
produce sanitizer and hygiene products, and were 
able to capture business opportunities based on our 
ESG Strategy, which also enabled us to control 
company-wide risks.

4. Increased credibility
In March 2022, we were selected for the list of the 
World’s Most Ethical Companies 2022® by the U.S. 
think-tank Ethisphere Institute. We have been named 
to the list 16 straight years since the award’s inception 
in 2007. We are the only Japanese company, and the 
only manufacturer of fast-moving consumer goods 
and chemicals in the world, to be honored for 16 
consecutive years.
 This recognition reflects the fact that the spirit of 
Integrity passed down from our founder continues to 
be implemented by all Kao Group members in day-to-
day operations through practice of the Kao Way and 
the Kao Business Conduct Guidelines.

Beneficial effects on society
The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have 
continued to be felt around the world in 2021, and we 
have deepened and expanded our initiatives 
accordingly. We have expanded our fun education 
program and campaigns to have children acquire 
good hygiene habits in order to help protect them 
from infection. Based on the hand-washing lessons 
that employees in Japan go out to schools to teach, 
we developed a new program that can be conducted 
independently by a greater number of schools, and 
this has now been launched. We also created and 
launched a new version of the same program for 
schools for the deaf. In the U.S., the hand-washing 
campaign we conducted was also covered by

 The use of mass COVID-19 vaccination sites 
increased around the world in 2021. Mass vaccination 
sites opened in Japan as well, and hygiene 
management at the venues was a challenge. We 
therefore harnessed our expertise in hygiene 
management for medical settings to create a manual 
and propose hygiene management plans, which were 
used by a large number of local governments. In the 
U.S., Kao Specialties Americas LLC opened a drive-
thru vaccination clinic at the request of the local 
government to contribute to the community.
 We expanded our activity to provide product kits 
free of charge to medical practitioners working to 
treat infectious diseases that we began in Japan in 
2020 to deliver them to a greater number of people in 
2021, and also began the activity in Indonesia.
 If we can make the impacts we have on society 
visible, it will lead to a higher level of dialogue 
between the operating companies and investors, a 
higher level of activity, and increased corporate value. 
In 2021, we continued to participate in the ESG 
Disclosure Study Group and deepened discussions on 
how to disclose information on ESG. As there are 
growing calls to quantify corporate value and non-
financial aspects, in 2018 we conducted a trial 
evaluation and converted our social impacts into 
monetary equivalents. In 2021, we continued 
examining the various methods under development 
and review around the world while collecting 

information and performing trial calculations.

Contributions to the SDGs

Looking ahead to 2030, Kao is focused on the SDGs that have been agreed upon and adopted by the international community. As indicators for realizing a sustainable society, 
the SDGs set forth an integrated approach for improving the economy, society and the environment. Contributions by companies are considered extremely important to 
achieving the SDGs.
As indicated below, we are working to address the Kao Action topics set in the Kao ESG Commitments and Actions with the aim of achieving the SDGs.

The Kao Group’s first priority is the health and safety of all our stakeholders, including our customers and our employees and their families, and we are 
working hard to prevent the spread of the virus.
As a company that has engaged in research on cleanliness and hygiene and delivered products in these fields, we make concerted efforts to supply related 
products needed to maintain hygienic living conditions and communicate health-related information useful in daily life together with government agencies, 
scientific and industry associations and related companies, with the goal of safeguarding consumers’ health in their daily lives.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a major 
impact on social and economic activities and how 
people around the world live their lives. While 
vaccination rates have been rising around the world, 
COVID-19 variants have also been spreading and 
repeated waves of infections have occurred in many 
countries and regions. Uncertainty in the business 
environment is expected to continue, with years 
potentially required for the pandemic to fully subside 
and for the global economy to recover.
 Also in terms of how people around the world live 
their lives, we have had to cope with a large number 
of constraints on our daily activities over a long period 
of time, and with the changes to consumption, work 
styles and much more forced on society in general, 
we now find ourselves at a major crossroads. Many 
people are worried about the potential for this 
situation to continue in the future as well.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
By 2030 we aim to be a company with a global 
presence, valuable to society, by achieving both 
sustainable and profitable development and making 
contributions to the sustainability of society. A large 

number of unknown problems such as the emergence 
of variants still need to be solved before we can 
overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, and the uncertainty 
continuing in the business environment is a risk to 
achieving sustainable and profitable development.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Providing expertise and products on cleanliness and 
hygiene for the COVID-19 pandemic and further 
strengthening our capabilities in infection control and 
prevention represent opportunities to make contributions 
to the sustainability of society that will give reassurance 
to many people around the world as they lead their lives.

Kao’s creating value
As a company that has engaged in research on 
cleanliness and hygiene and delivered products in 
these fields, we can make large contributions to 
helping people around the world live their lives with 
greater cleanliness, easier aging, better health and 
confidence in self-expression through the actions we 
take to respond to the pandemic.

Impacts and risks to Kao due to rising COVID-19 
infection rates
Japan is one of our group’s key markets. Its cosmetics 
market was greatly impacted by the repeated state of 
emergency declarations nationwide and is not showing 

a strong recovery.
 The following are risks associated with the 
COVID-19 pandemic and related changes in 
consumers’ behavior. Not taking appropriate 
measures in response could cause net sales and 
profits to deviate significantly from targets.
•  Temporary suspension of operations or obstacles to 

providing products and services due to multiple 
infections (clusters) at Kao Group bases or in the 
supply chain, or due to requests from the national 
and local governments because of highly 
contagious variants or other developments

•  Delays in product development and launch plans 
due to work that cannot be performed remotely

•  Delays in the recovery of the cosmetics market or 
other businesses due to a resurgence of infections 
or prolonged pandemic

•  Lower competitiveness due to inadequate response 
to changes in people’s awareness and values and 
changes in consumer behavior

Policies

As our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are 
holding meetings of the Emergency Response Team 
Headquarters and have set response policies focusing 
on ensuring the safety of employees and their families 
and continuity of business activities, based on the 
response priorities outlined in the Kao Risk and Crisis 
Management Policy (1. Protection of human lives, 2. 
Environmental conservation, 3. Continuation of 
operations, 4. Protection of assets).

Education and promotion

As COVID-19 cases grew and the pandemic became 
prolonged, we communicated common symptoms of 
COVID-19 infections, effective ways to prevent 
infection, information about the efficacy of vaccines 
and other evidence-based information in easy-to-
understand ways via our internal portal site. We also 
worked to build awareness for key actions that should 
be taken both in workplaces and at home, including 
changes to work frameworks and work styles 
depending on infection rates as well as precautions to 
take when traveling and eating, in both work and 
personal life.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders
We have been collaborating with all of our 
stakeholders to help build a society offering greater 
cleanliness and peace of mind, with first priority on 
ensuring safety and health.
•  Coordinating with the national and local 

governments, we have held workplace vaccination 
drives and quickly responded when someone 
became infected or was in close contact with an 
infected person.

•  We have worked with researchers in the field of 
hygiene, medical professionals and other experts to 
mutually improve the quality of our activities by 
sharing information on infection control measures 
based on scientific knowledge.

•  With our business partners, we have conducted 
business activities based on actively sharing and 
discussing our findings related to infection control 
measures, with first priority on ensuring the safety 
and health of customers and employees.

Framework

When a crisis occurs, we evaluate the level of severity 
of the crisis on the basis of its potential group-wide 
impact (designating it as level one, two or three 
depending on the severity of the accident, disaster, 

epidemic, etc. in question), and an organizational 
framework is established to deal with the crisis 
according to the level of severity.
 The global COVID-19 pandemic was designated a 
crisis with the highest severity level of three 
(company-wide impact and impact on Kao’s 
business), and we established the Emergency 
Response Team Headquarters, the Emergency 
Response Team Headquarters Executive Office and 
the Infection Countermeasures Team in February 
2020.
 The Emergency Response Team Headquarters, 
with the President serving as its chair, holds meetings 
to decide the group-wide response policy. The 
Emergency Response Team Headquarters Executive 
Office monitors conditions and the response in our 
group as a whole, while the Infection 
Countermeasures Team establishes and publicizes the 
specific response measures. In July 2020, we 
launched the Infectious Disease Risk Assessment 
Project, through which we communicate evidence-
based infection control measures globally along with 
providing support for strengthened infection control 
measures at local worksites. The Board of Directors 
had responsibility for approving these response 
measures.

Performance in 2021

Performance
We set the emergency level at level 3, the highest 
level, and held Emergency Response Team 
Headquarters meetings (headed by the President) 11 
times to decide our response policies focused on 
ensuring the safety of employees and their families 
and continuity of business activities, and 
implemented them accordingly. The Board of 
Directors had responsibility for approving these 
response measures.

Ensuring the safety of employees and their families
•  As crisis management measures, followed national 

and local government policies, and additionally 
implemented work systems and styles compatible 
with the status of infection (promotion of remote 
work / teleworking, restrictions on business trips, 
restrictions on training / events / tours, etc.)

•  Tracked infections among employees and their 
family members as well as people who were in 
close contact with infected persons, provided care 
for those needing it, and implemented measures 
to prevent cluster infections at global worksites

•  Held workplace vaccination drives for employees 
and their families

•  Strengthened infection control measures in 
countries and regions where cases were rising

Continuity of business activities
•  To maintain the supply chain, implemented higher-

level infection control measures at production sites 
and rolled them out to subcontractors and other 

related parties, in addition to conducting relevant 
activities for raw materials procurement

•  Further expanded the digitalization of operations 
for remote work

•  Revised company systems for new work styles, 
including remote work

•  Conducted business continuity activities by 
strengthening collaboration among group companies

We also conducted the following corporate 
citizenship activities.
•  Continued to provide Kao Group product kits free 

of charge to medical professionals
•  Conducted a new hygiene habits program for 

children in the early grades of elementary school 
(provided educational materials)

•  Through our website, provided information on 
hygiene in daily life, based on the knowledge of 
experts and our own know-how. Also, for 
hygiene researchers, medical professionals, 
public health nurses working at educational 
institutions and other professionals, provided a 
wide range of information, including expert 
knowledge on measures for preventing the 
spread of infection based on academic papers

Improving employees’ awareness and sensitivity
We conducted the following activities for the 
purpose of improving the awareness and sensitivity 
of employees, in relation to the prolonged 
COVID-19 pandemic, on an ongoing basis.
•  Communicated messages to all employees from the 

President linked with crisis management measures
•  Communicated information about vaccine efficacy 

and precautions as well as work support measures
•  Developed a tool that uses a smartphone to evaluate 

infection risk from the number of people using the 
office or meeting room, the ventilation, infection 
control measures and so on, so that employees can 
perform their work with peace of mind

•  Gave all employees a questionnaire on infection 
control measures and provided feedback on key 
points for strengthening individuals’ measures

•  Throughout the year we communicated a range 
of risk-related information as COVID-19 cases 
rose, including on information security, personal 
information protection and compliance 
precautions related to remote work, working 
from home and vaccinations

Reviews of performance
Continuing from last year, we were able to fulfill our 
social responsibility of ensuring the safety of our 
employees and their families and the continuous 
supply of hygiene-related products by swiftly taking 
company-wide actions led by our management 
team. As a company that has engaged in research 
on cleanliness and hygiene and delivered products 
in these fields to society, in addition to continually 
supplying products, we were able to make 
contributions to protecting consumers’ lives by 
communicating useful health-related information.
 Going forward, we aim to protect consumers’ lives 
by continuing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Kao Way embodies our corporate philosophy and is the foundation for our business activities.
As our cornerstone, the Kao Way provides consistency to group activities from the formulation of mid- to long-term business plans to each business decision 
that we make every day. Accordingly, it acts as guiding principles for all of our members, bringing together the growth of our company and that of our 
individual members. As such, it is an essential element in making the work we do more rewarding and instilling in us a sense of purpose.
Kao employees share the Kao Way not as a manual or set of rules but as a foundation from which we are able to determine both the meaning of our work and 
the concerns we share.
In July 2021, the Kao Way was substantially updated for the first time since it was established in 2004.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
Environmental issues are increasing in severity day by 
day. We have contributed to improving people’s daily 
lives by offering household and chemical products, 
but producing goods requires large amounts of 
substances and energy, and large amounts of waste 
are also created in the processes of producing, 
distributing, selling and consuming the goods. There 
is a pressing need to shift our manufacturing from an 
approach driven by consumption to one where 
resources are circulated.
 In addition, to realize the mission set forth in the 
Kao Way, to provide care and enrichment for the life 
of all people and the planet, we must also consider 
solutions to social issues, such as poverty and human 
rights, as well as environmental problems.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
Kao aims to become a company with a global 
presence, valuable to society by 2030.
 This is an ambitious goal and one that will be 

impossible to achieve without all of our diverse 
employees around the world sharing the same 
philosophy and working together as one team based 
on trust. In other words, it will be exceedingly difficult 
to achieve our goal without the Kao Way serving as 
the shared language of all Kao employees.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
A range of social issues have gained broad 
recognition, and in addition to their economic 
activities, companies are being called on to make 
responsible contributions as members of society. To 
achieve our goal of becoming a company with a 
global presence, valuable to society by 2030, we must 
be able to take action on this point.
 The Kao Way also shows us how to be a positively 
contributing member of society. The Kao Way is the 
shared philosophy of employees around the world, 
and as such, the trend in society of expecting 
companies to make positive contributions to society 
represents an excellent opportunity for Kao.

Kao’s creating value
Since our founding, we have always worked with the 

belief of doing everything in our power to make 
society and people’s daily lives better. Put another 
way, we have consistently made efforts to provide 
solutions to the social issues that existed at the time. 
This spirit is also evident in the Kao Way.
 Kao products are used by large numbers of people 
all over the world. Through our products and 
corporate activities, we offer solutions to various ESG 
issues including environmental problems. This is 
Kao’s creating value.

Policies

It is important that the Kao Way not only be known by 
employees, but that employees are able to utilize it as 
the basis for their actions in day-to-day tasks.
 In 2021, the Kao Way was substantially updated 
for the first time since it was established. Without 
changing the core message of the Kao Way, the 
updated Kao Way emphasizes the three elements of 
caring for people and the planet, diversity and 
inclusion, and making bolder moves, in keeping with 
changes in the wider society. To achieve what we aim 
to be by 2030, establishing the updated Kao Way 
throughout the Kao Group is essential.

Education and promotion

The Kao Way communication activities have been 
conducted on a continual basis since the Kao Way 
was published in 2004.
 We have conducted communication programs 
primarily focused on dialogue for all Kao employees for 
the purpose of having the Kao Way be understood, 
supported and reflected in employees’ actions. In 
particular, at the many group companies outside Japan 
where employees have worked for Kao for a relatively 
short time, Kao Way communication activities are 
conducted for the purpose of fostering feelings of unity.
 As the Kao Way was updated in 2021, the Kao 

Head Office is once again encouraging group 
companies to strengthen the Kao Way 
communication activities.
 The Kao Way Team at the Head Office provides a 
standard education program and communication 
tools (documents, videos and other materials). As the 
level of Kao Way establishment and organizational 
issues vary among business sites (group companies 
and divisions), staff in charge of Kao Way 
communication at each group company and division 
lead development and implementation of the 
communication activities for their business site.

Framework

The Kao Way Team at the Head Office resides within 
the Corporate Strategy. This team has the following 
functions and leads global activities to communicate 
the Kao Way.

•  Deciding the policy for Kao Way communication 
activities

•  Proposing the standard education program
•  Providing communication tools
•  Reporting on the progress and results of the Kao 

Way communication activities to top management
• Overseeing the Kao Way
 Kao Way communication activities at group 
companies and divisions are carried out by Kao Way 
staff at each business site. Based on information from 
the Kao Way Team at the Head Office, Kao Way staff 
develop and conduct communication activities 
tailored to the organizational conditions and issues at 
their group company or division.
 The Kao Way Team supports the local activities of 
Kao Way staff by maintaining close communication, 
receiving reports and providing advice. 
 When the Kao Way was updated in 2021, its 
content was discussed and approved by the Board of 
Directors.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance
2025 mid-term targets
Communication activities for the updated Kao Way 
are conducted at all group companies and divisions.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
We believe that the more the Kao Way becomes 
established, the higher the likelihood that the K25 
numerical targets will also be achieved, because we 
can anticipate that employees will display initiative in 
taking action aligned with our strategy.

Toward achieving our 
objectives
Announcing the updated Kao Way
In July 2021, the President announced the updated 
Kao Way to all employees.
 He communicated to employees that the Kao Way 
represents the culmination of the thoughts and beliefs 
of our management team and employees to date and 
that we need to focus more on two areas going 
forward: caring for people and the planet and making 
bolder moves.

Our initiatives

Education program for the updated Kao Way 
gets underway
While in-person meetings have not been possible due 
to COVID-19, group companies outside Japan utilized 
online tools to start communication activities.

•  A lecture on the updated Kao Way was given for 
senior managers of Kao Group companies. The 
speaker was Dave Muenz, who led the project to 
update the Kao Way. He also engaged in a lively 
question and answer session with participants.

•  Group companies in Europe and the Americas held 
a joint online Kao Way kick-off event. Employees 
involved in the project to update the Kao Way also 
conveyed how the updated Kao Way incorporated 
feedback from large numbers of employees, which 
was enthusiastically received by employees 
participating in the event.

Improved quality of life 102-12, 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Kao’s creating value to 
address social issues
Social issues we are aware of
We have identified several key factors affecting society 
that are closely related to quality of life (QOL) for 
consumers: global warming, changes in the hygiene 
environment, obstacles to women’s empowerment, the 
hyper-aging society, and an inadequate response to the 
diversification of society.
 Global warming’s impacts on the human body 
include skin damage caused by ultraviolet rays, and the 
negative effects on human health of the increased 
incidence of heatstroke. Issues relating to the hygiene 
environment include the pronounced disparities in public 
sanitation and hygiene habits between different countries 
and regions in an era in which infectious diseases are 
becoming more common.
 With regard to the emergence of the hyper-aging 
society, the disparity between senior citizen’s healthy 
lifespan and their average overall lifespan is leading to an 
increase in the care burden. There are also problems 
with senior citizens becoming socially isolated, which 
can result in them losing their sense of purpose in life.
 While progress has been made in terms of women’s 
enhanced participation in society, unfairness in the 
division of labor within the home, and a lack of 
understanding of the difficulties that women face on the 
part of both their families and their workplaces, have led 
to an increased physical burden on women and an 
increase in the level of stress that they experience.
 If the response to the diversification of society is 
inadequate, then consumers will not be able to enjoy 

equitable access to the benefits of products and 
services, accessibility will be inadequate, and it will not 
be possible to realize a society in which everyone can 
enjoy invigorating, fulfilling lives.
 As a result of social issues such as these, many 
consumers are at risk of significant lowering of their 
QOL in their lives.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to Be by 2030

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
If we fail to implement initiatives addressing social 
issues, such as initiatives in response to global 
warming, changes in the hygiene environment, the 
hyper-aging society, obstacles to women’s 
empowerment, and the need to respond to 
diversification, and if we fail to respond to the 
changes in people’s needs, then we will not be able to 

Contributions to the SDGs

Help people to enjoy more beautiful lives through our products, services and communications.

The five key issues affecting the environment in which 
Kao operates, and the risk of reduced QOL for consumers

Global 
warming

• Skin damage caused by ultraviolet rays
• Increased incidence of heatstroke

Changes in the 
hygiene 
environment

• Increased spread of infectious diseases
•  Growing disparities between regions in terms of 

public sanitation and hygiene habits

The hyper-
aging society

• Increased care burden
• Isolation of senior citizens

Obstacles to 
women’s 
empowerment

• Unfair division of labor within the home
•  Lack of understanding of the difficulties that 

women face on the part of their families and 
workplaces

• Excessive physical burden on women, and stress

Inadequate 
response to the 
diversification 
of society

•  Consumers not able to enjoy equitable access to 
the benefits of products and services

•  Inadequate accessibility

Global 
warming

• Protecting against ultraviolet rays
• Moisturizing products
•  Providing products that keep people feeling cool 

and fresh

Changes in the 
hygiene 
environment

•  Providing solutions to support infection prevention
•  Implementing hand-washing awareness-raising 

activities for the next generation
•  Providing hygiene products

The hyper-
aging society

• Offering healthy habit proposals
•  Providing support to help senior citizens maintain 

their autonomy and sense of purpose

Women’s 
empowerment

•  Spreading awareness of the need to share housework 
and childcare responsibilities

•  Developing products that enable anyone to do 
housework easily

•  Developing preventative healthcare products for women, 
and products that help reduce stress for women

Diversity

•  Product development, communication and 
awareness-raising activities that take diversity into 
account

•  Content that provides enhanced web accessibility

win the approval of consumers and of society as a 
whole. This could lead to a fall in our corporate value 
and brand value, and to a deterioration in profitability 
and market competitiveness.

Kao’s creating value
We aim to contribute toward enabling all consumers to 
realize their potential and to enjoy happy, enriching lives. 
To this end, we will be implementing initiatives to 
address the five key issues affecting society that we have 
identified as being particularly significant, and we will be 
providing products, services and awareness-raising 
activities in line with the changes in consumers’ needs.

Policies Education and promotion Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

In response to the five main risk factors that could 
lead to reduced QOL, due to various problems 
affecting society and changes in the social 
environment, we have identified key topics for 
addressing these risks, and we are taking action to 
tackle them. Going forward, we will be working 
together with consumers to help solve the problems 
covered by these topics, in collaboration with 
stakeholders such as local communities, government 
agencies and our business partners.

With the implementation of a PDCA cycle that 
includes the proposal of products that use new 
technology, collaboration between employees, 
consumers and other stakeholders, the wide-ranging 
dissemination of information both within and outside 
the company, obtaining evaluations from third-party 
organizations, etc., we are constantly reviewing our 
activity themes and working to expand them.

To enhance QOL for people throughout the world, we 
are focusing on five key topics: global warming, 
changes in the hygiene environment, the hyper-aging 
society, women’s empowerment and diversity.
 The provision of related products, providing 
information that is useful in consumers’ daily lives, 
and awareness-raising activities are all important for 
addressing these topics.

•  Policy briefings for suppliers: Once a year
•  Business planning meetings with suppliers: Once a 

year
•  Information exchange with suppliers regarding the 

SDGs: As needed
•  Collaboration with local government authorities and 

educational institutions

Framework Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

Of the 19 actions included in our Kirei Lifestyle Plan 
(KLP), improved quality of life, habits for cleanliness, 
beauty & health, universal product design, sustainable 
lifestyle promotion and purpose driven brands are 
being promoted as a common framework. 
 The ESG Managing Committee, which meets six 
times a year, deliberates on these matters under the 
supervision of the Board of Directors. The committee 
is chaired by the President, and its members include 
directors and executive officers responsible for ESG, 
Business, R&D, Product Quality Management, SCM, 
Sales, etc., helping the committee to coordinate its 
activities with our business activities. The committee 
reports on its activities to the Board of Directors at 
least once a year, and receives oversight from the 
board.

Performance in 2021

● The number of products which contribute to a 

comfortable, beautiful, healthy life and touch the 

heart of people
Performance in 2021: 4.5 billion products

Reviews of performance
The above figure represents a decrease of 200 million 
products compared to the previous year. The 
performance in 2021 fell below that in 2020, due to 
the fact that demand in the consumer products 
market in Japan was lower than in 2020, partly due to 
a rebound from the rapid increase in demand which 
was seen in 2020, and partly due to the series of 
declarations of emergency that were issued in Japan 
over the course of 2021.

The main reasons for this situation are the 
continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 
cosmetics market, and the fact that, although usage 
rates of hygiene products such as sanitizer had risen, 
2021 saw a decline in sales of such products 
compared to the previous year. Going forward, we 
will be aiming to meet our mid- to long-term targets 
by developing sales of hygiene products in countries 
where hygiene habits still leave room for 
improvement, and through awareness-raising 
activities.

Support for women’s 
empowerment through the 
Pink Ribbon Campaign
With increased female participation in society, higher 
female employment rates, an increase in the number of 
female managers, etc., society now offers more 
opportunities for women’s advancement. At the same 
time, however, because of the trend toward later 
marriage and the fall in the percentage of women with 
experience of pregnancy and childbirth, there has been 
an increase in the incidence of female-only cancers, 
which has become a significant social problem. We 
support the Pink Ribbon movement, a global initiative 
that seeks to educate women about the importance of 
early diagnosis for breast cancer, and since 2007 we 
have been implementing the Kao Pink Ribbon Campaign.
 We are also undertaking development of related 
products that contribute to enhanced QOL.
 We are currently taking the following two 
activities as the main pillars of our support for 
women’s health.

1.  Preventive awareness-raising and donation activities 
that make effective use of Kao’s resources

Since 2007, we have been implementing activities to 
communicate the importance of early diagnosis of 
breast cancer directly to customers through in-store 
Sofina, est and Kanebo Cosmetics counters, focusing 
mainly on Japan and the Asia region.
 In 2021, a method for performing self-checks 
using Body Lipid Wear was introduced to customers 
at Kanebo outlets and via the Kanebo website. Part of 
the revenue from product sales was donated to a 
cancer education project.
 In addition, our Laurier sanitary products brand 
implemented a limited-period brand-wide campaign 
to support women’s health. During the campaign 
period, donations were made to activities that support 
women’s health through a click-to-donate platform 
using a special website established for this campaign.

2.  Providing support for activities to educate the 
next generation through Pink Ribbon Advisors

Since FY2018, we have been supporting the “Project 
of Cancer Education by Pink Ribbon Advisors*” 
(Organizer: Japan Society of Breast Health, certified 
specified non-profit organization).
 Pink Ribbon Advisors who have experienced 
cancer visit junior high schools and high schools to 
give special lectures. The aim is for the advisors to 
use their own experience to help children develop an 
accurate and deeper understanding of cancer, thereby 
helping to boost cancer screening rates in the future, 
and also cultivate greater health awareness among 
the students’ families and society as a whole.

Hygiene product proposals
Launching Bioré Guard Antibacterial Body Wash
With the rise in hygiene awareness, people have become 
more aware of the need to combat viruses and bacteria that 
they may have picked up while outside by washing and 
sanitizing their hands, and also by emphasizing whole-body 
hygiene. (According to a 2020 Kao survey)
 In April 2021, we launched a new medicated body wash 
product that can also be used for washing the hair (in Japan, 
this is classed as a quasi-drug product, which is 
able to clean, sterilize and disinfect the skin). Its 
sanitizing ingredients enables it to remove 
viruses and bacteria from the skin. It washes dirt 
off the body, and leaves the skin clean and fresh.
 It can also be used for washing the hair.
 
Launching Bioré Guard Sanitizer Foam
According to a survey on hand sanitizer usage, consumers 
tend to use an inadequate amount of sanitizer, and tend not to 
rub enough sanitizer on every part of their hands. (According 
to a 2021 Kao survey)
 With this in mind, in October 2021 we launched Bioré 
Guard Sanitizer Foam (in Japan, this is classed as a designated 
quasi-drug product, which is able to clean the fingers and 
skin, and has disinfecting properties), which has 
been made easy-to-use for consumers. It is 
designed so that, because the cleaner comes 
out as foam, it is unlikely to spill even if the 
dispenser pump is pressed down firmly, making 
it easy for children and senior citizens to use.

Healthy habit proposals
Launching the Healthya W Iikoto Meguri product line
The percentage of people who worry about their blood 
pressure as they get older is tending to increase. In 
particular, around 70% of men in their 40s or older who 
are concerned about their blood pressure are also 
worried about having too much body fat. (According to a 
2020 Kao survey)
 The Healthya W (Double) Iikoto Meguri product line is 
a Food with Function Claims product with chlorogenic 
acid derived from coffee beans̶which has been 
reported as having the two functions of helping to 
reduce high blood pressure and reducing visceral fat̶as 
the functional ingredient.
 This new product line includes three items: a bottled 
beverage (specifically, a blended tea drink) that can be 
drunk straight out of the bottle, and two beverages in 
powdered form (coffee flavor and black soybean tea 
flavor) that can be added to various different drinks. With 
this product line, we are proposing a healthy habit that is 
easy to maintain, and where consumers can choose the 
option that best suits their lifestyle and preferences, with 
the target consumers being people who are concerned 
about their high blood pressure and visceral fat.

Policies

Social issues we are aware of

The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the 
world, which in 2021 still showed no sign of abating, 
brought home to people once again just how 
important it is to maintain good hygiene.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
If we fail to implement initiatives addressing social 
issues, such as initiatives in response to global 
warming, changes in the hygiene environment, the 
hyper-aging society, obstacles to women’s 
empowerment, and the need to respond to 
diversification, and if we fail to respond to the 
changes in people’s needs, then the value that we 
provide through our products and services will not be 
able to win the approval of consumers and of society 

At a time when people’s lifestyles and values are 
changing, besides delivering cleaning and hygiene 
products that can help consumers to live with peace 
of mind and to enjoy a brilliant life, we also promote 
awareness-raising activities that can enable people to 
continue a daily routine of hygienic habits and actions 

as a whole, which could lead to a fall in our corporate 
value and brand value, and to a deterioration in 
profitability and market competitiveness.

to implementing activities that aim to promote 
adoption of good hygiene habits in the countries of 
Europe and the Americas, where people tend to be 
lax about hand-washing and mask-wearing, and also 
in the Asia region.

Education and promotion

Over the period from 2009 to 2019, as part of our 
efforts to encourage all Kao employees to participate 
in ESG activities, we provided support for the 
implementation of visiting classes at schools, 
including hand-washing lessons for children in the 
early years of elementary school.
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, while we were 
concerned that sending employees to visit schools to 
give lessons might exacerbate the spread of the 
disease, we also felt that, precisely because this was a 
pandemic, it was even more important than ever to 
instill correct hygiene habits in as many children as 
possible. With this in mind, starting from 2020, we 
began providing remote classes for pre-school 
children, and we developed teaching programs 
whereby teachers at elementary schools could make 
use of teaching materials supplied by Kao in their 
classes.

Habits for cleanliness, beauty & health

Framework

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders
By providing programs tailored to the changes 
affecting society, we implement activities for cultivating 
the next generation that help to develop children’s life 
skills and their ability to solve problems. In developing 
these programs, we work together with government 
agencies, local government authorities, schools, etc. to 
expand the content of the programs and enable them 
to be used effectively in the classroom.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

2030 long-term targets
•  Cumulative number of people reached by 

awareness-raising activities for acquiring habits for 
cleanliness, beauty & health using Kao products and 
services
Target for 2030: 0.1 billion people

Within Japan, we will be focusing on providing teaching 
materials that teachers can use themselves at school, 
while combining this with visiting classes, including 
classes provided remotely, and we will be approaching 
even more educational institutions, with the aim of 
establishing good hygiene habits in both pre-school-age 
children and young schoolchildren. We will also be 
working to disseminate accurate information and 
expand the scope of hygiene awareness-raising 
activities in the Asia region, and in Europe and the 
Americas, in a similar way to that used in Japan.

Of the 19 actions included in our Kirei Lifestyle Plan 
(KLP), improved quality of life, habits for cleanliness, 
beauty & health, universal product design, sustainable 
lifestyle promotion and purpose driven brands are 
being promoted as a common framework. 
 The ESG Managing Committee, which meets six 
times a year, deliberates on these matters under the 
supervision of the Board of Directors. The committee 
is chaired by the President, and its members include 
directors and executive officers responsible for ESG, 
Business, R&D, Product Quality Management, SCM, 
Sales, etc., helping the committee to coordinate its 
activities with our business activities. The committee 
reports on its activities to the Board of Directors at 
least once a year, and receives oversight from the 
board.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
Even in Japan, where people are already in the habit 
of washing their hands regularly, it can be anticipated 
that having people learn hygiene behavior from when 
they are children and make it habitual will lead to an 
increase in the percentage of people who use hand 
soap, hand sanitizer and other disinfectant products, 
and an increase in the frequency of use. Spreading 
Japanese hygiene habits to other countries will help 
to improve hygiene habits in the Asia region, and 
should contribute toward a dramatic increase in 
demand for hygiene products.

Social impacts
It can be anticipated that the adoption of habits for 
cleanliness, beauty & health will help to improve 
people’s quality of life, improve public hygiene, and 
reduce the risk of infectious diseases.

Habits for cleanliness, beauty & health 102-43

Educational program to cultivate 
habits for cleanliness, beauty & health
Education for the next generation through the 
provision of educational materials
We believe that safeguarding one’s own hygiene status 
helps to safeguard the hygiene status of society as a 
whole (in other words, the people around us). In line 
with this belief, we undertake activities for the 
cultivation of the next generation, with the aim of 
cultivating children’s life skills and their ability to solve 
problems, through the provision of educational 
programs tailored to the changes taking place in society.

In 2021, as in the previous year, we provided free 
teaching materials, aimed at children in the younger 
years at elementary school, for teachers to conduct 

Our initiatives

Provision of educational materials
Our new hygiene habits program: Let’s All Wash 
Our Hands Together! For First and Second Grade 
Elementary School Students

their own classes. In response to the pandemic, we 
developed a new hygiene habits program to help 
children in the early grades of elementary school enjoy 
learning the importance of hand-washing and mask-
wearing, and acquire hygiene habits. We provided 
information about the program to approximately 20,000 
schools nationwide, and more than 6,000 are using it.

Our new hygiene habits program: Let’s All Wash 
Our Hands Together! For Schools for the Deaf 

We developed a parallel program for children with 
hearing impairments, which we have been offering 
since September 2021, to help them acquire hygiene 
habits while having fun. As of December 2021, this 
program was being used by around 60% of schools 
for the deaf in Japan.

The members of Kakehashi*, an internal community in 
which Kao employees with hearing impairments play a 
central role, were involved in developing this program. 
With the aim of making the teaching materials easy to 
understand and able to stimulate interest, trial classes 
were implemented with collaboration from schools for 
the deaf, and a repeated process of verification was 
conducted in which, for example, the schools’ 

Trial class being given at a school for the deaf by members of Kao’s 
Kakehashi group

teachers were asked for their opinions. When 
explaining the six key positions that should be used 
when washing your hands in order to get every part of 
the hands clean, a major effort was made to ensure 
that the explanation could be done properly, for 
example by using fingerspelling.
*  Kakehashi is an internal community formed within the Kao Group in 

December 2020, in which employees with hearing impairments play 
a major role. Based on the philosophy that “By sharing everyone’s 
concerns in a forward-looking manner, people who can’t hear and 
people who can hear can collaborate on building a bridge to the 
future,” Kakehashi undertakes both internal and external activities 
aimed at finding solutions to various social problems.

Developing hand-washing awareness in the U.S.

Starting from March 2021, Kao USA has been rolling 
out a new Clean Routine for Healthy Hands program 
under the MyKirei by Kao brand to teach elementary 
school students in the U.S. the importance of good 
hygiene habits. This program was developed by 

Kao’s cultivation of the next generation

Our new hygiene habits program: Keeping Your 
Surroundings Clean

As the next step after children have got into the habit 
of washing their hands, we developed another new 
hygiene habits program̶Keeping Your Surroundings 
Clean̶to help children understand the importance of 

modifying the new hygiene habits program that we 
have deployed in Japan. It aims to support teachers’ 
efforts to provide children with hand-washing 
guidance by using content that treats hand-washing 
as something fun to do, rather than just something 
that has to be done every day. As of December 2021, 
teaching materials had been provided to ten schools, 
and it is anticipated that the scope of program 
implementation will be expanded in the future.

keeping their surroundings clean. We began providing 
this program in September 2021, only for elementary 
schools that have already implemented our Let’s All 
Wash Our Hands Together! For First and Second 
Grade Elementary School Students program. This is 
an experiential program, through which children 
acquire the habit of keeping things clean yourself by 
focusing on what you can do in a fun way, through 
practice in cleaning desks and activities that can be 
performed at home.

Developing a program for thinking about marine 
plastic waste in collaboration with an 
elementary school affiliated with Wakayama 
University Faculty of Education, for provision to 
public elementary schools in Wakayama City
In October 2020, we concluded a cooperation 
agreement with Wakayama City for promotion of the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are 
aiming to make contributions through our wide-
ranging business fields and our research technologies 
that support them to Wakayama City’s efforts toward 
the SDGs and to the sustainable development of the 
local community of Wakayama City. As part of these 
efforts, and with a focus on cultivating human talent 
for the future, we are working together with an 
elementary school affiliated with Wakayama 
University Faculty of Education to jointly develop a 
program for thinking about and addressing the issue 
of marine plastic waste. The program has been 
formulated using know-how acquired at the school,

and was implemented for public elementary schools 
in Wakayama City in 2021. Building on these 
activities, in the 2022 academic year we began to 
provide the program’s teaching materials to schools 
throughout Japan. The aim of the program is to 
provide classes in which, while learning about the 
efforts being made to reduce plastic waste and about 
recycling, children can learn to think for themselves, 
identify issues and acquire problem-solving skills.

Universal product design 102-12, 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

As part of Kao’s ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri, we provide products and services based on our Universal Design Guidelines.

Policies

Social issues we are aware of
In order to realize continued, sustainable growth for 
society, it is important to realize a world in which all 
individuals are respected, and in which people can 
fulfil their potential in the way that suits them best. 
For this reason, we believe that there is a need to 
provide products that are easy to use for everyone, 
regardless of cultural background, nationality, beliefs, 
ethnicity, gender, identity or abilities, and to provide 
related information in a way that is easy to access.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
If products do not take universal design 
considerations into account adequately, then there is 
a risk of improper usage by consumers, and of other 
safety issues. Furthermore, even products developed 
with safety in mind may be used improperly if easily 
understood information about how to use them 
correctly is not provided. Failure in this regard could 
have a negative impact on safety for consumers, and 
could lead to a loss of trust in our products and in the 
company itself.

We implement universal product design in 
accordance with the Kao Universal Design Guidelines, 
which were formulated in 2011.
 We will promote ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri 
throughout the company, and by delivering 
satisfaction and inspiration to all consumers in their 
daily lives through the use of Kao products, we will 
strive to become a consumer product industry leader 
in the use of Universal Design (UD).

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Helping to enrich the lives of people all over the world 
through Kao products and through the provision of 
information will reinforce trust in our company as an 
enterprise that is vital to maintaining a sustainable society.

Kao’s creating value
We have promoted development and provision of 
products that anyone can use easily under the basic 
concept of our consumer-focused Yoki-Monozukuri. 
Going forward, to contribute to the universal SDG 
target of leaving no one behind, we will deliver 
satisfaction and inspiration to all the consumers we 
serve, and strive to enrich people’s lives.
 To this end, we will implement manufacturing and 
provide products based on a consumer-focused 
perspective, so that all consumers can enjoy a stress-
free experience in the various stages of selecting, 
purchasing, using and disposing of products. We also 
aim to provide support so that using the information 
we disseminate and the products we supply will 
contribute toward a strengthening of the links 
between people and between people and society.

Contributions to the SDGs

Social inclusion

We strive to create products that bring 
joy to people in their daily lives.

By giving due consideration to 
diversity and diverse relationships 
as we influence lifestyles, we aim 
to contribute to the promotion of 
social inclusion.

User-friendly products
We strive to deliver “user-friendly 
products”  by focusing on “accessibility,” 
“safety” and “usability.”

Universal product design 102-43, 404-2

Specific initiatives to achieve this are set forth below.

1.  Adoption of the consumer’s viewpoint in the 
promotion of UD, from product awareness to 
consumption and final disposal in the home

Realizing user-friendly products, which is a core 
aspect of the Kao Universal Design Guidelines
Along with focusing on accessibility and usability as 
well as safety and security, we will disseminate easily 
understood product and service information at each 
stage from product awareness and selection to 
purchase and disposal.
 Regarding the key points of accessibility, usability, and 
safety and security, we implement checks both at the 
product development stage, and at the after-sales stage 
(including utilization of feedback received from consumers). 
The results of these checks are reflected in subsequent 
product development and information provision.

2.  Monozukuri Project promotion and strategic 
PR from a UD-centered perspective

We believe that for the socially vulnerable, UD is not 
merely value added, but is the value of the product itself. 
Going forward, we will launch UD-focused Monozukuri 
Promotion Projects in each business division that target 
senior citizens, who constitute a core group in Japan’s 
hyper-aging society, and we will expand our offering of 
products that embody an enhanced UD perspective.
 We will also strengthen our information and service 
offerings that utilize information and communication 
technology, and collaborate with stakeholders including 
distribution companies and local governments, and 
actively convey the customer perspective.

3. Promoting UD from a global perspective
Further promotion of UD will require an approach that takes 
differences in culture and habits into account at the level of 
the individual country or region. At the same time, an 
approach to UD that takes diversity into account is 
something that is needed globally, and which will need to be 
updated on an ongoing basis. While responding to the need 
for a UD perspective in those countries and regions where 
there is the highest demand for it, and taking these initiatives 
as pioneering examples of what can be achieved, we will 
also be expanding the addressing of UD concerns to bring 
about an overall enhancement of UD on a global basis.

Education and promotion

Deploying a structure for UD-centered 
manufacturing throughout the company
A cross-business approach is vitally important for UD 
promotion. Each business division has appointed a 
new UD promotion leader to collaborate with our 
Consumer Communication Center, which features a 
consultation window that deals directly with consumer 
requests and feedback, as well as with R&D and 
Creative, to promote UD-centered manufacturing.
 In addition, rather than the internal ESG awards that 
were originally planned, we have adjusted our internal 
recognition system, creating opportunities for the 
expression of thanks and for commendations relating to 
everyday initiatives not only at a company-wide level 
but also within individual units. Through these 
measures, we are aiming to enhance UD promotion 
awareness for all employees, and to help employees 

recognize that UD is directly relevant to them.

Internal education system
We hold Workshops for Promoting Empathy with 
Elderly People, with the aim of helping our employees 
develop greater empathy for the elderly and a sense of 
direct connection with the problems they face. During 
the COVID-19 pandemic, taking into account the needs 
of infection prevention, we have been disseminating 
information by video, and expanding the provision of 
online and virtual activities for our employees.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

Manufacturing that reflects consumers’ views
Kao’s consumer support desk inside our Consumer 
Communication Center receives large numbers of 
consumer comments on and responses to Kao products 
that are already on sale. These comments are shared in 
daily, monthly and annual reports, in a manner that 
considers why the comments were received, the 
background to the comments, and the feelings that they 
embody. In addition, the comments are also shared at 
the Quality Improvement Study Meetings that individual 
business divisions hold on a monthly basis, and lead to 
further improvements in products.
 By utilizing consumer feedback in product 
development and improvement, and providing related 
information, not just at the development stage but 
also in the after-sales stage, we are able to develop 
products that are even more user-friendly.

Mid- to long-term targets and performance

2030 long-term targets
1.  Practice UD-centered manufacturing on a 

continuous basis
We will expand ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri from a UD 
perspective not only in Japan, but also globally. We will 
also promote the UD-centered Yoki-Monozukuri Project, 
which aims to solve social issues, and accelerate the 
release of UD-centered new products. To this end, we will 
undertake product development that takes third-party 
opinions from a UD perspective into account at an early 
stage, across all household products businesses, and this 
content will be disclosed outside the company.

2.  Adopt a UD perspective when disseminating information
We will adopt a UD perspective in information dissemination 
and retail shop design. In particular, by 2025 we will fully 
utilize DX to provide information for all products that enables 
anyone to easily access and confirm what they need to know 
when selecting and using those products. At the same time, 
we will undertake the dissemination of information in 
collaboration with retailers and with the media so that senior 
citizens, who tend to have restricted access to information, 
can be sure of receiving the information they need.
 We will also strive to ensure that as many people 
as possible can access vital hygiene information, in a 
stress-free way.

 Implementing communication with diverse 
consumers enables us to adjust our approach to 
products and to information.

Exchanging information with consumer groups 
and consumer protection agencies
By exchanging information on a regular basis with 
government consumer protection agencies, including local 
consumer affairs centers, and with consumer groups, we are 
able to inform them about, and secure their understanding 
regarding, the proper ways to use and dispose of products, 
which can help to prevent consumer issues from emerging 
in advance, and regarding risk prevention, ensuring product 
effectiveness from a hygiene perspective, and the key 
aspects of UD. We have also been able to win the support of 
local communities for our efforts to ensure that consumers 
can enjoy safe lives with peace of mind.

Framework

Of the 19 actions included in our Kirei Lifestyle Plan (KLP), 
improved quality of life, habits for cleanliness, beauty & health, 
universal product design, sustainable lifestyle promotion and 
purpose driven brands are being promoted as a common 
framework.
 The ESG Managing Committee, which meets six times a 
year, deliberates on these matters under the supervision of the 
Board of Directors. The committee is chaired by the President, 
and its members include directors and executive officers 
responsible for ESG, Business, R&D, Product Quality 
Management, SCM, Sales, etc., helping the committee to 
coordinate its activities with our business activities. The 

3.  Promote understanding on the part of stakeholders
We aim to enrich the lives of people globally and to contribute 
to the sustainability of the world by spreading awareness of 
UD initiatives as widely as possible and fostering 
understanding of these measures among stakeholders.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
The need to respond to the hyper-aging society and the 
diversification of society so that all people can live healthy lives 
constitute global challenges. By utilizing our attention to detail 
to develop products that are easy to use for diverse groups of 
people throughout the world, and to disseminate product-
related information, we can enhance our global presence, 
which will also lead to growth as a brand and as an enterprise.

Social impacts
The consideration that we display̶for example by 
adding notches on shampoo bottles̶in the design of 
household products, which are familiar items for children, 
can provide widespread opportunities for thinking about 
universal design, and our initiatives in this area are now 
being used as examples in school education in Japan.
 We believe that providing products that are easy to 
use for everyone, regardless of age, gender, disability, 
race, ethnicity, birthplace, religion or economic status, 
etc., and making consumers aware of our efforts in 
this regard, can itself contribute toward generating 
greater diversity among consumers.

committee reports on its activities to the Board of Directors at 
least once a year, and receives oversight from the board.

Performance in 2021

1. Product development from UD perspectives
•  Percentage of new and improved products that 

incorporate UD perspective*
Japan: 98%, 984 items

•  We have launched products such as Bath 
Magiclean Airjet, which allows stress-free cleaning 
of the bathroom, and Bioré Guard Sanitizer Foam, 
an easy-to-use foam-type sanitizer product.

*  Regarding the data for Japan, up until last year the percentage 
for improved products was calculated by comparison with the 
previous products, but starting from this year the calculation is 
based on more precise assessment of whether products feature 
UD considerations.

*  Last year, improvement percentage data was given for Kao 
products in Europe and the Americas. However, this year, data 
for Europe and the Americas has not been given, because the 
basis for comparison is being revised.

2. Initiatives targeting diverse groups of people
Initiatives to aid people with visual 
impairments
•  We provided lifestyle information content, and our 

employees volunteered to help record narrated 
information, for Home Life, a voice-based 
magazine published by the Japan Braille Library.

•  We collaborated with viwa, an organization that 
provides living support for people with visual 
impairments, on the production of Liese̶
Hairstyling Information You Just Listen To, to 

provide information about hairstyling in an audio 
format that is easy to understand on our website.

Initiatives to aid people with hearing impairments
• TV commercials with closed captioning
We have been promoting the airing of closed 
captioning TV commercials in regular broadcasts 
since 2011. So far, around 1,900 commercials 
(including commercials on the Kao website) featuring 
closed captioning have been produced. Commercials 
that have not been broadcast on TV have been made 
available on the website. We are implementing 
initiatives to have more TV commercials with closed 
captioning shown during regular TV broadcasts.
•  Activities in which Kao employees with hearing 

impairments play a central role
As part of the activities undertaken by Kakehashi, a 
community organization created by Kao employees 
with hearing impairments as volunteers, special 
teaching materials were developed for giving hand-
washing classes at schools for children with 
hearing impairments.

3. Promote understanding on the part of stakeholders
As was the case last year, the number of awareness-
raising activities has been reduced due to the impact 

of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a presentation 
on our universal design initiatives was given online 
in the Okayama UD Ambassador Cultivation Seminar 
organized by Okayama Prefectural Government. We 
have also undertaken various other activities, such 
as providing UD materials for use by elementary 
school students (in two municipalities).

Reviews of performance
We have been emphasizing the UD-driven aspects of 
product design when launching new products in Japan 
since 2012, and an emphasis on UD is now firmly 
established in all segments of our Household products. 
However, as the pursuit of UD is an ongoing process 
with no end-point, we recognize the need for a more 
objective assessment of our efforts in this area. This 
year, we reviewed the UD-driven aspects of product 
design for each individual product. Going forward, we 
will be considering seeking evaluation widely from third 
parties in addition to our own in-house evaluation.
 This year, besides products, we have also been 
implementing initiatives to provide information in a 
way that takes UD into account. We are considering 
ways to undertake more wide-ranging activities, by 
not just disseminating information, but also listening 
to the views of the people who receive it.

UD considerations in relation to the 
products that we launched and the 
information that we disseminated in 2021
We are continuing to develop products that make it 
possible for diverse groups of people to use our products 
in a stress-free manner in different circumstances. In this 
section, we present some examples of how products 
that Kao launched in 2021 took UD into account.

Bath Magiclean Airjet
According to Kao surveys, around 50% of people in 
Japan clean the bath every day. Regardless of what 
equipment you have, and regardless of what age you 
are, for many people cleaning the bath involves an 
awkward posture, forcing them to bend down and 
putting strain on the knees and back.
 Bath Magiclean Airjet, which we launched in 
September 2021, aims to make cleaning the bath (and 
other surfaces in the bathroom) simple and 
straightforward. It features a new container design, 
embodying UD considerations, which allows the user to 
squirt a continuous jet of mist-like cleaner.
 The use of a pressure accumulation type nozzle with 
continuous spray makes it possible for anyone to spray the 
surface to be cleaned evenly, without gaps or overlaps, 
with small amounts of mist-like cleaner. The container is 
designed so that the user naturally places their finger on 
the end of the lever when they hold the container, and 
effective utilization of the leverage principle makes it easy 
to operate the lever, facilitating continued spraying. The 
cleaning agent used is tougher than previous agents, and 
the formula is designed so that even residual dirt where 

solid sebum has adhered to the area around lumps of 
protein will come off easily. Even congealed slime that has 
accumulated in the four corners of the bathtub can be 
cleaned within 30 seconds without the need for vigorous 
rubbing, and soap residue on bathroom stools or wash-
basins can also be removed easily.
 Feedback from customers who have used Bath 
Magiclean Airjet has been very positive, with comments 
such as: “Because I suffer from back pain, I find it very 
difficult to bend down, and I don’t have the strength to 
rub surfaces vigorously with a sponge. This new product 
can be sprayed on while standing upright, and it cleans 
the slime off the bathtub without needing to rub away 
with a sponge. It has made cleaning the bath a lot 
easier!” “In the past, when I have used a spray-type 
cleaner product, I found it difficult because it made my 
hand hurt, so being able to spray with just gentle 
pressure is perfect for me!” “It brings the dirt off very 
well, and everyone in my family who helps with cleaning 
the bath loves this product,” and “My son is now willing 

to help clean the bath for me.”
 Going forward, we aim to continue providing 
products and services that anyone can use easily, making 
housework easier and less physically demanding, and 
making the consumer’s everyday more beautiful.

Making hand hygiene stress-free and fun
The evolution of foaming hand soap
It is important for children to acquire hygienic habits from a 
young age. In 2004, we launched Bioré u Foaming Hand Soap 
to help young children, who sometimes find it difficult to get 
soap to lather, to get into the habit of hand-washing in a fun, 
easy way. Since 2009, we have been providing hand-washing 
lessons, particularly for children in the younger year groups at 
elementary schools, to teach them correct technique for 
hand-washing. These lessons have been effective in bringing 
across how important it is to wash your hands properly.
 In 2019, utilizing technology we had developed that 
makes it possible to create soap foam in various different 
shapes, we launched Bioré u Whip Stamp Handwash, which 
produces foam in the shape of flowers, with the aim of 
getting children into the habit of washing their hands by 
making it enjoyable. We received very positive feedback, with 
comments such as “It is convenient because it can be used 
with just one hand,” and 
“The children now enjoy 
washing their hands.” In 
August 2021, responding 
to feedback that indicated 
that, when children were 
using the product, it 
tended to slip off the 
surface it had been placed

Promoting employee UD

Barrier-free access to 
information

on because they couldn’t exert enough pressure on the bottle 
to keep it steady, which was upsetting for them, we changed 
the shape of the bottle from oval-shaped to circular, making it 
more stable. Following improvements of this kind, we have 
received comments from users indicating that this product 
has become easier to use. For example, one user reported 
that “My four-year-old daughter wasn’t able to create neat 
flower-shaped foam before, but now, with the new container, 
the flowers bloom right away, and she is very happy.”

Development of Hairstyling Information You Just 
Listen To for the Liese brand
In April 2021, Kao’s Liese hair care brand began 
presenting Hairstyling Information You Just Listen To 
audio content on the brand’s official website, so that 
people who are bad at styling hair and people with visual 
impairments can access easy-to-understand information 
about how to perform hairstyling with peace of mind.
 Audio content production has been undertaken since 
2020 in collaboration with viwa, an organization that 
provides living support for people with visual impairments.
 The aim was to provide hairstyling information that can be 
understood just by listening to it, for everyone from beginners 
to people who already have advanced hairstyling skills.
 People associated with viwa were very pleased with 
this initiative, commenting that “By building an image in 
your mind based on the audio explanation, it was 
possible to style hair beautifully!” “The narration was very 
easy to absorb, and I could understand what items I 
needed to use, how much, and where to apply it,” and 
“Now that I know how easy it is, I want to try some 
hairstyles that I never dared do before!”
 Going forward, we will develop information that makes it 
possible for anyone to learn how to do things easily in other

areas besides hairstyling.

Producing a video version of the Workshops for 
Promoting Empathy with Elderly People, and 
implementing related online experiential activities
With the aim of enhancing empathy for senior citizens, 
since 2012 we have been implementing the Workshops for 
Promoting Empathy with Elderly People for our employees. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has not been possible to 
implement face-to-face workshops that bring large numbers 
of people together, so we have produced explanatory videos 
based on the experience of past workshops, and these have 
been made available for use in employee training. We have 
also implemented, on a trial basis, online experiential 
workshops that employees can participate in at home. 
Employees who have participated in these workshops were 
able to experience for themselves how inconvenient the 
homes where they normally live without a second thought 
could be for senior citizens, and noticed many things from 
simulating an elderly person’s experience, including physical 
discomfort and changes in mood.
 In the future, we intend to continue providing various 
experiential activities to support manufacturing that takes 
senior citizens’ feelings into account.

Employees’ voice

Everybody wants to look beautiful, regardless of whether 
they have disabilities. However, beauty-related 
information usually needs to be seen or read. There is 
relatively little information available for people with visual 
impairments, resulting in a disparity in access to 
information.

The Hairstyling Information You Just Listen To audio 
content that Kao has created represents an initiative 
aimed at contributing toward the realization of the goal 
of “No one will be left behind,” one of the underlying 
principles of the SDGs. Rather than just undertaking the 
temporary dissemination of information, I hope that we 
will be able to continue providing information that is 
useful to people who suffer from various inconveniences, 
without limiting this to any particular brand.

Giving consideration to making 
it possible to use products 
more safely

Using opening-prevention stickers to warn users 
of chlorinated spray products of the need to 
exercise caution when using them
Spray-type chlorinated bleach products and mold-
removal cleaning agents for bathroom use are 
convenient products that make it possible to easily 
spray the agents where they are needed in mist form. 
However, the risk of harm to objects or to human 
health if they become airborne and adhere to other 
surfaces is greater than it is with other products, so it 
is very important to exercise caution when using 
them, to prevent problems from arising.
 In the past, we took many different steps to help 
prevent these products from being sprayed in the 
wrong place, for example by fitting them with levers 
to prevent unintentional spraying, and by adding a 
warning on the front of the bottle stating that “If liquid 
starts to leak out, this indicates that the bottle is 
deteriorating,” to warn users that leaks may occur if 
the bottle continues to be used for longer than the 
length of time it is designed to last for, and to 
encourage them to purchase a replacement. However, 
these measures did not really have an adequate 
warning effect.
 Although we have eliminated the use of eye-

Eye-catching plastic 
stickers used in the past 
(Kitchen Haiter Foam)

catching plastic stickers throughout the company, we 
have continued to use opening-prevention stickers on 
these types of chlorinated spray product in order to 
prevent accidents due to inappropriate use in retail 
stores, etc. The content of the text on these stickers 
has been changed, with content relating to product 
features etc. being eliminated, and instead focusing 
on how consumers should store the products, and 
warnings about how to use them safely.

Policies

Social issues we are aware of
In recent years, with the development of social media 
including social networking services and blogs, a 
wide range of information is now easily accessible 
online. As a result, more consumers are expressing an 
increasing interest in the effects on human health and 
the environment of the ingredients used in daily 
products, as well as related social and ethical issues. 
In addition, today it has become possible for 
consumers to search for related information. At the 
same time, however, scientifically-unfounded, 
inaccurate information is also available on the 
internet, and such misleading information may spread 
as if it is the truth.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
A wide range of information, including inappropriate 
information, is available for high-social-interest 
ingredients. When our products contain such 
ingredients, there is a risk that the value of the 
products may not be properly understood. In addition, 
if, in spite of recognizing the situation, we do not 
present our position, there is a risk that we may 
significantly lose trust, from consumers and 
customers in our products and in ourselves. 

Safety is always our first priority. With this in mind, we 
care not only about human health and wellbeing but 
also about the environment when developing our 
products. We disclose our policy regarding the 
ingredients that are of particular interest to society, so 
that customers and consumers can use our products 
with peace of mind. We also help consumers to 
choose suitable products and to use them safely by 
providing product information in an appropriate and 
easy-to-understand manner.

Education and promotion

In order to promote the development of safer, 
healthier products, human and environmental safety 
information about our products and the ingredients is 
shared on our internal portal site. This information is 
shared with various divisions such as Business and 
R&D, so that each employee can enhance their 
understanding from a global perspective.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Appropriate and clear communication with 
consumers and customers about the evidence-based 
approach to our ingredients helps us to enhance 
Kao’s and our products’ credibility. Moreover, 
communication based on shared information between 
consumers / customers and the company becomes a 
foundation for increasing trust in the company and an 
opportunity to contribute to Yoki-Monozukuri which 
includes innovation and value creation.

Kao’s creating value
In order for consumers and customers to use our 
products with peace of mind in a diverse information 
environment, we believe it is necessary to disclose 
our approach based on scientifically verified 
information. This is today’s way for companies to 
build trust with consumers and customers. We hope 
to win stakeholders’ approval and strengthen bonds 
of trust for the future by demonstrating a high level of 
transparency and responsible communication.

Framework

We utilize our continuous research on human health 
and environmental safety, based on data collected from 
all over the world for ingredients selection and safety 
evaluation, and therefore we are able to develop our 
products so that they can be used by consumers with 
peace of mind. In addition, we closely review safety 
information through industry association activities in 
various countries and regions and communication with 
government agencies. These activities help us to 
provide science-based safety information to consumers 
and customers. We consider that enhancing the 
correct understanding of products and ingredients 
helps people to use our products safely, and helps 
them to choose suitable products.

Disclosure of information to customers and 
consumers
Under the current environment, customers and 
consumers can easily access incorrect or out-of-date 
information about the ingredients. To help customers 
and consumers understand information accurately, 
we disclose our approach based on scientific 
evidence, and provide accurate information.

We implement activities through a working group led 
by Product Quality Management under the ESG 
Managing Committee and ESG Promotion Meeting, in 
collaboration with relevant functions around the 
world. The working group members discuss 
ingredients that society is particularly interested in by 
utilizing their expertise in order to examine the 
scientific information and deepen the understanding 
of social issues. We also have many discussions with 
the heads of relevant Business and R&D divisions, 
and then we disclose our approach.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

2030 long-term targets
We establish policies relating to ingredients of 
particular interest to society based on our research 
into available safety evaluations, and our evaluation of 
their validity. We have disclosed our policies for nine 
ingredients as of the end of 2021. We have achieved 
our mid-term goal of announcing our policies for eight

ingredients by 2022 ahead of schedule. We are 
continuing to work to achieve policy disclosure for a 
total of 16 ingredients by 2030. 

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
We anticipate that our value and business will be 
enhanced through disclosing our policies regarding 
ingredients of particular interest to society, and we 
believe that this helps build trust in our products and 
contributes to Yoki-Monozukuri. 

Social impacts
By sharing our policies, we encourage customers and 
consumers to enhance their understanding of our 
products, and help them choose products with 
greater confidence. As that trust spreads from the 
individual to communities and society as a whole, we 
can build greater trust socially.

Safe and reliable ingredient use 
and information disclosure

Industry association 
activities / communication

We will disclose our policies and actions regarding 
ingredients of particular interest to society in a 
proactive manner, based on scientifically validated 
information. We have disclosed our policies relating to 
nine ingredients (alkyl sulfates, 1,4-dioxane, 
formaldehyde-releasing preservatives, parabens, 
plastic microbeads, preservatives, silicones, talc and 
UV absorbents) so far.
 We internally organize management structure for 
ingredient information including health impact, 
environmental impact as well as fundamental 
information to promote disclosing our approach on 
more ingredients.

To address environmental concerns relating to 
microplastics, including plastic microbeads, the Japan 
Cosmetic Industry Association has collaborated with 
its partner associations around the world. It has also 
coordinated scientific research and usage surveys in 
Japan, and provides information to the government. 
We play a central role in these activities and lead 
cosmetics industry activities in Japan.
 Furthermore, we actively participate in industry 
activities related to our business, such as those of the 
Japan Soap and Detergent Association and the Japan 
Chemical Industry Association. We also participate in 
industry association activities in other major regions 
of the world to research local information, and in 
particular in the ASEAN and other Asian regions, 
contribute to the exchange of information with 
governments.
 Moreover, we strive for adequate communication 
with consumers and customers. For example, when 
we receive inquiries regarding our use of ingredients 
or their safety, we provide adequate information 
quickly. At the same time, we utilize inquiries to 
examine areas of high social interest, and these 
surveys are useful for product development.

Performance in 2021

In August 2021, we published our policies developed 
based on science for four ingredients of particular 
interest to society on our sustainability website: alkyl 
sulfates, 1,4-dioxane, formaldehyde-releasing 
preservatives and talc.

Reviews of performance
The working group held meetings constantly in order 
to thoroughly discuss the contents of each of the 
four ingredients, and drafted our policies. The draft 
policies were then reviewed by the heads of related 
Business and R&D divisions, and further discussed to 
finalize the policies for publication. We continue to 
proactively research ingredients from multiple 
perspectives, and strive to achieve our long-term 
targets ahead of schedule.

Sustainable lifestyle promotion 102-12, 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 306-1 (Waste 2020)

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
Climate change caused by global warming over the 
last few decades affects people’s lives and the natural 
ecosystems in various ways. For instance, the melting 
of glaciers, changes in the sea levels, floods and 
droughts and the like as a result, impacts on marine 
and terrestrial ecosystems, and impacts on people 
including food production and health have begun to 
be observed.

In 2020, the average worldwide concentration levels 
for CO2 in the atmosphere causing global warming 
were 413.2ppm, which has increased 49% compared 
to 278ppm, the concentration levels considered the 
average prior to industrialization (circa 1750). (ppm is 
a unit of measurement used to express the amount of 
substances within 1 million molecules in the 
atmosphere.)

Enable people to live more sustainable lifestyles through information, services and products that save precious resources such as energy and water.

Advances in science and technology have improved 
people’s lives, but at the same time, inappropriate 
economic activity can cause damage to the 
environment.
 Building a sustainable society will require not only 
products and services that leverage enterprise 
strengths, but new sustainable lifestyle ideas and 
information. At Kao, we believe that solving these 
issues requires action to accomplish the goals 
embodied in “making the world healthier & cleaner” 
in the Kirei Lifestyle Plan (KLP) as well as for 
decarbonization, zero waste, water conservation and 
air and water pollution prevention.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
We believe that if we cannot realize the sustainable 
manufacturing desired by society, or we are unable to 
offer products and services that change the way 
people live, there will be a negative impact on 
progress toward a sustainable society, we will lose the 
sympathy of consumers and society, and this will 
impair our brand value as well as our profitability and 
competitiveness in the market.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Since our founding, we have strived to enrich daily life 
through our business activities by listening closely to 
consumers, and developing and accumulating our 
own unique technologies over a period of 130 years. 

We believe that by contributing to decarbonization 
and zero waste, water conservation, and air and water 
pollution prevention, we can help realize a sustainable 
society and demonstrate our commitment on a global 
basis.
 In addition, through new ideas for living reinforced 
by educational and awareness-raising efforts, we are 
encouraging consumers around the world to make 
more sustainable choices, and by maximizing the 
results of those efforts, we are helping solve global 
environmental challenges.

Kao’s creating value
Responsible consumption is also an important theme 
of the SDGs. Our mission is to support consumer 
cleanliness, beauty and health in daily life. This 
positions us to offer consumers new ways of living 
through products and services, and collaborate with 
consumers around the world to realize enrichment of 
the lives of people globally and contribute to the 
sustainability of the world.
 Our aim is for a little adaptability and product 
selection on the part of consumers in daily life to 
contribute effortlessly to the realization of a 
sustainable society. We will achieve this through 
Yoki-Monozukuri and daily life solutions.

Sustainable lifestyle promotion 102-43, 306-2 (Waste 2020), 404-2

By proactively working on technical innovations that are 
characteristic of Kao as well as lifestyle solutions, we 
will promote the actions for “making thoughtful choices 
for society” and “making the world healthier & cleaner” 
in the KLP and will realize sustainable human life.
 By offering environmentally friendly, sustainable 
products, and receiving support for our products 
through the choices consumers make, we will build a 
sustainable society.
 In addition, through our wide range of marketing, 
information dissemination, education and awareness-
raising activities, we will strive to foster understanding 
by consumers themselves of the importance of 
sustainable lifestyles, and collaborate with them to 
promote contributions to sustainability.

Four actions
1.  Propose sustainable solutions through 

manufacturing and products themselves
2.  Disseminate information related to sustainable 

lifestyle solutions
3.  Offer opportunities for hands-on learning
4.  Conduct activities in collaboration with companies, 

organizations and public institutions

Through these activities, we will raise consumer 
awareness that the individual daily life choices they 
make can help realize sustainable lifestyles. In 

Policies addition, through our contact with consumers and 
in-store sales promotions, we will promote awareness-
raising activities for a range of topics, including the 
environment, water conservation and hygiene. 
Moreover, we are helping the next generation 
understand the importance of responsible choices.

Education and promotion

We hold e-learning sessions for all employees inside 
the company. Currently we raise awareness on the 
current state and issues of decarbonization, LCA, zero 
waste and water conservation and concrete examples 
of measures. In the future, we plan to supplement 
this curriculum.
 In addition, we hold a monthly environmental 
meeting for manufacturing between ESG divisions, 
research laboratories and business divisions. While 
sharing the rapidly changing situation of consumers, 
governments, government agencies, industries and 
retailers, we share technology and confirm our progress 
for Yoki-Monozukuri to contribute to a sustainable society.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

We disseminate life hacks useful for consumers and 
our intentions and solutions. By providing information 

about the basic functionality of our products as well 
as guidance for their use, we promote a reduced 
environmental impact when consumers use these 
household products.
 Moreover, we also disseminate information from 
various events and the Kao Eco-Lab Museum.

Corporate customers (retailers)
We propose a sustainable lifestyle via internet and 
stores in a joint campaign with retailers. In addition, 
we also promote the achievement of highly 
productive logistics that incorporates the realization of 
work style reforms while also proposing to retailers 
environmentally friendly products and collaboration 
on initiatives.

Suppliers
At each stage, from raw material procurement to 
production and transport, we coordinate with 
numerous business partners in our efforts to realize a 
sustainable society.

Peer companies
The resource-circulating society cannot be realized by 
a single enterprise. An industry-wide change in 
awareness will be necessary. We are promoting 
initiatives that transcend corporate frameworks.

National and local governments
We are working with local governments to collect 
used refill packs of detergent, shampoo and other 
products, and promoting their reprocessing into resin.

Framework

Of the 19 actions included in our KLP, improved 
quality of life, habits for cleanliness, beauty & health, 
universal product design, sustainable lifestyle 
promotion and purpose driven brands are being 
promoted as a common framework. 
 The ESG Managing Committee, which meets six 
times a year, deliberates on these matters under the 
supervision of the Board of Directors. The committee is 
chaired by the President, and its members include 
directors and executive officers responsible for ESG, 
Business, R&D, Product Quality Management, SCM, 
Sales, etc., helping the committee to coordinate its 
activities with our business activities. The committee 
reports on its activities to the Board of Directors at least 
once a year, and receives oversight from the board.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

Mid- to long-term targets
Cumulative number of people reached by awareness-
raising activities for promoting environmentally 
friendly lifestyles and realizing a sustainable world. 

Our target is to reach an accumulated 100 million 
people from 2016 to 2030. 
 This indicates the number reached by awareness-
raising activities using products and services, various 
means of disseminating information to raise 
awareness (including websites and social media) and 
activities provided by Kao employees.
 Currently, these activities are focused on Japan 
and Asia, but we will expand them worldwide in the 
long-term.
 Based on two of the three commitments in the 
KLP (“making thoughtful choices for society” and 
“making the world healthier & cleaner”), we will raise 
awareness of more sustainable lifestyles in 
collaboration with consumers.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Social impacts
By raising awareness of sustainable lifestyles, we 
promote ethical consumption and solution of social 
challenges, which can lead to changes in behavior.

Business impacts
Aware consumers choose Kao products actively. This 
leads to greater loyalty to Kao products, and enhances 
our brand value, profitability and competitiveness.

Performance
Cumulative number of people reached by 
awareness-raising activities for promoting 
environmentally friendly lifestyles and realizing a 
sustainable world
Cumulative total up to 2021: 3.10 million people

As a continuation of our past initiatives, we 
further reduced plastic and used more recycled 
materials. Our main initiatives include:
•  Total elimination of eye-catching plastic stickers
•  Launch of recycled PET for use in PET bottles
•  Discontinuation of color swatch samples placed 

on the shelves at stores selling hair dye
•  Begin using chemically recycled PET materials 

for cosmetics

In addition, we will expand field testing for 
recycling through collaboration with retailers and 
local governments. Our main initiatives include:
•  Launch of field testing in collaboration with 

Lion Corporation, Welcia Yakkyoku and 
Hamakyorex

•  Launch of detergent etc. sold by weight for a 
limited time in collaboration with Welcia 
Yakkyoku

•  Project launch in collaboration with retailers, 
manufacturers, recyclers and Kobe City

•  Participation in used plastic collection field 
testing in Kitakyushu City

Furthermore, we launched a website that has 
become a hub for our environmental information 
for consumers.

Reviews of performance
Even during COVID-19, we raised awareness on 
environmentally friendly lifestyles and promoted 
activities to realize a sustainable society as 
planned.
 In 2021, we started numerous field tests for 
the recycling of plastic packaging. Initially, we 
placed stations to collect used containers. In the 
process, collaborations began with many 
retailers, manufacturers and local governments.
 Future issues are improvements to 
consumers’ awareness of recycling in tandem 
with the expansion of collection stations, 
establishment of technology to recycle collected 
plastic, and the acceleration of field testing to 
effectively use recycled plastic.

Sustainable lifestyle promotion 306-2 (Waste 2020)

Solving problems through 
Yoki-Monozukuri manufacturing 
and through products

We have created environmentally friendly products and 
product packaging innovations̶exemplified by our 
sustainable detergent base, single-rinse laundry 
detergents and rapid-rinse dishwashing detergents and 
shampoos̶and promoted sustainable lifestyle solutions 
based on manufacturing and products themselves.
 Since 2020, we started numerous activities about 
packaging and store displays aimed at a sustainable 
society and were able to achieve several of the goals 
for these in 2021.

Addressing the environmental challenges 
presented by containers
We announced our intention to transition almost 
completely from plastic bottles to refillable film 
containers for products like shampoo and conditioner 
by 2030, and are aiming to deploy new technology 
effectively to reduce the environmental impact. In 
addition, we have set a goal of boosting the annual 
quantity of environmentally friendly, innovative film 
packaging to 300 million units by 2030.
 We have strived to drive adoption of disposable 
refill pouches, which have reduced plastic waste from 
original containers by approximately 78%, as well as 
Raku-raku Eco Pack Refill containers, which have 

Our initiatives

reduced the same type of waste by around 80%.
 In addition, we are pushing forward the proposal to 
stop using the bottles and replace them with the Smart 
Holder pump which lets you use the product repeatedly 
without refilling and use nearly all of the contents when 
used as a set with the Raku-raku Eco Pack Refill as well 
as the Raku-raku Switch which makes it easy to 
dispense a uniform amount of liquid with a light touch 
when used with the Raku-raku Eco Pack Refill.

In the future, we will challenge ourselves with new 
technology while accelerating the widespread usage 
of our existing solutions.

Eliminating eye-catching plastic 
stickers completely

While eye-catching stickers made of plastic can 
convey product advantages or instructions for correct 

product use, they also lead to increased plastic waste 
and CO2 emissions when burned.
 We aimed to eliminate the use of eye-catching 
plastic stickers by the end of 2021, and achieved this 
by moving information from the conventional sticker 
to the product bottle, and using other means to 
convey any needed information. When this could 
pose a significantly detriment to the purchaser due to 
the elimination of messages on usage or prevention 
of mistaken purchases, we used FSC-certified or other 
certified paper.

On Kao Plaza provided for our customers, we also 
posted information on the elimination of eye-catching 
plastic stickers and messages from our employees 
who conducted this initiative.

Launch of recycled PET for use in PET bottles
In addition to the approaches we have developed so 
far to realize a plastic circulating society, we will make 
full-scale use of recycled plastic in plastic packaging 
in Japan. By 2025, we will replace all bottles made of 
PET material for household products in Japan, which 
use large amounts of plastic, with 100% recycled PET.
 We started implementing this with the Attack Zero 
and CuCute Clear Foam Spray launched in April 2021, 
and then implemented this in the Bath Magiclean 
Airjet launched in September.
 In the future, we will promote the transition to 
recycled PET containers by focusing on products 
most frequently used by consumers and which 
therefore have the greatest impact on the 
environment.

Switch from CuCute Clear Foam Spray refill 
bottles to pouch types
The improved CuCute Clear Foam Spray refill 
containers, newly released in April 2021 switched 
from the conventional bottle types to pouch types in 
order to reduce the amount of plastic used.

Discontinuation of color swatch samples placed 
on the shelves at stores selling hair dye and 
reduction in the usage of plastic
Since October 2021, we no longer offer color swatch 
samples for all our hair dye and hair manicure 
products in Japan as a promotional material to select 
a color at stores. In doing so, 56 tons maximum of 
plastic used yearly to produce these color swatch 
samples were reduced.
 Instead, we introduced a hair color simulation as a 
support tool for customers to select a color. By 
scanning the QR code* on the store POP or the back

Begin using chemically recycled PET materials 
for cosmetics
We use chemically recycled PET (polyethylene 
terephthalate) produced by PET Refine Technology. 
Co., Ltd., a group company of JEPLAN Inc., in bottle 
type containers for cosmetics. Since June 2021, we 
have been incorporating this starting with the bottle 
for the Twany cosmetics brand. Going forward, we 
will promote initiatives to achieve horizontal recycling 
making new bottles from used 
bottles (i.e. a recycling method 
in which a used product is 
recycled into a product with 
similar application) by collecting 
used containers and reusing 
them in cosmetics PET bottles.

Pilot plant operation for film packaging recycling 
at Wakayama Research Laboratories
Since June 2021, we have operated a pilot plant to 
test regeneration treatments for film packaging. Once 
the used refill packs amassed from various locations 
are sorted, crushed, cleansed, pulverized, dried and 
dissolved, they are reverted to pellets, the raw 
material for plastic products. While performing 
various types of testing and field using this facility, we 
aim at horizontal recycling to ultimately revert a 
package into another package.

Disseminating information 
related to sustainable living
Dissemination and sharing of information with 
consumers
We use our website, social media and corporate 
communication activities to disseminate and share a 
wide range of information with stakeholders. These 
efforts convey our activities to consumers, and enable 
us to reflect consumer opinion in Yoki-Monozukuri.
 We use principally the following to disseminate 
and share information relating to sustainable lifestyles 
with consumers.

Kao’s environmental information website for 
better living
Since September 2021, we have published a website 
that has become a hub for our environmental 
information for consumers, in which we disseminate 
life hacks useful for consumers and our intentions and

Recycling field testing activities in collaboration 
with Lion Corporation
To carry out field testing for segregated collection of 
used refill packs, since October 2020 we have begun 
working with Ito-Yokado Co., Ltd. on RecyCreation 
activities. RecyCreation means upcycling to create 
more enjoyable and better goods without reverting 
them back to the same product they were in the past 
by combining recycling in which used goods are 
reverted to raw materials and creation in which new 
value is generated.
 In the field testing, special recycling boxes are 
placed at stores for consumers to return used refill 
containers of detergent, shampoo and other products 
from Kao and Lion Corporation. Refill packs collected 
in this way can be recycled into blocks and other 
shapes for a variety of uses, such as events to convey 
the importance 
of recycling.

In July 2021, we reported the progress of field testing. 
From October 30, 2020 to June 15, 2021, we 
collected approximately 5,200 pieces of film 
packaging. Thanks to the cooperation of the 
Ito-Yokado Hikifune Store and its customers, we were 
able to collect about twice the amount we had 
planned for.
 We are working to further expand our collection 
initiatives.

Field testing in collaboration with Lion 
Corporation, Welcia Yakkyoku and Hamakyorex
Since October 2021, we have collaborated with Lion 
Corporation, Welcia Yakkyoku and Hamakyorex to 
begin field testing for recycling used refill packaging 
of household products as part of our efforts to realize 
a plastic packaging resource circulating society.
 Welcia Yakkyoku places collection boxes at a total 
of 28 locations, and collects used refill packs of 
detergent, shampoo and other products. Hamakyorex 
implements the revised logistics process to make it 
more efficient and reduce its environmental impact by 
picking up used refill packs on the return trip of trucks 
delivering products to Welcia Yakkyoku stores. Kao 
and Lion Corporation recycle the collected refill packs 
into blocks that can be used at stores and throughout

explore technologies for horizontal recycling to reuse 
these as film packaging and to design film packaging 
that is easier to recycle.

Launch of detergent etc. sold by weight for  
a limited time in collaboration with Welcia Yakkyoku
As one option to keep containers from being thrown 
away, we have placed a corner called Hakariuri-do at 
two Welcia Yakkyoku stores to sell four products by 
weight̶concentrated liquid detergent for clothing, 
detergent for formal clothing, fabric softener and 
dishwashing detergent. 
We refill customers’ 
desired amount in bottles 
they brought into the 
store or the original bottle 
for the Hakariuri-do 
corner (for the customer 
to bring in next time).

Collaboration with local governments
Recycling project in collaboration with retailers, 
manufacturers, recyclers and Kobe City
Since October 2021, we have recycled used refill 
packs of household products in collaboration with 
retailers, household products manufacturers, 
recyclers (resource recycling business operators) and 
Kobe City and has been participating in the Kobe 
Plastic Next: Joining Forces to Recycle Refill Packs, a 
project aimed at realizing the resource-circulating 
society.
 We call on residents of Kobe to collect used refill 
packs for detergents, shampoos and other products 
and gather these refill packs they brought into the 
collection boxes placed in a total of 75 locations at 
retail stores so as to efficiently limit our environmental 
impact. Recyclers and manufacturers are working 
together to achieve horizontal recycling to reuse film 
type packaging from the collected refill packs, as well 
as turn them into recycled products that are useful in 
daily life.

Participation in used plastic collection field 
testing in Kitakyushu City
Since July 2021, we have participated in the Meguru 
Box Project, a pilot project for recycling used plastics 
in Kitakyushu City, which was launched by Kyushu 
Circular Economy Partnership, a corporate alliance 
aiming to achieve a circular economy in the Kyushu 
area. We place boxes to collect used plastic bottles 
and pouches at retail stores and public facilities in 
Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka Prefecture and request 
separated collection from residents. We promote 
horizontal recycling of collected plastic bottles while 
verifying the framework to promote resource 
collection through the use of information and 
communication technology. More than ten companies 
and organizations collaborate with the goal of 
creating a resource recycling system.

Collaborative Plastic Recycling Program in 
Higashi-Yamato City, Tokyo
Since June 2021, Unilever Japan and Kao have been 
jointly collecting used packaging for household 
products, aiming at making new bottles from used 
bottles. Collection boxes are being installed at ten 
locations within Higashi-Yamato City, Tokyo, for the 
collection of used packaging that have been washed 
and dried after their use by households. The collected 
packaging is then delivered to Veolia Jenets K.K., a 

leading company in waste management and 
recycling, where the packaging are sorted, washed 
and processed, and used in verification testing of 
horizontal recycling technology for transforming used 
bottles into new bottles.

In September 2021, we reported on our progress. With 
the collaboration of citizens of Higashi-Yamoto City, we 
collected 1,426 used product packaging, approximately 
42kg, from June 1 to August 18, 2021. Going forward, 
we will promote the expansion of these collections and 
more verification of horizontal recycling technology 
making new bottles from used bottles.

RecyCreation activities with five local governments
We are working with Kitami City, Hokkaido Prefecture, 
Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture, Onagawa-cho, 
Miyagi Prefecture, Kamikatsu-cho, Tokushima Prefecture 
and Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture to collect used 
refill packs of detergent, shampoo and other products, 
and promoting their reprocessing into recycled resin.
 Collected packs are reprocessed in blocks called 
Okaeri-blocks, which are useful in the daily lives of 
the cities’ residents.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
Globally, there are environmental problems such as 
climate change and marine plastic, as well as hygiene 
problems including infectious disease pandemics. In 
Japan, due to the arrival of a hyper-aging society and 
the diversification of values and ethnicities, the 
situation we live in is changing dramatically.
 As with changes in society and the global 
environment, consumer awareness is also changing. 
Not wanting to add to waste caused by mass 
consumerism and purchasing, in response to this 
more steps are being taken to choose only those 
things which are necessary. In light of this, the 
definition of the concept of ownership as something 
owned by a single individual is expanding to include 
sharing. Now there is demand for a mindset where 
lifestyle is something created together with 
consumers.

Kao’s creating value
By clarifying the purpose of each brand, and based 
upon that, implementing various communication and 
activities that resonate with stakeholders beginning 
with consumers, and encourage them to align their 
actions with ours, we aim not only to enrich people’s 
lives, but to contribute to the sustainability of society 
as well as the Earth.

Every Kao brand will have a purpose that offers solutions to social issues within the communities or societies it touches.

www.kao.co.jp/lifei/support/50/ (Japanese)

Contributions to the SDGs

 
The social issues each brand contributes to depend 
on its category and the value it provides. For example, 
in order to contribute to the fundamental SDG goal of 
“No one will be left behind,” we are developing and 
providing easy-to-use containers for our products. The 
zigzag notches on our shampoo bottles make it 
possible to distinguish shampoo from rinse through 
touch. This enables not only people with visual 
impairments, but anyone with their eyes closed to 
identify bottles by touch when washing their hair.
 Regardless of disability or age, we strive to 
develop products that are safe, easy to understand 
and easy to use for all people.
 In addition, our products that require fewer rinse 
cycles and less quantity save on water and electricity, 
helping to reduce environmental impact.
 Each of our brands has a different purpose based 
on various social issues, and by responsibly 
manufacturing products and providing them to 
consumers, we believe that their usage is able to 
contribute to the achievement of the 12th SDG Goal.
 To this end, we will not make these efforts alone, 
but will coordinate and cooperate with local 
government bodies, retailers, competing companies 

in our industry and others to elevate the speed and 
level at which social challenges are solved.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

Important stakeholders
Consumers are the most important stakeholders 
concerning our business activities. It is important to 
foster empathy and action by creating consumer 
awareness using various means beyond utilizing 
different types of media and storefronts. These means 
include school education for the next generation and 
working with local governments and worksites to take 
initiatives toward a hyper-aging society.

Next-generation awareness raising
As part of our activities to educate the next 
generation, since 2009 we have been providing hand-
washing lessons as visiting classes for lower grades at 
elementary schools with our Bioré u brand, which 
promotes good physical hygiene.
 However, due to the ongoing effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, in 2021, as in the previous year, 
we provided free teaching materials for teachers to 

When it comes to Kao’s brand purpose, we refer to 
what positive impacts we can make on daily life, 
society and the Earth.
 The activities of our purpose driven brand include the 
following efforts: (1) an explanation of why the brand 
exists, (2) specific brand actions, (3) communication.
 During our first year of these activities in 2019, we 
focused on (1) an explanation of why the brand exists. 
From 2020 forward, we have been focusing on 
creating change in the world through (2) specific 
brand actions and (3) communication, becoming an 
entity that contributes to the solution of social issues 
in collaboration with consumers and society.

Education and promotion

Communication with consumers is essential for making 
a positive impact on daily life, society and the Earth. In 
order to achieve this, we provide educational training to 
staff in order to reconfirm the significance of our 
existence as a brand based on consumer perspective, 
working with ESG management and global unity.
 In addition, conveying brand attitude and participating 
in awareness-raising activities in order to create social 
change together with consumers is important. For 
instance, with Bioré u, we were able to develop a foam 
hand soap that makes hand washing easier, along with a 

conduct their own classes. In response to the 
pandemic, we developed a new hygiene habits 
program to help children in the early grades of 
elementary school enjoy learning the importance of 
hand-washing and mask-wearing, and acquire 
hygiene habits. We provided information about the 
program to approximately 20,000 schools nationwide, 
and more than 6,000 are using it.
 In addition, we developed a parallel program for 
children with hearing impairments, which we have 
been offering since September 2021, to help them 
acquire hygiene habits while having fun.

Initiatives for a hyper-aging society
In cooperation with local governments and worksites, 
we are working to extend healthy life expectancy 
through visualizing how much visceral fat they have at 
measurement sessions, encouraging citizens to walk 
and offering them healthy meal menus.
 Under the Healthya brand, through the LINE we 
are conducting a service that allows users to easily 
check their percentage of visceral fat.

Purpose driven brands

Of the 19 actions included in our Kirei Lifestyle Plan 
(KLP), improved quality of life, habits for cleanliness, 
beauty & health, universal product design, sustainable 
lifestyle promotion and purpose driven brands are 
being promoted as a common framework. 
 The ESG Managing Committee, which meets six 
times a year, deliberates on these matters under the 
supervision of the Board of Directors. The committee 
is chaired by the President, and its members include 
directors and executive officers responsible for ESG, 
Business, R&D, Product Quality Management, SCM, 
Sales, etc., helping the committee to coordinate its 
activities with our business activities. The committee 
reports on its activities to the Board of Directors at 
least once a year, and receives oversight from the 
board.

Framework Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

Performance in 2021

Performance
In 2019, we reviewed our brand design from a KLP 
perspective, characterized the type of positive 
impact it will have on people’s lives, society and 
the Earth, and began to define our purpose.
 From 2020, we began taking clear, concrete 
actions in line with these purposes. For example, 
we stated that both the purpose of our MyKirei by 
KAO brand, launched in the U.S., as well as our 
athletia brand, launched in Japan, would be to 
contribute to a sustainable global environment.
 In 2021, we completed the process of defining 
purposes for all domestic brands. Based on these 
definitions, we are initiating specific actions and 
communications to create positive change in the 
world.

Brands that epitomize the Kirei 
Lifestyle

MyKirei by KAO brand, epitomizing Kao’s Kirei 
Lifestyle, was launched in the U.S. in April 2020.
 MyKirei by KAO was created with the brand 
concept “Every facet of daily life is filled with caring,” 
and a brand purpose of providing unique products 
with low environmental impact that anyone can use 
with ease, made possible through our Essential 
Research.
 We used our company developed Air-in Film 
Bottle for the first time with MyKirei by KAO. Made 
with flexible materials, these bottles gain their rigidity 
through an air fill, allowing them to stand upright like 
a traditional bottle, and compared to pump bottles, 
uses 50% less plastic. Furthermore, our line of refills 
encourages consumers to keep using the same bottle 
pump again and again. Additionally, compared to 
other conventional bottles it allows one to finish using 
product in them with less liquid waste, making it 
more environmentally friendly.

Our initiatives

athletia (known in Japan as e’quipe)
athletia is for people who live active lives. It was 
designed for people of any gender or age. No matter 
how one’s skin condition fluctuates, athletia preserves 
skin’s natural suppleness. Launched in February 2020, 
it was founded on these concepts as well as 
controlling the balance between “dynamic” and 
“tranquil.”
 Everything from its ingredients and raw materials 
incorporates the concept of clean beauty, in 
consideration of its impact on people, society and 
nature.
 Common ingredients found in the brand such as 
ashitaba and perilla are cultivated on farms using

from natural, plant-based essential oils.
 We use as much recycled and bio-based materials 
for packaging as possible, and actively use recycled 
and recyclable materials for the interior, flooring, 
fixtures and decorations that make up our flagship 
store in Omotesando. We strive to make the best 
choices possible, aiming for a more sustainable 
future.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
The economic and production activities that have 
supported our way of life also produce carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gas emissions that cause temperatures 
to rise, and therefore, mitigation measures as a strategy to 
reduce these emissions need to be accelerated as an issue 
of the highest priority. So far we have taken steps to 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions, such as making efficient 
use of natural resources and developing energy-saving and 
water-saving products, but to realize the future 
decarbonized society, resource circularity initiatives for 
plastic packaging are another important cross-industry 
issue.
 In addition to taking steps to cope with the heat as 
part of adaption measures to reduce risks associated 
with heat waves and water disasters caused by these 
rising temperatures, we also need to build a more 
resilient society.
 COVID-19 emerged in 2019 and has changed how 
we think and act in our daily lives. R&D activities on 
hygiene, diagnosis and treatments as part of adaption 
measures for new and re-emerging infectious diseases̶
whose occurrence is said to be only be a matter of 
time̶are increasingly important.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has become an 
opportunity to take another look at the connections 
between people and the wider society. It has also 
reminded us of the importance of social acceptance for 
diverse values and enabling people’s physical, mental 
and social needs to be met (well-being).

Pursue Essential Research to unleash breakthrough innovations that help realize more sustainable lifestyles by solving social issues and easing people’s 
pains.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
It is our responsibility to create a society that offers 
safety and security. Our goal is to realize enriched 
lives and a sustainable society in which no one is left 
behind, where everyone can confidently lead Kirei 
lives every day with vitality and peace of mind.
 In this, the frequent occurrence of natural 
disasters caused by climate change, environmental 
pollution caused by increasing amounts of waste, and 
water insecurity not only lower consumers’ quality of 
life (QOL)̶they are also serious risks in terms of the 
continuity of our business activities. Changes in 
society due to the global pandemic in particular have 
also transformed the role of companies in society.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Since our founding, we have embraced the ethos of 
responding to social issues with safe and reliable 
quality. Swiftly identifying changes in consumers’ 
lifestyles and social issues, we use science to reveal the 
mechanism of phenomena and, using technology, 
connect this to product creation that meets diverse 
needs. Going forward as well, we will be able to give 
consumers and customers new experiences and 
satisfaction through products and services that leverage 
our strengths in research findings and technology 
assets built up in wide-ranging business domains, as 
we have done with precise interfacial control 
technology, where we have built up expertise and 
deployed it for a diverse range of products from 
clothing to precision electronic components.

 Various risks including social issues and uncertainty 
that cannot be solved by one company alone, for 
example environmental and infectious disease 
countermeasures, are projected to increase. Along with 
strengthening internal collaboration, while cooperating 
broadly with consumers, customers, industry, 
government, academia and others, we will increase the 
velocity of our technology and product development 
and make daily life more fulfilling for consumers around 
the world with our unique and novel approaches.

Kao’s creating value
Through the fusion of science and technology, we will 
continue striving to solve issues from the perspective 
of people, society and the environment, and to create 
value.

The human perspective
We have strived to enhance consumer QOL. From the 
human perspective, together with ways to reduce the 
burden of housework and realize diverse beauty that 
we have offered so far, we also continue to conduct 
research on protecting people from bacteria and 
viruses and preventing lifestyle diseases and geriatric 
syndromes, with protecting consumers’ lives as our 
highest priority.
 In addition, by combining our research findings 
and scientific data on the skin and health that we have 
collected so far with biological information including 
RNA, we aim to offer individually customized, 
precision life-care proposals and realize well-being so 
that everyone can lead comfortable, beautiful and 
healthy lives.

The social perspective
From the social perspective, we are deploying our 
expertise in the mechanisms of propagation and 
inactivation of the causes of infectious diseases, 
revealed through exhaustive research on microbes 
and viruses, to create products and services, and 
making use of this knowledge in infection 
countermeasures taken in daily life, public health, 
hospitals and other medical facilities.
 Moreover, we are contributing to the creation of a 
safe society by offering highly functional chemicals for 
road and bridge construction such as Visco Top, which 
does not pollute water, as well as asphalt additives 
that enhance pavement durability and useful life.

The environmental perspective
From the environmental perspective, we are working to 
realize a recycle-based society by adhering to the 4Rs for 
packaging, reducing the use of plastic, recycling used 
refill packs for further use, and developing technology to 
recycle reprocessed materials back into containers and 
film. In addition, we are also attempting to create 
business by taking waste materials and turning them into 
new value. We are also working to reduce the 
environmental impact of consumer product contents, and 
continue to research ways to utilize natural raw materials 
such as inedible biomass and to reduce the amount of 
water and energy consumed during product use.

Contributions to the SDGs

We have adopted the following three basic policies for 
our R&D activities.
1.  Create the seeds for new businesses
2.  Bring about innovation that creates new customers’ 

needs in existing business domains
3.  Share scientific technologies with society
 Based on these basic policies, we seek to enrich 
people’s lives through innovation and advance our 
research activities while embracing two approaches.
 One is pursuing Essential Research, which is 
driven by our passion for discovery. Essential refers to 
the universal nature and root causes that are revealed 
through exhaustive investigation of objects and 
phenomena using the lens of science, which offer 
clues to solutions to issues and spark ideas for new 

Policies technologies and consumer and customer value 
creation.
 The other approach is promoting technology 
innovation to create the seeds for new businesses and 
products. We have many technology assets built up 
through Essential Research on humans and materials. 
In addition to deploying our core technologies such as 
interfacial control, reframing our technology assets in 
terms of solving social issues will enable us to design 
products that will strengthen our existing businesses 
and realize the Kirei Lifestyle. And we will bring new 
businesses to fruition by creating technology 
solutions and value using backcasting.
 By continuing to build on these activities, we will 
create innovations that will have major positive impact 
on people’s lifestyles and contribute to people and 
society through Yoki-Monozukuri.

Education and promotion

To advance our R&D activities, we must develop individual 
researchers’ advanced specialization, creativity and originality 
as well as foster a culture in which many researchers work 
together to take on challenges in new fields.
 For this purpose, we have established a research report 
database that all researchers can access to independently 
browse internal research findings, technology assets and 
the latest research results. We also provide opportunities to 
engage with leading-edge science and technology through 
lectures and technical guidance provided by outside 
experts.
 In addition, we hold presentation sessions with 
participation and discussion open to all researchers to 
create opportunities for collaboration where new discoveries 
can be made through the exchange of ideas. Using an 
online conferencing tool, over 100 researchers participate 
each session, which is helping generate innovation. 
Focusing on efficiency gains through the use of digital tools 
as well as dialogue, we are establishing awareness for 
tackling challenges related to realizing the ideal sustainable 
society of the future.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

Multi-faceted linkage and collaboration between industry, 
government and universities are necessary to solve 
challenging environmental and social issues. Open 
innovation is one example of this approach. New value is 
created when two or more parties mutually supplement and 

combine their technology strengths, and this enables 
products and services to be quickly delivered to consumers. 
Especially when it comes to realizing a sustainable society, 
collaborating with companies that are tackling the same 
social issues is necessary. When it comes to our efforts for 
packaging as part of resource circularity, we collaborate 
through field testing, aiming to establish technology and 
realize swift social implementation.
 By presenting important knowledge gained through 
R&D activities at academic conferences and through 
publications, we strive to propagate science and technology. 
This has earned us recognition, including awards for various 
technologies that reduce environmental impact.

Framework

We are promoting matrix management in our R&D Division 
to gather knowledge across business and technological 
boundaries. Each of our research laboratories reports 
directly to the R&D Division, with flexible cross-team 
coordination between the Fundamental Technology 
Research and Product Development Research laboratories 
as the situation demands. This helps us also respond swiftly 
to climate change trends with product suggestions.
 To generate innovation, we need to transform technology 
into new consumer and customer value and realize swift 
social implementation in the form of products and services.
 In our existing business domains of beauty, health, 
cleanliness and the environment, our Product Development 
Research laboratories link their activities with our business 
strategy to quickly establish policy for the proposed value 
and continue offering innovative products.

 In new business domains, we are examining solutions 
we can offer in healthcare and skin care as well as new 
businesses such as hygiene services that target social 
issues such as infectious diseases, population aging and 
treatments, based on deploying technologies and data we 
have built up in fundamental technology research and 
product development research as well as collaborations 
involving leading-edge external technologies.
 By sharing these R&D policies with management and 
business divisions at strategy meetings, etc., and by 
confirming strategy implementation and progress in annual 
plans, we are increasing the speed of our decision-making 
and velocity of our global growth.

Performance in 2021

In terms of infection countermeasures, we 
launched body wash products that wash away 
viruses and bacteria as well as products that have 
lasting antiviral properties. We are developing 
recycling technology to take used plastic 
containers and turn them into products for the 
same application, toward realization of a resource-
circulating society.
 At the Kao Group Technology innovation 
session in November 2018, we announced our 
new technologies in five domains: skin, health, 
hair, surface chemistry and environment.
 One of these is Bio IOS, an environmentally 
friendly surfactant obtained from natural raw 
materials that do not readily compete with food 
resources. Including the surfactant in product 
formulations makes it possible to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions, and it received the Minister of 
Economy, Trade and Industry Award in the Green 
and Sustainable Chemistry Awards organized by 
the Japan Association for Chemical Innovation.
 In 2019, we deployed our Fine Fiber 
Technology, which forms an extremely thin, natural 
membrane on the skin through deposition of 
ultra-fine fibers, in a skin care serum. We are 
advancing research to deploy the technology in 
more products, and in 2021 we found that its 

unique structural properties attach to and remove 
PM2.5 and other polluting airborne molecules, and 
that it offers functional protection from friction and 
other physical irritants.
 Skin surface lipids-RNA monitoring makes 
visible precise, day-by-day changes in skin and 
body condition, and in 2020 we began testing its 
use in beauty counseling. The expertise to estimate 
the progression of skin aging, which differs from 
person to person, and the potential for early 
diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, are the results of 
open innovation, and we plan to connect these 
results to business and solving social issues.
 We believe that we will have achieved 
innovation not just when we propose products and 
services that mobilize the features of the 
respective technologies, but when this changes 
how people live their lives and enriches society. 
We are advancing proposals as planned for our 
long-term goals. In this, it is not only the number 
of proposals that is important but also the speed 
with which the technology is deployed in products 
and services. We are looking at ways to measure 
the actual impact of innovation sparked through 
these efforts while quickly meeting market and 
customer requests and deploying unique 
technologies in wide-ranging products.

Essential Research on Humans: Product development 
for consumer-focused infection countermeasures
As infection countermeasures, we are proposing 
products with our Essential Research and 
technologies that alleviate people’s worries.
 We learned that ethanol-based hand sanitizer 
tends to not get adequately rubbed all over the hands. 
While it had been a challenge to dispense our existing 
sanitizer as foam, Bioré Guard Sanitizer Foam is 
designed to dispense as a foam using a pump foamer. 
This makes it less prone to spilling and easier to apply 
the active ingredient all over the hands as the foam 
changes to a liquid after being dispensed. In 
Indonesia, we released the gel-type Bioré Guard Gel 
Hand Soap Eucalyptus Scent Antibacterial, which 
matches local lifestyle preferences.
 People are also more aware of viruses and bacteria 
adhering to them while they are away from home. To 
meet needs related to this and expand hygiene 
practices to the entire body, we released a medicated 
body wash product that can also be used for washing 
the hair and is formulated with sanitizing ingredients. 
For clothing as well, we are offering Resesh Disinfecting 
EX Protect Guard, which has lasting ability to reduce 
the amount of virus adhering to clothing just by 
spraying it on clothes before going out.
 We announced our findings about the 
homeostatic natural bacterial and viral barrier function 

of human hands and individual differences in the 
effect and how lactic acid contained in sweat secreted 
from the hands, the pH level and temperature of the 
hands play an influential role in this function. Based 
on new findings from our Essential Research on 
Humans, as well as our wide range of product 
offerings, we will develop products that safeguard 
people from infections in various daily situations and 
that are easy to use for everyone from children to the 
elderly.

Essential Research on Humans: Protecting 
human lives by opening up new domains
We are opening up new domains for protecting 
human lives by making maximum use of our 
technology assets. One of these is our obtaining of 
VHH antibodies, which have the ability to inhibit 
(neutralize) infection from novel coronavirus (SARS-
CoV-2), in 2020. Kitasato University, Epsilon Molecular 
Engineering Inc. (EME) and Kao collaborated on this 
research. EME provided a screening system (cDNA 
display) able to select VHH antibody candidates in a 
short period of time. Using this, we prepared the 
candidate VHH antibodies, and together with Kitasato 
University confirmed the binding of the VHH 
antibodies to novel coronavirus particles and their 
neutralizing capacity. We also reported that nasal 
delivery of these antibodies inhibits replication of the 
novel coronavirus in animal models.
 We aim to contribute to preparing candidate VHH 
antibodies and to build basic production technology 

for VHH antibodies using our technology to cultivate 
and genetically modify Bacillus subtilis bacterium built 
up through work in enzymes for laundry detergents. 
Currently, the National Institutes of Natural Sciences 
and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. have also joined this project. 
Under the Japan Agency for Medical Research and 
Development, we are developing antibody-based 
therapeutics for COVID-19, including variants, as well 
as developing antibody-based therapeutics for 
respiratory infections.

Essential Research on Materials: Social 
implementation of environmentally friendly 
functional materials

Cellulose nanofiber
We are also working to develop technology that not 
only removes dirt and stains from the target objects, 
but also modifies their surface so that dirt and stains 
do not adhere to them. Taking hints from the 
functions and structures of living organisms, such as 
the surface of snail shells and the pitcher fluid of 
tropical pitcher plants, we combined these hints with 
cellulose nanofiber (CNF), a high performance, 
sustainable material derived from wood that is 
attracting attention globally. We then successfully 
applied the result to products and created surfaces 
where dirt and stains did not stick but simply slid off. 
Hydrophobic modified CNF blends well with 
lubricating oil and keeps lubricating oil firmly adhered 
to the surface of objects. Examples of applying this 
technology are having bird droppings slide off solar 
panels and having snow accumulation slide off roofs. 
In water, hydrophobic modified CNF emulsifies in the 
shape of beads coated with lubricating oil, and these 
beads form a structure on the surface of target 
objects to create a laminating film able to maintain a 
slippery surface over a long period of time. This 
aqueous coating agent is safe and reliable for workers 
and the environment.

 We will create new businesses and strive to 
realize sustainability in society by reusing waste 
materials and creating natural materials with higher 
performance.

NEWTLAC 5000 asphalt additive
With the recent widespread uptake of hybrid and 
electric vehicles and future self-driving vehicles, 
vehicles driving on the same roads and heavier 
vehicles will become placing greater burden on road 
pavement. The importance of creating more durable 
pavement is expected to rise. Using upcycling 
technology for low-quality waste PET, we have created 
NEWTLAC 5000, an asphalt pavement modifier that 
can be easily used in road construction. Adding this 
product to pavement strengthens the adhesion of 
rocks and sand to asphalt, and increases pavement 
durability more than five-fold compared with standard 
pavement. This product is the aggregate of our core 
technologies in interfacial properties control and 
functional molecular design. Going forward, we aim to 
have a large number of customers use this product 
and contribute to sustainability in society.

Employees’ voice

When Kao was pivoting to ESG-driven management, 

we created this product through a series of 

discussions with sales and research divisions by 

focusing on the serious social issue of waste plastic, 

with the goal of creating a product able to make 

greater environmental contributions.

Quickly creating a product that met the needs of 

the times was the result of innovation born from an 

“all Kao” approach.

We will continue offering pavement that is gentle 

to both people and the global environment and 

contribute to safe and reliable community 

development.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
Major issues in product raw materials procurement 
include local environmental destruction and loss of 
biodiversity due to indiscriminate development, 
protection of workers’ human rights, safety and health 
management, forced migration of local residents and 
health hazards in the supply chain.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
Procurement risks may include, among others, the 
inability to procure raw materials as planned due to 
fluctuations in prices caused by various factors 
including abnormal weather, natural disasters, 
geopolitical influences and international conflicts. 
Procurement risk may also arise when rapid changes 
in demand, or problems originating with suppliers, 
destabilize procurement and disrupt the supply of 
products to the market.
 In addition, our raw materials are heavily 
dependent on natural capital such as palm oil, paper 
and pulp. We must fulfill our corporate social 
responsibility by achieving sustainable procurement 
and fully considering environmental issues including 
resource conservation, global warming prevention 
and biodiversity conservation, as well as social issues 
such as safety, health, the labor environment and 

Source our raw materials in a way that protects natural resources, the environment and human rights through supply chain traceability and collaboration with 
suppliers.

human rights. If, as we make efforts to achieve these 
goals, our commitment to sustainable and responsible 
procurement comes to be viewed as insufficient due 
to an issue or issues originating in the supply chain, 
our brand image and credibility may be damaged.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
ESG procurement is important if we are to contribute 
to a sustainable society.
 In terms of ESG procurement for the environment, 
we promote procurement of palm oil, pulp and paper 
based on our “High-Risk” Supply Chain Management 
and Sourcing. In terms of ESG procurement for 
society, we conduct human rights due diligence in 
line with the Kao Human Rights Policy, and supplier 
risk assessments based on our Partnership 
Requirements for Suppliers. In addition, the Kirei 
Lifestyle Plan sets mid- to long-term targets centered 
on ESG procurement through 2030, and promotes 
responsible procurement.
 By continuing these activities, we aim to become 
number one in ESG procurement.

Kao’s creating value
Along with ESG procurement, stable procurement is 
also vitally important in promoting Yoki-Monozukuri to 
provide a stable supply of products to consumers and 
customers. Our Procurement Division is conducting 
responsible procurement along the two axes of ESG 

Responsibility for a sustainable society

Responsibility to our businesses and consumers

Responsibility to our stockholders and employees

Our mission is to achieve three responsible procurement together
with our business partners.

Mission: Responsible sourcing

ESG procurement

Stable procurement

Procurement to improve competitiveness

Contributions to the SDGs

procurement and stable procurement, in addition to 
competitiveness-enhancing procurement.
 By promoting these three procurement-related 
priorities in concert with our suppliers, we can ensure 
that consumers and customers can use our products 
with peace of mind.

Policies

We have formulated Partnership Requirements for 
Suppliers, “High-Risk” Supply Chain Management 
and Sourcing and ESG Promotion Activities with 
Suppliers to facilitate the practical implementation of 
procurement activities in accordance with our Policies 
for Procurement.
 The Policies for Procurement include items 
relating to fairness and equity in trading, adherence to 
laws and ethics, and social responsibility. We seek to 
contribute to the establishment of a sustainable 
society, provide for due consideration for protection of 
natural resources, environmental preservation and 
human rights, and support ESG procurement along 
with compliance with laws and ethics.
 Our Partnership Requirements for Suppliers 
require suppliers to observe their social 
responsibilities, including complying with laws, 
regulations and social norms, protecting human 
rights, ensuring health and safety, and promoting fair 
trade. Our guidelines also enjoin suppliers to consider 
the environment in such areas as environmental 
management systems, biodiversity conservation and 
resource conservation. Our standard contract with 
suppliers clarifies provisions concerning the 
aforementioned issues including the environment, 
human rights and labor.
 We are also committed to sustainable 
procurement based on the “High-Risk” Supply Chain 
Management and Sourcing. We pursue zero 

deforestation at the source in our procurement of raw 
materials including palm oil and paper. We support 
the NDPE* and request that suppliers and supplier 
group companies comply with it.
* NDPE: No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation

Moreover, in June 2021, we issued our ESG Promotion 
Activities with Suppliers. To further promote the 
resolution of social issues, we will make the Partnership 
Requirements for Suppliers known to all suppliers, and 
monitor compliance through such means as third-party 
audits. If we identify a violation, we will take appropriate 
action, including providing guidance for improvement or 
suspending transactions. In addition, with respect to raw 
materials procured by Kao, we will identify supply chains 
that entail significant human rights or environmental 
issues as high-risk supply chains. Through on-site 
dialogue, we will identify risks, determine the nature of

Education and promotion

To carry out responsible procurement, each of our 
Procurement Division employees must acquire the 
needed knowledge, and ensure that they understand 
and adhere to the Policies for Procurement and 
related guidelines. To this end, we conduct various 
training and awareness-raising activities. We use new 
employee training for recent graduates and mid-
career hires, training for young employees and other 
training programs, for example, to deepen 
understanding of ESG procurement, stable 
procurement and strategic procurement.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

We are promoting opinion exchanges with suppliers 
through vendor summits, quality improvement meetings 
and other initiatives. We utilize Sedex for supplier 
monitoring, and by requesting Sedex membership and 
response, we are undertaking to assess risk for our 
entire supply chain. We are strengthening coordination 
with our suppliers through various initiatives including 
the CDP Supply Chain Program, and developing our 
global procurement activities.
 We are also working with our international 
business partners to provide essential solutions to 
social issues.

 We also continue to engage in dialogue with NGOs 
and respond sincerely to opinions and advice from a 
variety of perspectives. We are actively exchanging 
opinions with other companies and external 
organizations, such as participating in JaSPON in 
Japan and SUSTAIN internationally, with the aim of 
realizing sustainable procurement and traceability.

Framework

By strategically coordinating three policies̶ESG 
procurement, stable procurement and strategic 
procurement for enhancing competitiveness, the 
Procurement Division is promoting responsible 
procurement to all stakeholders. In 2020, to practice 
responsible procurement, the Procurement Division’s 
organizational structure was reorganized broadly into 
a Strategic Sourcing Department and an Operational 
Excellence Department.
 The Strategic Sourcing Department’s principal 
mission is to formulate and implement mid- to long-
term procurement strategies based on the three 
procurement policies, while the Operational 
Excellence Department’s main mission is to innovate 
in terms of efficiency and timely information-sharing 
along the supply chain.
 These Strategic Sourcing and Operational 
Excellence activities are reported to the Board of 
Directors via reports to the Management Board.

Mid- to long-term targets
On the environmental side of ESG procurement, we 
will work to reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions 
from raw materials, use recycled raw materials and 
recycled plastics, and establish a recycling system for 
containers.
 In social terms, we will strive to strengthen human 
rights due diligence on the part of suppliers by 
promoting Sedex and SMETA audits.
 In governance terms, we aim to ensure traceability 
of raw materials back to their origin and make the 
supply chain visible.

With particular respect to palm and palm kernel oil 
procurement, we are strengthening our initiatives to 
address business issues, ranging from promoting the 
purchase of RSPO-certified oil and ensuring 
traceability to supporting small farms, establishing a 
grievance mechanism, and disclosing forest 
footprints. (See Our initiatives section for details.)

1. Ensuring traceability
We take into consideration preservation of biodiversity 
and pursue zero deforestation in our procurement of 
palm oil and palm kernel oil. In addition, we seek to 
procure 100% RSPO* certified palm oil for consumer 
and industrial applications by 2025 and to complete 
confirmation of traceability back to small oil palm 
farms, also by 2025.
 With regard to paper and pulp procurement as 
well, we take into consideration preservation of 
biodiversity, pursue zero deforestation, and are 
working toward 100% procurement of certified paper 
products and pulp used in consumer products by

* RSPO: Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil

2. Human rights initiatives
We established the Kao Human Rights Policy in 2015 
to address various risks associated with human rights 
issues. In addition to our own activities, we also 
request that our suppliers’ activities embody respect 
for human rights based on the Partnership 
Requirements for Suppliers, and we conduct human 
rights due diligence accordingly.
 To conduct this risk assessment, in 2014 we 
joined Sedex, a platform for sharing information on 
ethical practices by global companies. We have been 
also encouraging our suppliers to join Sedex. We aim 
to achieve 100% implementation of due diligence by 
suppliers by 2025. In addition, we will request that 
suppliers that are rated as high risk conduct SMETA 
audits and act on them to address issues.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Social impacts
Through dialogue and improvement activities with 
suppliers, we will contribute to solving social issues 
by building a sustainable supply chain world.

Business impacts
Achieving these targets will reduce various related 
environmental and social risks and contribute to cost 
reductions. It will also enhance our brand image and 
social trust.

Reviews of performance
With regard to confirming traceability to palm oil 
production regions (palm farms), we have 
completed tracing to palm oil mills and farms 
owned and managed by oil suppliers. We will 
continue to pursue traceability confirmation for 
small- and medium-scale farms in coordination 
with suppliers, farmers, NGOs, specialists and 
third-party organizations. In addition, we are 
steadily performing confirmation of palm oil mills 
identified as requiring observation through risk 
assessments. Concerning procurement of RSPO-
certified oil, we procured a volume of RSPO-
certified oil equivalent to the total volume of palm 
oil for consumer applications. Going forward, we 
will expand procurement to include industrial 
applications.

We once again achieved nearly 100% traceability 
for paper and pulp producing areas, maintaining 
the results from 2020, and the certified product 
ratio was 96%. We will continue to introduce 
certified products for small-scale suppliers and 
encourage confirmation of sustainability with the 
aim of achieving the 100% by 2023, even earlier 
than our original 2025 target.

To address human rights, we request that all 
direct materials suppliers worldwide join Sedex, 
respond to Sedex questionnaires and set up data 
access rights. As of the end of 2021, suppliers 
accounting for 89% of global transactions (on a 
monetary value basis) were Sedex members 
(including Kao SAQ, an alternate program). In the 
future, besides continuing to encourage suppliers 
to join Sedex, we will also request improvements 
from suppliers whose assessment results are low 
(scores of B or C). 
 SMETA audits of high-risk suppliers were 
conducted for only two companies in 2021 due to 
COVID-19, but will be expanded to a target of 30 
companies in 2022.

Initiatives ahead of the introduction of  
a grievance mechanism
Starting in 2022 we are preparing to introduce a 
grievance mechanism for independent small farmers 
in Indonesia, which will enable us to respond 
promptly to human rights issues. The grievance 
mechanism is an initiative to identify and investigate 
issues (complaints) in the field (farms) in collaboration 
with NGOs, resolve the issues proactively, and follow 
up to confirm resolution.
 In 2021, in cooperation with NGOs and as a 
preliminary survey of claims from small farmers, we 
conducted a survey of 250 independent small farmers 
in Riau Province, Indonesia, regarding occupational 
health and safety, farmland and market access.

Support for small oil palm farms
Kao, Apical Group (a company that manufactures and 
sells oil and fat products) and Asian Agri (a plantation 
company) are implementing Smallholder Inclusion for 
Better Livelihood & Empowerment (SMILE), a 
program to help small oil palm farms in Indonesia 
improve productivity and obtain certification for 
sustainable palm oil, with the aim of establishing a 
sustainable palm oil supply chain.
 These activities aim to enhance the living 
standards of local farmers and reduce deforestation. 
By 2030, a team of education specialists will enhance 
the living standards of approximately 5,000 farmers 
by providing technical training to increase productivity 
(target yield doubling) and education to obtain RSPO 
certification (RSPO basic principles, safety education 
and yield management methods). Furthermore, 
doubling the oil palm productivity of all independent 
small-scale Indonesian farms would have the effect of 
reducing new deforestation equivalent to the area of 
existing palm plantations in Borneo (approximately 4 
million hectares).
 In 2021, a dedicated plantation manufacturer 
education team conducted RSPO training sessions as 
well as safety, fire response, and volume and 
shipment bookkeeping education for approximately 
700 farmers in Sumatra. We also introduced our 
proprietary technology, Adjuvant, and began testing 
its use locally in February 2022.

anticipated requests and complaints.

 We will thus bolster our activities to resolve the 
roots of issues to enhance sustainability, with 
dialogue in the field (farms) as the starting point. Our 
aim is to then communicate these activities to 
external stakeholders (NGOs, etc.), and through 
dialogue, achieve further improvement.

and are working to sustainably procure raw materials. 
These initiatives must be managed across the entire 
supply chain. With regard to climate change, water 
and forests, we are participating in the CDP Supply 
Chain Program and asking our key suppliers to 
disclose relevant information. In 2021, the supplier 
response rate was 78% in regard to climate change, 
77% in regard to water and 84% in regard to forests.
 In regard to forests, we are conducting risk

Kao vendor summits
We hold vendor summits to provide a venue for sharing 
information and exchanging opinions with suppliers 
within and outside Japan. Each year, a specific theme is 
chosen for the vendor summits, and we seek to foster 
communication in regard to that theme.
 In 2020, the meeting was postponed to prevent the 
spread of COVID-19, but in 2021 was held remotely in 
Japan, Taiwan and Indonesia. At the 2021 vendor 
summit, we and our suppliers presented our initiatives 
and activities, and called for collaboration to strengthen 
ESG procurement (including joining Sedex, conducting 
SMETA audits and participating in the CDP Supply Chain 
Program), and stable procurement (including raw material 
traceability and BCP compliance). In addition, we also 
launched a supplier commendation program in 2016 to 
recognize outstanding suppliers in terms of quality, price, 
delivery, information provision and management / ESG.

rights and labor problems, and in risk assessments. 
After joining in 2014, we began full-scale use in 2016, 
and we request that all direct materials suppliers 
worldwide join Sedex, respond to Sedex 
questionnaires and set up data access rights.
 For suppliers that find it difficult to join Sedex, we 
also use an original survey form (Kao SAQ) as an 
evaluation tool to supplement Sedex. Kao SAQ 
comprises such social responsibility items as 
compliance, human rights and business practices, 
and such environmental conservation items as 
environmental policies, environmental objectives and 
various categories of environmental management, 
including pollution prevention (air, water, etc.).
 We are also performing this assessment when 
onboarding new suppliers.
 As of the end of 2021, suppliers accounting for 
89% of global transactions (on a monetary value 
basis) were Sedex members (including Kao SAQ, an 
alternate program*1). We will continue to raise the 
proportion of transactions with Sedex members in the 
future.
 We also perform risk assessments using Sedex

Employees’ voice

“Eco” is a term that has become familiar to everyone in 
today’s society, and with the introduction of plastic 
shopping bag fees, I believe that many have adopted an 
environmental perspective in their lives.
 Yet concerning the history and origins of this 
perspective and humanity’s approach to it, the problems 
are enormous, and there are few who can characterize 
them.
 In addition to equipping me to grasp familiar 
general knowledge, my preparation for the Eco Test® 
has also enabled me to grasp the history of complicated 
social issues and the current positioning of these issues 
in a systematic way. We will utilize these certification 
tests and external educational opportunities to raise the 
level of basic knowledge in the entire Procurement 
Division, and promote ESG-conscious procurement 
activities to realize a sustainable society, with everyone 
in the division playing a central role rather than trusting 
that “someone else will handle the problem.”

Employee training and awareness-raising (Japan)
We educate new Procurement Division employees in 
our basic approach to procurement, which includes 
fairness and equity, adherence to laws and ethics and 
social responsibility. Through such education, we 
strive to encourage our employees to understand 
global social issues such as human rights and labor, 
which are fundamental to the United Nations Global 
Compact and ISO 26000 principles. In 2021, we 
conducted education on our basic approach to 
procurement for ten employees newly assigned to the 
Procurement Division.

Promoting certification testing (Japan)
So that all Procurement Division employees 
understand the relationship between society and the 
environment, and as education to modify their 
behavior accordingly, we encourage them to take 
certification examinations. In 2021, we encouraged 
employees to take the Certification Test for 
Environmental Specialists® (Eco Test®*), and the 
cumulative number of employees who have passed 
the test accounted for 82% of division employees in 
2021.

Decarbonization 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 201-2

As we work toward the goal of becoming carbon zero (reducing CO2 emissions to net zero) by 2040, and becoming carbon negative by 2050, besides aiming 
to reduce CO2 emissions in our own business activities, we also aim to contribute toward realizing the decarbonized society by helping to reduce emissions in 
society as a whole, and through carbon fixation to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Social issues we are aware of
1. Societal ideals and current issues
Today, the vision for society is to realize net zero 
emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, so that the 
average rise in global temperature can be kept to 
within 1.5°C higher than pre-industrial revolution levels. 
 However, according to the Working Group I 
contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report 
published in 2021 by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC)*, it is highly likely that human 
activity has already caused average global 
temperatures to rise by around 1.1°C over the period 
between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019, and if the 
current situation continues, it is possible that this rise 
may increase to 1.5°C by as soon as 2030.
 Global warming is thus already underway, and has 
been accompanied by an increase in the scale of 
damage caused by localized torrential rain and 
typhoons, frequent forest fires, the melting of the 
Siberian permafrost and other climatic abnormalities.
 In response to this situation, in recent years, countries 
and regions around the world, including the European 
Union (EU), have been issuing carbon neutrality 
declarations, and in October 2020 Japan also announced 
that it would seek to become carbon neutral by 2050. In 
addition, many local governments within Japan have been 
declaring a climate emergency in relation to the crisis 
posed by climate change, and large numbers of business 
enterprises have announced that they are aiming to realize 
net zero emissions. Furthermore, with the holding of the 

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

COP26 conference in Glasgow in the U.K. in November 
2021, growing importance is being attached to the need 
for effective action. There have also been movements 
demanding effective action on climate change, such as 
Friday For Future, in which young people̶who represent 
the future̶have played a key role.
*  IPCC 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
This organization was established by the United Nations Environment Programme and 
the World Meteorological Organization in 1988 for the purpose of conducting 
comprehensive evaluations from scientific, technical and socio-economic perspectives 
regarding climate change, its impact, adaptation and mitigation measures.

2. Kao’s current status and assets
We are aiming to achieve carbon zero by 2040, earlier 
than the standard global target year of 2050. This is a 
very challenging target that cannot be achieved just 
through slow evolution of existing technologies and 

activities. To achieve this target, we will need to fully 
utilize all of our existing assets (including production 
systems and equipment, intellectual property, human 
capital, internal and external networks and investments), 
and will need to build an organizational structure 
capable of speedy decision-making in relation to the 
promotion of decarbonization. Our R&D capability gives 
us the ability to undertake innovation based on Essential 
Research, and we will need to collaborate with external 
stakeholders in order to maximize this ability.

3. What is Kao aiming for?
We are moving speedily from the making of a 
decarbonization declaration to the implementation 
stage, and have formulated a roadmap for ensuring 
that we achieve carbon zero by 2040.

4. Estimation of business impacts by 2030
We evaluated the business impacts in relation to 
What Kao Aims to Be by 2030 by four product 
groups. More specifically, we set baseline Profit and 
Loss (P&L) data for 2030 on the assumption that our 
company’s sales would reach 2.5 trillion yen by 2030 
(1.67 times as high as in 2018), and that P&L would 
grow proportionately compared to 2018. Business 
impacts were estimated on the basis of this baseline 

*1  1.5°C scenario 
This is equivalent to the IEA’s NZE 2050 Scenario, 2DS Scenario, 
IPCC’s RCP 1.9 scenario or SSP1-1.9 scenario, etc. It refers to the 
economic measures that would be needed in order to keep the 
average global temperature rise down to less than 1.5°C compared to 
the situation prior to the Industrial Revolution, and to the environmen-
tal damage that is expected to result from such a rise in temperature.

*2  4°C scenario 
This is equivalent to the IEA’s Current Policy Scenario, IPCC’s RCP 
8.5 scenario or SSP5-8.5 scenario, etc. It refers to the economic 
measures that would be needed in order to keep the average global 
temperature rise down to less than 4°C compared to the situation 
prior to the Industrial Revolution, and to the environmental damage 
that is expected to result from such a rise in temperature.

P&L. In order to compare the respective impact of 
individual factors on our business based on different 
climate change scenarios, we performed evaluation 
for both the 1.5°C scenario*1 and 4°C scenario*2. For 
this reason, evaluation was not performed for some 
factors even though there was the potential for them 
to have a significant impact. There were also some 
factors which might have a major impact by 2050, but

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
Transitional risks that we have identified include a 
possible increase in costs relating to regulatory 
compliance due to the introduction of carbon taxes, 
increased expenses relating to product development in 
response to climate change, and rising raw material 
costs due to restrictions on the use of fossil fuels.
 With regard to physical risks, important risks that we 
have identified include the risk of flood damage to Kao 
plants due to the increased frequency of concentrated 
heavy rainfall occurring over a short period of time, and 
the possible impact of supply chain disruption on the 
supply of products.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
We have identified opportunities that may contribute toward 
reduced operating expenses due to the effective utilization 
of resources based on strategies adopted in response to 
climate change. We have also identified opportunities for 
increased sales resulting from the ongoing development of 
products that contribute toward mitigating the impact of 
climate change, in response to the changes in market 
demand caused by a shift toward ethical consumption by 
consumers. We formulate resilient corporate strategies in 
respond to identified risks and opportunities.

Kao’s creating value
Climate change is a problem that affects the whole of society. 
In response to this issue, we have proactively set ourselves 
targets, and by actively developing applications for cutting-

edge technologies and other new technologies, both within 
Kao and in the wider society, in collaboration with various 
stakeholders, we aim to demonstrate solutions to the 
problem of climate change.
 In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated 
with our business activities, we are improving the energy 
efficiency of our worksites and shifting over to green energy 
use, and we are continuing to implement initiatives aimed at 
reducing emissions in collaboration with our stakeholders, by 
cutting emissions at every stage in the product lifecycle, from 
raw materials procurement through to product use, disposal 
and recycling. We are also working actively to provide 
products and services that contribute toward reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions associated with product use.
 By providing environmentally friendly products that take 
account of transitional and physical risk, and products suited 
to the changes in consumer lifestyles that have resulted from 
climate change, we are making a positive contribution toward 
creating a Kirei life for all.

Contributions to the SDGs

Climate change poses a major risk to the realization of an 
enriched Kirei Lifestyle, both now and in the future. The 
Kao Way enunciates our mission to “create a Kirei life for 
all̶providing care and enrichment for the life of all 

people and the planet,” and we are actively implementing 
initiatives to both mitigate and adapt to global warming in 
relation to every aspect of our business strategy.
 Our Basic Principle and Basic Policies on 
Environment and Safety states that “We shall contribute 
to social sustainability by giving thorough consideration 
to environmental conservation and human safety in 
every aspect of our operations, including product 
development, materials procurement, manufacture, 
distribution, sales, usage and waste disposal.”
 Furthermore, the Kao Group Responsible Care (RC) 
Policy contains the following declaration: “We shall strive 
to continue to reduce the environmental impact of our 
business operations by promoting reduction of uses of 
resources such as water and energy.”
 Our Environmental Statement embodies our 
commitment to ensuring that “Kao products utilize 
original Kao-developed technologies to minimize the 
impact they have on the environment, not just in the 
manufacturing process, but in the daily life of the 
customers who use them. From materials procurement 
and manufacturing, to distribution, sales, usage and 
final disposal, we want to engage in ‘eco together’ with 
stakeholders including consumers worldwide.”
 By formulating our “High-Risk” Supply Chain 
Management and Sourcing in relation to palm oil, paper 
and pulp, we have committed ourselves to a raw 
materials procurement policy that recognizes the risks 
relating to sustainable development.
 We are implementing our decarbonization activities based 
on the policies noted above. We are working not only to reduce 
the CO2 emissions at our own worksites, but also to reduce CO2

Decarbonization 102-12, 102-43, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 404-2

Our employees are not only in the position to develop 
and supply products, but once they leave the 
company, they are consumers for the rest of their lives 
and are the ones who select those products. We thus 
recognize the importance of giving our employees the 
opportunity to learn about global warming through 
various programs and to actively engage in 
decarbonization activities of their own accord.
 Starting in 2020, we have begun making and 
disseminating educational videos for internal use that 
are specific to the themes of the Kirei Lifestyle Plan 
(KLP). In 2020 we disseminated videos on the topics 
of decarbonization and life-cycle assessment (LCA), 
and in the future we intend to continue spreading 
awareness of KLP activities among our employees by 
developing more video content relating to other KLP 
objectives. 

In line with the “eco together” motto of the Kao 
Environmental Statement, we are working together 
with a wide range of stakeholders to promote 
activities aimed at realizing decarbonization. We are 
also implementing education about decarbonization 
and working to spread awareness of our initiatives.

“eco together” with consumers / customers
As the product usage stage accounts for around 40% 
of total product lifecycle CO2 emissions, raising 
consumers’ awareness is extremely important. For 
example, even if a consumer buys single-rinse laundry 
detergent, if the consumer sets the washing machine 
to do two rinses, then there will be no reduction in 
CO2 emissions. It is thus very important for us to 
accurately communicate the environmental value that 
Kao products can provide and encourage consumers 
to use them properly. By organizing a wide range of 
different events, we aim to get across the importance 
of CO2 emission reduction and the environmental 
value of our activities and products.

emissions throughout the entire product lifecycle. In addition, 
we are working actively to provide products and services that 
contribute toward reducing CO2 emissions for society as a 
whole. We are also investing in the development of technologies 
for using the CO2 in the atmosphere as raw material, and in 
activities to realize carbon fixation through tree-planting, etc. 
Furthermore, with regard to offset measures to support 
decarbonization in sectors outside our business areas, we 
recognize the importance of such measures̶particularly during 
the transition period̶and we are working to implement them.
 Through these activities, we aim to reduce net carbon 
emissions to zero by 2040, and become carbon negative by 
2050. At the same time, we are accelerating the provision of 
products and services that are adapted to the changing 
climate, and aiming to realize a Kirei Lifestyle for consumers.

“eco together” with society
We proactively participate in activities organized by the 
United Nations, the central government, local 
government authorities, NPOs, etc., where we provide 
information about our technologies and exchange 
opinions with other participants. 
 In order to realize a decarbonized society, reducing 
the CO2 emissions associated with electric energy 
generation is a particularly important approach, and we 
are working actively to disseminate information about our 
activities in this area.

Risk management in relation to climate change issues is 
carried out by the Internal Control Committee and 
opportunity management is carried out by the ESG 
Managing Committee, under the supervision of the Board of 
Directors. These committees are headed by the President.
 The Responsible Care Promotion Committee, which 
manages policy / regulatory regime and technology risks, 
and the Risk and Crisis Management Committee, which 
manages market, reputational and acute risks, are under the 
Internal Control Committee. These committees are headed 
by the executive officer in charge of the Corporate Strategy.
 The Responsible Care Department of Corporate 
Strategy Division acts as the Responsible Care Promotion 
Committee Secretariat while the Crisis Management 
Department of Corporate Strategy Division acts as the 
Risk and Crisis Management Committee Secretariat.
 The Responsible Care Promotion Committee meets 
twice a year to report on and discuss compliance with laws 
and regulations, status of CO2 reduction and other matters. 

“eco together” with business partners
We aim to realize the Kirei Lifestyle for consumers 
through ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri. However, this is 
not something that can be achieved by Kao acting 
alone. We believe that it is important to share our 
vision with the business partners at every stage from 
raw materials procurement through production to 
delivery and sales, so that we can take action 
together, and we have established a number of 
different venues for sharing information with them.
 In particular, as the raw materials stage accounts 
for around 40% of total product lifecycle CO2 
emissions, we view collaboration with raw materials 
suppliers as being especially important.
 We also view dialogue with investors and other 
stakeholders as being very important for the 
sustainable growth of business enterprises and of the 
planet, and in March 2019 we announced our support 
for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD). By proactively implementing the 
disclosure of information relating to climate change, 
we are promoting dialogue with investors and other 
stakeholders.

It also sets targets for the following year. The Responsible 
Care Promotion Committee Secretariat conducts monthly 
checks on compliance with laws and regulations, monitors 
CO2 emission and water use, mainly at plants which have a 
large impact, and keeps abreast of the amount of chemical 
substances in wastewater, reporting on these and other 
matters to the head of the committee, committee members, 
members of the Internal Control Committee, auditors and 
others. The Risk and Crisis Management Committee which 
manages natural disaster including caused by climate 
change and reputational risks, meets four times a year.
 The Internal Control Committee meets one or more 
times a year, receiving activity reports from the 
Responsible Care Promotion Committee, the Risk and 
Crisis Management Committee and other subordinate 
committees that it oversees and auditing the activities of 
those committees.
 Opportunity management relating to climate change 
issues is handled by the ESG Managing Committee, 
which meets six times a year. Committee members are 
the persons in charge of the Business, Sales, R&D, SCM 
and other divisions, an arrangement which connects 
divisions horizontally. The Internal Control Committee, and 
the ESG Managing Committee which it supervises, 
discuss climate change and environmental issues as well 
as social and governance issues.
 The committee reports on its activities to the Board of 
Directors one or more times a year and is audited by the 
Board of Directors.

We aim to be carbon zero by 2040, and carbon negative 
by 2050, and we are accelerating our activities to 
achieve these goals. We will also be maximizing our 
contribution toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
throughout society as a whole.

2030 mid-term targets
We set ourselves the target of reducing the amount of energy 
consumed at all Kao Group sites by at least 1% per year, and 
we have maintained this target every year since 2013.
 Our target for the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions at all Kao Group sites (Scope 1+2) has been set, 
based on the Science Based Targets (SBT) 1.5°C scenario, 
as a reduction of 55% (in absolute terms, compared to 
2017). Our target for the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions throughout the product lifecycle (Scope 1+2+3) 
has been set, based on the SBT 2℃ scenario, as a 
reduction of 22% (in absolute terms, compared to 2017). 
Both of these targets have been approved by the SBTi.
 In addition, in June 2021 we joined the RE100 global 
corporate renewable energy initiative, and we have set 
ourselves the target of having 100% of electricity 
purchased by all Kao Group sites be generated using 
renewable energy by 2025, and of having 100% of 
electricity used by the Kao Group sites be generated using 
renewable energy by 2030.
 In addition, we aim to enable society as a whole to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 
10,000 thousand tons-CO2 through the provision of Kao 
Group products and services.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
Achieving targets (for energy consumption and 
greenhouse gas emissions) for all sites in the group 
leads to higher profits as they contribute to the 
reduction of business activity operating costs. 
Additionally, the reduction of CO2 emissions across 
product lifecycles can be achieved by reducing raw 
material use and increasing sales of products with low 
CO2 emissions during usage, leading to reduced 
operating costs and sales growth.
 As renewable energy generating costs have been 
falling steadily for the past few years, switching over to 
having 100% of the electricity that we purchase 
generated using renewable energy can be expected to 
result in reduced electricity purchase costs in the future.

If no action is taken to reduce usage, then by 2030 our 
overall CO2 emissions (Scope 1+2) are forecast to rise to a 
level that is 1.67 times higher than in 2017. However, in 
order to control our CO2 emissions (Scope 1+2), in 2006 
we adopted an internal carbon pricing system, and for 17 
years now we have been implementing investment 
decision-making that contributes toward decarbonization, 
for example through the adoption of energy-saving 
equipment and equipment with low CO2 emissions, and 
through the purchasing of renewable energy. Last year, we 
changed our CO2 emissions (Scope 1+2) reduction target 
from a goal of reducing emissions by 22% by 2030 to one 

Long-term targets
Reduction of net carbon emissions to zero by 
2040 and becoming carbon negative by 2050 
Through our Innovation in Reduction and Innovation 
in Recycling CO2 emissions reduction initiatives, and 
through the various activities that we undertake in 
collaboration with stakeholders, we are aiming to 
reduce CO2 emissions to zero by 2040 and to become 
carbon negative by 2050.

of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. In order to achieve 
this goal, when adopting new equipment, we will need, as 
far as possible, to adopt equipment that has low CO2 
emissions, and if we fail to do so, then not only will we 
have difficulty in achieving our CO2 emissions reduction 
target, the equipment that we purchase may end up 
becoming stranded assets. With this in mind, we have 
raised our internal carbon price from 3,500 yen per t-CO2 
to 18,500 yen per t-CO2*1. If carbon taxes equivalent to 
130USD/t-CO2*2 are adopted by 2030, then assuming that 
we achieve the target outlined above, our carbon tax 
burden will be approximately 7.8 billion yen, which is 
around 21.0 billion yen less than it would be if we failed to 
take any action. In this way, by reducing the CO2 emissions 
of the products that we manufacture, we are facilitating 
the supply of products with low CO2 emissions, and 
making it possible to meet demand for such products.
*1  As it is assumed that new equipment adopted in the future will still be in 

use after 2030, we have estimated the likely carbon tax rate in 2035 based 
on the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2021.

*2  World Energy Outlook 2021

Social impacts
By achieving the above goals, we can reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and contribute toward mitigating global 
warming. Additionally, products with low CO2 emissions 
during usage can contribute to reduction in consumer 
spending because they consume less energy and water. 
Furthermore, they are also effective in reducing the burden 
of social infrastructure maintenance and renewal 
concerning energy, water and sewage systems.

CO2 emissions across the entire product lifecycle 
decreased by 47 thousand tons over the previous 
year, representing a fall of 4% compared to 2017, the 
same as in 2020. The main reason for the decline in 
emissions was slower growth in sales of hand soap 
and sanitizer (products which had seen a spike in 
sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic), despite the 
growth in our overall sales.
 Energy consumption for all Kao Group sites 
combined was 18.5 PJ. Energy consumption per 
unit of sales was reduced by 2.9% compared to 
the previous year, surpassing the target of a 1% 
reduction. Greenhouse gas emissions fell by 20% 
compared to 2017. Renewable energy accounted 
for 52% of all electricity purchased, and 38% of all 
electricity used by the Kao Group.

*  CDP 

CDP is a London-based NGO operated by institutional investors, and 
it motivates business enterprises to disclose information related to 
climate change, water and forests.

Category 1: Purchased goods and services 
This value is calculated by multiplying CO2 emissions associated with raw materials per unit of product 
sold (both within and outside Japan) by the total annual sales volume of the product in question.
CO2 emissions associated with raw materials are calculated by multiplying the weight of 
raw materials purchased by inventory data (using supplier surveys, documentary data, 
commercially available databases, etc.).

Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution
CO2 emissions associated with transporting products (both within and outside Japan) 
while Kao Group acts as consignor.
For Japan, the calculation is made using the criteria specified by the Energy Conservation 
Act. For areas outside Japan, the calculation is made by Kao based on data for Japan.

Category 11: Use of sold products
This value is calculated by multiplying CO2 emissions associated with product use per unit 
of product sold (both within and outside Japan) by the total annual sales volume of the 
product in question.

Industrial-use products are excluded.
CO2 emissions associated with product use are calculated by multiplying the amount of water, 
hot water and electric power consumed during product use by inventory data (using 
documentary data, commercially available databases, etc.)

Category 12: End-of-life treatment of sold products
This value is calculated by multiplying CO2 emissions associated with the disposal or recycling of sold 
products (both within and outside Japan) by the total annual sales volume of the product in question.
CO2 emissions associated with the disposal or recycling of industrial-use products are excluded.
CO2 emissions associated with disposal or recycling are the sum of CO2 emissions associated 
with disposal or recycling of product content and product packaging. Emissions from product 
content are calculated by converting all content that consists of fossil-derived carbon into CO2. 
Emissions from product packaging are calculated by multiplying packaging material weight̶
broken down by the appropriate percentage of disposal by incineration, landfill or recycling for 
each category of material in line with each country’s performance in this regard̶by inventory 
data (using documentary data, commercially available databases, etc.)

*  Kao focuses on the categories of 1, 3, 4, 5, 11 and 12 related to site activities to 
save energy and reduce waste materials, as well as on the product lifecycle.

Vendor Summit
We hold the Kao Vendor Summit, which important suppliers are 
invited to attend, where we give presentations on our ESG-related 
initiatives, including decarbonization, and request suppliers’ 
collaboration. In 2021, the Kao Vendor Summit was held remotely. 
The event featured presentations on the activities being 
implemented by Kao together with suppliers, and invitations to 
collaborate, with the aim of strengthening ESG-driven 
procurement (including joining Sedex, participation in the CDP 
supply chain initiative, etc.) and stable procurement (traceability 
of raw materials, responding to BCP requirements, etc.)

CDP Supply Chain Program (Climate Change)
In 2009, we became the first Japanese company to participate in 
the CDP Supply Chain Program. From 2017, in expectation that 
our suppliers will become more active toward promoting CO2 
reduction activities, we have been evaluating CO2 reduction 
activities and have been working to provide the results of these 
evaluations back to our suppliers.
 The 2021 survey results showed that the number of 
suppliers obtaining an evaluation of at least “three stars” had 
increased to 193 compared to the previous survey, indicating that 
the overall supplier activity level had risen. The number of 
suppliers who failed to respond to the survey was smaller than in 
the previous year. We are working on engagement to encourage 
a further enhancement of the level of activity implementation.

Our initiatives

CDP Supply Chain Program (Forests)
We have participated in the CDP “Forest” Supply 
Chain Program since 2018. We expect suppliers 
providing palm oil, paper or pulp to begin sustainable 
and responsible procurement, which includes 
procurement preventing deforestation. We assess 
forest activity status and provide suppliers with 
feedback on the results of this assessment.
 The 2021 survey results showed that the number 
of suppliers obtaining an evaluation of at least “three 
stars” had increased by ten compared to the previous 
survey, indicating that the overall supplier activity level 
had risen. At the same time, in regard to the roughly 
15% of suppliers who failed to respond to the survey, 
we are continuing to work on engagement with these 
suppliers.

Low-carbon raw materials procurement
In collaboration with suppliers, we are working 
actively to adopt raw materials with lower CO2 
emissions by using plant-based and recycled plastics 
and thinner cardboard. This can make a substantial 
contribution to reducing CO2 emissions not only in the 
manufacturing process but also at the time of disposal 
and recycling.
 Furthermore, by optimizing the volume and 
frequency of raw materials deliveries, we are reducing 
CO2 emissions in the transport of raw materials.

More precise calculation of the environmental 
burden of raw materials for calculating product 
lifecycle CO2 emissions (LC-CO2)
With the cooperation of those suppliers from which we 
purchase raw materials that have particularly high CO2 
emissions, we are collecting data on CO2 emissions 
produced in the procurement and processing of raw 
materials. This measure not only improves the accuracy 
of our CO2 emission calculations during the raw material 
procurement process, but also allows us to evaluate the 
CO2 emissions reduction initiatives adopted by suppliers, 
which can then be reflected in lifecycle CO2 emissions 
reductions of Kao products.
 In 2020, we received the Industrial Science and 
Technology Policy and Environment Bureau Director-
General’s Award (Ministry of Economy, Trade and 
Industry), the highest award, at the Life Cycle Assessment 
Society of Japan (LCA) Awards, in recognition of our 
continued initiatives in relation to suppliers.

Adaptation
CDP Supply Chain Program (Water)
Due to climate change, extreme weather is occurring 
in different places. For instance, there is an increase in 
short-term, localized torrential heavy rain. Reflecting 
our focus on strengthening suppliers’ awareness of 
the need to put water risk systems in place in relation 
to flooding of rivers and sewage systems caused by

Developmental efforts

Mitigation
When deciding to launch new and improved 
products, we verify that the products satisfy the 
environmental standards outlined by the Design for 
Environment Guidelines. We also evaluate CO2 
emissions over the entire product lifecycle using the 
same standards. The results of these evaluations are 
not only used to determine product launches, but are 
also incorporated in future product development.
 In particular, with regard to products that make 
use of water during the usage process, we recognize 
that both the water purification plants that provide 
drinking water for household use and the wastewater 
treatment plants that process households’ wastewater 
use a great deal of energy and generated CO2 
emissions, and so we are working actively to develop 
water-saving products. Furthermore, products such as 
shampoo that require the use of hot water during the 
usage process also involve the generation of CO2 
emissions in relation to the heating of the water, so 
making products that use hot water into water-saving 
products can be very beneficial.

 In addition, we aim to achieve “Maximum with 
Minimum,” or in other words achieving the highest 
possible quality with the minimum possible raw 
materials. Based on this approach, we developed the 
Bio IOS surfactant. This surfactant is used in our 
Attack ZERO laundry detergent product. 
 We have also been working on the development 
of manufacturing technology for a new type of 
photovoltaic cell which is expected to be highly 
efficient, in collaboration with the Research Center for 
Advanced Science and Technology, the University of 
Tokyo, and with Kyushu Institute of Technology.
 We are also undertaking technology development 
aimed at using CO2 as a raw material for Kao 
products.

Photovoltaic cell production technology that is expected to 
realize a high energy conversion rate has been developed 
through collaborative research undertaken by Kao, the 
University of Tokyo and Kyushu Institute of Technology

Adaptation
As global warming progresses, it is apparent that there 
is a tendency toward higher temperatures and an 
increased number of sunny days. Demand for UV care 
products as well as anti-perspirants, etc. is expected 
to increase during summer. In 2020, we launched 
Humming Ryokan Technology fabric softener, which 
features a breathability mechanism for expelling hot

Continuing from the previous year, equipment such as 
chillers, air conditioners and compressors were 
replaced with Best Practice Technologies (BPT) 
equipment in 2021. Through optimized control using 
multiple units of air conditioners and compressors, we 

air. Additionally, as the probability of droughts 
occurring increases, the demand for water-saving 
products is also expected to increase. We are working 
actively to develop products for which there is high 
demand in summer and water-saving products.
 Given that there are expected to be significant 
restrictions on resource use in future, in order to meet 
the goals set in the Paris Agreement, there will be 
high demand for biomass materials that do not 
compete with food. We have developed Bio IOS 
surfactant, which uses a type of biomass that does 
not compete with food and which has not previously 
been used. Bio IOS surfactant is already in use in our 
Attack ZERO laundry detergent product.
 Our total investment in environmentally friendly 
R&D, including climate change response measures, in 
2021 was 2,770 million yen, while the total cost of 
this R&D work was 7,754 million yen.

are operating equipment more efficiently 
corresponding to fluctuating demand.
 In addition, we are switching lights to LED around 
the world. Our plants, offices and logistics centers in 
Japan have accomplished plans announced in 2015, 
reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 4.65 
thousand tons annually. Affiliated companies outside 
Japan are also proactively switching to LED lights.

Eliminating wasted energy
As in the previous year, in 2021 we continued to take 
steps to find areas with wasted energy, reduce energy 
use to the minimum required and use unused energy 
in other processes.
 Aiming to improve the efficiency of steam use, we 
are continuing to strengthen our steam trap 
maintenance and increase the amount of steam we 
recover. We are also actively implementing 
improvement activities at worksites to optimize the 
amount of required energy, including lowering the set 
temperature of heat-insulated tanks and shortening 
operating times.
 Striving to eliminate energy wastage at our 
offices, some of the steps we are taking include 
turning off unnecessary lights, using presence 
sensors to automatically turn lights on and off, 
optimizing air conditioner temperature settings and 
encouraging people to take the stairs to reduce 
unnecessary elevator use.
 We undertook 167 energy-saving activities at 
Japanese plants and offices in 2021, resulting in 

approximately 5,327 tons of CO2 reduction and 190 
million yen in cost reduction for the year.

2. Efforts to use cleaner energy
Clean-burning fuel
Gas fuel, especially natural gas, is the cleanest fossil 
fuel. We use natural gas at all plants outfitted with the 
necessary infrastructure. Our plants do not use any coal.

Use of renewable energy
We are promoting the introduction of solar 
photovoltaic power generation systems for on-site 
power generation at Kao-owned facilities. In 2021, the 
systems installed at the Sakata Plant, Kawasaki Plant, 
Kao Chimigraf and PT Kao Indonesia Chemicals 
started generating electricity. The total power 
generating capacity of these systems was 6,970 MWh 
in 2021. The generating capacity of individual facilities 
is shown on the next page.
 We are also promoting the purchasing of electric 
power that is generated using renewable energy. Kao

3.  Reducing the volume of leaked refrigerants 
and other greenhouse gases

Air conditioners and chillers used in manufacturing 
are charged with fluorocarbon that has extremely high 
global warming potential. To reduce the volume of 
fluorocarbon leaks from equipment, we have been 
strengthening our regular equipment inspections.

4.  Initiative to secure ZEB Ready certification for 
office buildings

In August 2020, a newly-built office building forming 

Photovoltaic (solar) power generating facilities at Sakata Plant

part of our Sumida Office (in Sumida Ward, Tokyo) 
was awarded ZEB (Net Zero Emission Building) Ready 
certification. Through the installation of highly 
efficient, energy-saving equipment such as highly-
insulating external walls and water-based radiant 
air-conditioning, the new building realizes a reduction 
in energy consumption of 58% compared to a 
building with standard specifications. The new 
building also has solar panels on its roof, along with 
an emergency generator unit, ensuring that the 
building is ready to cope with natural disasters.

Decarbonization 403-7 (Occupational health and safety 2018)

Adaptation
With rising summer temperatures, heat stroke 
prevention is essential in Japan. Especially for our 
outdoor workers, we have taken measures such as to 
share the day’s heat index, shorten continuous 
working hours and prepare drinking water.
 Additionally, as new water risks, including more 
powerful typhoons and localized torrential rains, are 
likely to emerge as a result of climate change, annual 
water risk surveys are conducted at our plants.

Employees’ voice

Faced with the problem of climate change caused by 
global warming, the Kao Group has set itself the goal 
of helping to realize the decarbonized society, and has 
formulated new decarbonization objectives. Kao is 
aiming to become net carbon zero in its business 
activities by 2040, and to be carbon negative by 2050.
 So as to meet these objectives, every Kao (China) 
plant is speeding up its activities to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions. In 2019, Kao (China) set up an I-REC 
Promotion Team, and it was decided that each plant in 
China would systematically purchase I-REC certificates 
and switch over to purchasing only electricity that has 
been generated using renewable energy. I-RECs meet 
the requirements of the CDP and of the RE100 
initiative, and can be used to offset Scope 2* carbon 
dioxide emissions. “I-REC” stands for International 
Renewable Energy Certificate. Also known as a “Green 
Electricity Certificate” (“green electricity” includes 
electricity generated using wind power, solar power 
and hydroelectric power), an I-REC represents proof, 
certified by an internationally recognized organization, 
of the purchase of green electricity.

I-REC purchasing and decar-
bonization targets at Kao 
(China)

 In the case of Kao (China), five of its plants̶Kao 
Corporation Shanghai, Kao (Hefei), Kao Chemical 
Corporation Shanghai, Kao (Shanghai) Chemical 
Industries and Kao Huludao Casting Materials̶have 
acquired I-RECs, and have been able to ensure that 
100% of the electricity that they purchase is 
generated using renewable energy.
 Based on the actual energy consumption of the 
five plants of Kao (China), the total amount of 
electricity generated using renewable energy that was 
purchased was 28,483 MWh in 2020 and 36,152 
MWh in 2021. Given that we purchased a combined 
total of 64,635 MWh of green electricity in 2020 and 
2021, the electric power consumption by the five 
plants over these two years was able to offset the 
equivalent of 37,740 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
 As the green electricity purchased in 2020 was 
generated using wind power, this represented support for 
the operation of wind power generating facilities in China’s 
Yunnan Province and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region. The green electricity purchased in 2021 was 
generated using hydroelectric power, and represented 
support for hydroelectric power projects within China.
 The plants of Kao (China) will continue working 
tirelessly to save energy and reduce emissions 
through continued technological innovation and 
ongoing improvements, aiming to achieve the goal of 
being carbon neutral across the board by 2050.

Efforts in distribution

Mitigation
CO2 emissions during distribution in Japan were 100 
thousand tons-CO2 in 2021, a 0.3% increase 
(compared to 2017).

1. Increase shipment volumes per shipment
We are proactively making adjustments including 
improving loading efficiency, changing product sizes 
and using larger vehicles.

2. Shorten shipping distances
We are continuing to look at ways to revise shipping 
routes, optimize manufacturing plants and shift which 
logistics center is used.

3. Use cleaner shipping methods
We are pursuing steps such as switching from truck 
to shipping methods such as rail and ship, which have 
lower CO2 emissions (modal shift).

4. Improve loading ratios
Having trucks return from their shipping destination with 
a load, instead of returning empty after unloading, i.e., 
improving the loading ratio, contributes to improving 
energy efficiency and CO2 emissions in shipping.

 We are participating in the Cross-ministerial 
Strategic Innovation Promotion Program promoted by 
Japan’s Cabinet Office. We have partnered with Lion 
Corporation to launch a smart logistics initiative, with 
scheduled deliveries having started in October 2020.

emissions outside Japan starting from 2020. However, 
the calculation and reporting of distribution-related 
CO2 emissions outside Japan for 2020 has been based 
on estimates. We are proceeding with preparations to 
begin reporting of emissions based on actual 
distribution performance as soon as possible.

Adaptation
With the worsening trend toward short-term, localized 
torrential rain, there is an increased risk of the supply 
chain from Kao’s plants to our customers being 
disrupted, with Kao being unable to deliver products 
on schedule, and a possible need to use roundabout 
routes over an extended period, leading to an 
increased environmental impact. When risks appear, in 
order to take appropriate measures in a short amount 
of time, subsidiaries are charged with managing 
product transport to our main market in Japan.

Collaborative delivery with Lion Corporation

* Boundary: Kao Corporation and Kanebo Cosmetics Inc.
* Assurance provided for CO2 emissions

CO2 emission during distribution✓□ (Japan)

 The aim is to enhance the productivity of truck 
transport and reduce CO2 emissions by implementing 
two-way transport that integrates deliveries between 
Kao’s Kawasaki Plant (in Kanagawa Prefecture) and the 
Sakaide Logistics Center (in Kagawa Prefecture), as well 
as from the Sakaide Plant (in Kagawa Prefecture) of Lion 
Chemical (a Lion Corporation affiliate) and the logistics 
centers at Kazo (in Saitama Prefecture), Kashiwa (in Chiba 
Prefecture) and Sagamihara (in Kanagawa Prefecture).
 This new initiative will reduce the distances that 
trucks are travelling without loads, by comparison 
with conventional transportation methods, and is 
expected to result in a 45% reduction in CO2 
emissions and a 23% reduction in transport costs for 
both companies combined.

Efforts during use

Mitigation
We offer a wide selection of products that contribute 
to the reduction of CO2 emissions during the use stage.
 Important examples include ultra-concentrated 
laundry detergents that only require one rinse cycle, and 
shampoo, body wash and dishwashing detergent that 
reduce the amount of hot water required for rinsing.
 In the laundry detergent segment, in 2009 we 
launched Attack Neo, which reduces the lifecycle CO2 
emissions per wash by approximately 22%. In 2019, we 
introduced Attack ZERO, a concentrated liquid clothing 
detergent that has redefined the whole concept of 
clothes washing, which uses Bio IOS, our most 
advanced ever detergent base, as its main ingredient, 
and which was followed by Attack 3X in 2020. Within 
Japan, the way in which consumers do their washing 
has begun to be transformed, with washing machines 
that come equipped with a button allowing the user to 
select a single rinse cycle as a standard feature 
becoming the norm. Laundry detergents that require 
only one rinse cycle are offered in Japan and Taiwan.
 We also offer other products, such as foam-type 
shampoo, which can be expected to reduce the 
amount of water used when foaming and rinsing. 
 To help ensure that when consumers use these 
products, which are capable of effectively reducing 
CO2 emissions, they use them properly, we participate 
in environmental events hosted by local governments 
and distribution companies.
 We also offer a wide selection of products for industry 
that allow customers to reduce their CO2 emissions during 

Adaptation
As global warming progresses, the period of time for 
which there is high demand for anti-perspirants etc. in 
the summer is lengthening, and demand is expected 
to rise. We are therefore working to strengthen our 
development of these types of products. Additionally, 
as the probability of droughts occurring increases, the 
demand for water-saving products is also expected to 
increase.
 Our sonaeru website provides information about 
household products that will be useful in the 
unfortunate event of a natural disaster occurring, with 
a particular focus on products that can help people to 
maintain good hygiene while living in an evacuation 
facility.

Efforts in disposal and recycling

Mitigation
CO2 emissions in the disposal and recycling stage 
consist of the following two types. One type is the CO2 
emitted as materials and ingredients degrade when 
packaging, diapers and other materials disposed of by 
consumers after use are incinerated, or when 
wastewater containing cleansing and other agents made 
from petroleum is treated. The other type is CO2 emitted 
from using energy required to operate incinerating and 
recycling equipment and wastewater treatment facilities. 
In order to simultaneously address these two types of 
emissions, the most important thing is to reduce the 
volume of material subject to disposal and recycling. For 
this reason, as far as possible we recycle waste that is 
subject to disposal and recycling. In the case of waste 
that cannot be recycled and can only be disposed of as 
waste, we adopt a carbon neutral approach.
 In line with this philosophy, we refer to initiatives that 
reduce the amount of waste that needs to be dealt with 
as Innovation in Reduction. We are applying Innovation in 
Reduction to the raw materials used in manufacturing 
packaging and diapers, and to the cleaning agents used 
in cleaning products. We refer to initiatives in the area of 
recycling as Innovation in Recycling. We are applying 
Innovation in Recycling to packaging and to used diapers.
 Used diapers are carbonized using carbonization 
equipment, and the resulting material is then utilized 
for environmental purification and plant cultivation. 
We are also undertaking R&D aimed at conversion to 
new types of carbon material.
 We are proceeding with the utilization of biomass 

plastic and other raw materials that are carbon neutral 
in terms of the amount of CO2 emitted during disposal.
 To further strengthen our focus on recycling 
activities, in 2020 we established the Recycling 
Science Research Center within our R&D Division.

Adaptation
In the future, as the human population continues to 
increase, it is anticipated that increasingly strict 
restrictions will be placed on the extraction of fossil fuels, 
in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and as 
a result restrictions can be expected to be placed on the 
use of various types of resources. We believe that, in 
order to realize a decarbonized society, it is vital to reduce 
the amount of raw materials used, recycle used products 
whenever possible, and only dispose of those products of 
biomass origin when there is no alternative to disposal.

Decarbonization 102-44

of people globally and contributing to the sustainability 
of the world as the core of the Kao Way, its business 
philosophy, and it has become leaders in sustainability 
initiatives, including those addressing the issue of 
climate change.
 In 2021, Kao made substantial further progress 
with these initiatives. In May 2021, it formulated new 
decarbonization objectives, aiming to reduce its carbon 
dioxide emissions to net zero by 2040 and become 
carbon negative by 2050. In 2019, Kao had already 
secured approval for its goals from the SBTi, which 
encourages business enterprises to set targets that are 
in conformity with the long-term goals of the Paris 
Agreement, and in 2021 it signed up to the Business 
Ambition for 1.5°C initiative, which asks companies to 
set targets consistent within keeping the average rise in 
global temperature within 1.5°C.
 In addition, in line with its goal of becoming net 
carbon zero by 2040, Kao has begun participating in 
the international RE100 initiative, which seeks to have 
100% of electricity used in business be generated from 
renewable energy. Kao has set itself the objectives of 
purchasing only electricity that has been generated 
using renewable energy within Japan by 2023, and 
achieving this globally by 2025, which is even earlier 
than RE100 recommendations. Besides implementing 
measures such as installing solar power generating 
equipment to generate electricity for its own use, and 
reducing the CO2 emissions of the electricity that it 
purchases to net zero through the use of non-fossil fuel 
energy certificates, as has been done at the Sakata 
Plant, Kao has also begun using corporate Power 

Purchase Agreements, through which it purchases 
renewable energy directly from the power producers.
 As in 2020, once again in 2021 Kao was selected 
as a Triple A company, having secured the highest 
possible A rating in all three areas covered by the CDP 
survey: Climate Change, Forests and Water Security. 
This achievement reflects just how high a level of 
initiatives the Kao Group has been implementing.
 Going forward, everyone will need to set 
themselves even higher challenges in responding to 
climate change. In particular, there is a need to reduce 
emissions throughout the product lifecycle (Scope 3 
emissions). Emissions associated with raw materials 
procurement, product use, disposal and recycling 
account for the largest share of the Kao Group’s total 
emissions. Kao needs to collaborate and liaise with 
suppliers in regard to reducing emissions associated 
with raw materials procurement, and collaborate and 
liaise with customers and other stakeholders in regard 
to reducing emissions associated with product use, 
disposal and recycling. I anticipate Kao implementing 
measures that will encourage suppliers to make 
improvements, and measures that will change the 
lifestyles and behavior of customers through its 
products and services. A further point is that the key 
issues which we are facing̶including climate change, 
plastic resource circulation and safeguarding the 
natural environment̶are all mutually interconnected. I 
hope that Kao will be able to strengthen understanding 
of all these issues among both suppliers and 
customers, and implement initiatives that address them 
all in a coordinated, comprehensive manner.

In recent years, natural disasters resulting from severe 
weather have caused immense damage, both in Japan 
and globally. The latest meteorological science 
indicates that human activity has definitely been a 
cause of global warming, and predicts that the 
changes in the climate will become even more 
dramatic as temperatures continue to rise. At the 
COP26 conference held in Glasgow in the U.K. in 2021, 
agreement was reached on the need to resolutely 
pursue the achievement of the Paris Agreement goal of 
keeping the increase in average global temperatures 
(compared to pre Industrial Revolution levels) down to 
within 1.5°C, and it was confirmed that, to realize this 
goal, emissions reductions over the next ten years, 
during the period until around 2030, would be of 
decisive importance. The agreement reached at 
COP26, set against the background of a sense of crisis 
in relation to the science-based evidence for climate 
change, shows just how much importance investors, 
and society as a whole, will attach to companies’ 
response to climate change risk in the future.

Zero waste 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 306-1 (Waste 2020)

Inspired by a philosophy of avoiding unnecessary waste, we aim to contribute toward the realization of a zero waste society by ensuring that used products 
and product packaging are utilized to the maximum possible extent, if necessary by changing their function.

Social issues we are aware of
Efforts to build high-level circular economic societies 
with high-level economic growth are increasingly 
needed throughout the world. Considering that the 
world’s resources are limited, standards of living are 
rising, and the resources needed are steadily 
increasing as the global population continuously 
grows, the one-way economic models of the past will 
no longer support prosperous lifestyles and culture 
into the future.
 In regions where social infrastructure (i.e., waste 
treatment systems) is not sufficiently developed for 
the increases in the amount of waste generated 
including household waste, there are numerous 
instances of environmental pollution due to waste 
being dumped or insufficiently treated at disposal 
facilities. In addition, improper conduct by consumers 
after use results in waste dumped on land entering 
the oceans. Plastic in particular does not decompose 
naturally, and the volume of marine plastic waste 
continues to increase. Estimates are that by 2050, 
there will be more plastic in the ocean environment 
by weight than the weight of all the fish in the oceans. 
This marine plastic is starting to have detrimental 
impacts on marine ecosystems.
 To keep the temperature rise due to climate 
change under 1.5°C, consumption of fossil fuels must 

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

be drastically reduced. Consequently, production of 
fossil-based plastics may fall dramatically compared 
to current levels. It is clear that existing plastic 
containers made with large amounts of fossil-based 
plastic are not sustainable.
 Although fossil fuel usage fell in 2020 due to the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be 
necessary to keep fossil fuel use under control and 
address the rising demand for plastics in order to 
strike an appropriate balance between fostering 
economic recovery and the transition to a 
decarbonized society. In light of this situation, we 
recognize the growing importance of reducing plastic 
usage and of recycling.
 Currently, because there is a stable supply of 
plastic products and packaging, and because they are 
reasonably priced, lightweight, multi-functional and 
corrosion-resistant, they play an indispensable role in 
realizing consumers’ Kirei Lifestyle. However, because 
plastic products and containers are mostly made from 
fossil fuels, if they are not disposed of properly after 
use they can cause environmental problems.
 An additional issue is that, currently, around 
one-third of all food produced in the world is thrown 
away as waste. Given that around 8% of annual GHG 
emissions derive from food waste, there is a clear 
need to reduce the amount of food that is wasted.
 In 2021, we supplied products that included 106 
thousand tons of plastic packaging, such as bottles 
and film-type refill packs. We also generated 723 tons 

of food waste.
 We aim to help realize a zero waste society, not 
only by minimizing the resources used in all processes 
from new product development through to disposal of 
used products, but also by trying to ensure that, after 
use, all products are reused, recycled, or effectively 
utilized in some other way. We also believe that, in 
cases where it is unavoidable for something to be 
disposed of as waste, it should undergo appropriate 
treatment.

Kao’s creating value
We are continuously implementing 3R activities to reduce, 
reuse and recycle waste generated at plants, distribution 
sites and offices and with regard to products and packaging.
 In the area of plastic packaging in particular, we are 
undertaking ongoing development and use of film 
packaging that reduces plastic usage by around 75%, and 
products in refillable film packaging are becoming popular 
in Japan. We are also rolling out these technologies to 
overseas group companies, making it possible to reduce 
the amount of plastic used in packaging.
 Besides our efforts in regard to film packaging, we are 
also implementing initiatives to reduce plastic usage 
through the reuse of bottles.
 Through effective coordination between the recycler 
and the manufacturer, we are getting used products 
recycled to create recycled products that are useful in 
consumers’ daily lives. Working together with distributors, 
competitors, local government authorities and other 
stakeholders, we are putting in place a framework for the 
collection of used packaging. Having as many other 
stakeholders as possible participate in this initiative will 
help make the benefits even more substantial.
 Furthermore, efforts to recover waste that has already 
been released into the environment greatly contribute to 
the protection of marine and land ecosystems.

Contributions to the SDGs

We believe that, in all processes from new product 
development through to disposal of used products, we 
should make an effort, as far as possible, to reduce the 
quantity of product that is subject to being disposed of 
and recycled, and that we should try to ensure that all 
waste, regardless of whether it is solid or liquid, is 
utilized in a way that is useful for society, with the 
ultimate goal of achieving a net zero waste society. As 
we see it, we should seek to maximize recycled 
resources, and when the generation of waste is 
unavoidable, it should be utilized appropriately.
 Our Basic Principle and Basic Policies on 
Environment and Safety states that “We shall contribute 
to social sustainability by giving thorough consideration 
to environmental conservation and human safety in every 
aspect of our operations, including product development, 
manufacture, distribution, usage and waste disposal.” 
Furthermore, the Kao Group Responsible Care Policy 
contains the following declaration: “We shall reduce, 
reuse and recycle waste and strive to continuously 
reduce environmental impact.”
 Our Environmental Statement embodies our 
commitment to ensuring that “Kao products utilize 
original Kao-developed technologies to minimize the 
impact they have on the environment, not just in the 
manufacturing process, but in the daily life of the 
customers who use them. From materials procurement 
and manufacturing, to distribution, sales, use and final 
disposal, we want to engage in ‘eco together’ with

stakeholders and consumers worldwide.”
 With the aim of realizing these policies in concrete 
terms, in October 2018 we announced Our Philosophy 
& Action on Plastic Packaging, which clearly enunciates 
that our action on plastic packaging is driven by our 4R 
(reduce, reuse, replace, recycle) program based on 
continuous improvement and bold innovation.
 In September 2019 we announced that, as part of our 
efforts to realize ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri, we would be 
taking responsibility for our products not only until they are 
sold, but until they are disposed of, and that we would be 
focusing heavily on Innovation in Reduction and 
Innovation in Recycling aimed at building the plastic 
resource circulating society. In May 2020, we established 
the Recycling Science Research Center in our R&D 
Division to drive business development with a plastic 
resource circulating model that incorporates RecyCreation. 
To realize our vision, we are collaborating with other 
business enterprises, local governments and universities 
as we seek to realize a resource-circulating society.

A further point is that food waste connected to our 
businesses is of relevance to Kao’s beverage business. 
In regard to food waste, we are working to reduce the 
amount of waste generated as much as possible, and 
striving to ensure that when the generation of waste is 
unavoidable, this waste is recycled.

Efforts in raw materials procurement
To reduce waste generated at our plants, we 
continuously work with external suppliers to adjust 
the volume and frequency of raw materials deliveries. 
This contributes to reducing the amount of packaging 
materials our suppliers procure as well as reducing 
CO2 emissions from the transport of raw materials.
 In addition, in order to reduce waste throughout 
the product lifecycle, we are continuing our efforts to 
improve the production methods used by our 
subcontractors for contracted product manufacturing, 
for example by providing them with relevant 

technology. This contributes to reducing CO2 
emissions associated with raw materials procurement.

Initiatives taken in relation to our products
We offer products such as disposable diapers and 
cleaning sheets that become waste after consumer use. 
While ensuring product performance, we are developing 
technologies to reduce the amount of materials used in 
products and contribute to reducing waste in order to 
reduce the amount of waste generated after product 
use. This also reduces costs and CO2 emissions in 
conjunction with waste processing.
 We also use recycled plastic for some of our 
products. As a result, we are able to reduce the 
amount of virgin plastic used, which leads to a 
reduction in the use of fossil fuels, the raw material 
for plastic. We are aware that these measures are 
important for solving the problem of plastic and 
creating a decarbonized society.
 In addition, regarding the eye-catching plastic 
stickers used on products to attract consumers’ 
attention, we have switched over to using certified paper 
for these when their use is unavoidable, and we 
eliminated all non-essential use of these stickers in 2021.

Initiatives targeting packaging
We are aiming to realize net zero waste for plastic 
packaging by 2040, and negative waste for plastic 
packaging by 2050. To achieve these goals, we are 
undertaking measures in compliance with the ISO 
18600 series standards for packaging and the

environment. Specifically, we are reducing the 
amount of materials used in packaging, and in 
particular we are reducing the use of plastic 
packaging, which has become a serious issue for 
society, by adopting a 4R (reduce, reuse, replace, 
recycle) approach from an Innovation in Reduction 
and Innovation in Recycling perspective.

Innovation in Reduction
This involves initiatives to reduce the amount of 
fossil-based plastic used.

Reduce
We are continuing to take steps to make containers 
and packaging thinner, as a means of reducing the 
amount of plastic used in individual products.

Reuse
We are promoting the adoption of refill and 
replacement products. The use of plastic film 
packaging enables us to slash the use of plastic by 
around 75% compared to plastic bottles. To expand 
the use of film packaging, we have continued to make 
improvements to these refill products according to 
bottle size, the viscosity of the contents and so on to 
make refilling easier for consumers, and we 
encourage the internal and external use of innovative 
film packaging. We are exploring the possibility of 
in-store refilling whereby consumers bring packaging 
to the store and purchase only the products they are 
filled with. In addition, we have adopted a “take-back” 

system for some products, whereby we take back 
used containers from customers and then clean them 
and reuse them.

Replace
We are implementing initiatives to replace fossil-
based plastics with alternative materials such as paper 
and metal. We are also proceeding with initiatives to 
use bio-based plastic as an alternative for fossil-based 
plastics. We have been using recycled paper for the 
carton boxes and instructional inserts for many 
products, including powdered laundry detergent, 
since the 1960s, and we plan to expand their use.

Innovation in Recycling
This involves initiatives to recover used packaging and 
recycle it so that it can be used again as recycled 
plastic.

Recycle
Recycling includes initiatives to develop packaging 
that is easy to recycle. Based on the fundamental 
technology that we have accumulated until now, we 
are focused on creating innovative recycling 
technologies for used plastic, including the use of 
recycled plastic for packaging, as well as developing 
and using high-quality, low-cost recycled plastics, 
encouraging activities that generate value from used 
plastic, and using plastic waste for industrial 
applications. We are also undertaking initiatives to 
replace refill packaging made from multiple layers of 

different plastic materials with a single material.
 We are establishing a framework to recover used 
packaging and recycle it, in collaboration with 
stakeholders such as distributors, competitors and 
local government authorities, with the aim of helping to 
build the resource-circulating society. We are also 
working actively to promote the use of recycled plastic.

Efforts in development, manufacturing and sales
We are reducing the amount of waste generated at 
our plants and offices, and we are reusing and 
recycling waste and other materials inside and outside 
the company. We have set reduction targets for how 
much waste we generate and are working company-
wide to achieve them.
 At plants, we are reducing loss of raw materials 
and products. For example, for liquid products, 
wastewater sludge is produced as a result of cleaning 
the mixing and storage tanks at the production facility 
when the product produced is switched. For sheet-type 
products, a portion of the sheet material is left unused 
when the material is switched out. We are studying 
loss reduction countermeasures on an ongoing basis 
according to the type of loss that occurs. We then 
implement improvements to reduce waste.
 Because products that are returned from stores 
are ultimately disposed of as waste, considerable 
expense and environmental impact arise including the 
waste of resources and GHG emissions during the 
disposal process as well as considerable disposal-
related expense. Going forward, we will work with

Zero waste 306-2 (Waste 2020), 404-2

Many of our products become waste after use. We 
are facing this fact earnestly and recognize the 
importance of giving our employees the chance to 
learn about the generation of waste from our business 
activities and used products through various 
programs and to actively engage in waste reduction 
measures of their own accord. To this end, we have 
created many opportunities for employee education.
 If, in addition to plants’ waste reduction activities 
and technology development that is oriented toward 
using fewer resources in manufacturing, there is also 

Education and promotion

stores to review product shipping and stock 
replenishment methods in an effort to minimize 
waste.
 In addition, sales promotion materials are 
discarded after use, so we are making a transition to 
disseminating information using digital means.

Enhancing waste recycling
It would be difficult to reduce generated waste to zero 
with currently available technology. Accordingly, we 
ensure that generated waste is thoroughly sorted, and 
we select the most appropriate recycling methods in 
cooperation with contracted waste treatment 
providers. We monitor the amount of waste recycled 
and sent for final disposal along with the amount of 
waste generated to improve how waste is treated 
overall.

Preventing illegal dumping of waste
When contracting waste treatment service providers 
to dispose of waste generated at our plants and 
offices, there is a risk of illegal dumping. To reduce 
this risk, we regularly visit the service providers to 
verify that the contracted waste is being disposed of 
appropriately. The Kao Group in Japan has created a 
database containing information including contracts 
with waste treatment service providers and the results 
obtained from surveys of appropriate waste treatment 
to prevent illegal dumping. This system is also 
connected to the Electronic Manifest System, which 
also ensures prevention of illegal dumping.

Proper storage and treatment of PCB waste
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were formerly used 
in insulating oil, such as in transformers and ballasts, 
but they have low degradability and therefore pose a 
risk to human health and can create hazards in living 
environments. We appropriately store and treat PCB-
containing waste in accordance with the law until its 
disposal is contracted to a service provider.

Reducing food waste
We are working with the business partners of our 
Beverage business to review the rules governing 
product returns for products that are nearing their 
expiry date. Some returned products can be utilized 
effectively in methane fermentation and composting. 
Through activities such as these, we are taking steps 
to reduce food waste.

a strengthening of employees’ waste awareness, then 
this will help to enhance our activities in this area. A 
further point is that employees are also consumers, 
and in their role as consumers it is important that they 
choose products more carefully and take steps to deal 
with waste properly.
 With regard to packaging, our research 
laboratories, Procurement, SCM, Business divisions, 
the ESG Division, etc. engage in a periodic exchange 
of views regarding our strategy in this area, the issues 
faced, and how to address them.

We recognize that, in order to help consumers realize 
the Kirei Lifestyle, it is vital for us to deepen mutual 
understanding with a wide range of stakeholders and 
collaborate with them, by developing mutual 
communication.
 As the waste generated by our production 
activities impacts on local communities, having good 
communication with local communities is also vitally 
important. Many of our plants compile an annual 
environmental report, and communicate with local 
residents.
 Methods of processing waste generated from our 
business activities as well as waste generated by 
consumers and customers after using our products 
are regulated by government agencies. In order that 
more waste can be recycled, and to make the 

Collaboration and engagement

Under the supervision of the Board of Directors, risk 
management in relation to zero waste issues is carried 
out by the Internal Control Committee and 
opportunity management is carried out by the ESG 
Managing Committee. The ESG Managing Committee 
decides on overall strategy regarding zero waste 
initiatives, and implements strategy decision-making 
and management with regard to waste generated 
from used products, and packaging. The Internal 
Control Committee handles management of waste 
generated from business activities. These committees 
are headed by the President.

more times each year, receiving activity reports from 
the Responsible Care Promotion Committee and other 
subordinate committees that it oversees and auditing 
the activities of those committees.
 Management of waste generated from used 
products, and of its recycling, is handled by the ESG 
Managing Committee, which meets six times a year. 
Committee members are the persons in charge of the 
Business, Sales, R&D, SCM and other divisions, an 
arrangement which connects divisions horizontally. 
The ESG Managing Committee, and the ESG 
Promotion Meeting which it supervises, discuss 
environmental issues including waste derived from 
packaging as well as social and governance issues.
 Site inspections of waste treatment service 
providers are conducted systematically in cooperation 
with the SCM Division, Procurement Division, 
Logistics Division, Enterprise Information Solutions 
Division, Sales Division and related companies.
 Data reliability is ensured by using a database that 
centrally manages environmental data for all Kao 
Group sites throughout the world, and by 
standardizing tasks and making them more efficient, 
we are able to conduct activities properly.

processing of waste easier, lobbying undertaken in 
collaboration with industry organizations is very 
important.
 It is also vitally important to share ideas with 
suppliers and undertake collaborative R&D with them, 
in order to reduce the amount of plastic used in 
packaging and enhance its recyclability.
 To realize a Kirei Lifestyle for consumers, a change 
in consumers’ behavior is needed. We provide 
opportunities to think about the Kirei Lifestyle through 
visits to museums and plants that take Kao products 
as the theme. This visit program includes displays that 
enable participants to get a real feel for the amount of 
waste generated from products manufactured using 
limited amounts of resources.

secretariat for the committee. The committee meets 
twice annually to report on and discuss the state of 
compliance with laws and regulations at all worksites 
throughout the world, the amount of waste 
generated, the status of recycling and other matters, 
and sets targets for the following year. The 
Responsible Care Promotion Committee Secretariat 
conducts monthly checks on compliance with laws 
and regulations, monitors waste amounts and the 
status of recycling, mainly at plants which have a 
large impact, and reports on these and other matters 
to the head of the committee, committee members, 
members of the Internal Control Committee, auditors 
and others.
 Activities related to waste issues are reported at 
the Japan RC Meeting and Global RC Meeting under 
the supervision of the Responsible Care Promotion 
Committee. The SCM Division, which manages our 
plants that account for the majority of waste 
generated by our plants and offices, holds the 
Environment Working Group Meeting with 
environmental staff at all plants, manages progress 
relating to activity targets regarding recycling and 
reducing waste at plants, and internally develops best 
practices.

Zero waste 306-2 (Waste 2020)

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
It will be necessary to raise productivity in order to 
curtail the amount of waste and the like generated 
from business activities. If productivity is raised, 
manufacturing costs can be reduced. In addition, 
promoting recycling can also be expected to reduce 
waste processing costs.
 By using innovative film packaging both internally 
and externally and meeting our targets for reducing 
plastic consumption, we can boost sales in new 
markets and earn revenue from licensing our patents.
 By increasing consumption of recycled and 
recyclable plastics, we can also avoid new taxes on 
the use of fossil-based plastic.

Social impacts
By curtailing waste and the like generated from 
business activities, promoting recycling to achieve 
zero waste, and developing a society where 
innovative film packaging that can drastically reduce 
the amount of plastic used (to around one-sixth of the 
former level) is widespread both internally and 
externally, we will contribute to enhancing resource 
productivity throughout society as a whole. Doing this 
will contribute to realizing a resource-circulating 
society and make it possible to offer consumers clean 
products in a future society with limited resource 
availability. These are important approaches for 
carrying out the Kirei Lifestyle and achieving One 
Planet Living vision.

We are aiming to have the reduction in the amount of 
plastic packaging used by Kao and by society as a 
whole*4 reach 200 thousand tons.
 We are also aiming to have the amount of plastic 
packaging that we use at Kao reach a peak by 2030.

*1 Annual penetration amount
*2 Amount of waste not recycled from business sites
*3 Beginning with production sites
*4  Amount of reduction achieved through the use of innovative 

film-based packaging, refill and replacement products, and devel-
opment of more concentrated products

2040 long-term targets
We are aiming to reduce plastic packaging waste to 
zero*5.
*5  This is the state in which the amount of plastic packaging used by 

Kao is roughly equivalent to the amount of plastic for which 
resource recovery is implemented by Kao*6.

*6  This is the amount of plastic that is upcycled, plus the amount 
recycled plastic used by Kao in packaging, plus the amount of 
plastic that is recovered, recycled and / or transformed into pellets 
by Kao working together with society as a whole.

2050 Long-term targets
We are aiming to reduce the amount of fossil-derived 
plastic used to zero.
 We are also aiming to achieve negative plastic 
packaging waste*7.
*7  This is the state in which the amount of plastic for which Kao 

implements resource recovery*6 is more than the amount of plastic 
packaging used by Kao.

We are aiming to realize net zero waste for plastic 
packaging by 2040, and negative waste for plastic 
packaging by 2050. We will also be maximizing our 
contribution toward helping society as a whole to 
reduce plastic packaging usage.

Performance

Amount of generated waste and other 
unwanted materials
In 2021, the amount of waste generated totaled 212 
thousand tons, representing an increase of 2 thousand 
tons compared to the previous year. As there was an 
increase in sales, the reduction rate (per unit of sales) 
was 27%, representing a slight improvement.

Waste that individual countries’ laws require be 
disposed of by landfill or incineration, and waste in 
countries where there are no facilities for disposal 
otherwise than by landfill or incineration, is excluded.

Reduction rate of discarded products and 
discarded sales promotion materials

The target for this activity was set in 2021. The 
performance achieved in 2021 was a 14% 
reduction rate.

Food waste
Since 2018, we have been implementing activities to 
reduce food waste. For Kao, food waste is generated 
when products are returned because of damage to 
packaging or because they are past the expiry date. In 
2021, the amount of food waste disposed of by the Kao 
Group as a whole totaled 723 tons, of which 43 tons 
were utilized effectively for methane fermentation or 
composting*. We have also been working together with 
our customers to revise the rules relating to the return 
of products that are approaching their expiry date.
*  Besides methane fermentation or composting, this figure also includes 

the effective utilization of packaging (such as cans or cartons).

Amount of hazardous waste generated
Of the generated waste, 37 thousand tons constituted 
hazardous waste. No hazardous waste was 
transported internationally under the Basel Convention.

Recycling
We are promoting the reuse of waste, such as 
offcuts generated in the production of diapers, 
etc., for example by turning such waste into pellets 
or using it to make paper products.
 Waste reused or recycled* came to 194 
thousand tons , a recycling rate of 92%.
 We maintained our target of a 0.1% or lower final 
disposal ratio for waste. We have achieved our target 
of zero emissions for the 17th consecutive year since 
the target was set (final disposal ratio to generated 
waste for all Kao Group worksites in Japan).
 Starting from 2021, as a new zero waste 
indicator, we have begun to calculate a combined 
landfill disposal and incineration rate, which was 
9.1% for all production sites combined in 2021. 
We are aiming to reduce this rate to under 1% (i.e., 
to more or less zero) by 2030.
 The combined landfill disposal and incineration 
rate is the share of industrial waste (as defined in 
Japan) generated by production sites that is 
disposed of either by landfill disposal (direct disposal

Inspection of waste treatment facilities
In 2021, as in 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the number of waste treatment facilities at 
which on-site inspection could be performed was lower 
than in normal years. However, by using documentary 
review, etc. we still managed to evaluate a total of 104 
facilities (in Japan), thanks to collaboration from 87 
waste treatment companies. The evaluation results 
showed that there were no waste treatment companies 
that did not meet Kao’s evaluation criteria.

Amount of packaging materials used, by material type
In 2021, paper and paper pulp usage came to 166 
thousand tons, with certified paper and paper pulp 
products accounting for 96% of the total. The amount 
of metal used in packaging was 4.1 thousand tons, and 
the amount of glass used was 0.7 thousand tons.

Horizontal recycling of film packaging
Since June 2021, we have been developing and 
verifying recycling technology at our pilot plant for 
film packaging recycling set up at Wakayama 
Research Laboratories. Since October 2021, we 
have also been participating in Kobe Plastic Next: 
Joining Forces to Recycle Refill Packs. In this 
project, retailers, consumer products manufacturers 
and recyclers (resource recycling business 
operators) collaborate with the city of Kobe to 
recycle used refill packs of household and personal 
care items, aiming to achieve circularity in society.
 We are examining easier-to-recycle packaging 
designs with the aim of raising recycling rates and 
realizing horizontal recycling.

Shift to 100% recyclable, reusable packaging
Plastic packaging used for household products in 
Japan is required by the Act on the Promotion of 
Sorted Collection and Recycling of Containers and 
Packaging to have a framework in place for recycling. 
Our plastic packaging is thus already 100% recyclable.
 Outside Japan, definitions of what constitutes 
recyclable packaging vary depending on the 
country or region, and recyclability also depends 
on the recycling systems that exist in each country 
or region. We are therefore working to confirm not 

only packaging specifications but also the sales 
areas for each type of packaging.

Amount of plastic packaging used
Plastic packaging usage in 2021 was 106 thousand 
tons. Of this, fossil-derived plastic usage amounted to 
104 thousand tons.
 Kao Corporation now offers 380 refill and 
replacement products (as of December 2021), with a 
penetration rate of 83% and slightly more than 80% 
recently. The refill ratio for fabric bleach in particular 
now stands at approximately 90% (unit basis).
 Plastic consumption has been reduced by 77.0 
thousand tons through the use of refill and 
replacement products. If the impact of making 
products more concentrated is also factored in, 
then the overall amount of reduction was 139.8 
thousand tons, and the reduction rate (compared 
to if the products had been packaged in the 
original plastic packaging) was 78.4%.

Usage and reduction volume of plastic in refill and replacement categories

Quantity of innovative film packaging penetration
In 2021, the total number of products 
manufactured using innovative film packaging, 
calculated as a combined total for products that 
included Raku-raku Eco Pack Refill and Air-in Film 
Bottle, was approximately 11 million items.

Amount of recycled plastic used
Recycled plastic made from used plastic is utilized 
for shampoo, conditioner and body wash products 
by Kao (Taiwan) Corporation, and it is also used by 
the salon-oriented Kerasilk brand in Europe and by 
the Oribe brand in the U.S., as well as by brands 
such as Attack ZERO and CuCute in Japan. The 
total amount of recycled plastic used in 2021 was 
1,339 tons (3.1 times as much as in 2020).

Recycled plastic usage rate in PET packaging 
In an initiative targeting household products sold 
in Japan, we have begun using recycled plastic in 
the manufacturing of PET packaging, starting 
with the packaging of Attack ZERO and CuCute 
Clear Foam Spray. In 2021, 19% of the plastic 
used in this PET packaging was recycled plastic.

Amount of bio-based plastics used
Bio-based plastics are used for Merit shampoo 
and conditioner, Segreta shampoo and 
conditioner, CuCute 1,380ml containers, Raku-raku 
Eco Pack Refill, and and shampoo and treatment, 
and other products, and the total amount used has 
reached 483 tons (0.9 times the amount in 2020).

Eye-catching stickers
The use of eye-catching plastic stickers was reduced 
by 100%.

Our initiatives

Reducing the amount of product materials used
We continue to reduce the materials used in making 
products that become waste after product use by 
consumers. For example, we reduced the product 
weight of medium-sized Merries disposable taped 
diapers by 37% while improving product function 
compared to its 1990 version.

Paper hot water pipes
Paper hot water pipes handled by Chemical Business 
combine molding technologies with high-temperature 
material technologies and are made from waste 
paper. Compared to general ceramic hot water pipes, 
the amount of raw materials used is reduced to one-
tenth and post-use waste to one-sixteenth.

Healthya Green Tea
Healthya Green Tea, which can help to reduce visceral 
fat, utilizes a drip method to effectively extract tea 
catechins, which are the active ingredient, from the 
tea leaves. In this way, the amount of tea leaves that 
need to be disposed of by the contract manufacturer 
as food waste after use is reduced by 37%.

Products that use recycled materials
We use recycled materials for some of our products. 
We have been using recycled paper in the carton 

boxes and instructional inserts of many products 
since the 1960s, including powder-type clothing 
detergents. We use recycled polypropylene (PP) in the 
measuring spoon for Attack powder type laundry 
detergent, which was first put on the market in 1987, 
and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in the 
fibers of Quickle Wiper floor dry cleaning sheets, 
which first appeared on the market in 1994.

Using waste PET to make NEWTLAC 5000 
asphalt modifier
The Chemical Business has used our proprietary 
modification and compounding techniques on 
discarded PET materials (waste PET) to develop 
NEWTLAC 5000, a new type of asphalt modifier, 
through upcycling. The full-scale commercial launch 
of the new product took place in late 2020.
 Besides improving the durability of road surfaces 
in the same way as conventional asphalt modifiers, 
because NEWTLAC 5000 uses waste PET, the 
disposal of which has become a problem for society, 
it makes it possible to create asphalt road surfaces 
that are not only durable but also environmentally 
friendly. (Approximately 1,430 PET bottles are used in 
surfacing an area of road of 100m2)

Recycling of used disposable diapers
Field testing of technology to convert used disposable 
diapers into carbon material began in January 2021, 
in collaboration with Saijo City, Ehime Prefecture, 

Initiatives taken in relation to 
our products

where Kao Sanitary Products Ehime is located. We 
have developed carbonization technology that 
reduces the amount of CO2 emitted during recycling, 
while also sterilizing and eliminating odor, and 
reducing the volume occupied by the recycled 
material. We are proceeding with activities to develop 
applications for the carbon material obtained through 
recycling, including industrial uses, air and aquatic 
environment purification, and plant cultivation.
 The recycling system development has been 
undertaken through joint research with Kyoto 
University Open Innovation Institute, with the aim of 
realizing social implementation by 2025.

Launch of the Raku-raku Switch for dispensing a fixed 
amount from film packaging with one light push
Bioré u The Body—Body Lotion for Wet Skin, which 
was launched in September 2020, uses a Raku-raku 
Switch that, when attached to a Raku-raku Eco Pack, 
makes it possible to extract a fixed amount of liquid 
with just a light touch. Compared to bottles with 
pumps, Raku-raku Switch-equipped products reduce 
the amount of plastic used by around 50%. From a 
universal design perspective, these products have the 
outstanding feature of being easy to use even for 
people who do not have much strength.

Air-in Film Bottle technology adopted for use in 
MyKirei by KAO products sold in the U.S.A.
In April 2020, Kao-developed Air-in Film Bottle film 
packaging began to be used for the first time for 
MyKirei by KAO products sold in the U.S.A. The film is 
the same kind of soft material used in refill packaging. 
The bottles gain their rigidity through an air fill, 
allowing them to stand upright, and compared to 
conventional pump bottles, they use approximately 
50% less plastic. Additionally, compared to 
conventional bottles there is less liquid left in the 
bottles when they are disposed of.

Initiatives to reduce
Smart Holder and Raku-raku Eco Pack Refill
In 2017, we proposed Raku-raku Eco Pack Refill, 
which can be used with our Smart Holder, improving 
usability and allowing the product to be completely 
consumed, thus reducing environmental impact. This 
eliminates the need for an original plastic bottle.
 Until now, these were sold only on our online site, 
but we implemented a full-scale rollout to stores in 
April 2020. We believe this will make them accessible 
to more consumers and will encourage use.

Zero waste 301-2, 301-3, 306-2 (Waste 2020)

Total elimination of eye-catching plastic stickers
Eye-catching plastic stickers attached to products 
provide consumers with information on product 
advantages and correct usage at the time of 
purchase, but they increase the amount of plastic 
used, and the increase in plastic waste and CO2 
emissions at the time of disposal is an issue.
 We therefore terminated the manufacturing of 
products with eye-catching plastic stickers in late 2021.

Thin-film packaging
Film packaging already uses less plastic than regular 
containers, but we are proceeding with efforts to 
further improve it by making it even thinner. Bioré 
products sold in Indonesia use film packaging that 
realizes a 14% reduction in weight.

Elimination of measuring scoops
Powder-type laundry detergent is sold packaged with 
a plastic scoop for measuring out the right amount of 
powder. Some Attack products sold in China are now 
sold without a plastic scoop.

Use of bio-based plastics
We are actively developing technologies for using 

bio-based plastics for bottles and refills. Since we 
began this initiative in 2012, our consumption of 
bio-based plastics and the range of products for 
which they are used have continued to expand.
 For example, Raku-raku Eco Pack Refills are made 
from 15% bio-based plastic on a weight basis.

Initiatives to Reuse (promoting the adoption of 
refill and replacement products)
We continue to provide refill and replacement 
products and expand sales of Smart Holder.

Hakariuri-do
In September 2021, we launched Hakariuri-do retail 
counters in two branches of the Welcia Yakkyoku 
drugstore chain, where customers can purchase refills 
of the desired quantity of Attack ZERO and EMAL 
laundry detergent, Flair 
Fragrance IROKA 
softener and CuCute 
dishwashing detergent. 
By bringing their own 
bottles to get refills at 
the store, customers 
are helping to reduce 
plastic waste.

Refillable in stores
At Molton Brown, following on from the packaging 
reduction initiative implemented in 2020 (specifically, 

in-store refill for hand wash products), starting from 
2021, reusable bottles and Aroma Reed Diffuser refills 
have been on sale both in-store and online in Europe 
and in the Americas. Utilizing refills makes it possible 
to reduce the amount of single-use plastic and plastic 
that is disposed of as waste by 82%.

Take back system creation
Chemical Business is conducting a program to reuse 
sold product packaging (take back system) to reduce 
their environmental impact. In 2021, a total of 20,132 
1-ton containers (IBC containers) used for corporate 
customers were collected for reuse.

Initiatives to recycle
RecyCreation activities
We have been engaged in research toward creating a 
new resource recycling system. We have proposed 
the RecyCreation approach, which generates new 
value by adding technology and the knowledge and 
ideas of various people to used items. To date, we 
have continuously conducted verification in five areas 
with members of the community.

Zero waste 301-2, 301-3, 306-2 (Waste 2020)

 In a trial, we collected used refill packs for laundry 
detergent, shampoo and other products from 
members of the community and recycled them to 
create a block of recycled plastic that symbolizes 
“creation” of various objects and values that will be 
useful for community development and lifestyle 
development. In September 2020, we made the 
decision to collaborate with Lion Corporation on 
RecyCreation, and began field testing at the Ito-
Yokado Hikifune store in Sumida-ku, Tokyo of a 
program to implement in-store collection and 
recycling of used refill packaging. Over a period of 
approximately one year from October 30, 2020 to the 
end of October 2021, we collected approximately 
9,500 pieces of film packaging*. Going forward, we 
will be aiming to realize horizontal material recycling 
that makes it possible for film packaging to be 
recycled for use in the production of film packaging.
*  Calculated by dividing the total weight of collected film packaging̶

170.2kg̶by the average weight per piece of packaging, which was 
18.0g (in the 2021 report, the calculation was based on an estimated 
average weight of 14.4g).

Commencement of the verification process for a 
resource-circulating model project involving 
horizontal material recycling* of single-use plastics
Since October 2021, we have been participating in 
Kobe Plastic Next: Joining Forces to Recycle Refill 
Packs. In this project, retailers, consumer products 
manufacturers and recyclers (resource recycling 
business operators) collaborate with the city of Kobe 
to recycle used refill packs of household and personal 
care items, aiming to achieve circularity in society.
 The city of Kobe encourages every resident of 
Kobe to recycle used refill packs from detergents and 
shampoo products, etc. by dropping them off in 

RecyCreation on Facebook

www.facebook.com/RecyCreation.jp/ (Japanese)

collection boxes placed in 75 locations at retail outlets 
throughout the city. By leveraging “return trip 
operations” from retail outlets and cooperation of 
existing waste collection operators, used refill packs 
can be collected effectively with minimum 
environmental impact. Recyclers and manufacturers 
are working together to achieve horizontal recycling 
to film packaging from the collected refill packs, as 
well as turn them into recycled products that are 
useful in daily life. Kobe and 16 companies and 
organizations are collaborating to realize circularity of 
resources. The project aims to set an example to help 
promote similar activities across Japan.

* Recycling of materials into products with the same application

Use of recycled materials
Kao (Taiwan) has been using recycled plastic for 
regular containers since 2016. In 2021, Kao (Taiwan) 
also started recycling polyethylene, which is more 
challenging to recycle, for use in this way.

Development of film packaging recycling 
technology
Refill packs can significantly reduce the amount of 
plastic used compared to rigid containers and are 
made from composite materials with many layers 
rather than a single raw material, such as PET bottles, 
in order to protect its contents from heat, moisture 
and ultraviolet rays with a thin film. In doing so, the 
different varieties of recycled ingredients make 
inhomogeneous plastic, which is difficult to reuse in 
film packaging under present circumstances.
 We aim to improve the rate of recycling and 
achieve horizontal recycling by developing and 
verifying recycling technology at our pilot plant for 
film packaging recycling set up at Wakayama 
Research Laboratories in June 2021. The plant will 
examine effective processes for separation and 
collection from consumers and easier-to-recycle 
packaging designs.

Reducing the amount of waste produced
We handle a large number of liquid products, and 
reducing the sludge produced from treating 
concentrated wastewater generated in the process of 
cleaning tanks and switching products is a major issue.
 Kao Industrial (Thailand) treats wastewater using 
separate wastewater treatment facilities according to 
the COD concentration of the wastewater, which has 
successfully reduced the amount of sludge produced 
and contributes to reducing waste. Fatty Chemical 
(Malaysia) has also reduced waste through the 
adoption of sludge dewatering equipment.
 Also, to contribute to reducing the amount of 
generated waste at retailers, we are working with the 
understanding and cooperation of retailers to reduce 
the number of boxes used in the delivery of products.

Enhancing waste recycling
Waste recycling in manufacturing
One example of this is recycling the waste generated 
by the manufacture of diaper and feminine products to 
be turned into plastic pallets. We began test operation 
of this system at our plants in 2016, with cooperation 
from research laboratories and related divisions using 
the strengths of our matrix management.
 By 2020, we were able to recycle 772 tons of 
waste into approximately 49,620 plastic pallets. This 
project has now been put on hold, as the required 
number of plastic pallets had already been secured.

Initiatives adopted at our business sites

Global RC Meeting
As a part of our Responsible Care (RC) measures, RC 
managers in Japan, and RC managers of overseas 
subsidiaries with manufacturing plants, hold an 
annual meeting. The aims are to invigorate RC 
activities and raise their level including reducing 
waste produced by subsidiaries.
 Unfortunately, in 2021 this activity had to be held 
through the exchange of documents, because of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

RC Environment Committee of the SCM Division
The RC Environment Committee of the SCM Division 
meets twice annually to gain an understanding of 
conditions at each plant and share information on best 
practices with the objectives of curtailing the production 
of waste from plants in Japan and promoting recycling.

A packaging review meeting
To promote activities and understanding internally, 
Packaging Technology Research holds packaging 
review meetings when new and improved products 
are launched. Members from the relevant divisions, 
including business units, the SCM Division and the 
Consumer Communication Center, evaluate the 
environmental performance of the packaging.
 In 2021, a total of 47 meetings were held in 
Japan, and 9 elsewhere in Asia. All of these meetings 
were held online.

“eco together” with consumers / customers
Awareness-raising activities at the Kao Eco-Lab 
Museum
To encourage more consumers to choose refill and 
replacement products that greatly reduce plastic 
consumption, overviews of our packaging initiatives 
have been presented at the Kao Eco-Lab Museum 
and at the EcoPro exhibition.

Ways to look after and wash eco-friendly 
reusable shopping bags to keep them clean
With the rise in awareness and concern for the 
environment, as well as the fact that consumers are 
increasingly having to pay for plastic shopping bags, 
88% of people reported taking an eco-friendly 
reusable shopping bag with them when they go 
shopping (according to a survey conducted by Kao in 

Collaboration with stakeholders 
based on “eco together”

December 2019).
 In relation to new legislation in Japan that came 
into effect in July 2020, requiring consumers to pay 
for plastic shopping bags in shops, the Kao Consumer 
Research Center has posted hints on ways to look 
after eco-friendly reusable shopping bags, which are 
now being used more frequently, and to keep them 
clean, on the life information website (Japanese).

“eco together” with partners
Recognizing that it is essential to collaborate with 
manufacturers producing materials, recycled plastics 
and packaging when developing and launching new 
packaging, we work together with a wide range of 
business partners.

“eco together” with society
Clean Ocean Material Alliance
We are participating in the Clean Ocean Material 
Alliance, which was established to encourage global 
initiatives for solving the ocean plastic pollution 
problem. The Kao Corporation Director and Chair is 
chairman of the alliance, and Kao is taking a leading 
role among Japanese businesses.

Japan Partnership for Circular Economy (J4CE)
The trend toward development of the circular economy 
is picking up speed throughout the world, and we are 
participating in the Japan Partnership for Circular 
Economy, which was established to strengthen 
collaboration between government and the private 
sector, with the aim of promoting an enhanced 
understanding of the circular economy among a wide 
range of stakeholders, including Japanese companies, 
and of promoting related initiatives. We provided case 
studies for inclusion in a collection of case studies, and 
our representatives were included in the panelists for a 
panel discussion held to accompany the official 
ceremony that marked the publication of the collection 
of case studies and the launching of the related website.

Package collection measures
Together with outside organizations, we are involved 
in recovering packaging, etc. discharged into the 
natural environment.
 In October 2020, we signed a cooperation 
agreement with Wakayama City. To protect the ocean 
from pollution, including marine plastic waste, arising 
from land-based activities, we have undertaken 
surveys and collection of marine plastic waste that 
has accumulated at Tomogashima, Kataonami and

Hamanomiya Beach. We are promoting research on 
reusing recovered marine plastic to make tables and 
chairs for oceanside facilities, and using it as a road 
strengthening agent on the oceanside cycling path. 
We are also engaging in unique clean-up activities for 
river and ocean waste and in the community.

Employees’ voice

In May 2020, Kao established the Recycling Science 
Research Center, with the aim of realizing zero plastic 
waste, underscoring our commitment to dedicating plastic 
resource recovery and recycling. The coupling of the word 
“science” with “recycling” in the name of the Recycling 
Science Research Center embodies our passion for 
developing technology based on Essential Research, which 
forms part of Kao’s corporate philosophy Yoki-Monozukuri. 
The center has four main research projects: packaging 
recycling, ocean plastic waste recycling, used-diapers 
recycling, and RecyCreation. Regarding packaging 
recycling, in 2020, we demonstrated a resource circulation 
model project as the main operator for material recycling of 
single-use plastics, in which the New Business Model for 
Sustainable Use of Plastics initiative was organized by the 
Tokyo Metropolitan Government. In this field testing,

Packaging Technology Research 
Laboratories

Recycling Science Research 
Center initiatives

besides developing easily-recyclable plastic packaging, we 
conducted material recycling of post-consumer used 
packaging (in this case, recycling from used refill packs to 
bottles) under a cross-industry collaborative framework. 
The packaging development involved the design and 
manufacturing of refill packs composed of mono-materials, 
while the packaging recycling part of the project involved 
testing recycling technology using used refill packs 
collected from approximately 90 elementary and junior 
high schools and public facilities. In parallel with the field 
testing, we also conducted a monitoring survey of a group 
of approximately 90 consumers regarding their attitude 
toward using refill packs. The collaborative project with 
other enterprises and local government authorities enabled 
us to carry out the field testing within the short period of 
around one year, and get a window of opportunity to find 
the following two new insights.
 First, the monitoring survey disclosed that consumers 
have high environmental awareness. Based on the results, 
we found that “environmental and resource issues” 
constituted one of the things that consumers had been 
worrying about most recently, with 85% of consumers being 
worried about this, and that much of this was concerned 
with “the issue of plastic, and waste sorting.” It also revealed 

preferences in terms of the way to collect used packaging; 
many consumers liked the idea of being able to drop it off at 
stores or public facilities. Through the monitoring test, we 
perceived that it is important to develop solutions that fit our 
lifestyle without imposing a burden on users.
 Second, the implementation of the recycling test 
suggested the importance of process management in 
recycling. The types of regular recycling materials and 
installed recycling machines depend on the geographical 
region and the recycling plant. For example, a lack of initial 
cleaning of the recycling facility creates a risk that other, 
previously processed materials carry over to subsequent 
recycling, resulting in unexpectedly degrading the quality of 
the recycled materials. In order to conduct recycling with 
minimal variation in quality, it is vitally important to 
implement detailed checks regarding the risk of 
contamination and the quality of washing water in the 
recycling process.
 Although our project is at the field testing stage, we 
aim to contribute to the growth of a resource-circulating 
society by dedicating ourselves to the transformation of 
social infrastructure in cooperation with other companies, 
local government authorities, associations, and central 
government agencies, who have the same vision as us.

Introducing cases at seminars on waste
In Japan, it has been reported that many incidents 
occur at waste treatment companies, which are 
caused by not providing sufficient information on the 
chemical substances to the contractor when 
contracting the waste treatment.
 Therefore, we present cases at various seminars 

regarding waste with the aims of spreading our 
knowledge about past successful cases of improving 
communication with waste treatment companies, and 
identifying points of improvement in how we 
communicate information.
 Thanks to these activities, there were again no incidents 
involving waste contracted for disposal from us in 2021.

Zero waste 102-44

Hopes and suggestions regarding Kao’s 
further intensification and expansion of its 
activities as it aims to realize zero waste
Kao continued to make significant forward progress in 
its activities in 2021, as it had done in 2020. The 
company announced ambitious targets, and made 
steady progress with demonstration-level projects to 
achieve these targets.
 The most important of Kao’s initiatives has been the 
announcement that the company would seek to achieve 
net zero carbon emissions by 2040, and become carbon 
negative by 2050. To achieve these goals, Kao has set 
concrete, individual targets, and is taking steps to meet 
them throughout the company. Of these measures, one 
crucial step forward is the refill pouch collection and 
recycling initiative, which aims to recover 10,000 tons of 
refill packaging by 2025.
 In October 2021, in Kobe City, the city government, 
ten consumer products manufacturers, four distribution 
firms, two waste disposal firms and various NPOs joined 
forces to install refill pouch collection points in retail 
stores. Kao is also participating in similar projects in 
Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka Prefecture and in Higashi-
Yamato City, Tokyo.
 In the Kobe City project, a collaboration between 
manufacturers that between them account for over 80% 
of recovered material (by weight) has made it possible to 
achieve very high-quality recovered material, only 
around 3% of which is foreign matter, and most of 
which has been washed. Data for the first three months 
of project implementation indicates that the quantity of 
recovered material has been increasing steadily, so it is 
anticipated that this project will be very successful.
 There are three main obstacles to the achievement of 
Kao’s targets. Firstly, there is the question of consumer 
cooperation. In order to get more consumers 
collaborating with recycling initiatives, it is essential to 
develop a more in-depth understanding of consumers’ 
resource (waste) generation activity, and to implement 

effective communication based on this understanding. To 
achieve this, it would be beneficial to execute an analysis 
of the results achieved and conduct surveys of the project 
to collect waste from retail stores in Kobe City, the 
community drop-off project that was launched in Kobe 
City at around the same time, and similar projects that 
have been implemented in other cities. By using resource 
recovery to develop a more in-depth understanding of 
consumer behavior, it should be possible for retailers to 
identify new value. This will also help clarify retail stores’ 
role in the resource-circulating society.
 Secondly, there is the issue of realizing high-level 
recycling of recovered material. Currently, while it is 
already possible to use recovered refill pouches to make 
thin film for use in producing Air-in Film Bottles (on a trial 
basis), if Kao is to achieve its goal of realizing net zero 
carbon emissions, then it will need raise the recycled 
resource utilization rate to nearly 100%.
 A third obstacle is the need to achieve the right 
balance between originality and standardization regarding 
product design. In order to realize high-level recycling, it 
is vital that product design takes the recovery stage into 
account. Thinking about consumers’ understanding of 
recycling, and in terms of the economics of collection 
logistics, it would seem reasonable for products to be 
produced to enable consumers to recognize them as 
being in the same product category at the recovery stage. 
However, in the linear economy that has characterized 
society to date, each company has been working 
assiduously, and undertaking technical innovation, to 
ensure that its products are differentiated from those of 
other companies. In the resource-circulating society, we 
will need to maintain this dynamism while also 
establishing a standard framework for product design.
 Although space restrictions prevent me from 
discussing it here, given how ambitious Kao’s targets 
are, it would also be beneficial for Kao to undertake 
wide-ranging exploration of the potential for selling 
products by weight, chemical recycling, etc.

Kao’s response to the views expressed 
last year
Regarding the issues on which we received advice 
last year, we have been working in collaboration 
with retailers and logistics companies to increase 
the number of locations at which in-store 
collection points have been established, and also 
to take on new challenges, such as implementing 
field testing for more efficient collection methods 
that make use of delivery trucks’ return trips to 
transport collected material. With regard to refill 
pack material, in addition to undertaking 
development of horizontal recycling technology, 
we have also been proceeding with the sharing of 
information regarding specifications and materials, 
as issues with these can constitute an obstacle to 
improving the recycling process. In 2022, we are 
continuing to work together with our stakeholders 
with the aim of further expanding the scope of 
recycling, and further enhancing its efficiency.

Water conservation 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 303-1 (Water and effluents 2018)

Kao is promoting water conservation throughout the entire product lifecycle, by providing products that conserve water during use, and which have high 
water-saving benefits.

Social issues we are aware of
Water is necessary to life for all plants and animals on 
the planet. All humans also need access to 
sustainable sources of sanitary water in order to 
maintain wholehearted satisfaction and enrichment. 
In Japan, water used for washing apparently accounts 
for the largest share of total household water usage*1. 
Furthermore, given that water used by Japanese 
households when using Kao products accounts for 
around 15% of all household water usage in Japan*2, 
we recognize that we have a big role to play within 
society in relation to water resource conservation.
 Currently, problems including localized torrential 
rains and floods, chronic drought and related long-
term dry conditions, are arising in many regions and 
are predicted to grow in severity due to future 
population growth and climate change.
 In addition, water is a local resource, and 
consequently, for example, even when the same 
amount of water is taken from a river, there is a 
significant difference in terms of the impact on water 
resources between water taken in a water resource-
rich basin and water taken in a water-stressed 
watershed. For this reason, when we undertake 
sustainable operation, we are aware that we need to 
take action both to reduce the company’s own water 
risk and to give consideration to the local environment

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
The number of people living in the world’s major cities 
continues to increase. If urban water infrastructure is 
unable to keep pace with urban residents’ continually 
increasing demand for water, then residents may not 
have enough water to use, and it may be impossible 
to implement wastewater treatment properly. In this 
case, citizens’ cleanliness and sanitation may be 
under threat. Furthermore, if the cost of municipal 
water supply rises, then plant operation costs will rise 
too, with a risk that this may lead to reduced profits. 
Plants need to act with consideration for the 
environment and residents of watersheds, and we 
believe that failure to do so will give rise to reputation 
risks among local residents and others.
 Due to the effects of climate change, the impact 
of drought and localized torrential rains is being seen 
all over the world. Governments and business 
enterprises are implementing various measures to 
reduce GHG emissions, but further rises in 
temperature are inevitable, and the resulting impacts 
are sure to become even more serious.

Starting in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen 
the emergence of new risks and opportunities. At the 

same time, water consumption has increased 
throughout the product lifecycle, particularly during 
use. As a result, there is a growing possibility that we 
may not be able to achieve our water reduction 
targets. Failure to achieve these targets could incur 
risk of damage to the company’s reputation. Even 
though people’s awareness of sanitation has been 
heightened, if drought occurs, there is a risk that they 
will not be able to perform cleaning activities 
adequately, and so will not be able to maintain the 
Kirei Lifestyle.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Because the rise in awareness of the need to save 
water and the need for cleanliness and hygiene, 
which has emerged in relation to climate change, is 
closely linked to our business areas, current 
developments also represent a significant opportunity 
for us. Continuous implementation of measures to 
reduce plant water usage in response to the situations 
outlined above should lead to both cost reductions 
and increased profits.
 Rising awareness of the need to save water will 
create opportunities for increased sales of water-
saving products for washing clothes, washing one’s 
body, etc. Furthermore, rising awareness of the 
importance of cleanliness and hygiene will generate 
opportunities for increased sales of all cleaning 
products.

Kao’s creating value
We aim to substantially improve water usage 
efficiency in all stages of the product lifecycles. At our 
plants, we set targets and continue to aim for water 
use reduction. We believe that this contributes toward 
safeguarding the river basins (rivers and their sources) 
that are used to supply water to the plants.
 When the livelihoods of local residents are 
threatened by water risk, as a good corporate citizen 
with strong roots in the community, we work actively 
to provide support for local residents.
 We are also developing water-saving products, 
which we are rolling out globally, to reduce water 
consumption during product use. As we see it, in this 
way, even if restrictions are placed on water usage, 
consumers can continue to enjoy lives of cleanliness.

Contributions to the SDGs

The product use stage accounts for around 90% of 
total lifecycle water usage for Kao products, with the 
raw materials procurement stage accounting for only 
around 10%. As one of Japan’s leading manufacturers 
of consumer products, we are demonstrating 
leadership by actively rolling out new, water-saving 
products and striving to realize effective engagement 
with government bodies and suppliers.
 We continue to implement activities aimed at 
minimizing the negative impact on water conservation 
at every stage, from product development through to 
disposal.
 We will promote “eco together” activities in 
relation to water-saving products, in line with the Kao 
Environmental Statement, which embodies our 
commitment to ensuring that “Kao products utilize 
original Kao-developed technologies to minimize the 
impact they have on the environment, not just in the 
manufacturing process, but in the daily life of the 
customers who use them. From materials 
procurement and manufacturing, to distribution, 
sales, usage and final disposal, we want to engage in 
‘eco together’ with stakeholders including consumers 
worldwide.”
 In our Basic Principle and Basic Policies on 
Environment and Safety, we undertake to “assess 
environment and safety aspects throughout the entire 
lifecycle of the products, from manufacture through

environmental burden.” Furthermore, the Kao Group 
Responsible Care Policy contains the following 
declarations: “We will strive to develop technologies 
for products that consumers and customers can use 
with peace of mind, as well as striving to provide 
products that have a low environmental impact,” and 
“We shall strive to continue to reduce the 
environmental impact of our business operations by 
promoting reduction of uses of resources such as 
water.”

Water conservation 102-20, 102-43, 404-2

As the product use stage accounts for around 90% of 
total product lifecycle water use, it is important to 
design products that contribute to saving water. For 
this reason, we provide employees with numerous 
opportunities to learn about this.
 By giving our employees opportunities to learn 
about water through various programs, we can 
ensure that they will actively engage in water 
preservation activities of their own accord when 
engaging in water conservation at plants or 
conducting R&D on water-saving products. This will 
raise the overall level of our water saving activities.
 Not only are our employees in a position to develop 
and supply products, when they are not at work, they are 
consumers, and as such are among the people who 
select those products. Therefore, it is important that 
employees also undertake measures to conserve water in 
the role as consumers. Starting in 2021, we have begun 
making and disseminating educational videos relating to 
water conservation for internal use by all employees that 
are specific to the themes of the Kirei Lifestyle Plan.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

We recognize that, in order to help consumers realize 
the Kirei Lifestyle, it is vital for us to deepen mutual 
understanding with all stakeholders and to collaborate 

Risk management is carried out by the Internal 
Control Committee and opportunity management is 
carried out by the ESG Managing Committee, under 
the supervision of the Board of Directors. These 
committees are headed by the President.
 The Responsible Care Promotion Committee, 
which manages policy / regulatory regime and 
technology risks, and the Risk and Crisis Management 
Committee, which manages market, reputational and 
acute risks, are under the Internal Control Committee. 
These committees are headed by the executive officer 
in charge of the Corporate Strategy.
 The Risk Management and Responsible Care 
group of the Corporate Strategy Division acts as the 
secretariats for the Responsible Care Promotion 
Committee and the Risk and Crisis Management 
Committee.
 The Responsible Care Promotion Committee 
meets twice a year to report on and discuss 
compliance with laws and regulations, status of water 
use reduction and other matters. It also sets targets 
for the following year. The Responsible Care 
Promotion Committee Secretariat conducts monthly 
checks on compliance with laws and regulations, and 
monitors water use, mainly at plants which have a 
large impact on water issues, reporting on these and 
other matters to the head of the committee, 
committee members, members of the Internal Control 
Committee, auditors and others. The Risk and Crisis 

Education and promotion Frameworkwith them, by developing two-way communication.
 As the water consumed in our production activities 
impacts local communities, having good communication 
with local communities is vitally important. Many of our 
plants compile an annual environmental report, and 
communicate with local residents.
 In order to solve water issues faced by countries and 
regions, we actively participate in programs organized by 
central government, local government authorities, NPOs 
and others. We play a leading role in the Future of Washing 
Initiative, which is gathering wisdom from industry, 
academia, government and ordinary citizens across the 
boundaries of traditional business domains and academic 
fields, and discussing and proposing washing solutions for 
the future. We are implementing a water conservation 
campaign in China and are participating in the Water Project 
conducted by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan. 
 It is essential that suppliers in high water risk sectors 
understand the need to improve their water 
management standards and to take appropriate actions. 
Through the CDP Supply Chain Program, we request that 
suppliers respond each year. We provide feedback on 
supplier assessment results in order to enhance the 
overall level of the activities undertaken by each supplier. 
 Consumer behavior needs to change in order for 
consumers to attain the Kirei Lifestyle. We provide 
opportunities to think about the Kirei Lifestyle through 
visits to museums and plants that adopt as a theme 
the water that all consumers use daily. For example, 
the Kao Eco-Lab Museum has displays that vividly 
indicate the amount of household water usage.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

Management Committee which manages natural 
disaster including caused by climate change and 
reputational risks, meets four times a year.
 The Internal Control Committee meets one or 
more times a year, receiving activity reports from the 
Responsible Care Promotion Committee, the Risk and 
Crisis Management Committee and other subordinate 
committees that it oversees and auditing the activities 
of those committees.
 Opportunity management relating to water issues 
is handled by the ESG Managing Committee, which 
meets six times a year. Committee members are the 
persons in charge of the Business, Sales, R&D, SCM 
and other divisions, an arrangement which connects 
divisions horizontally. The ESG Managing Committee, 
and the ESG Promotion Meeting which it supervises, 
discuss water and environmental issues as well as 
social and governance issues. The committee reports 
on its activities to the Board of Directors one or more 
times a year and is audited by the Board of Directors.
 The risk and opportunity management system for 
water resources is the same as the management 
system for decarbonization.

At all Kao Group sites, water-saving is promoted on a 
daily basis in all activities, including production, 
research and operations. Besides providing water-
saving products that help to save water across the 
entire product lifecycle, we also seek to spread 
awareness of the importance of saving water to all of 
our stakeholders.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
Achieving water consumption targets for all Kao 
Group sites will contribute to lowering operational 
costs and to improving earnings. Achieving targets for 
water consumption during product used and during 
the product lifecycle will require increased sales of 
water-saving products, and as a result, increased 
sales by achieving these targets can be expected.
 If no action is taken to reduce usage, the overall 
municipal water usage of the Kao Group as a whole in 
2030 will be 1.66 times higher than in 2017.

Assuming that water charges rise by 20%*, then it 
can be anticipated that our costs will rise by 771 
million yen. We have set ourselves the goal of 
reducing water usage by 45% by 2030 compared to 
2005, which is expected to keep the increase in costs 
down to 51 million yen.

Social impacts
Achieving water consumption targets for all Kao 
Group sites will contribute to sustainable availability 
or supply of fresh water in the river basin where water 
sources used by plants are located, and will have a 
positive effect on conserving ecosystems. Moreover, 
achieving targets for water consumption during 
product used and during the product lifecycle will 
reduce the burdens of waterworks infrastructure 
maintenance, and reducing water usage by 
consumers will lead to lower fees consumers pay for 
water and sewer service.

Reviews of performance

Our water consumption (all sites) came to 
17.3 million m3, slightly higher than in the 
previous year. As sales increased, the per 
unit (of sales) reduction rate rose to 40%, 
which was an improvement compared to the 
previous year, but we did not achieve our 
target of 41% for 2021. Water consumption 
at production sites with water intake risks 
came to 2.9 million m3.
 Water consumption across the entire 
product lifecycle (for the Kao Group as a 
whole) rose by 92 million m3 year-on-year. The 
per unit (of sales) reduction rate for water 
consumption across the entire product 
lifecycle was the same as in the previous year, 
up 5 percentage points compared to 2017.
 Demand for hand soap and hand 
sanitizer had been unusually strong due to 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
high demand fell off slightly, and so the 
water usage associated with this demand 
also fell. On the other hand, sales of laundry 
detergent, which has high water usage per 
unit of sales, rose, and so overall there was a 
slight increase.
 The challenge is to reduce water 
consumption during the use stage. We are 
working to further expand our water-saving 
products.

Efforts in development, 
manufacturing and sales

We began participating in the CDP Supply Chain Program 
in 2015 and we encourage suppliers in high water risk 
sectors to work on improving their water management 
standards. More specifically, we ask suppliers to fill out 
the CDP questionnaire survey. We use our unique 
methods to evaluate suppliers’ water management status, 
and we provide feedback on the evaluation results.
 The 2021 survey results showed that the number 
of suppliers obtaining an evaluation of at least “three 
stars” had increased by seven compared to the 
previous year, indicating that the overall supplier 
activity level had risen. At the same time, in regard to 
the roughly 25% of suppliers who failed to respond to 
the survey, we are working on engagement to 
encourage these suppliers to respond.

Initiatives to reduce water consumption
We use water as a product ingredient as well as to 
clean and cool equipment at our plants. We set 
targets to reduce water consumption at each plant 
and are working to reduce consumption and increase 
recycling based on the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and 
recycling).

Reduce
Multiple plants including Kao Chemicals GmbH in 
Germany conduct efforts to increase the number of 
times that water is reused for boilers and for cooling 
to reduce their water consumption.

Reuse
Rainwater is collected and used to water green 
spaces at the Sumida Office, Kao Chemical 
Corporation Shanghai and Fatty Chemical (Malaysia).

Recycle
Active recycling efforts, such as recovering steam and 
treating and reusing water that has been used in 
production processes, are being carried out at many 
plants.

Our initiatives

Concluded an agreement with the local 
community to receive treated water from the 
community’s wastewater treatment plant. Reverse 
osmosis is employed to use sewerage effectively, 
and Quimi-Kao further purifies the treated water it 
has purchased and releases water left over from 
production into a river through the community’s 
facility, thus contributing to local water recycling

Climate change scenario analysis
It is reported that changes in the amount of rainfall and the 
rise in sea level caused by climate change are not the 
same around the world, and are different between regions. 
According to the RCP 8.5 scenario, future average annual 
rainfall will increase in high latitude and Pacific Ocean 
equatorial regions, and will decrease in arid mid-latitude 
and subtropical regions during the period from 2080 to 
2100. According to that scenario, global average sea level 
rise will be 0.71m during that period, with a range from 
0.51m to 0.92m, a substantial difference.
 Accordingly, we assessed water risks caused by 
climate change at worksites, plants and distribution sites.
 For the initial screening, we determined site 
conditions (primarily confirming nearby rivers, 
coastlines, elevations and so on from the perspective 
of flooding and storm surges), performed checks 
using existing tools (Aqueduct, hazard maps, etc.),

and confirmed past examples (whether there had been 
past water damage and other natural disasters). Next, 
we used climate models to compare heavy rain, light 
rain and storm surge risks with the current climate 
(1951–2011) at sites identified in the initial screening.
 The results indicated that light rain will occur at all 
sites at about the same frequency as under the current 
climate, and that heavy rain and storm surges will occur 
more frequently at some sites, and flooding damage will 
be at about the same levels that we assumed until now.
 There are several sites where a high level of 
drought risk is anticipated. We have been 
implementing quantitative evaluation of water resource 
risk in the drainage basins where these sites are 
located, using a methodology based on the CBWT 
method. The results confirmed that the evaluation 
method used was effective. It was also confirmed that, 
for some plants, the risk is growing higher. Going 
forward, besides expanding the scope of quantitative 
evaluation to include more sites, we will also be 
evaluating preventive measures to prevent latent risks 
from being actualized, and evaluating countermeasures 
that can be adopted if risks are actualized.

Efforts during use

As water consumption in the product use stage 
accounts for around 90% of water consumption across 
the entire lifecycle, we are providing water-saving 
products and implementing consumer communication 
in regard to how to use these products properly.
 In 2009, we launched Attack Neo laundry detergent, 

which enables washing to be completed properly with 
only one rinse cycle, in Japan. The year 2019 saw the 
launch of Attack ZERO, which combines superb washing 
power and odor removal capability with zero detergent 
residues. Our products for front-load washers, which use 
less water, can also be used with just one rinse cycle. 
Laundry detergents that require only one rinse cycle are 
now offered in Japan and Taiwan. We aim to make one 
rinse cycle the norm for clothes washing.
 Through our Essential Research focused on foam, 
we have also succeeded in reducing the amount of 
water used when rinsing with other product categories 
too. In 2010 we launched Merit Shampoo, which uses 
20% less water for rinsing than conventional products, 
followed in 2014 by CuCute dishwashing detergent, 
which also reduces the amount of water needed for 
rinsing by 20%, and in 2015 by Bath Magiclean 
bathroom cleaning liquid, which uses 10% less water 
for rinsing. We plan to continue rolling out new water-
saving products based on our Essential Research.
 We also communicate ways to save water to 
consumers using a variety of approaches. For example, we 
have developed eco shampoo techniques to use less water 
when shampooing hair, and we communicate these to 
consumers. Communicating ways to conserve water while 
offering water-saving products truly embodies “eco 
together,” the slogan of the Kao Environmental Statement.

Implementing education and 
activities based on “eco together”

Employees

• I n regard to employee education based on 
Responsible Care activities, we implement relevant 
education for all employees.

•  We implement relevant education for all employees 
working at applicable worksites at plants and 
research institutes that have secured ISO 14001 
certification.

•  We hold guided tours of the Kao Eco-Lab Museum 
for our employees. 
(We have been conducting online tours for 
employees to prevent the spread of COVID-19.)

Customers
•  We exhibit on water conservation at the Kao Eco- Lab 

Museum. (We have suspended tours for the general 
public to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We 
explained the role of water in our lives to elementary 
school students by conducting online tours.)

Business partners
•  We hold the Kao Vender Summit for important 

suppliers.
•  We asked suppliers to complete the CDP 

questionnaire survey.

Local communities
•  Many plants prepare annual environmental reports 

and communicate with local residents.

National and local governments
•  We conduct a water conservation campaign in China.
•  We participated in the Water Project conducted by 

the Ministry of the Environment of Japan.

Water conservation 102-12, 102-43

Participation in China’s Nationwide Cleanliness 
and Water-saving Initiatives̶a water conservation 
campaign̶for ten consecutive years
Kao (China) has conducted the Nationwide 
Cleanliness and Water-saving Initiatives jointly with 
the Center for Environmental Education and 
Communications of Ministry of Ecology and 
Environment, since 2012. In 2021, these activities 
were conducted from July onwards.
 Until now, we focused mainly on water 
conservation as an activity to draw the attention of 
university students and the general public in China to 
water conservation, but starting in 2020, we expanded 
our efforts to cover a wider range of environmental 
protection perspectives with additional activity themes, 
including water conservation and safeguarding of 
water resources, biodiversity, low-carbon emissions, 
eliminating plastic and sustainable development.
 Although there were effects from COVID-19, 
undertaking activities with a focus on university 
students in different areas, we received 138 proposals 
from 79 universities in 22 provinces and cities 
throughout China during the approximately four-
month period. From these, we selected 20 projects, 
which we helped implement.
 Students from throughout China implemented proactive 
measures to help conserve the environment by putting into 
practice activities of their own design, and developed 
different activities to improve the environmental awareness 
of people in the community. These measures and activities 
were evaluated through expert review and by online voting, 
and the winning university was announced online.

Employees’ voice

At the Hair Care Products Research Laboratories, as 
part of our ESG initiatives, we are taking steps to 
contribute toward the cleaning and washing of the 
hair and scalp, which is vital for everyone, and to 
reduce the burden that hair-washing places on the 
environment. In the past, we have developed sham-
poo and conditioner products that anyone can use 
easily and which come out as foam and are washed 
away quickly, and we have also developed shampoo 
sheet products that can remove dirt from the hair and 
scalp when the user does not have access to water.
 In a survey in which people’s hair-washing 
behavior was observed, it was found that, on aver-
age, women in Japan use around 20–30 liters of hot 
water each time they wash their hair. This high water 
usage in the hair-washing process not only places a 
burden on water resources, it also results in in-
creased CO2 emissions. It is a little-known fact that 
CO2 emissions associated with providing the hot 
water used when washing one’s hair with shampoo 
and conditioner products account for around 80% of 
the total emissions associated with these products 
over the entire product lifecycle.
 Kao provides shampoo sheet products that do not

Using hair-washing in space, 
where the available water is 
very limited, as a source of 
inspiration

require water for the Japanese astronaut in the Inter-
national Space Station (ISS), the first time that our 
company has provided products of this type for use in 
space. Water is very precious in the ISS, so it is not 
possible for the astronauts to wash their hair using the 
same large amounts of hot water that would be used 
on Earth. Kao proposed a method whereby astronauts 
could remove dirt from their hair by wiping it with a 
three-dimensional non-woven fabric sheet containing 
a cleaning agent that does not require rinsing. The aim 
was to achieve strong sebum cleaning capability, 
make the product convenient to use under conditions 
of very low gravity, and enable the astronauts to enjoy 
the comfort of having clean hair. An astronaut who 
actually used this product during the process of 
evaluation for use in the ISS was full of praise for it, 
commenting that “You get a real feeling of cleanliness 
just by wiping your hair with the sheet.”
 Thinking about hair-washing products and behav-
ior for use in space, which has the most extreme 
conditions possible for hair-washing, made us rethink 
how people can wash and clean their hair and scalp 
on Earth in a way that depends as little as possible on 
resources such as water and waste disposal that we 
have come to take for granted. I hope that Kao’s 
involvement in developing shampoo sheet for use in 
space will serve as a catalyst for new solutions that 
can provide products for cleaning the hair and scalp 
that can be utilized in any environment and under any 
circumstances, that reduce the amount of water used 
in hair-washing, and that encourage hair-washing 
habits that are not dependent on water.

Strategic water conservation expectations 
based on a product lifecycle perspective
Damage resulting from natural disasters continues to 
increase throughout the world. Over the period 2000–
2019, the world experienced around 7,300 significant 
natural disasters, affecting around 4 billion people, 
and causing 3 trillion USD of economic damage. By 
comparison with the period 1980–1999, these figures 
represented an increase of 72%, 25% and 82% 
respectively. Most of these disasters involved flooding, 
drought or storms, all of which are water-related. With 
the effects of global warming becoming more 
apparent, and demand for water rising due to 
population increase, the impact of natural disasters 
can be expected to become even more severe in the 
future. The question of how to cope with competition 
for water in the agricultural, residential and industrial 
sectors is a matter of shared global concern.
 In order to achieve the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), there are several issues 
that need to be tackled at the same time. Kao is 
utilizing the experience that it has accumulated when 
implementing countermeasures in response to climate 
change to effectively address water-related issues. 
Kao has expanded the scope of its Scope 3 data, 
which estimates an organization’s total CO2 emissions 
over the entire product lifecycle, to include emissions 
associated with water use. Through this analysis, Kao 
was able to identify product use by consumers and 
water use relating to raw materials procurement as 
key “hotspots.” By focusing its efforts on initiatives 
tailored to these stages in the product lifecycle, Kao is 
implementing strategic water conservation measures.
 As one of its water conservation measures targeting 

product use, Kao is promoting early, widespread 
adoption of water-saving versions of its core products, 
such as detergent and shampoo, and Kao is also 
working on the development of detergent products that 
do not require water. I anticipate that these initiatives 
will be particularly effective in areas with an especially 
high risk of drought, and when natural disasters occur.
 At the raw materials procurement stage, Kao is 
utilizing the CDP Supply Chain Program to coordinate 
the collection and management of water risk data with 
suppliers. As Kao is dependent on developing nations for 
many raw materials, the collection of data on water use 
during cultivation and at processing plants can be 
challenging, but I hope Kao will be able to realize 
effective implementation of water conservation 
measures through collaboration with international NPOs.
 Kao has received an A rating, the highest 
possible, for each of Climate Change, Water Security 
and Forests from the CDP. This is the fruit of its 
comprehensive efforts to realize strategic, 
sustainable management that covers the whole of 
the product lifecycle. In today’s world, where there 
is a need for business models that are not 
dependent on water, it is vitally important to 
undertake product development, and early 
implementation of such products, that endeavors, 
from multiple perspectives, to prevent water 
pollution, control water consumption, and mitigate 
social problems that derive from water risk. 
According to United Nations forecasts, by 2050, 
some 5.0 billion people around the world will be 
affected by water shortages. I hope that Kao will 
continue to make a contribution in this area, both 
before and after the realization of the SDGs.

Kao’s response to the views expressed 
last year

Taking into account the suggestions that we 
received last year, we have been working to 
develop and launch water-saving products. In 
2021, we launched Merit The Mild Foaming 
Shampoo and Merit The Mild Foaming Conditioner, 
the foaming action of which is expected to reduce 
the amount of hot water used when rising the hair. 
By using these foaming products, the amount of 
hot water used is reduced by 25% as compared 
with having the product come out of the bottle as 
liquid.
 We are also continuing to develop water-
saving products for other usage scenarios besides 
the bathroom.

Air & water pollution prevention 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Protect human health and the natural environment by preventing pollution of water and air through the manufacture or use of our products.

Social issues we are aware of
It goes without saying that air pollution, water 
pollution and soil pollution can have a significant 
negative impact on human health, on agricultural 
crops and other plants, and on ecosystems. In order 
to create a sustainable Kirei life for all, besides 
conducting our business activities in a way that does 
not exert negative impacts, we also aim to work 
together with stakeholders to address pollution that 
has already had a negative impact, and to restore 
things to a sustainable state.
 Atmospheric pollutants such as nitrogen oxides 
(NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter (PM) 
and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known to 
increase the prevalence of pulmonary diseases such 
as asthma. Most atmospheric pollutants derive from 
burning of fossil fuels or usage of organic solvents. 
Worldwide, around 8.8 million people die prematurely 
each year because of atmospheric pollution. In 
Europe alone, the figure is believed to be over 
790,000 (according to a study by the University of 
Mainz in Germany). At the same time, in recent years 
there has been a trend for indoor spaces to be made 
as airtight as possible in an effort to make homes 
more energy-efficient. As a result, chemical 
substances in indoor spaces remain in those spaces 
for long periods, and their concentration levels rise. A 

Kao’s creating value to 
address social issues

report (by Yokohama National University in Japan) 
suggests that this can have a negative impact on 
human health.
 The vast majority of living organisms, including 
human beings, cannot live without water. Humans 
also need access to sanitary water in order to 
maintain Kirei Lifestyles. The main cause of water 
pollution is various substances contained in 
wastewater from plants and household sewage.
 Negative impacts on human health resulting from 
soil pollution include the effects of both direct 
contacts with polluted soil by touching it or eating it 
and indirect contacts by using groundwater that has 
been polluted with harmful substances that have 
leached out from polluted soil. Significant 
characteristics of soil pollution include the fact that, 
once soil pollution starts to occur, harmful substances 
can accumulate in the soil over a long period, and the 
fact that people are less likely to be aware of soil 
pollution than they are of air pollution and water 
pollution.
 We need to speed up the initiatives we are taking, 
and expand their scope in order to realize the SDGs 
by 2030. In January 2020, the United Nations started 
the Decade of Action in relation to the achievement of 
the SDGs.

Policies, 
laws and 
regulations

Various policies and legal restrictions on air and water will be enacted, 
management costs may increase to comply with them. Investing in better facilities 
and developing of new technologies to comply with policies and regulations will 
mean higher equipment and operating costs, which could negatively impact our 
profitability. 
Additionally, the delayed production schedule could negatively impact sales, if 
national and local governments are urged to pass restrictions on operations due to 
the state of air pollution in areas where our plants are located and the state of 
water pollution from plant wastewater discharged in public water.

Examples of possible policy or regulatory restrictions
・Air pollutant regulations ・Regulations on substances depleting the ozone layer 
・Plant wastewater regulation ・Regulation of use of chemical substances in 
products ・Product labeling programs for environmental performance or chemical 
substance 

Technology Increasing R&D expenses to address the risks posed to the air and water will mean 
higher operating costs, which could negatively impact our profitability.
Risk of failing to increase sales if technologies developed do not work out

Markets When regulations on air pollutants are tightened at a national or regional level, 
demand for chemical products that contain few or no substances causing air 
pollution (like organic solvents) increases, whereas sales for conventional chemical 
products are at risk of decline. 
When regulations on water pollutants are tightened at a national or regional level, 
demand for commercial-use products that contain few or no substances causing 
water pollution (like alkali) increases, whereas sales for conventional commercial-
use products are at risk of decline.
Sales could be negatively impacted if technological capabilities for products in 
development are not on a par with market demands.

Reputation Our brand owner’s reputation is at risk of decline due to so-called fragrance 
pollution from scents in fabric softeners and others.

P
h
ysical risk

Acute Our plants may suspend operations and be unable to continue manufacturing 
products due to air pollution from forest fires or water pollution from oil tanker 
accidents. Similar conditions at suppliers’ plants could make it impossible for us to 
procure raw materials, with the risk that we could not continue manufacturing 
products. There is also the risk that supply chains, from suppliers to our plants, and 
from our plants to our customers, could be interrupted. These risks, meaning that we 
could no longer supply our products to the market, would negatively impact sales, 
and if such risks actually materialized, would require special measures at additional 
cost, thus reducing our profits.
In addition, if restrictions for large-scale air and water pollution significantly impact 
on the lives of consumers, consumption might fall, which would negatively impact 
on sales.

Chronic There’s a risk that production may be unable to increase at the rate required for 
future growth due to our plants or supplier’s plants being located in areas where 
air and water pollution are likely to become more severe.

Optimizing logistics and reducing the distances that trucks are travelling without

PM, an air pollutant, has health consequences and in terms of beauty, is one of the 
causes of dull skin. The coal-fired power generation is expected to decline, 
decreasing the amount of PM in the atmosphere in the medium to long term with 
the objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, PM disappearing 
from all regions around the world is expected to take some time, which presents 
an opportunity for products that respond to PM in Health and beauty care and 
Hygiene and living care.
In the industrial sector, there are opportunities for chemical products that reduce 
organic solvents and dust causing air pollution at worksites.
Many of our products are discharged into the water environment after use. 
Surfactants powerful enough to reduce the usage of surfactants and alkali-free 
professional-use detergents offer an environmental value that improves water 
environments.

Markets The manifestation of air pollution caused by PM presents increased sales 
opportunities by attracting attention to consumer products that respond to PM.
Strengthened regulations on worksite organic solvents and dust present an 
opportunity to expand demand for chemical products that comply with such 
restrictions.

Resilience Ongoing measures for air pollution and water discharge pollution at plants help 
increase our resilience to issues with air and water quality in terms of product 
manufacturing.
In addition, the resilience of our businesses needs to be improved with activities 
suggesting new products by predicting consumer trends based on consumer 
feedback from the last 60 years or more and a database built for more than 40 
years.

We recognize the importance of giving our employees 
who handle chemical substances a variety of 
opportunities to obtain knowledge about the relationship 
between our business activities and products and air and 
water pollution, and to actively engage in pollution 
prevention activities of their own accord. We have created 
many opportunities for employee education accordingly.
 Our employees take responsibility for air and water 
pollution prevention activities at plants and R&D on low 
VOC products and highly biodegradable products. 
Strengthening employees’ air and water quality awareness 
helps to enhance the overall level of our activities in this 
area. A further point is that employees are also 
consumers, and in their role as consumers it is important 
that they take steps to prevent air and water pollution.
 Specifically, we conduct environmental education 
including on air and water pollution prevention for all 

Education and promotion

Policies

We utilize a wide range of chemical substances in our 
products, from home-use products to industrial 
products, and we continue to implement activities to 
minimize negative impacts of chemical substances at 
every stage from development to post-use disposal.
 In our Basic Principle and Basic Policies on 
Environment and Safety, we undertake to “assess 
environment and safety aspects throughout the entire 
lifecycle of the products, from manufacture through 
disposal, when developing products and technologies” 
and to “offer products with a lower environmental 
burden.” Furthermore, the Kao Group Responsible 
Care Policy contains the following declarations: “We 
will strive to develop technologies for products that 
consumers and customers can use with peace of 
mind, as well as striving to provide products that have 
a low environmental impact” and “We shall strive to 
continue to reduce the environmental impact of our 
business operations by ... disposing of wastewater and 
waste gas appropriately.”
 Our Environmental Statement embodies our 
commitment to ensuring that “Kao products utilize 
original Kao-developed technologies to minimize the 
impact they have on the environment, not just in the 
manufacturing process, but in the daily life of the 
customers who use them. From materials procurement 
and manufacturing, to distribution, sales, usage and 
final disposal, we want to engage in ‘eco together’ 
with stakeholders and consumers worldwide.”

Kao’s creating value
We are working to prevent air pollution and water 
pollution in the areas near Kao production plants by 
reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants such as 
NOx, SOx and VOCs from our plants and reducing 
organic matter and other substances in wastewater 
discharged from our plants, by complying faithfully 
with the relevant laws and regulations in each country 
and region in which we operate, and by setting 
reference values that are even more rigorous than 
those required by law to strictly manage pollutants.
 We propose various products for air pollution in 
Chemical, paying attention to maintain the health of 
people working around the world.
 In order to ensure the groundwater used by locals 
is not polluted, we periodically survey the soil 
conditions at each plant for water pollution.
 Additionally, we propose various products to help 
prevent water pollution in all our business units for 
household, commercial-use and chemical products.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
Disclosing VOC and COD emissions pertaining to our 
business activities will improve the transparency of 
occupational safety measures and pollution measures. 
Maintaining employees’ health and mitigating risks 
posed by pollution will contribute to lowering 
operational costs and improving profitability.

Social impacts
We anticipate that disclosing VOC and COD 
emissions pertaining to our business activities and 
engaging in an ongoing dialogue about this will 
improve communication with the residents around 
our plants and lead to reduced reputational risks 
concerning these emissions throughout society.

2025 mid-term targets

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

We recognize that, in order to help consumers realize 
the Kirei Lifestyle, it is vital for us to deepen mutual 
understanding with a wide range of stakeholders and 
collaborate with them, by developing two-way 
communication.
 As the substances generated by our production 
activities that lead to air and water pollution have an 
impact on local communities, having good communication 
with local communities is also vitally important. Many of 
our plants compile an annual environmental report, and 
communicate with local residents.
 Emissions of substances linked to air pollution and 
water pollution, which are from business activities, are 
regulated by government agencies. We have established 
our own voluntary management criteria which are even 
more rigorous than the statutory requirements, and we 
comply with these to monitor pollutants. Additionally, 
we continue to conduct water quality surveys not as a 
single company but as an industry group.
 Distribution initiatives are required to help make 
improvements to air pollution. We are taking part in 
programs established by the Cabinet Office in 
collaboration with other companies in this industry.

 Consumer behavior needs to change in order for 
consumers to attain the Kirei Lifestyle. We provide 
opportunities to think about the Kirei Lifestyle through visits to 
museums and plants that take as its theme the water that all 
consumers use daily. For example, the Eco-Lab Museum has 
displays on household sewage and wastewater treatment.

Smart Distribution in partnership with Lion Corporation
We are participating in the Cross-ministerial Strategic 
Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) promoted by the 
Cabinet Office. We started regular shuttle deliveries 
between Kao and Lion Corporation in October 2020. 
This new initiative will reduce the distances that 
trucks are travelling without loads, by comparison 
with conventional transportation methods, and is 
expected to result in a 45% reduction in atmospheric 
pollutants emissions for both companies combined.

Framework

Emissions of pollutants into the air or into bodies of 
water in relation to our business activities, and the 
current state of progress in addressing this issue, are 
managed under our Responsible Care promotion system.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

employees as part of our Responsible Care activities. We 
also provide education encompassing the importance of 
legal compliance pertaining to air and water pollution to 
all employees working at plants and research institutes 
that have obtained ISO 14001 or RC 14001 certification.

Emissions of VOCs
Although we have no facilities subject to the VOC 
emission regulations provided in the Air Pollution 
Control Act, we work to voluntarily cut VOC emissions.
 For the 100 VOC substances defined in the 
notice issued by the Director General of the 
Environmental Management Bureau, Ministry of 
the Environment, we set voluntary targets on the 
annual atmospheric emissions from each plant for 
each substance (5 tons or less in 2005, 3 tons or 
less in 2009, 1 ton or less in 2010), conducted 
emission reduction activities and accomplished our 
targets. We are managing VOC emissions with the 
current target of maintaining our activities.
 The group in Japan handled 33 types of VOCs 
in quantities over 1 ton in 2021, with total 
emissions into the atmosphere of 6.5 tons✓□.

Compliance with environmental legislation
In 2020, there was an omission of the notification for 
minor changes to wastewater treatment facilities 
(sludge dewatering facilities) at the Kawasaki Plant, an 
omission of the regular inspection of the dust 
collector at Kao Specialties Americas LLC and 
insufficient water flow in the scrubber water (fine of 
146,000 yen), and a leakage of ammonia water at 
Quimi-Kao, S.A. de C.V. (fine of 460,000 yen).
 In 2021, there was a failure to install sufficient gas 
detection equipment at Kao Huludao Casting 
Materials Co., Ltd. (fine of 542,000 yen), an omission 
in reporting by the designated manager (fine of 
1,444,000 yen) at the same company, and an instance 
of hydrogen sulfide levels exceeding the permitted 
value at Kao USA Inc. (fine of 1,192,000 yen).

Air & water pollution prevention 102-43

Initiatives to prevent air pollution

Efforts at plants
Compliance with laws and regulations
The amounts and densities of pollutants emitted into 
the atmosphere are regulated by government 
agencies. We have established our own voluntary 
management criteria which are even more rigorous 
than the statutory requirements, and we comply with 
these to monitor pollutants.

Using cleaner fossil fuels
As burning of fossil fuels is accompanied by emission of 
NOx, SOx, PM, etc., we use natural gas̶which is a 
clean fossil fuel̶at all plants outfitted with the 
necessary infrastructure. Our plants do not use any coal.

Reducing emissions of chemical substances 
subject to the Japanese PRTR system
We began activities in this area by setting a voluntary 
target for annual emissions of one ton or less for each 
substance from each plant in FY2000. We achieved 
this target in FY2002. Since then, we have continued 
to achieve this voluntary target, excluding leaks of 
chlorofluorocarbon and similar emissions.
 The number of chemical substances subject to the 
Japanese Pollutant Release and Transfer Register 
(PRTR) system of which we handled over 1.0 ton in 
2021 was 71, and the total discharge of such 
substances into the atmosphere and public water 
areas was 1.6 tons. In addition, we are voluntarily 

Our initiatives

monitoring and controlling releases and transfers (in 
the same way as would be done for chemical 
substances subject to PRTR) of chemical substances 
that the Japan Chemical Industry Association has 
specified as being subject to voluntary surveys.

Reducing emissions of VOCs
Our production plants outside Japan include some 
plants where they have not been possible to monitor 
VOC emissions, or where the emissions are relatively 
high. We are working to monitor and reduce VOC 
emissions at these plants.

Initiatives taken in relation to logistics
Smart Distribution in partnership with Lion 
Corporation
We are participating in the SIP promoted by the 
Cabinet Office. We started regular shuttle deliveries 
between Kao and Lion Corporation in October 2020. 
This new initiative will reduce the distances that 
trucks are travelling without loads, by comparison 
with conventional transportation methods, and is 
expected to result in a 45% reduction in atmospheric 
pollutants emissions for both companies combined.

Initiatives taken in relation to our products
LUNAJET water-based pigment inkjet ink
Using the pigment nano-dispersion technology that 
we had previously developed, we successfully 
developed LUNAJET, the world’s first water-based 
pigment inkjet ink, featuring a VOC-free design* 

which ensures that only very small quantities of VOCs 
are emitted during printing operations, thereby 
helping to prevent air pollution and also making a 
major contribution toward improving the working 
environment of printing workers. We also confirmed 
that this water-based pigment inkjet ink technology 
can be applied to water-based gravure-printing ink.
*  VOC-free design: “VOC-free” is defined as emitting less than 700 

ppmC (in carbon conversion terms) of VOC during the printing 
process. 
VOC is a collective term for organic compounds that are volatile and 
are transformed into gaseous form in the atmosphere. In Japan, VOC 
emissions are regulated by the revised Air Pollution Control Act.

Visco Top UT thickener for concrete spraying 
construction
We developed then launched full-scale sales for Visco 
Top UT thickener which significantly decreases dust 
generated when spraying concrete for mountain tunnel 
construction. Visco Top UT is able to substantially 
reduce the amount of dust generated even when using 
powder accelerator, which tends to stimulate dust 
dispersion. With only half as much thickener as would 
be needed with a conventional dust reducer, the dust 
concentration level can be reduced to 2mg/m3 or less 
(as recommended by the new dust guidelines that 
came into effect in April 2021). This is registered in 
NETIS*, the new technology provision system 
(Number: KT-200035-A) and is anticipated to be utilized 
in the various tunnel construction commissioned by 
national and local governments.
*  NETIS: Database system operated with the objective of the Ministry 

of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism sharing and providing 
information on new technologies

Initiatives to prevent water 
pollution
Initiatives taken in relation to product 
development
In product development, we incorporate considerations 
for impacts on the water environments of discharged 
water after product use. More specifically, we have 
investigated the biodegradability of raw materials that 
may be discharged into the environment and their 
impacts on common aquatic organisms using river water 
and activated sludge used at wastewater treatment 
plants. Through this investigation, we are actively 
promoting the development and use of raw materials 
with reduced environmental impact. We also plan to use 
AI and other technologies to investigate chemical 
substances with high environmental compatibility.

Efforts at plants
Compliance with wastewater related laws and regulations
The amounts and / or densities of pollutants 
discharged into rivers, the ocean and sewage systems 
are regulated by government agencies. We have 
installed and conduct high-level maintenance and 
management of wastewater treatment facilities at 
many plants. After properly treating plant wastewater, 
it is discharged outside the plant. We have established 
our own voluntary management criteria which are 
even more rigorous than the statutory requirements, 
and we comply with these to monitor pollutants.

Surveys of groundwater and soil contamination
In light of our past history of chemical substance use, 

every year we voluntarily measure the levels of 
substances regulated by environmental standards in 
the groundwater within plant premises.

Initiatives relating to wastewater after product use
We are focusing on understanding the actual situation in 
relation to wastewater discharge after product use and we 
are conducting our own field surveys on an ongoing 
basis, such as environmental monitoring of river water to 
get an idea of the ecological risks of chemical substances.
 To respond to globalization, we collaborate with 
experts to verify the effectiveness of mathematical 
models and develop new models for monitoring 
environments outside Japan and predictions of chemical 
substance concentration in rivers, aiming to ensure our 
business activities are environmentally friendly on the 
local environment. Recently in Japan, we are analyzing in 
detail the impact of chemical substances on ecosystems 
using data gathered from the river environment.
 We are also participating in environmental monitoring 
that has been undertaken by the Japan Soap and 
Detergent Association since 1998. Currently we assess 
the environmental risks posed to ecosystems targeting 
four major surfactants in municipal rivers (measured four 
times per year at seven sites in four rivers). In the surveys 
conducted so far, the results show that these surfactants 
have consistently low risks to aquatic organisms.

Initiatives taken in relation to our products
Visco Top high-performance specialty thickener
When undertaking civil engineering work near water 
(for example, on riverbanks or on the coast), it is 
vitally important that measures are taken to protect 

the water from being contaminated. In the case of 
bridge pier construction for long bridges or 
suspension bridges that cross ocean straits, because 
the piers are actually built in the riverwater or 
seawater, special underwater concrete that has high 
viscosity and is resistant to washout is used. 
Furthermore, when construction is undertaken near 
underground watercourses, care must be taken not to 
contaminate the groundwater. For work in this kind of 
water-related environment, the use of additives to 
increase the viscosity of inorganic materials such as 
grouting materials and concrete can enhance 
underwater anti-washout performance.
 We have developed Visco Top, a high-performance 
specialty thickener that provides un-precedented 
viscosity for grouting materials and concrete, and 
makes it possible to undertake construction work 
without polluting the riverine or ocean environment. 
Visco Top has been also used in the removal of high 
concentration contaminated water from trenches at 
the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

Smash alkali-free commercial use detergent
Alkali detergent used for hard-to-remove kitchen 
stains must adjust (neutralize) its pH when the 
cleaning liquid is discharged to prevent water 
pollution, whereas neutral detergent without alkali 
generally does not have sufficient cleaning effects.
 Smash, the newly debuted kitchen oil stain 
detergent, works safely with a neutral formula that 
has the same cleaning power as an alkali detergent, 
and contributes to preventing water pollution with its 
gentle ingredients.

Employees’ voice

We are undertaking R&D work to develop safe 
contamination removal technology for the disabled 
reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power 
Plant (Fukushima Daiichi NPP), which suffered 
extensive damage from the tsunami that 
accompanied the Great East Japan Earthquake of 
2011. More specifically, we are undertaking the 
development of efficient technology that will reduce 
the risk of radiation exposure for the operatives, to 
facilitate speedy decontamination of the disabled 
reactors. We are proceeding with this research with 
the conviction that the cleansing technology research 
results that we have accumulated over the years can 
be utilized effectively in the decontamination of 
Fukushima Daiichi NPP.
 We are challenging ourselves on a daily basis 
with the goal of helping restore Fukushima’s beautiful 
natural environment as soon as possible, and of 
making it possible for people to live in the region with 
peace of mind.

Air & water pollution prevention 102-44

Assessments of and expectations for Kao’s 
initiatives on prevention of air and water 
pollution
By reading the Kao Sustainability Data Book 2021, 
I was able to develop an understanding of Kao’s 
business management, which emphasizes an ESG 
perspective. Kao’s initiatives in this area have 
secured the company a Triple A rating (the highest 
possible) for the Climate Change, Forests and 
Water Security aspects of environmental data 
disclosure through CDP for two consecutive years, 
in 2020 and 2021. Out of 12,000 organizations 
throughout the world whose data disclosure was 
evaluated, only 14 companies secured a Triple A 
rating, and only 2 of those were Japanese 
companies. The CDP’s evaluation thus represents 
recognition of Kao’s status as a world leader in 
environmental data disclosure.
 In the following sections, I would like to 
comment on Kao’s initiatives in FY2021 to prevent 
air and water pollution.

1. Initiatives to prevent air pollution
SOx and NOx emissions from worksites in Japan 
remained at roughly the same level as in the 
previous year. NOx emissions from the Wakayama 
Plant, which is Kao’s most important production 
site, were noticeably high, so Kao will need to 

focus its attention on the Wakayama Plant if it is to 
achieve further reductions in NOx emissions. Kao 
has accurate data regarding VOC emissions from 
its worksites in Japan. Hereafter, while continuing 
to accumulate VOC emissions data, ideally, Kao 
should also clarify the methods to be used for 
reduction of VOC emissions, and the target 
reduction amounts. The process of determining 
VOC emission levels at production worksites 
outside Japan has only just got underway, and 
there are still many worksites for which data are 
not available. Of those worksites for which VOC 
emission levels have been clarified, it is noticeable 
that VOC emissions at worksites in the U.S. and in 
Spain tend to be quite high. In this regard, there is 
a need for response measures that would include 
reviewing the production methods used, and 
making changes to the emissions reduction 
technology used.

2. Initiatives to prevent water pollution
While the COD emissions load from worksites in 
Japan have been kept at a low level by the strict 
discharge regulations, the COD emission load of 
worksites in Southeast Asia and Germany are 
relatively high. It is to be hoped that Kao will 
respond to this situation, in ways suited to local 
circumstances, and that this response will include 

Stakeholder engagement

Kao’s response to the views expressed last year

Regarding the use of Tubifex worms to realize 
reduction of wastewater sludge, we are examining 
the question of which Kao plants would be suitable 
candidates for the full-scale application of this 
method, in terms of how suited they are to stable 
growth of the Tubifex worms. We are considering 
strategies for preventing the pH level from falling too 
low when using microorganism treatment on 
wastewater with a high nitrogen content.
 At Quimi-Kao in Mexico, an adequate supply of 
water is ensured by using treated water from the local 
government authority’s wastewater treatment facility, 
due to restrictions on groundwater usage. Kao plants 
in Taiwan are starting to be affected by drought risk, 
and so consideration is being given to reusing treated 
water. We feel that a significant issue here is how to 
ensure safety when using treated water.
 With regard to VOC emissions at overseas plants, 
we have begun to disclose the VOC emissions of 
those plants that have calculated their emissions on a 
dedicated emissions webpage. Besides working to

the transfer of the advanced COD removal 
technology that Kao has accumulated through its 
business activities in Japan.

3.  Use of Tubifex worms for volume 
reduction of wastewater sludge

To achieve volume reduction of organic sludge 
that is generated during the biological 
wastewater treatment process, Kao is focusing 
on the use of Tubifex worms. In order to create a 
stable habitat for the Tubifex worms within the 
wastewater treatment tank, it is necessary to 
provide the proper growth environment (in terms 
of temperature, salinity, pH value and habitat), 
while keeping the organic loading at a low level. 
Industrial wastewater tends to contain an 
unsatisfactory balance of nutrients, as well as 
being too highly concentrated, and having low 
buffer capacity. If a wastewater treatment 
process is operated under low organic loading so 
as to create a suitable habitat for Tubifex worms, 
then nitrification may occur, causing a decrease 
in pH, in which case the Tubifex worms cannot 
survive. By circulating the nitrified sludge liquor 
to the front end of the wastewater treatment 
tank, where a low dissolved oxygen environment 
has been created by reducing the aeration, it is 
possible to induce denitrification and prevent the 
pH value from becoming abnormally low. To 

transform existing wastewater treatment tanks so 
that they are capable of denitrification, an agitator 
needs to be installed. If aiming to use Tubifex 
worms in wastewater treatment tanks for volume 
reduction of wastewater sludge, it is 
recommended to replace diffuser aeration 
systems with underwater mechanical aerators 
when the aeration system is renewed.
 It would seem advisable for Kao to identify, 
from among its various worksites, which 
worksites discharge wastewater that is suitable 
for treatment using Tubifex worms and then 
install this system at an actual wastewater 
treatment plant to clarify the attainable cost 
reduction. Hopefully, going forward, this 
treatment method can be adopted for wastewater 
treatment not only within Japan but also at 
worksites outside Japan, so as to bring about a 
reduction of wastewater treatment costs.
 Industrial wastewater treatments often 
involve coagulation treatment to remove 
substances that inhibit treatment, and this 
process generates large quantities of inorganic 
sludge. Ideally, Kao should adopt an integrated 
approach to reducing the amount of inorganic 
sludge and organic sludge through reconsidering 
raw materials, manufacturing processes and 
wastewater lines.

Finally
Kao has made a serious effort to reduce emissions 
of air pollutants from its plants, and to reduce the 
pollution load from its wastewater plants. These 
efforts have produced meaningful results, and 
have won high praise. With global warming 
progressing rapidly, the 21st century will inevitably 
be an era in which water is of great importance, 
and securing stable access to water resources will 
be an urgent task. In Japan, which is blessed with 
rich water resources, there is no pressing need to 
reuse treated water, but for Kao, which aims to 
continue conducting its business activities 
sustainably on a global scale, the issue of water 
resources is one that cannot be avoided. As a 
leading company in the disclosure of 
environmental data, it is to be hoped that Kao will 
work actively to safeguard water resource stability 
in harmony with the local community, to 
implement production activities in a water-saving 
manner, and to realize the reuse of treated 
wastewater.

Effective corporate governance 102-12, 102-15, 102-16, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Kao’s concept of effective 
corporate governance
Integrity, the foundation of our corporate culture
We promote day-to-day activities based on the 
recognition that Integrity, which has been handed 
down from our founder, will enhance the 
effectiveness of corporate governance. In addition to 
corporate governance initiatives (p. 255), we believe it 
is essential that each and every employee support 
corporate activities.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Social issues we are aware of
The spread of COVID-19 has forced rapid change in 
both living and working environments, and as 
telecommuting becomes the norm, new issues have 
arisen that must be addressed, including work styles, 
employee communication, remote sales activities and 
increased security risks. The direction of the pandemic 
remains hard to predict, but having gradually become 
accustomed to this changing environment, we have 
moved to the stage of how best to move forward with 
our business activities despite concerns about the 
spread of infection, and we believe we will need to 

We will steadily implement our ESG Strategy by examining our corporate governance system whenever necessary, and conducting fair and honest business 
activities while acting in accordance with laws and ethics and responding to changes in society. All of this will contribute to making Kao a company with a 
global presence, valuable to society. In this chapter, we will introduce our activities to practice Integrity, which is the foundation of our corporate culture 
supporting corporate governance. Please see p. 255 for more information about the Kao Group’s corporate governance.

conduct activities with the expectation that additional 
problems may arise.
 In this changing situation, we believe it is 
important for the advancement of society to furnish a 
structure that enables us to grasp change in a timely, 
appropriate manner and respond flexibly, and while 
preparing for risks, to realize employee-friendly, 
efficient, productive workplaces where all employees 
are treated equally. As such, we will continue to 
implement initiatives aimed at the thorough 
prevention of harassment of all kinds.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
In this era of VUCA*, change is often difficult to 
anticipate, and any delay in responding to 
environmental change entails the risk of declining 
competitiveness. We also believe that failure to 
leverage diversity also entails the risk of delayed 
awareness of change.
* Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Since our founding, we have promoted corporate 
activities based on Integrity (acting in accordance 
with laws and ethics, and conducting fair and honest 
business activities), which is one of our most 

important values. As a result, we have been evaluated 
highly by society for sustainability and compliance. 
This leads to increasing trust on the part of 
consumers, shareholders and other stakeholders in 
our products and our company, and also makes it 
easier for us to hire and retain talented human capital.

Kao’s creating value
We see our mission as contributing to society through 
Yoki-Monozukuri, based on contributing to the SDGs 
in our business activities with our value of Integrity. 
By continuing to flexibly adapt to the demands of 
society in a rapidly changing environment, we will 
maintain our thorough practice of Yoki-Monozukuri.
 We are also creating workplaces with an open 
atmosphere that allow talented human capital to fully 
demonstrate their abilities on an equal standing.

Policies

In our revision of the Kao Way for 2021, we have established 
“Integrity as the only choice” as the first of our fundamental 
values. We regard our value of Integrity as the starting point 
of compliance, and promote it as a foundation for earning the 
respect and trust of all stakeholders.
 To ensure greater efficacy of the Kao Business Conduct 
Guidelines (BCG) that embody Integrity, we are implementing 
activities focused on reducing serious compliance risks, and 
activities designed to create an open workplace atmosphere 
that allows improprieties that have been discovered to be 
immediately reported to management and an appropriate 
response to be taken promptly.
 Regarding bribery, which is a compliance risk, we have 
clearly stated our strong anti-bribery stance in the BCG and 
established the Kao Anti-bribery (anti-corruption) Guidelines, 
which specify the monetary standards and prior reporting 
obligations for giving and receiving of entertainment and gifts 
as well as rules for preventing corruption, including evaluating 
bribery risks when selecting distributors and renewing 
distributor contracts.
 Our marketing and advertising activities include fair 
content and appropriate statements based on facts, avoid 
exaggerated statements concerning our impact on society 
and the environment, and take into consideration a wide 
range of people, including those who could be considered 
socially vulnerable. We also ensure that information relating to 
competitors and competing products is not provided to 
consumers.
 Furthermore, we make it clear that there is a zero 
tolerance policy for discrimination and harassment, that is, we 
will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment of 

which every individual employee is fully aware of the need to 
prevent compliance violations from occurring, and in which 
compliance violations that have been discovered are reported 
immediately and prompt action taken to deal with them, and 
of employee-friendly workplaces that embody concern for 
others, forms part of What Kao Aims to Be by 2030.
 To realize this vision, we expect every single employee to 
be aware of the harm that compliance violations can cause 
and of the impact they can have on the trust that people place 
in Kao. We expect managers to be aware of the types of 
compliance risk that could emerge in their own workplace, 
and to take steps to minimize such risks. We also expect 
employees to respect the diversity of the people working 
together with them in the same workplace, and to recognize 
the importance of showing consideration for others in the way 
that you speak and act, in order to realize a workplace

 We believe that there is a serious risk that compliance 
violations by suppliers can lead to quality issues and loss of 
trust in Kao products, and so we are implementing initiatives 
that prioritize focusing on suppliers of raw materials, contract 
manufacturers, and contractors engaged in product 
manufacturing on Kao Group premises.
 In particular, because suppliers’ failure to safeguard 
employees’ human rights, leading to dissatisfaction, is a major 
factor in compliance violations, we are promoting measures 
to prioritize respect for human rights. The specific initiatives 
being implemented are outlined below.
1.  The annual meetings that we hold with suppliers include 

presentations on the content of our BCG, and also lectures 
by experts on topics relating to compliance.

2.  Grasping social needs through external surveys and 
necessary activities
Each year, based on responses received on external 
questionnaires, we recognize and grasp changes in society 
through the content of the questions, and establish and 
pursue activity goals for the following year based on those 
changes.

3.  The compliance hotlines are staffed by outside clinical 
psychologists and independent lawyers with no advisory 
relationship with the company. Since they are independent 
from the company, each hotline reports only the number of 
cases on a monthly basis, but each understands the case 
content and provides any necessary advice and consulting. 
As an external party interfacing directly with our employees, 
the hotlines establish regular opportunities, once or twice a 
year, to exchange views on any organizational climate 
concerns they feel have been raised by our employees.

environment that is easy to work in. With this in mind, we 
implement education as appropriate based on the training 
system outlined on p. 156. Through this education, we 
provide opportunities for employees to enhance their 
awareness, which in turn can help employees to recognize 
compliance as something that is directly relevant to them 
personally. We also urge employees to make effective use of 
the compliance hotlines that we provide when they are unsure 
of the best course of action to take.
 Kao Group employees take compliance training designed 
to learn their role when those roles change significantly, 
including when they join the company, when they are 
promoted to managerial positions, and when they assume 
responsibility for subsidiaries outside Japan.
 In addition, all employees participate in the training 
organized by the leader of their division and take a BCG 
refresher test to periodically give them opportunities to review 
and maintain their awareness for compliance. Furthermore, 
the Compliance Committee Chairperson and division 
managers send out an annual Compliance Message to 
communicate the importance of thoughtful words and actions 
as well as an open organizational culture. Education related to 
laws and ordinances is planned and conducted by designated 
managing divisions.

Collaboration and engagement with 
stakeholders

The BCG clearly states the need for gaining understanding 
and support for the BCG among vendors as well and 
encouraging conduct based on this.

Framework
We have set up the following framework to implement the 
PDCA cycle for compliance, and to respond appropriately to 
reported incidents. The PDCA cycle framework consists of 
policies, an annual plan and specific activities to implement 
these devised by the Compliance Committee, comprising 
division leaders and other members, and its secretariat, with 
directives for implementation given to persons responsible for 
divisions and subsidiaries. The activities are evaluated by the 
Board of Directors among others, and the evaluations are 
used to inform improvement activities. The framework for 
responding to reported incidents involves a shared group 
hotline, the Compliance Committee, which receives hotline 
reports, investigation by the Compliance Committee or the 
person responsible for compliance promotion at subsidiaries, 
and the necessary corrective measures taken to resolve 
matters.
 We have also put in place a framework for encouraging 
individual units at the worksite level to report compliance 
violations and suspected compliance violations, thereby 
contributing to early resolution of issues, by clarifying the 
rules governing initial reporting of compliance violations and 
suspected compliance violations.

PDCA cycle to continuously improve compliance
Compliance promotion activities are implemented using the 
PDCA cycle shown below. The Compliance Committee creates 
the policy and annual plan, and the Compliance Committee 
Secretariat breaks it down into specific activities that are then 
implemented. The implemented activities are evaluated, and 
identified issues and improvements are reported to inform the 
planning to be drafted from the following year onward.

Plan / Do
We have established the Compliance Committee, chaired by 
a Managing Executive Officer, and comprised of representa-
tives of relevant divisions and affiliated companies.
 This committee meets every three months to review the 
following activities and devise promotional measures to 
mitigate serious compliance risks and ensure Integrity.
1.  Decide the activities policy to ensure Integrity
2.  Finalize the establishment and revision of the BCG and 

other internal compliance-related rules and regulations
3.  Decide on the annual plan for educational and aware-

ness-raising activities to instill and establish Integrity 
within and outside Japan

4.  Confirm the operation and response status of compliance 
hotlines

 We also propose necessary amendments to compli-
ance-related rules and regulations and make an annual 
activities report to the Board of Directors.
 The Compliance Committee has a secretariat led by the 
Compliance Department. At the secretariat meeting held 
each month, members of the secretariat confirm and review 
the appropriateness of responses to all reports made to 
compliance hotlines both within and outside Japan. They 
also draft and implement plans for specific activities and 
promote activities in accordance with decisions by the 
Compliance Committee. The Compliance Committee then 
shares a summary of its discussions at the following month’s 
Executive Officers Meeting.

Check
Internal evaluations
• Opinions from the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is provided with an annual activity 
report through the Internal Control Committee.
 The Board of Directors monitors and evaluates these 
activities, and its evaluation and opinions are used to im-
prove the activities through the PDCA cycle.
• Issues identified from compliance hotlines
At the monthly secretariat meeting, themes that may repre-

sent emerging issues for the company are identified based 
on the trend of incidents for that month, and any necessary 
action is taken, including framework changes, internal educa-
tion and awareness promotion.
• Issues identified from risk surveys
We conduct a risk survey that includes compliance risks 
every year, and identify risk areas and specific risk scenarios 
based on the results, after which we take the necessary 
steps while coordinating with the relevant divisions.
• Employee survey
The Compliance Committee conducts biannual surveys of 
group companies within and outside Japan to determine the 
level of openness in each organization. Based on the organi-
zational culture trends we identify from these surveys, we 
create opportunities to hear more about specific workplace 
situations, and take any action required.
•  New initiatives aimed at invigorating and reforming 

the corporate ethos
As part of the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) adopted in 
2021 as a new strategy to energize our employees, we clarify 
what individual employees should be seeking to achieve and 
become, get employees to set targets for themselves 
through a repeated process of dialogue with supervisors and 
colleagues, and encourage them to challenge themselves.
 Within the OKR, we also set targets for activities aimed 
at helping to realize employees’ vision of what each organiza-
tion should be. Through this process of goal-setting and 
regular dialogue, which has replaced conventional opinion 
surveys, we are promoting the solving of problems and 
improvement of the corporate ethos within each organiza-
tion, and strengthening the links between employees.
External evaluations
•  Feedback from third-party organizations, external 

evaluation organizations, etc.
By answering socially responsible investing questionnaire 
items that incorporate societal expectations and exchanging 
information with other companies, we incorporate items 
where we have not yet taken action into the next year’s 
activities as necessary.

Performance in 2021

Performance
1.  Activities to reduce compliance risks 
Legal compliance structural reorganization
We have clarified the managing division for promoting 
compliance with approximately 250 laws and ordinances 
that apply to our worksites in Japan. At the beginning of 
2021, with the aim of reducing serious compliance risks, 
we established four themes: (1) proper working 
environment (unpaid overtime prevention), (2) 
compliance of the Fire Service Act, (3) power 
harassment prevention, and (4) fair transactions with 
business partners. Appropriate measures were then 
implemented, centering on the responsible divisions.
 In addition, we prioritized and thoroughly 
reviewed the legal compliance structures of divisions 
with responsibilities relating to important laws and 
regulations in foreign countries.
Analysis of underlying causes in cases requiring 
particular attention, and thorough 
implementation of policies to prevent recurrence
We identify any important organizational issues 
raised through whistleblowing, and work to mitigate 
these issues as an organization by examining their 
causes in depth, summarizing them, and confirming 
policies to prevent their recurrence.

2.  Educational activities to foster and establish 
compliance awareness

•  Conducted a new type of compliance training for 
newly appointed managers in Japan to discuss 

compliance risks that may arise when OKR 
management methods are ineffective

•  Implemented BCG refresher tests and related 
opinion surveys in Japan

•  Changed the name of the former Compliance 
Awareness Month to the Compliance Message in 
August 2021, and disseminated messages and 
other information from the chairperson of the 
committee, the heads of each functional division 
and the presidents of overseas group companies

•  Posted compliance case studies monthly in Japan 
and twice a year in other countries via the 
company intranet to promote understanding 
through specific case studies

3. Compliance promotion system development
With the following measures, we have put in place a 
system designed to reduce risk by detecting 
compliance-related problems at an early stage and 
appropriately resolving them.
•  Serious compliance issues are reported quarterly to 

the Compliance Committee, the Executive Officers 
Meeting, the Audit & Supervisory Board Members, 
and where necessary, the Board of Directors, for 
evaluation as to the appropriateness of actions taken.

•  We adhere to the Rules for Operating Compliance 

Hotlines, to strengthen trust in the compliance 
hotlines and enable employees to use them with 
peace of mind. Ahead of the June 2022 
implementation of revisions to Japan’s Whistleblower 
Protection Act, we plan to reiterate our commitment 
to thoroughly protecting the confidentiality of 
whistleblowers and consultants, not attempting to 
identify them, and not treating them unfavorably.

4. Evaluation activities
•  In Japan, we conducted a compliance awareness 

survey to measure how well-established 
compliance activities are, and the atmosphere at 
workplaces.

•  We identified issues and conducted improvement 
activities through information exchanges with 
other companies and responses to external 
evaluation survey.

5. External evaluations
In our FY2021 activities, we were again recognized 
as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies®.

Reviews of performance
Issues and response measures concerning 
mid- to long-term targets
1.  Contribute to Yoki-Monozukuri through a 

commitment to Integrity and prevent 
incidents of damage

In addition to promoting strict legal compliance 
activities to reduce serious compliance violations, we 
identify organizational issues triggered by 
whistleblowing that require close attention. We are 
promoting activities to encourage a sense of direct 
connection on the part of the division where the 
incident occurred, by making the division responsible 
for investigating the causes in depth, summarizing 
the incident, and confirming measures to prevent 
recurrence. Going forward, we will identify priority 
issues and continue responding to them.

2.  Minimize damage by creating workplaces 
with an open atmosphere that allows 
improprieties to be reported at an early stage 
and the appropriate response to be taken

Despite giving instructions regarding the need for 
prompt reporting when a compliance case is 
identified, there have been cases where reporting 
has been delayed, and so we have taken even more 
thorough steps to ensure widespread awareness of 
and compliance with the rules regarding initial 
reporting.

3.  Maximize utilization of human capital by 
ensuring that people’s language and conduct 
are considerate of the other person’s position 
and by creating workplaces in which all 
people are able to work on an equal standing

With regard to workplace bullying, etc., we have 
implemented initiatives that focus on preventing 
reoccurrence. Specifically, the whistleblowing 
described in Item 1 above was used as a starting 
point to identify organizational issues requiring 
close attention, and the division where the incident 
occurred conducted an in-depth investigation into 
its causes to ensure that measures were formulated 
and implemented to prevent recurrence.

Revision of the Kao Business 
Conduct Guidelines and utilization 
of compliance-related rules

The BCG serve as our code of conduct for practicing 
the Kao Way, our corporate philosophy. The content is 
regularly revised based on expectations from society, 
our circumstances and other factors, and was most 
recently revised in April 2019.
 To broaden BCG awareness, we have compiled 
the BCG Casebook in a Q&A format and shared it with 
companies in 17 languages, including Japanese and 
English.
 The BCG explicitly defines anti-corruption 
compliance regardless of the identity of the other 
party and bans facilitation payments, which are 
payments of small amounts made to individual 
government officials. Making political donations is 
also prohibited in the BCG and in the Donation 
Guidelines. Moreover, the Kao Anti-bribery (anti-
corruption) Guidelines, which describe the approval 
procedures and rules for giving and receiving of 
entertainment and gifts and notification procedures 
relating to invitations to government officials, have 
been adopted, including at the group companies 
outside Japan.
 In addition to the above, the Kao Guidelines for 
Avoiding Conflicts of Interest have also been adopted 
at the group companies both within and outside 

Our initiatives

Japan, and require approval or notification in 
situations of individuals having involvement in 
competition or transactions with group companies, 
investments in companies that engage in such 
competition or transactions, financial loans and so on 
with group companies, and close relatives engaging 
in such acts.

Annual confirmation
Once a year, we confirm the submission of reports to 
the Compliance Committee Secretariat regarding 
matters pertinent to the Guidelines for Avoiding 
Conflicts of Interest and the Anti-bribery (anti-
corruption) Guidelines with respect to members of the 
Board of Directors, the Audit & Supervisory Board 
Members, officers and employees.
 In addition, we investigate the function of the 
Anti-bribery (anti-corruption) Checklist used when 
selecting new cross-border distributors and new 
intermediaries or renewing contracts with existing 
ones.

Expenditures to trade associations and political 
organizations
Through our participation in committees, working 
groups, etc. of trade associations, we convey opinions 
that could influence enactment and revision of laws to 
the government. Apart from membership fees to 
these trade associations, it was verified that no 
donations were made regarding political campaigns 

or organizations, lobbying, trade associations, tax-
exempt entities or other groups whose role is to 
influence political campaigns or public policy and 
legislation in 2021.

Compliance initiatives in the KCMK Group*

Employees’ voice

We strive to maintain a good balance between 
case handling and awareness-raising activities to 
promote understanding. We aim for speedy case 
response and resolution, and take the feelings of 
informants into consideration during this process. 
We strive to achieve so our information is easy 
for all employees to understand, and provide 
information in a timely manner, so every 
employee can see our awareness-raising 
activities as personally relevant. (Published on 
KCMK Compliance Hotline)
 We will continue the above efforts with all 
members, with the aim of creating an open 
workplace environment where every employee 
can practice Integrity.

Compliance hotline operational 
status and 2021 regulatory 
violations

According to the needs of each country and region, 
group companies have established either both internal 
and external compliance hotlines or only external 
hotlines. (See diagram on p. 158 for details.)
 In operating the hotlines, after confirming the 
caller’s wishes, companies take steps to respect the 
individual’s privacy and strive to the maximum extent 
possible to ensure that callers suffer no retaliation or 
disadvantage as a result of their good-faith 
consultation. In principle, companies also receive the 
caller’s consent when an investigation of related 
parties is conducted. Anonymous inquiries are 
accepted, but callers are encouraged to identify 
themselves to facilitate proper investigation.
 In addition, as noted above, we clarified the rules 
governing initial reporting of compliance violations 
and suspected compliance violations, and have put in 
place a framework for receiving reports from 
individual units at the worksite level.
 In 2021, there were 424 reports made to the 
hotlines (including group companies outside Japan). 
Although the number of cases increased from the 
previous year, we recognize that this is due to the 
increased awareness of employees as a result of the 
BCG refresher test and compliance awareness survey,

Compliance Message

To encourage employees to view compliance activities 
as directly relevant to them, top management sends 
out Compliance Messages to promote compliance 
activities within and outside Japan.
 In 2021, the Compliance Committee Chairperson 
published the Compliance Message, “Dialogue fosters 
mutual respect and makes workplaces exciting.” We 
promoted activities to realize an enthusiastic 
workplace atmosphere by building awareness for 
workplace communication that gives consideration to 
others’ feelings.
 In addition, the Compliance Committee Chairperson’s 
message was posted on the company intranet and on 
posters. Regional leaders and company presidents 
globally published case studies, and starting this year, 
Compliance Messages and other communications were 
issued by the heads of domestic functional divisions.

Meeting and the Board of Directors.
 In making this determination, all cases reported by 
the compliance hotlines and management lines are 
reviewed at the weekly meeting to identify themes 
that should be recognized as issues for the company. 
After consideration and as part of its monthly 
meetings, the Compliance Committee Secretariat 
designates cases with potential to recur or spread 
throughout the company as cases requiring close 
attention. It also identifies potential serious 
compliance issues from among any violations of laws 
and regulations that may have occurred. During this 
process, the committee secretariat receives third-
party evaluations and recommendations from outside 
attorneys who attend its meetings as advisors. The 
division where the incident occurred will examine its 
causes and background, formulate and practice 
measures to prevent recurrence, and submit a 
summary report to the Compliance Committee. After 
a process of receiving evaluations and 
recommendations from each committee member with 
respect to the report, a final verdict is made on 
compliance violations that have a significant impact 
on management and significantly damage corporate 
value. There were 424 compliance reports and 
consultations in 2021. Of these, 209 cases were 
investigated due to material concerns relating to 
noncompliance, while 192 cases were subject to 
some form of corrective action or recurrence 
prevention, including review of business processes, 

organizational awareness-raising and verbal warnings 
to the individual involved. These matters were 
discussed and reviewed at the Compliance 
Committee Secretariat, the Compliance Committee 
and the Management Board, and no major 
compliance violations corresponding to the above 
were found.
 In addition, there were 8 cases of power, sexual 
and other forms of harassment by individual 
employees, and a total of 30 cases within and outside 
Japan in which employees were dismissed or took 
advisory retirement due to misconduct such as 
improper transactions, improper work records, 
smoking or drinking during working hours and theft.
 Compliance violations are divided into three 
categories: (1) those that must be addressed as 
organizational issues, (2) those requiring improvement 
of individual awareness, and (3) those discovered 
during the PDCA cycle of control activities. We strive 
to prevent recurrence through such means as 
verifying the appropriateness of the recurrence 
prevention measures prepared by the generating 
department by the Compliance Committee Secretariat 
or the Compliance Committee.

which are conducted biannually. A breakdown of 
reports showed that items related to harassment, 
including workplace bullying, represented roughly 
30% of reports, while items including those related to 
miscommunication at workplaces, working conditions 
and employment, represented around 40%, and items 
related to violations of laws and regulations 
represented around 20%. Together, these three 
categories comprised approximately 90% of reports. 
Violations of laws and regulations include many that 
are discovered during internal control inspections.
 No particular trends were observed in the 
organizations, worksites or occupations to which 
callers belonged.
 Under “Walking the right path” in the Kirei 
Lifestyle Plan announced in April 2019, we set the 
indicator of zero serious compliance violations.
 These serious compliance violations refer to 
compliance violations that significantly impact 
management and result in significant loss to our 
corporate value. Taking into consideration the 
malicious nature of the violation (importance / 
seriousness of the legal infraction, its underlying 
intent, the span of time over which the violation 
occurred, and its organizational scope), as well as its 
internal / external impact, opinions are solicited from 
the Compliance Committee Secretariat, Compliance 
Committee and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. 
The Management Board reviews these opinions, and 
its conclusions are reported to the Executive Officers

Sharing our insights on 
compliance with outside 
groups

In 2021 the Executive Officer holding the position of 
Senior Vice President of the Legal and Compliance 
lectured on corporate legal affairs and compliance 
under the impact of COVID-19 at a meeting attended 
by corporate legal professionals from Japan and 
China. In addition, at an event organized by a 
corporate legal organization and attended by 
approximately 100 enterprises, we participated in a 
dialogue on human capital development of young 
corporate legal professionals and a roundtable 
discussion with a major accounting firm on efforts to 
foster an ethical culture. We also held lectures on the 
role of corporate legal affairs, including corporate 
governance, at two universities and three law schools.

Sixteen consecutive years on 
the World’s Most Ethical 
Companies® 2022 list

In March 2022, Kao was recognized as one of the 
World’s Most Ethical Companies® 2022 by the U.S.-
based think tank Ethisphere Institute. We have been 
named to the list 16 straight years since the award’s 
inception in 2007. We are the only Japanese 
company, and the only manufacturer of fast-moving 
consumer goods and chemicals in the world, to be 
honored for 16 consecutive years.
 Selection of companies for the list is based on the 
evaluation of five factors: (1) Corporate Ethics and 
Compliance Program; (2) Corporate Citizenship and 
Responsibility; (3) Culture of Ethics; (4) Corporate 
Governance; and (5) Leadership, Innovation and 
Reputation.
 This recognition reflects the fact that the spirit of 
Integrity passed down from our founder continues to 
be implemented by all Kao Group members in day-to-
day operations through practice of the Kao Way and 
the BCG.

Company awareness of issues and 
activities
While handling matters reported by the 
compliance hotlines and the management line 
appropriately, we identify themes to be 
recognized as company issues and take 
appropriate actions in parallel with these 
activities. Based on the background of the 
occurrence and a shared awareness of the 
problem, the monthly Compliance Committee 
Secretariat meeting identifies cases with 
potential to recur or spread throughout the 
company, designates them as requiring close 
attention, and continues activities to prevent 
them from becoming serious violations by 
appropriately identifying the seeds of compliance 
violations in the company. The division where the 
incident occurred will examine its causes and 
background, formulate and practice measures to 
prevent recurrence, and submit a summary 
report to the Compliance Committee. Based on 
the committee’s multifaceted evaluations and 
recommendations, the division concerned then 
implements improvement activities.

Stakeholder engagement

Thoroughly analyze root causes and respond
A secretariat was established as a subordinate 
organization of the Compliance Committee, and 
secretariat meetings are held once a month, with 
members from the Compliance Department and 
other supervising divisions. I also attend the 
secretariat meetings as an advisor.
 The Kao Way, Kao’s corporate philosophy, 
establishes Integrity, the final instruction of its 
founder Tomiro Nagase, as the basis for values 
unique to Kao, and Integrity is positioned by the 
Compliance Committee (Secretariat) as the starting 
point for compliance. It is easy to call for Integrity, 
but for a company that pursues efficiency and 
individual optimization at each worksite, it is also 
easy to imagine that Integrity can entail 
considerable challenges.
 The Compliance Committee (Secretariat) 
handles compliance cases, including those reported 
through the compliance hotlines, and strives to 
discover and analyze the underlying causes (root 
causes) behind the cases, rather than merely taking 
superficial measures in response to issues specific 
to the offending party. If we identify causes that 
could lead to noncompliance, such causes must be 
eliminated to prevent recurrence. However, if the 
causes of noncompliance lie in the daily work 
system itself, then unless that system is changed, 

noncompliance will recur somewhere.
 Furthermore, changes to the work system itself 
are expected to generate significant resistance from 
each worksite, since it would mean changing 
individually optimized work systems. The 
Compliance Committee (Secretariat) will likely face 
the challenge of finding ways to persuade and 
adjust. It is not an easy task to analyze the root 
causes of a problem and proceed to develop and 
implement measures to prevent recurrence. But if, 
in the company’s pursuit of efficiency, distortions 
have occurred in the process of optimization at 
each worksite, correcting these distortions is itself 
an instance of Integrity. I am convinced this is 
surely something that Kao can achieve.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Social issues we are aware of
In modern society, individuals have a greater need 
and desire to obtain necessary and important 
information. At the same time, the development of 
social media has made it easy to obtain a wide range 
of information. Ethical consumption, where products 
and services created with environmental and social 
considerations in mind are chosen and consumed, is 
growing on the part of consumers. Consumers are 
also seeking information about corporate activities 
with the desire to purchase not only individual 
products of high quality, but also products from 
companies they can trust.
 However, information relating to companies and 
the products and services they offer is still often 
fragmentary, preventing consumers from making right 
and satisfactory choices for themselves.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
If a company is unable to share information that is 
sufficient in terms of both quality and quantity, at the 
right time, with a quickly changing market and with 
consumers, and if that information is not compatible 
with the company and the products it offers, then the 

Through product transparency, Kao aims to build stronger trust with consumers. We believe that sharing information that consumers need in an appropriate 
and easily understand manner is important if they are to make the right choices for themselves and lead beautiful lives. We disclose information in a timely 
manner through our websites and various opportunities to engage with stakeholders.

products to be purchased, or even the company itself, 
may be excluded from consumers’ choices.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
We believe we can become a sustainable company 
with people, society and the planet by walking the 
right path and continuing to provide science-based 
products that support enriched lives for consumers.

Kao’s creating value
Obtaining necessary information makes it easier for 
consumers to choose safe, reliable products and 
services, and lead comfortable lives. In addition, the 
individual choices of consumers contribute to the 
SDGs without them being aware of it, and we believe 
in the need for the environmental impact of these 
activities to stay within the range that our natural 
world can safely absorb.
 And by providing innovation and new value to the 
world with appropriate information, we will create 
new markets and help realize a world that is 
sustainable and filled with trust.

Contributions to the SDGs

Policies
Regarding transparency, we conduct activities founded 
in the Kao Way, Kao Business Conduct Guidelines and 
Disclosure Guidelines so that people can easily get the 
information they need when they need it for the right 
choices to be made for individuals, society and the 
Earth, and based on that accurate information, dialogue 
with stakeholders can become more developed. We will 
disclose information to all stakeholders in a timely, 
accurate and fair manner, aiming to be a company that 
is trusted and supported by society.
 First, transparency must be mainstreamed in all 
business activities within Kao. We hope that activities 
can then be expanded and upgraded a step ahead of 
the scope and level of transparency required by the 
times, and that transparency will be promoted through 
the voluntary efforts of employees. We will also 
encourage the integration of each database, which was 
designed individually for the primary purpose of storing 
and managing information, and require systemic 
measures to ensure a smooth two-way flow of 
information with internal and external stakeholders. We 
believe that by further enhancing transparency, we can 
move beyond merely disclosing required information to 
actively promoting communication and interactive 
activities that will realize the Kirei Lifestyle Plan and lead 
to ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri. We also hope to move 
closer to the vision set forth in the Kao Way: To be

information, but also through dialogue with

Framework

We believe that conveying Kao accurately to all 
stakeholders will help ensure full transparency. Each 
managing division promotes activities to enhance 
transparency.
 Of particular importance was our decision to 
accelerate promotion of these activities from a global, 
cross-divisional perspective for information relating to 
products that consumers come in frequent contact 
with.
 To this end, in 2019 we established a task force 
for disclosing product information in the ESG 
Promotion Meeting, an organization under the ESG 
Committee (now the ESG Managing Committee), and 
it has begun conducting activities, focusing first on 
fragrance ingredient disclosure, for which there is 
strong global demand. In February 2020, the ESG 
Committee deliberated on and approved proposals to 
disclose our Fragrance Policy, and to begin disclosing 
the names of fragrance ingredients in line with this 
policy disclosure, as well as deliberating on and 
approving the targets for 2030. The task force, whose 
members are drawn from Kao employees in Japan, 
Europe and the Americas, operates through five 
working groups focused on such areas as information 
gathering, IT and other infrastructure and region-

specific activities in Europe and the Americas. In July 
2020, we established two preparatory teams to 
expand the scope of our activities to include 
consumer and cosmetic products in Japan and Asia, 
and we have also created a forum for sharing 
progress and issue-related information.
 It is also necessary to promote and deepen 
engagement with stakeholders and enhancement of 
the education and understanding of employees to 
improve the inculcation of understanding. 
 In 2021, representatives from Japan, Europe and 
the Americas joined us at the beginning of the year to 
review 2020 activities and share plans for 2021. We 
also agreed to collaborate on the development of a 
system to centralize information. On the Japan side, 
we discussed the overall progress of the task force 
and next actions every two to three months, and 
shared the results with the two preparatory teams.
 In system terms, we have made modifications to 
systematize (automate) the process of disclosing 
fragrance ingredient names, which had been partly 
dependent on manual operations. Meetings were held 
on a weekly basis, and the system began operation in 
July 2021, as originally scheduled.
 At the ESG Promotion Meeting held in June, we 
reported results of activities after the task force was 
established, response after the release of information, 
and plans for future activities. In October, we 
summarized for the business, research and related 
divisions the reception system for inquiries from 
various directions, and trends in the number of 

closest to the individual and beyond their expectation.

Education and promotion

Integrity, or walking the right path, is fundamental to the 
Kao Way, and the basis for the My Kirei Lifestyle. Along 
with strict observance of laws and regulations, it is 
considered extremely important that each Kao employee 
act with social integrity, in accordance with ethics. This 
attitude is inculcated in Kao employees not only through 
specific training opportunities, but through their daily 
work, and is practiced thoroughly in their daily life.
 In addition, in accordance with the “we think from 
the Genba” viewpoint set forth in the Kao Way, we 
learn through dialogue with stakeholders what 
information is needed by consumers globally.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

Collaboration with suppliers is essential for enhancing 
transparency, and we work closely with industry 
groups to promote product information disclosure.
 Moreover, we gather the latest scientific 
knowledge though ongoing interaction with 
academics.
 We strive to understand the needs of society and 
the market, not only through direct inquiries from, and 
consultations with, consumers relating to product

information they need, and can select products that 
have meaning for them and are safe and reliable, it 
will generate opportunities for market expansion, and 
lead us to take actions and develop products correctly.
 In addition, certain retailers select products that 
incorporate information not only concerning fragrance 
ingredients, but on other ingredients and the impact 
they have on the environment. For Kao, sustainable 
manufacturing that is friendly to the environment and 
promotes biodiversity, and promoting product 
information disclosure, will become more and more 
important.

Social impacts
When consumers choose products that have meaning 
for them and are safe and reliable based on correct 
information, it creates opportunities for changed 
behavior not only for Kao, but for other companies as 
well. We believe that this will lead to the society 
where people choose sustainable lifestyles, products 
and services that are friendly to the environment and 
promote biodiversity.
 We also believe that as information regarding 
issues that arise are shared with the public and 
become visible, new collaborations will be created 
among the individuals, companies and organizations 
possessing the means to address those issues who 
enter the market.

consumer inquiries among others, and reported that 
activities were progressing without major problems.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

2030 long-term targets
We defined brands as transparent brands when the 
information that consumers need is available in both 
quality and quantity. And we have set the target of 
making all our brands selling consumer products 
transparent brands by 2030. We are also looking at 
how to disclose information in ways that consumers 
find easier to understand.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
We expect these efforts to eliminate asymmetries 
between companies and consumers with respect to 
the information displayed on products, and increase 
the number of product choice selection criteria. We 
believe that consumers and companies accessing the 
same information will contribute to ESG-driven Yoki-
Monozukuri and the building of a better society.

Performance in 2021

Performance
Between June and September 2021, 
fragrance ingredient names were disclosed 
in the product catalog of our Japan website 
for four brands in the Hygiene and living 
care. In October, global cosmetics brand 
SENSAI began disclosing fragrance 
ingredient names on its EC sites in Japan 
and Europe. We disclosed fragrance 
ingredients for a total of 16 brands.
 In addition, KMS in Europe promoted the 
display of QR codes* on packages.
 Moreover, we are working to establish an 
IT system to facilitate more accurate and 
timely disclosure of fragrance ingredients. To 
date, maintenance of the list of fragrance 
ingredient names for disclosure has been 
handled manually, creating a heavy 
workload. As part of these efforts, a new 
system able to automatically create a list of 
fragrance ingredient names from a database 
was launched in July. This new system is 
being used to update information relating to 
brands that have already disclosed 
information, and as a new effort for this year, 
to disclose the names of fragrance 
ingredients in the Cosmetics.

 Along with the five ingredients of particular 
interest to society that we disclosed last year, we 
have also disclosed our approach to alkyl sulfates, 
formaldehyde-releasing preservatives, 1,4-dioxane 
and talc on our Japanese and global websites.

Reviews of performance
This year we disclosed the names of fragrance 
ingredients for five brands, including SENSAI. This 
was our first effort to disclose SENSAI-related 
information on its Japan and European websites 
within a short period of time, since the number of 
products under the brand is much larger than that 
of general household products.
 SENSAI must negotiate and contract with 
suppliers and obtain and organize information for 
more than 100 products, which is a process that is 
difficult to automate and inevitably requires a 
considerable amount of time. In addition, since 
brands that have disclosed information to date 
have done so mainly on their home-country 
websites, it can be presumed that the sensitivity of 
recipients and information providers to issues of 
expression and the manner in which information is 
received are relatively similar. This effort to disclose 
fragrance ingredient names on websites in Japan 
and Europe, which have different levels of 

sensitivity to information, involved numerous 
complex and difficult challenges that had to be 
met in parallel. We believe that this effort was 
made possible by the SENSAI brand’s long history 
of doing business and accumulating knowledge in 
Europe̶where people are sensitive to information 
regarding ingredients and safe products, and are 
strongly predisposed to gather information̶as 
well as by the employees and external parties 
supporting the brand.
 Displaying QR codes* on packages of KMS 
products in Europe prepares us for the increasing 
number of ingredients that may be required to be 
disclosed in Europe going forward, and is a means 
to provide consumers with more information by 
posting information on the website that cannot be 
included with the package. The website explains 
that the purpose of the QR code placement is to 
enable consumers to access the website more 
easily, and find the transparency policy and 
ingredients list. From this experience, we learned 
from our European members the importance of 
communicating the purpose of our actions to 
consumers.
 In addition, there has been a recent increase in 
demands for information, not only relating to 
fragrance ingredients, but also for other 

ingredients as well as environmental impact and 
the overall transparency of our supply chain, and 
this information must be conveyed to a wide range 
of stakeholders in addition to consumers. To this 
end, we will promote further strengthening of 
internal structures, database enhancement, system 
linkage and collaboration with internal and external 
partners, and strive to move up our 2030 deadline 
for achievement of 100% transparent brands.

Considerations in the product 
catalog website and individual 
product websites

We disclose information needed to make decisions 
about whether products that customers are planning 
to purchase and products that customers already 
have purchased can be purchased and used with 
peace of mind.
 In product catalogs on our website and on 
individual product websites, we provide information 
on product features and the ingredients used in 
products based on scientific evidence.

In 2021, we started to disclose new fragrance 
ingredient information for SENSAI. In Hygiene and 
living care products, we disclosed fragrance 
ingredient information for four new brands. We are 
also updating this information for products that have 
been improved.

1.  Ensure all of our fragrance formulations are fully 
compliant to the local regulations of the regions 
where they are marketed, and ensure that the 
latest safety data is collected.

2.  Only create fragrances using ingredients that are 
in line with the guidelines set forth by the 
International Fragrance Association (IFRA).

3.  Begin the process of providing information of 
fragrance ingredients accounting for 0.01% or 
more of the product weight.

The disclosure threshold (0.01% or more of fragrance 
ingredients by weight of product) is determined by 
reference to the SCCS opinion. This standard is 
consistent with the disclosure standards of peer 
companies in Europe and the Americas.

Based on this basic policy, and in line with the trend in 
the industry, we began disclosing the names of 
fragrance ingredients in a total of 16 brands in Japan

Reinforcing person-to-person connections 
through improved 
transparency

Employees’ voice

As part of our global ESG Strategy, SENSAI, a 
brand with operations in Europe, Japan and 
China, has begun disclosing the names of 
fragrance ingredients on its website. SENSAI 
offers products in more than 40 countries, and 
our customers have a wide range of interests and 
tastes relating to our products. At the same time, 
we felt that the need for safe products and 
information disclosure was growing worldwide.
 This project was promoted not only through 
R&D, marketing and product development, but 
also through collaboration with local staff 
involved in European EC operations. As a result, 
we believe we have not only enabled our 
customers to feel more secure than ever in using 
our products, but also strengthened our 
relationship of trust, and we will continue this 
effort going forward.

Supply chain transparency

We are also promoting activities to enhance the 
transparency of our supply chain. We strive to source 
our raw materials in a way that protects natural 
resources, the environment and human rights through 
supply chain traceability and collaboration with 
suppliers. We plan to complete traceability 
confirmation for small oil palm farms by 2025. In 
2021, we published a list of mills from which we 
source palm oil.

We disseminated these results through overseas 
lectures and other means.

Respecting human rights 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

We support and respect international rules relating to human rights, and have developed the Kao Human Rights Policy, which is based on the United Nations 
(UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We are implementing initiatives aimed at realizing zero human rights violations in every aspect of our 
corporate activities. The Kao Human Rights Policy was first published in 2015, and was revised in 2021 with the approval of the ESG Managing Committee, 
which is supervised by the Board of Directors, to reflect social trends and express Kao’s commitment more strongly.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Social issues we are aware of
Human rights are fundamental rights, and in a world 
of diverse values, it is important to build a society in 
which people respect one another’s human rights, 
and where no one has to suffer from prejudice or 
discrimination.
 Corporate activities are closely bound up with the 
human rights of a wide range of people, including 
employees, business partners, customers and local 
communities. Under these circumstances, the risk of 
human rights violations occurring cannot be said to 
be zero.
 For example, it has been pointed out that, given 
the ongoing globalization of corporate activities, there 
is a risk of forced labor occurring at suppliers in 
developing nations. Within the workplace, there is a 
need for mechanisms to support diverse work styles, 
including working from home, which has increased in 
the wake of COVID-19, as well as initiatives to 
leverage the diverse value sense of employees and 
prevent discrimination. For consumers, if advertorial 
expression infringes on their human rights, or if 
advertisements reposted by consumers on social 
media incorporate content that infringes on human 
rights, consumers may be indirectly complicit in 

human rights infringement.
 We also recognize that global issues such as 
climate change are closely linked to human rights.
 Ten years have passed since the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights were 
approved, and discussions are underway, particularly 
in Europe, to legislate corporate human rights 
initiatives and their disclosure. Corporate human 
rights initiatives are thus increasingly regarded as 
important. Companies have a responsibility to respect 
human rights. They need to identify human rights risk, 
implement corrective action when human rights 
violations have emerged, and continue making an 
effort to reduce the risk and prevent human rights 
violations from occurring.
 Across all of our corporate activities, we commit 
to achieving zero human rights violations, and to 
solving problems promptly when they unintentionally 
occur. In particular, we recognize that the two issues 
of supply chains, including for palm oil, and employee 
human rights are major social issues for us. 
 We also recognize that to achieve the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, we must 
accelerate and expand our efforts.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
Laws and regulations that encourage companies to 
address human rights, such as the U.K.’s Modern 

Slavery Act 2015, can impose penalties for 
noncompliance.
 Recently, as consumers’ ethical awareness has 
grown, there has been a global increase in concern 
regarding the ways in which business enterprises 
respond to human rights issues. Besides complying 
with relevant laws and regulations, it is important to 
bear in mind that paying inadequate attention to 
human rights, can entail reputation risk.
 Both internally within Kao Group and in the case 
of suppliers and contractors, manufacturing products 
in environments with poor labor conditions, such as 
forced labor, has the potential to create quality 
problems. Furthermore, if our reputation is damaged 
by human rights risk, the relationship of trust that we 
have with our suppliers could be damaged, which 
would have an adverse impact on purchasing, and 
consumers’ loss of faith in the company could lead to 
reduced sales. At the same time, employee motivation 
and loyalty may decline, which can negatively impact 
productivity and increase turnover, leading to 
impaired recruitment efforts.
 We recognize that there are risks like those shown 
in the “Kao Group risks specified through risk 
assessments” chart, and in particular high risks 
relating to the people we work with, consumers and 
customers. We conduct periodic risk assessments to 
evaluate the status of these risks.

Respecting human rights 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Our respect for human rights, which imbues all of our 
corporate activities, and the initiatives that we have 
taken in this area, has the potential to earn 
widespread approval from society. Such our effort will 
lead an increase in activities that foster respect for 
human rights. Contractors and other companies in the 
supply chain will pursue human rights initiatives, and 
this will enhance their activities. This in turn will lead 
to strengthened human rights awareness in society as 
a whole, and will contribute toward reducing human 
rights violations to zero.
 We respect human rights, and we are working to 
promote fair procurement. This secures consumer 

support for our corporate approach and helps build 
and maintain trustworthy relations with suppliers. In 
particular, if we can secure the approval of Millennials 
and Generation Z, who tend to be very concerned 
about ethical consumption, then this may lead to 
increased purchasing of our products, and increased 
opportunities for us to recruit talented individuals. 
Within the company also, promoting initiatives that 
embody respect for human rights can enhance 
employees’ loyalty, and can result in enhanced 
productivity and lower employee turnover.

Kao’s creating value
In the Kao Human Rights Policy, we enunciate our 
commitment to human rights in all of our corporate 

Kao Group risks specified through risk assessments (those with high risk are underlined)

activities. The Kao Business Conduct Guidelines 
(BCG), which represent the Kao Group’s code of 
conduct, emphasize the need to conduct fair, honest 
and appropriate transactions, to respect human rights 
through all company activities, and to respect 
employees’ diversity. We promote fair and equal 
procurement activities, and ask our suppliers to adopt 
the same initiatives we do, as set forth in our 
Partnership Requirements for Suppliers. In addition, 
we promote Yoki-Monozukuri throughout our supply 
chain, and state clearly in our ESG Promotion 
Activities with Suppliers that we monitor supplier 
compliance.

to resolve them speedily. We have set up compliance

Respecting human rights 102-12, 102-43, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Through our corporate activities, we aim to reduce human 
rights violations to zero, and to resolve the issues speedily 
if human rights violations do emerge unintentionally.
 In 2015, we formulated and announced the Kao Human 
Rights Policy, which stipulates that we respect international 
norms relating to human rights, such as the International 
Bill of Human Rights, and that we will conduct human 
rights due diligence and provide human rights education 
and training to all officers and employees, working diligently 
to fulfill our responsibilities in regard to respecting human 
rights in every aspect of our operations. In the Kao Business 
Conduct Guidelines (BCG), which serve as our code of 
conduct for practicing the Kao Way, we also clearly state 
the need to respect human rights and our commitment to 
not engage in child labor, human trafficking or forced labor.
 We are also committed to promoting respect for human 
rights in the supply chain. Our Policies for Procurement 
stipulate the need for purchasing operations to embody 
respect for human rights, and to contribute to the fulfillment 
of our corporate social responsibility. In addition, the 
Partnership Requirements for Suppliers include suppliers’ 
fulfillment of their corporate social responsibility as an 
assessment item, and note that suppliers are required to take 
measures to prevent forced labor, child labor and other illegal 
labor practices. In response to this request, our ESG 
Promotion Activities with Suppliers clearly state that we will 
monitor compliance. Furthermore, our “High-Risk” Supply 
Chain Management and Sourcing clearly stipulate the need 
to demonstrate awareness of sustainable development 
issues, including human rights, and to undertake the 

procurement of raw materials in a sustainable manner. We 
have formulated Sustainable Palm Oil Procurement 
Guidelines and Sustainable Paper and Pulp Procurement 
Guidelines.
 Our human rights due diligence includes risk 
assessment efforts. We are promoting prioritized efforts 
related to the human rights of the people we work with. To 
expand our efforts to where human rights issues are of 
particular concern, we will begin a fact-finding survey of our 
on-site subcontractors and even foreign workers (including 
technical intern trainees). In parallel, third-party audits of 
suppliers will be introduced to reinforce activities.
 In 2005, we also declared our support for the UN Global 
Compact, which defines ten principles in the four areas of 
human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. 
We also pay attention to industry-specific challenges, and 
support the CGF’s* Forced Labour Resolution and its Priority 
Industry Principles. Besides legal compliance, in case where 
there is any conflict between internationally recognized 
human rights and the laws of a country or regions, we will 
follow processes that seek ways to honor the principles of 
international human rights.
 In order to be able to respond promptly in the event that 
a problem does occur unintentionally, we have established 
hotlines to receive reports and requests for consultation 
both from within the company and from outside. On the 
basis of these reports and requests, discussions and 
surveys are undertaken by the Compliance Committee and 
other relevant divisions, and appropriate steps are taken in 
response as necessary.
* CGF (The Consumer Goods Forum)

Global network of consumer goods retailers and manufacturers. As 
part of our human rights-related activities, we participate in the 
Japan Social Working Group of the Japan Sustainability Local Group.

Policieshotlines, etc. to which stakeholders can submit their 
views, and when problems start to manifest 
themselves, we take steps to address them through 
collaboration between related units.
 By working together with a wide variety of 
stakeholders to implement measures that strengthen 
respect for human rights, rather than just Kao working 
alone, and by striving to prevent and mitigate human 
rights risk, we are able to get closer to our goal of 
reducing human rights violations to zero, while also 
contributing toward the realization of our mission, as 
enunciated in the Kao Way: As one, we create a Kirei 
life for all̶providing care and enrichment for the life 
of all people and the planet.
 By promoting respect for human rights 
throughout our corporate activities, we will safeguard 
the rights of those who work with us, enhance 
productivity, and earn the trust of consumers.

Education and promotion

To reduce human rights violations to zero, we must 
prevent and mitigate human rights risks in every aspect 
of our corporate activities. Moreover, it is important to 
ensure that every employee has an in-depth 
understanding of human rights issues, and to implement 
measures to foster respect for human rights. To this end, 
besides disseminating information and implementing 
education and training in line with the Kao Human Rights 
Policy, we also take advantage of various opportunities to 
provide education and training focused on individual 
topics, such as compliance, responsible procurement, 
safety and peace of mind in the workplace and diverse 
human talent. From an overall ESG standpoint, we have 
been creating content for the Kirei Lifestyle Plan Lecture, 
an e-learning program comprising the knowledge needed 
to implement the Kirei Lifestyle Plan (KLP), since 2020, 
with human rights as one of the subjects covered.
•  Raising awareness of the importance of respecting 

human rights using the BCG (Global)
•  Raising awareness of the importance of respecting 

human rights using the company’s intranet (Global)
•  Raising awareness of respect for human rights in 

advertising (Japan)
•  Initiatives for deepening understanding of racial 

discrimination issues

building of inclusive and diverse workplaces. The 
Procurement Division has main responsibility for 
initiatives relating to suppliers. The aspect that is most 
directly related to consumers is human rights 
concerns relating to representations in advertising. 
The Consumer Products Business divisions and 
Creative divisions have responsibility for this aspect. 
In addition, we have set up compliance hotlines to 
receive reports and requests for consultation from 
both within and outside our company to facilitate 
prompt remediation of human right violations.
 The ESG Division exercises oversight over, and 
promotes, all of these individual initiatives, and 
collaborates as necessary with each of the divisions 
that is implementing initiatives. The Executive Officer 
in charge of the ESG Division has overall responsibility 
for our human rights initiatives.
 The ESG Division reports annually to the ESG 
Managing Committee, which is supervised by the 
Board of Directors, on overall human rights initiatives.
 In the risk assessment process, the ESG Division 
examines risks anticipated at Kao and conducts risks 
assessments based on feedback from outside experts 
and staff in internal departments undertaking human 
rights initiatives, and these are approved by the ESG 
Managing Committee.

Kirei Lifestyle Plan̶Kao’s ESG Strategy > ESG 
governance structureP16

The human rights initiatives of the Kao Group as a 
whole are implemented within the ESG promotion 
structure as one of the 19 Actions of the KLP. In other 
words, the ESG Managing Committee discusses and 
approves the general direction of initiatives, while the 
ESG Promotion Meeting discusses actual initiatives 
and confirms progress.
 As human rights issues are so multifaceted, 
various different units are implementing individual 
initiatives in this area, depending on the specific 
stakeholders concerned and the individual topics. In 
the case of initiatives that relate to our employees, 
Corporate Strategy plays a central role in the 
implementation of initiatives relating to workplace 
safety and security, while Human Capital 
Development plays a key role in those relating to the 

Framework

We implement initiatives that promote respect for 
human rights in all of our corporate activities. The Kao 
Human Rights Policy states that “We consult with the 
relevant stakeholders on responses to potential and 
actual impacts on human rights.” We recognize the 
importance of continuing to raise the level of our 
activities through dialogue with our employees, 
suppliers, consumers, local communities and a wide 
range of other relevant stakeholders with regard to 
our human rights initiatives.
 In dialogue with stakeholders, it is important to 
hear from parties affected by human rights violations. 
In addition to those directly involved, we engage in 
sincere dialogue with experts, NGOs and others who 
can speak on behalf of those affected by human 
rights violations.
 We utilize a variety of opportunities and methods 
to ensure that our policies and ethical standards are 
understood by our employees, suppliers, consumers, 
shareholders, business partners, local communities 
and government agencies.
 For employees, we strive to understand on-site 
issues and employee attitudes through the annual Kao 
Forum, Employee–Management Meetings and 
employee engagement surveys. For suppliers, we 
introduce our activities and engage in an exchange of 
views at the vendor summits. We issue plant site 
reports to introduce plant activities and gain the 

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

understanding of local communities. We also create 
opportunities for local residents to provide input.
 To foster two-way communication with experts, 
we participate in dialogue with experts from outside 
Japan organized by the Caux Round Table Japan (CRT 
Japan) and exchange views with influential thought 
leaders in the global discussion on business and 
human rights. Through communication with Mr. 
Hiroshi Ishida, Executive Director of the CRT Japan, 
we have recognized the need to promote initiatives 
for foreign workers and have begun surveying actual 
situations at on-site subcontractors.

Mid- to long-term targets
In all of our corporate activities, we aim to reduce 
human rights violations to zero, and to resolve the 
issues speedily if human rights violations do emerge 
unintentionally.
 To this end, we use human rights due diligence 
and awareness-raising activities to deepen 
stakeholders’ understanding of human rights. We will 
continue to identify, prevent and mitigate human 
rights related risks in our corporate activities.
 As human rights issues are so multifaceted, they 
potentially impact a wide range of stakeholders. We 
therefore assess what human rights risks exist for 
each type of stakeholder, and address them, giving 
priority to those risks that would have a profound 
impact on stakeholders if they were to manifest 
themselves.
 We conduct risk assessments of employees and 
suppliers who are at high risk for infringement, 
prioritizing people we work with. Our goal is to 
achieve a 100% risk assessment survey 
implementation rate by 2025 for suppliers and by 
2030 for others.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
Once a human rights violation occurs, the company is 
exposed to direct litigation risks and forced to bear 
litigation expenses, collection expenses and other 
economic burden. There is also greater probability of 
severe damage to our company image, a lower 
reputation among consumers, weakened employee 
loyalty, and loss of trustworthy relations with business 
partners and suppliers.
 Continuing to identify, prevent and mitigate 
human rights risks in our business activities not only 
avoids direct economic losses but also contributes to 
increasing opportunities for consumers to choose our 
products through their support for our corporate 
approach, reduces procurement risks by 
strengthening trust with suppliers, increases 
opportunities for recruiting talented individuals, 
improves productivity from increased employee 
loyalty, and reduces hiring costs from lower employee 
turnover.

Social impacts
Expanding company measures to ensure respect for 
human rights contributes to enhanced awareness for 
human rights in society as a whole. Our measures are 
one part of this. For example, deepening 
understanding among stakeholders enhances 
awareness for human rights in society as a whole, 

mitigates human rights problems such as forced 
labor, and can also prevent negative environmental 
impact by reducing indiscriminate development in 
developing countries.
 Providing products made with consideration for 
human rights reduces the chances of consumers 
indirectly infringing on human rights and leads to less 
human rights violations in society as a whole.

Performance
In May 2021, the Human Rights Policy was revised 
with the approval of the ESG Managing 
Committee, which is supervised by the Board of 
Directors. The policy targets all business activities, 
including M&A and new projects.

Human rights due diligence
Internal
(1) Risk assessment
•  We conducted a survey of all group companies 

using the Human Rights Checklist (100% 
response rate from surveyed companies).

•  We conducted a survey of all group production 
sites (41 plants in total) using the Sedex* Self-
Assessment Questionnaire (100% response rate 
from surveyed plants).

(2) Risk identification and reduction
The results obtained in the risk assessment of Kao 
Group worksites did not indicate that Kao had 
caused or contributed to any adverse impact on 
human rights, such as forced labor or child labor. 
The results obtained did not show any human 
rights related risks at either our production sites or 
our group companies. There are therefore no cases 
of sites making improvements or conducting 
remediation procedures.

(3) Status verification
This year, we identified risks through risk 
assessments and conducted third-party social 
responsibility audits at three sites.
(4) Reviewing of rules and standards
To strengthen confirmation of the working 
environment, especially at suppliers, we added a 
section on “living wage” to the Sedex questions. 
In addition, to make the Human Rights Checklist a 
survey that more strongly reflects the demands of 
society, we are considering switching to Sedex, 
which is operated by a third party and has a high 
degree of objectivity.
* Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange)

A large-scale global platform for the sharing and verification of 
information relating to labor standards, health and safety, 
environmental protection and business practices, aimed at 
promoting the adoption and maintenance of ethical business 
practices in global supply chains

Suppliers
•  We are requesting that all of our direct global 

suppliers to join Sedex, reply to its questions, 
and grant us data access privileges.

•  As of the end of 2021, suppliers accounting for 
89% of global transactions (on a monetary value 
basis) were Sedex members (including Kao SAQ, 
an alternate program).

•  Of the 1,043 sites that had granted access 

privileges and replied to Sedex’s new Self-
Assessment Questionnaire as of December 2021, 
we gave 19% an S ranking and 40% an A 
ranking in the Sedex-based assessment.

•  We released ESG Promotion Activities with 
Suppliers and enhanced supply chain 
management.

Contractors
•  Surveys of the Kao Group’s on-site 

subcontractors have been conducted to 
understand the current status. Risk surveys by 
Sedex have been initiated, and risk assessments 
have been conducted for 3% of on-site 
subcontractors.

Remedies and handling of grievances
•  We established hotlines for employees, suppliers 

and contractors, and support desks for 
consumers to receive reports and requests for 
consultation.

•  We decided through the ESG Managing 
Committee to establish a grievance mechanism for 
employees of on-site subcontractors at each plant.

•  In cooperation with NGOs, we conducted a 
questionnaire survey of independent small oil 
palm farmers in Indonesia in preparation for the 
introduction of a grievance mechanism.

Education and awareness-raising
Employees
•  We have posted material that addresses human 

rights topics on the company intranet to raise 
awareness among employees.

•  We have promoted awareness of the importance 
of respect for human rights through BCG training 

and refresher test implementation.
•  We have continued to implement LGBTQ+ study 

sessions and ALLY recruitment, as part of our efforts to 
promote active participation by diverse employees and 
to foster understanding of diverse types of customers.

•  We implemented initiatives to deepen 
understanding of racial discrimination issues and 
diversity in Europe and the Americas.

•  We initiated the Human Rights section of the 
Kirei Lifestyle Plan Lecture.

Suppliers
•  At the vendor summit, we implemented awareness 

raising with respect to human rights risks.

Dialogue and consultation
•  We participated in a dialogue with overseas 

experts organized by the CRT Japan, and 
conducted stakeholder communication.

•  We participated in the human rights related 
subcommittee of Global Compact Network Japan, the 

Japan Social Working Group, Japan Sustainability 
Local Group, CGF and the Japan Cosmetic Industry 
Association, and we exchanged information with 
experts from other companies, NPOs, international 
organizations and government agencies.

Information disclosure
•  Information about our initiatives is shared with 

consumers using our website, etc.
•  In 2015, the “Act to make provision about 

slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory 
labour and about human trafficking, including 
provision for the protection of victims; to make 
provision for an Independent Anti-slavery 
Commissioner; and for connected purposes” (the 
Modern Slavery Act 2015)* was enacted and 
came into effect in the U.K. A statement noting 
the measures taken by the group in relation to 
the act has been posted on our website.

•  We have begun to consider producing 
commentary documents to explain the details of 
the Kao Human Rights Policy.

* Modern Slavery Act 2015
The Act requires for-profit groups and companies conducting 
business activities in the U.K. whose annual sales exceed a 
certain scale to produce and release annual statements about 
measures enacted to ensure that slave labor and human 
trafficking offenses have not been committed.

Reviews of performance
With regard to human rights initiatives, we have 
set ourselves the goal of raising the human rights 
due diligence survey implementation rate to 
100% by 2030 for the Kao Group, suppliers and 
contractors (specifically, those subcontractors 
operating on Kao Group worksites). This survey 
enables us to grasp human rights risk relating to 
people we work with (regular and contracted 
employees, temporary workers, contractor 
employees and supplier employees). The survey 
implementation rate in 2021 was 100% for the 
Kao Group. The suppliers that completed the 
survey accounted for 89% of global transactions 
(on a monetary value basis), which represented a 
move in the right direction.
 The investigation did not reveal any serious 
human rights risks, such as forced labor or child 
labor, in the Kao Group. We will continue to share 
our ideas with suppliers, including the Partnership 
Requirements for Suppliers and ESG Promotion 
Activities with Suppliers, and continue to request 
cooperation from suppliers to achieve a 100% 
assessment implementation rate. In addition, 
since approximately 41% of suppliers had low 
assessment results, we will ask these suppliers to 
improve their activities. While we were unable to 
conduct a survey of contractors, we conducted a 

questionnaire to grasp the current status of 
on-site subcontractors, and ascertained the 
number of foreign workers. Based on the results, 
we will make preparations, and plan to extend 
the human rights due diligence survey to on-site 
subcontractors at all of our domestic plants by 
the end of 2022.
 This year we took a step beyond our previous 
risk surveys and engaged in third-party audits to 
gain deeper situational understanding. At our 
flagship Wakayama and Kawasaki plants, as well 
as at Kao Industrial (Thailand) Co., Ltd., third-
party auditors conducted hearings that included 
the status of certain on-site subcontractors. 
Although minor points were raised, the auditors 
confirmed that no major human rights violations 
had occurred. Going forward, we plan to focus 
audits on plants we believe need to be improved, 
based on Sedex survey results. As the situation 
changes every year, we will continue to 
implement the survey next year and after, as we 
strive to identify, prevent and mitigate human 
rights risk.

Revising the Kao Human Rights Policy

The Kao Human Rights Policy was first published in 
2015. In 2021, the ESG Managing Committee, which 
is supervised by the Board of Directors, approved a 
revised policy to reflect social trends and express our 
commitment more strongly.

Human rights due diligence process

We are making efforts to investigate and identify 
human rights risks involving the group, including 
forced labor, workplace labor conditions and 
discrimination.
 We strive to identify, prevent and mitigate 
negative human rights impacts by conducting risk 
assessments of various items (including internal, 
supplier, contractor and new business transactions, 
such as mergers and acquisitions). We then review 
the results and identify risks.

1. Efforts in the group
Every year, we perform a risk assessment targeting all of 
our business locations throughout the world. With respect 
to production sites, we make effective use of Sedex, a 
global corporate ethics information sharing platform. For 
other Kao Group companies besides the production sites, 
a Human Rights Checklist was compiled, which these 
companies are required to complete.
 In 2021, a total of 41 production sites completed 
the Sedex Self-Assessment Questionnaire. For other 

Our initiatives

Kao Group companies, a total of 56 Kao Group 
companies completed and returned the Human Rights 
Checklist. In both cases, there was a 100% completion 
and return rate. The results obtained did not show any 
serious human rights risks at either our production 
sites or our group companies. There are therefore no 
cases of mitigation being implemented.
 In 2021, audits were implemented at Wakayama, 
Kawasaki and Kao Industrial (Thailand) plants. While 
there were some minor findings, social audits by 
third-party auditors identified no instances of major 
human rights violations.

2. Efforts in the supply chain
New clauses relating to concern for the 
environment and for human rights added to 
standard contract with suppliers
In 2012, new clauses relating to concern for the 
environment and for human rights were added to the 
master agreement that we sign with suppliers. In principle, 
this master agreement is used when signing contracts 
with new suppliers or renewing existing contracts.

Request for self-assessment and monitoring
Since 2008, suppliers have been required to perform 
self-assessments of their conformity with the Partnership 
Requirements for Suppliers, which we then monitor. 
Since joining Sedex in 2014, we have held presentations 
to explain Sedex to suppliers, and we continue to 
request that suppliers join Sedex, respond to Sedex 
questionnaires, and set up data access rights. As of the 
end of 2021, suppliers accounting for 89% of global 

transactions (on a monetary value basis) were Sedex 
members (including Kao SAQ, an alternate program*).
*  EcoVadis and other survey programs used as alternatives to Sedex 

Remedies and grievance 
mechanism

We have opened a wide range of channels so that we 
can receive reports and requests for consultation from 
all stakeholders. Our compliance hotlines handle 
reports and requests for consultation from employees, 
suppliers and contractors, while consumers can submit 
reports and requests for consultation to the support 
desks by telephone or e-mail, etc. In addition, views 
expressed directly to managers are shared with relevant 
units, and action taken in response, as needed.
 Furthermore, thanks to the written contribution of 
Mr. Hiroshi Ishida (Executive Director of the CRT 
Japan) in last year’s Sustainability Data Book and 
subsequent engagement, we recognized the 
importance of efforts to help foreign workers and the 
establishment of a grievance mechanism. In 
response, this year we conducted a survey of the 
current number of foreign workers at each plant and 
on-site subcontractor, and began preparations for the 
launch of a grievance mechanism.
 In addition, we have begun preparations to 
introduce a grievance mechanism for independent

small oil palm farmers in Indonesia starting in 2022. In 
2021, we conducted a preliminary survey of 
independent small farmers in Riau Province, 
Indonesia, in cooperation with an NGO.

Education and promotion

Raising awareness of the importance of 
respecting human rights using the BCG (Global)
We implement educational activities to deepen 
employees’ understanding of the BCG, which set out our 
approach to ensuring respect for human rights among 
employees in all of our group companies. In Japan, the 
BCG refresher test was given to all employees, and 
compliance training was carried out for new employees 
and newly appointed managers. In addition, by sending 
out messages from the Compliance Committee 
Chairperson, division heads in Japan, the Vice President 
of each region and the President of each group company 
outside of Japan during Compliance Message 
throughout the year, the entire group, including overseas 
subsidiaries, promoted diversity by encouraging dialogue 
within workplaces, and activities to realize a workplace 
culture in which people can work with enthusiasm.

Raising awareness of the importance of respecting 
human rights using the company’s intranet (Global)
We have posted material that addresses human rights 

topics on the company intranet to raise awareness 
among employees.
 In conjunction with Human Rights Day on 
December 10, the Human Rights section of the Kirei 
Lifestyle Plan Lecture, an ESG awareness-raising 
program was released, with 611 employees taking the 
course. Among others, the lecture introduces human 
rights-related news events from around the world and 
our efforts to support oil palm farms. It gives 
employees an opportunity to deepen their 
understanding of business and human rights and 
consider the relationship between their own work and 
human rights.
 In addition, to familiarize our management team 
with D&I concepts and ensure that they are 
thoroughly practiced, we invited Tsukiko Tsukahara, 
President of Kaleidist K.K. and Japan Co-
Representative of G20 EMPOWER, to speak at the 
ESG Promotion Meeting, which was attended by 
approximately 70 people. Ms. Tsukahara’s lecture was 
distributed with Japanese and English subtitles, 
enabling 528 employees to view it.
 The Consumer Products Business is actively 
raising awareness of the importance of respect for 
human rights in advertising, while the Human Capital 
Development is also actively raising awareness 
through such initiatives as the continuing 
dissemination of content to provide basic knowledge 
on LGBTQ+, cross-cultural and disability issues.

Raising awareness of respect for human rights 
in advertising (Japan)
We have created an e-learning program for new employees 
and transferees regarding human rights considerations in 
advertising. Employees involved in product development 
and marketing are participating in this program.

Efforts to deepen understanding of racism and 
diversity (Europe and the Americas)
In the Americas, workshops and expert lectures on social 
issues were conducted in conjunction with annual events, 
such as Black History Month, to deepen employees’ 
understanding of issues impacting underrepresented and 
marginalized communities. Workshops included 
Unconscious Bias and Understanding Racism and were 
available to all employees.
 Among additional activities conducted as part of efforts 
to create an inclusive culture were a monthly newsletter 
called #StrongerTogether and opportunities for employees 
to share their own personal stories with others to help 
strengthen understanding. Employee resource groups have 
also been formed to address the specific needs of women 
in the workplace and young employees as they begin their 
careers and work to establish strong relationships. 
 In Europe, we are also conducting activities to 
deepen understanding of diversity, such as trainings 
on unconscious bias and conducting surveys on D&I.

human rights initiatives, we participated in a dialogue 
with overseas experts organized by the CRT Japan. We 
explained these initiatives to, and exchanged views with, 
two international experts active in the field of business 
and human rights. While our governance structure and 
ESG vision were well received, the exchange of views 
reinforced our awareness of the importance of dialogue 
with a wider range of stakeholders, and of continuously 
engaging with rights holders who provide views via the 
grievance mechanism.

Other

A system is in place for those in charge to voluntarily 
check expressions in advertisements, packages, sales 
promotion materials, etc., from a human rights 
perspective. Previously, the responsible reviewed 
advertising and related materials against a checklist, 
but we strengthened the system this year by 
instituting multi-person review to ensure that a 
broader perspective is incorporated. It is important to 
conduct a multi-person review to judge whether or 
not an expression contains content that could be 
considered a human rights violation. Consequently, 
the person in charge and their supervisor will check 
whether the content is free of anything that could be 
considered an infringement of human rights, and at 
the same time share the information with our internal 
creative division (i.e. Advertising Communication). In 
addition, personnel to undertake human rights 
promotion* within the Advertising Communication 

reviews advertising, packaging, and sales promotion 
and other materials. If a case is difficult to judge, a 
process to deal with the case is in place, with the 
personnel to undertake human rights promotion 
consulting and obtaining advice from the ESG 
Division.
 By adhering to this process, we make appropriate 
changes to advertising content and strive to perform 

 
Employees’ voice

Human resources are the most important resource of an 
organization. Nowadays, it is not just important to ensure 
that the members of the organization comply with its 
standards and decisions; they must also be motivated to 
unleash their potential on their own. The organization or 
supervisor just needs to play the role of a mentor that 
supports everyone in the organization as they strive to 
reach the same goal.
 From my own experience in relation to the compliance 
audit for the Sedex standard in 2018, there were many 
points where there was a need for focus and improvement, 

especially in regard to the labor management of both Kao 
and our contractors. The power of employees is important. 
It can be a positive or negative power, depending on the 
circumstances or on access to necessary information. If 
employees lack the information they need, this may make 
them dissatisfied or uncertain, which may then be reflected 
in a negative attitude that could manifest itself in ignoring 
necessary tasks or violating rules and regulations. How to 
energize the power that comes from inside the heart of 
team members is the key to success for an organization. 
We already have good guidelines in place, in terms of the 
Kao Way and our ESG policies. We need to understand 
human beings and their diversity, and demonstrate respect 
for differences in gender, race, religion, skin color and 
opinion, which are all fundamental aspects of humanity. 
Understanding of humanity, and respecting and honoring 
the rights of all, will be the basis and the driving force for 
unleashing potential and maximizing benefits for the 
organization as well.

Stakeholder engagement

Hiroshi Ishida
Executive Director,  

Caux Round Table Japan

Kao’s efforts on “respect for human rights” x 
“responsibly sourced raw materials”
■  Global trend: Due diligence is essential to 

obtain social legitimacy
As we are rapidly entering an era of increasingly 
strict legal regulation of business and human 
rights, companies will be expected to conduct due 
diligence that integrates human rights and climate 
change. You are therefore expected to engage in 
direct dialogue with vulnerable producers and 
workers (rights holders) in the supply chain, 
identify those who are suffering human rights 
violations, and address their issues. A shift from a 
comprehensive approach to one of selective 
prioritization is needed.

■ Notable Kao initiatives
•  I recognize the following three points that I 

commented on last year, which are beginning to 
show results.

(1) Kao has drawn up a grand design in agreement 
with management as an ESG Strategy, and has 
clearly stated in Goals of Human Rights Initiatives 
that it will work toward risk mitigation in 2030 and 
2050, further demonstrating its strong 
commitment to human rights initiatives.
(2) Kao is also working steadily to create a system 
based on UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights (UNGPs) procedures to identify 
foreign workers within and outside Japan, identify 
any direct human rights violations in relation to raw 
materials (palm oil), and establish a grievance 
mechanism.

(3) To build quality relationships, Kao has engaged 
in dialogue with leading foreign experts, and 
enhanced transparency to gain legitimacy for a 
series of initiatives.

■ Expectations for future actions
•  Going forward, though laws and regulations will 

be tightened mainly in the European region, I 
expect that Kao will continue to steadily 
implement its initiatives on “respect for human 
rights” x “responsibly sourced raw materials,” 
based on the UNGPs, and establish a leading 
position in the near future.

(1) Implementation of human rights x 
environmental due diligence
Identify foreign workers within and outside Japan 
and confirm whether there are any direct human 
rights violations relating to raw materials including 
palm oil + Implement a grievance mechanism and 
the PDCA cycle
(2) Management involvement(E x S x G)
Establish a series of management frameworks that 
incorporate the voices of rights holders through 
disclosure of the ESG Managing Committee’s 
discussions and decision-making processes
(3) Quality relationship
Invite ESG-related investors to the existing 
dialogue, further enhance quality relationships, and 
continue efforts to establish a framework that 
ensures legitimacy

Kao’s response to views expressed last year

Last year, Mr. Ishida indicated his hopes for 
further efforts regarding oil palm plantations and 
foreign workers. For oil palm plantations, we 
launched the Smallholder Inclusion for Better 
Livelihood & Empowerment program (SMILE) to 
support small farmers in Indonesia with the aim 
of improving productivity. We also conducted a 
survey to ascertain the number of workers 
employed by on-site subcontractors, and 
ascertained how many foreign workers were 
present in each plant. Our ESG Managing 
Committee also discussed the introduction of a 
grievance mechanism, and decided to 
implement a mechanism with oil palm 
plantations through communication with small 
farmers. The committee also decided to 
establish a mechanism at on-site subcontractors 
in domestic plants, to gather feedback from 
foreign workers. We are currently preparing to 
expand risk surveys of on-site subcontractors 
and introduce grievance mechanism.

Employees are a company’s most important asset. We aim to draw out the unlimited potential that every employee possesses to generate immense vitality, 
and utilize this vitality to the maximum possible extent as an organization. We strive to create an environment and a corporate culture in which both 
individuals and the company grow together through successful completion of work and making positive contributions to society.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Social issues we are aware of
Adaptiveness is required to flexibly respond to 
increasing changes due to the spread of COVID-19 in 
2020 as well as intensified global competition from 
the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the advent of a 
hyper-aging society in Japan.
 Furthermore, values regarding individual careers 
and work styles are diversifying more than ever 
before, and in society overall job mobility is becoming 
even more prevalent.
 In the midst of this, we continue to maximize the 
power and potential of employees and make 
maximum use of human capital so that the challenges 
tackled by all employees continue to be the wellspring 
of innovation contributing to the realization of a 
sustainable society.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
If our organizational culture, work style reform and career, 
skills and health development are insufficient for allowing 
employees from diverse backgrounds to advance, we 
may be unable to retain or acquire outstanding talent, 
which could pose a problem for implementing plans to 
realize What Kao Aims to Be by 2030.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
By conducting business that enables each member of 
a diverse workforce to perform their work in a healthy 
and enthusiastic manner and constantly tackle the 
challenges and grow, and encouraging collaboration 
across various positions premised on maintaining 
positive labor / management relations, we will 
become a company with a global presence that 
contributes to realizing a sustainable society.

Kao’s creating value
To flexibly respond to changes and drive societal 
transformation, we are stepping up and promoting 
initiatives so that all employees are able to keep 
tackling the challenges that extend beyond divisions, 
position hierarchies and other boundaries and 
demonstrate the combined capabilities of the group 
to the maximum possible extent.

We are therefore making an effort to promote human 
capital development, career development, Diversity & 
Inclusion (D&I) so that we can attract talent with 
diverse background and all employees are able to 
demonstrate their characteristics and capabilities to 
the maximum possible extent.

Furthermore, reflecting our awareness of the fact that 
employees’ health represents not only a key 
foundation of each employee’s life but also an 
important asset for the company and a fundamental 
source of corporate growth, we are providing active 
support to encourage employees to look after their 
own health properly.

These initiatives encourage our employees to further 
exercise their creativity, and to provide even higher-
quality products and services.

Policies

At Kao, we believe that the diversity of our workforce 
and the efforts of each and every employee to pursue 
individual achievements by exercising his or her own 
abilities and characteristics to the utmost lead to growth 
as an organization and become combined capabilities of 
the company. Based on this concept, we aim to create 
such an environment and corporate culture.
 To achieve What Kao Aims to Be by 2030, we have 
established the following three policies, aiming to be 
an organization teeming with talent who are extremely 
ambitious and continue to tackle new challenges.

From equality to equity
We provide opportunities for all employees to 
challenge themselves.

From relative to absolute
We recognize, evaluate and reward the challenges 
undertaken by each person.

From standardization and conformity to diversity 
and self-reliance
We draw out unlimited individual features, 
characteristics and motivation.

In accordance with these policies, we will develop 
initiatives to encourage all employees to tackle the 
challenges and collaborate across positions, foster a 

corporate culture and develop human capital to lay 
the foundation for a highly specialized, diverse human 
capital to fully demonstrate their capabilities, and 
create an environment to realize effective and flexible 
work styles.
 Furthermore, we clearly state roles and 
responsibilities and endeavor to appropriately evaluate 
the contributions and challenges undertaken by each 
employee in order to provide fair evaluations and 
compensation without regard for employment status, 
gender or other individual attributes. Employee 
compensation is set at levels commensurate with our 
company capabilities and growth, and at levels 
ensuring market competitiveness through verification 
of external markets and other factors giving due 
consideration to the cost of living.

Education and promotion

Via our internal intranet, we provide an environment 
where our employees can always confirm our various 
policies and initiatives on human capital development. 
We are also working to ensure that these are 
disseminated as widely as possible, by sharing them 
with employees during a wide range of training 
activities, including training for employees who have 
just been appointed to managerial positions, and 
training for cultivating global leaders.
 In addition, we strive to foster understanding 

between senior management and employees by 
facilitating opportunities for mutual dialogue, with the 
objective of developing a sense of unity throughout 
the group.

We continuously promote these activities, and widely 
share and disseminate with our employees the direction 
the company is going and the issues we’re facing.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

We hold various activities involving the exchange of 
views and ideas between senior management and 
employees as opportunities for dialogue.
 We promote mutual understanding between senior 
management and employees by providing 
opportunities for the senior management to explain 
priority issues such as the company’s current situation, 
policies and human capital development to employees 
as well as responding to employees’ questions.
 In addition, by conducting the employee survey, job 
stress assessment and various employee 
questionnaires and studies on work styles, we establish 
an understanding of the genuine concerns and 
opinions of employees, which then feeds into ongoing 
measures to improve human capital development 
policies and the workplace environment, and increases 
our engagement with employees as well.

Platforms for regular dialogue with employees include 
Employee Welfare Committees at each worksite and 
branch, Employee–Management Meetings at every 
group company, and the Kao Forum for the group as 
a whole.
 The Kao Forum is held in both Japan and Europe, 
with employee representatives from Kao Corporation, 
Kao Group Customer Marketing Co., Ltd., Kao 
Professional Services Co., Ltd., Kao Sanitary Products 
Ehime Co., Ltd. and Kao Logistics Co., Ltd. 
participating in the Kao Forum in Japan.
 Meetings of the Employee Welfare Committee are 
conducted monthly, and the Employee–Management 
Meetings and Kao Forum are conducted twice a year. 
Continuous mutual information sharing on the 
content of the discussions and information shared at 
each meeting is implemented for all employees 
through the employee representatives and Employee 
Welfare Committees.

We share the company policies with the local union of 
Kao Corporation’s Wakayama Plant and Sakata Plant 
and the labor union of Kao Group companies and 
promote understanding through labor–management 
consultations, and thereby we reflect the views of 
employees in the management initiatives.
Note: Within the group as a whole, the percentage of employees that 
are union members is 43%.

Note: This figure excludes Kao Group member companies that do not 
track the number of employee union member. Due to information

Human capital development 102-8, 102-20, 404-2

After the Board of Directors discuss policies for human 
capital strategies, we discuss and deliberate on various 
issues and initiatives pertaining to human capital 
development and share our progress at the Human 
Capital Development Committee held monthly and whose 
members consist of top executives. In concrete terms, the 
committee discusses and deliberates on essential, newly 
established organizations and reorganization, the 
appointment and dismissal of key positions, plans for 
personnel and labor costs, and the establishment, 
modification and elimination of essential personnel 
initiatives, and conducts a review after implementing 
these changes, leading to further improvements.

In addition, to promote activities within the group in 
accordance with the Guidelines for Human Capital 
Development, we have introduced a framework that is 
shared and utilized globally. For example, we make use 
of human capital information via a global human 
capital information system. We also bolster our human 
capital management and development through 
Objectives and Key Results (OKR), the establishment 
of job ranking, evaluation and training systems and 
compensation policies that are shared globally.
 We pursue these activities under Senior Vice 
President of Human Capital Development in cooperation 
with the human capital development divisions of each 
group company, both within and outside Japan.
 Furthermore, we have set up human affairs 
functions within major divisions in Japan while also 

Human capital development structures

establishing on-site career coordinators who oversee 
the nurturing of each employee and provide 
assistance in career development.

Performance
Encouraging all employees to tackle major 
challenges and collaborate across positions
Introduction of OKR
We introduced OKR aiming to have all employees 
learn about other employees’ individual activities 
and to form one team where they learn from each 
other, help each other and rely on one another as 
well as to motivate each employee to be more 
willing to tackle major challenges.
 Since starting this in 2021, we have currently 
implemented it for all Kao Corporation employees 
and 95% of Kao Group employees in Japan. This is 
being phased in at the overseas companies of the 
group and in 2021 has been implemented for 54% 
of management.

Introduction of 0★1Kao
Since July 2021, we have been introducing the 0★1 
Kao program as a system to solicit new ideas from 
employees, with the objective of expanding 
employees’ prospects to go beyond the scope of 
the roles they are responsible for.
 The first idea meeting was held in October. At 
this meeting, employees proposed their own ideas 
directly to the President, most of which are 
approved for implementation. Thereafter, we hold 
idea meetings with each executive officer as needed.
 Close to 100 ideas have been received and there 
has been a lively exchange of ideas for their realization.

Career development and human capital development 
to lay the foundation for highly specialized, diverse 
human capital to fully demonstrate their capabilities
Support for career self-reliance and a variety 
of professional opportunities
We are committed to the existing initiatives on 
various forms of career development and support our 
diverse talent so that they can actively participate.
 In addition, we are expanding the placement of 
employees to government agencies and partner 
institutions for the industry with the objective of 
leveraging the skills and expertise of our employees 
to solve major issues working together as an entire 
society. As of the end of December 2021, 45 
employees were making effective use of the 
experience that they had accumulated within the 
Kao Group to play an active role outside the group.

Training to improve the level of management
We reviewed the training program for new managers 
(Managing Human Performance Program: MHPP). 
Along with the introduction of OKR, notably in this 
program we integrate target configurations for the 
major challenges, status updates and evaluations for 
the achievement of these targets, communication 
methods for feedback and role play. In 2021, 96% of 
employees of the targeted 312 employees participated. 
(To be conducted in 2022 for the 4% who were absent)
 To support the next generation of managers, 
we have developed liberal arts studies as a training 
program aimed at gaining a broader perspective, 

deeper insight and a new awareness of human 
perception. A total of 15 people (for a total of 285 
hours) have attended this program.

Introduction of on-demand program to support 
the growth of employees educating themselves
After introducing in 2020 an e-learning platform 
with a new concept that automatically gathers 
online learning content based on each employee’s 
individual interests and can easily be shared with 
other employees, we introduced and expanded an 
on-demand program in which employees can 
study topics such as digital transformation in-depth 
based on the responsibility of their job.

Support seminar to meet different career needs
Starting in 2017, we have implemented a 50+ Career 
Seminar for employees who have reached the age of 
50, in addition to the Life Career Design Seminar for 
employees who have reached the age of 45 and the 
Life Plan Seminar for employees in their late 50s.
 In FY2021, 42% of the target demographic 
attended the seminar, which received positive 
feedback with 96% of attendees rating their 
satisfaction as “very good” or “good.”

Expanding the scope for active participation 
by senior employees
We are working to expand the range of 
opportunities̶both within and outside the 
company̶for senior employees to utilize the

experience and specialist expertise that they have 
accumulated at Kao to remain active.
 In October 2021, we introduced the Special 
Mission Expert System with the objective of further 
expanding opportunities for the active participation of 
senior employees who have high-level expertise, skills 
and experience. These special experts, consisting of six 
fellows for special mission as of the end of December 
2021, are significantly contributing to business growth.

Creating an environment to realize effective 
and flexible work styles
Promotion of work styles not constrained by a 
specific time or location
We have continued to promote work styles that are not 
constrained by a specific time, such as the discretionary 
labor system for professional work and flextime.
 Due to the spread of COVID-19 in 2020, we 
have also been incorporating remote work such as 
teleworking and diversifying not only work hours 
but also locations and environments.
 At Kao Group companies in Japan 30 to 50% 
of employees were going in to the office in 2021, 
while at Kao Corporation this percentage was close 
to 30%, excluding the divisions where personnel 
are required to use equipment at R&D and 
manufacturing sites and other physical locations.

Initiatives to effectively leverage remote work
In working remotely, we have created an online 
environment and digitized various work processes 

for major meetings, business discussions, hiring 
and training, presentations and forums.
 In addition, we have been transforming the past 
layout of our offices that assumed work was done while 
physically there to one that encourages flexible work 
styles that better demonstrate employees’ creativity.

Dialogue with employees
Confirmation and response to the circumstances of 
the organization and employees based on surveys
We conducted activities that will lead to improvements 
via dialogue with the workplace and individual 
employees based on our analysis of the findings from 
the statutory job stress assessment implemented in 
Japan in compliance with Industrial Safety and Health 
Act.

Creation of opportunities for dialogue with 
employees online
In 2021, we conducted online opportunities for dialogue 
via Kao Group Employee–Management Meetings and 
Kao Forum twice̶in February and July for employees in 
Japan. At Kao Forum, 4 Kao senior managers and 
approximately 30 Kao Group employee representatives 
in Japan had a lively discussion and exchanged their 
opinions on a wide range of themes such as the Kao 
Group Mid-term Plan 2025 (K25), business and 
marketing strategies, ESG activities and new work styles.
 At the Kao Corporation’s Employee–
Management Meetings, over a dozen employee 
representatives and the Human Capital Development 

had a lively discussion under the themes of training 
systems, compensation systems and OKR.

The Kao European Forum was also conducted online 
in November and 17 representatives of employees 
throughout Europe participated in sharing business 
policies, exchanging their opinions on human capital 
development, and discussing future work styles.

Reviews of performance
Encouraging all employees to tackle major 
challenges and collaborate across positions
•  OKR has become a common language through 

which incentives to tackle major challenges and 
collaboration with other venues are initiated. 
Additionally, the 0★1 Kao program is garnering 
interest from employees, who continue to 
actively exchange their opinions and make 
suggestions, and has got off to a good start with 
incentives and a corporate culture to maximize 
the power and potential of employees. At the 
same time, since OKR and the 0★1 Kao program are at 
the implementation stage, we need to push forward 
initiatives to make maximum use of these frameworks 
in conjunction with implementing them at companies 
where they are yet to be introduced.

Human capital development 404-2

•  While the impact of COVID-19 put certain 
constraints on personnel transfers across 
countries and regions from 2020 to 2021, we 
continued to provide a variety of professional 
opportunities for all employees to actively develop 
their career. The opportunities for employees to 
demonstrate their unlimited capabilities and 
potential are expanding to various divisions within 
and outside the group and partner institutions. 
We believe that in the near future it will be 
necessary to more thoroughly grasp employees’ 
career aspirations from the perspective of the 
entire group as well as to enhance initiatives for 
assessing employees’ aptitude and developing 
their skills and careers over the long term.

•  We received many positive responses from 
participants at the training for new managers 
(MHPP), which included comments such as 
“Besides the objectives and affinity with OKR, I 
rediscovered the importance of the management 
cycle to encourage tackling the challenges and 
growth i.e., delegating (believing in your team 
members), being permissive (being receptive to 
challenges and allowing for failure) and being 
appreciative (appreciating others’ initiatives, 
praising their successes, and evaluating the 
challenges tackled and initiatives)” and “I learned 
about management and coaching which I can 
use in the future.” Going forward, we expect this 
to be a positive loop for workplace management.

Our liberal arts training also provides 
opportunities to expand scope of thought and to 
enhance different perspectives.

Creating an environment to realize effective 
and flexible work styles
•  The expansion of remote work fostered better 

cross-site communication. Additionally, in the 
internal questionnaire on remote work, we 
received positive feedback about how this 
allowed employees to use their time more 
efficiently, gave them a better work–life balance, 
enabled them to complete their daily work, 
management and communication without any 
issues and led to a revised work process.
 At the same time, there were concerns about a 
reduction in co-creation and ideas born from 
casual in-person conversations as well as isolation.
 Going forward, we will resolve these issues 
while promoting even more flexible work styles 
adapted to each position and role.

Dialogue with employees
•  The employee engagement survey Find, which has 

been conducted once every two years, significantly 
contributes to improved communication, improved 
work environments and other improvements based 
on employee feedback with the RPDCA cycle*, 
which encompasses responding to multifaceted 
questionnaires, thoroughly analyzing additional 
comments to determine how viable the power of 

the company and culture and organization capacity 
are, identifying issues, linking them to improvement 
actions in the workplace and verifying the results of 
these actions with the next survey.
 However, under the current circumstances in 
which employees’ values are diversifying and 
changing at a rapid speed, it is imperative to alter 
this format so that we can more quickly ascertain 
the situation and take measures. Going forward, 
we plan to implement the employee engagement 
survey in the new format in FY2022 while also 
integrating other surveys currently being 
conducted from the perspective of visualizing the 
circumstances of our employees and organization.

* RPDCA cycle
This adds “Research” (which equates to “analysis of the current situation”) 
to the PDCA cycle for operational improvement. Doing so has allowed us 
to strengthen our ability to respond to changing circumstances.

•  Strengthening opportunities for dialogue 
We are continuing to hold Kao Forum, Employee–
Management Meetings and labor–management 
consultations with labor unions to provide valuable 
opportunities to have direct dialogue between 
senior management and employee representatives. 
The K25 was started in 2021 and different views 
on new direction of the company and how to 
maximize the power and potential of employees 
have been actively exchanged. In the future, we 
will enhance its content such as the revisions to 
opportunities for dialogue and set themes so as to 
provide opportunities for more serious discussions 
between labor and management.

Human capital development 404-2

Promotion of initiatives to tackle 
major challenges and collaboration
Introduction of OKR
In OKR implemented since 2021, all employees 
specify the major challenges that they will tackle to 
realize an ideal society and company under the three 
main pillars of business contribution, ESG, and one 
team and my dream.
 This OKR for each employee is a framework in 
which all employees of the group can share and 
search for information and can freely communicate 
with all their colleagues via this system. This 
promotes collaboration across national borders, 
regions, jobs and positions.
 With the introduction of OKR, the performance 
evaluation system has been modified from focusing 
on past results to a framework emphasizing initiatives 
to tackle major challenges.
 We revised the CEO Awards and Division Awards 
aiming to further recognize and applaud the 
challenges taken through routine activities.
 At each Kao Group company and division, we 
implement an activity to share and recognize each 
other’s challenges (challenge sharing session) and 
revise this process so that employees are awarded for 
activities at each workplace. In addition, we also held 
communication events (e.g. lectures and study 
sessions) to foster a corporate culture that is willing to 
take on challenges.

Introduction of 0★1Kao
With 0★1 Kao implemented since July 2021, all our 
employees can freely make suggestions about new 
businesses, products and services as well as activities 
for internal structural reforms.
 These suggested ideas are shared with all our 
employees including top executives via online tools 
and can be discussed freely among various people 
there and receive advice, which contributes to 
deepening these ideas and creating a network that 
crosses boundaries.
 An idea meeting for top executives is held as 
needed, and we provide support for costs and 
workforce required for outstanding suggestions in 
order to make all our employees’ dream come true 
and advance society and the company.

Diverse career development

We are committed to the existing initiatives on various 
forms of career development and in 2021 continued 
to utilize “Self Education & Development Scheme 
(SeEDS) “ and the “Career coordinator system” to 
support our diverse talent so that they can succeed.

Skill and career development support
We develop “Self Education & Development Scheme 
(SeEDS)” and provide an opportunity once a year for 
individuals to report skills they obtained through their 

work and their desired career trajectory. These 
individual’s supervisors confirm the content of the 
report through interviews with employees, and in 
collaboration with career coordinators, move forward 
as planned to develop individual careers in terms of 
human capital development and “the right person in 
the right place.”

Career coordinator system
At Kao Group in Japan, we have appointed career 
coordinators in each division and company to further 
all employees’ skill and career development.
 The career coordinator transfers and places 
personnel within and outside the group based on 
career interviews, the content of the employees’ report 
for the “Self Education & Development Scheme” and 
the education plan from their supervisor as well as 
concentrates human capital in the new business called 
Another Kao and specific sectors to establish a 
foothold to realize the mid-term business plan.

Expanding the scope for active participation by 
senior human capital
Since 2016, Kao Corporation has held open 
recruitment for people aged 55 or over. We are 
implementing careful matching of human talent with 
positions, expanding the opportunities for senior 
citizens to use their experience, specialist expertise 
and other strengths to include not only positions 
within our company but also positions at non-profit or

non-governmental intermediary support organizations. 
In 2018, we set up a dedicated page on our intranet, 
which is used to disseminate relevant information and 
provide individual career consultations.
 In October 2021, Kao Corporation established the 
Special Mission Expert System in addition to the 
current senior partner system (reemployment system 
for people aged over 60). The Special Mission Expert 
System aims to further expand opportunities for the 
active participation of senior employees by assigning 
to them the necessary tasks to greatly contribute to 
our business growth based on their high-level 
expertise, skills and experience for up to five years 
after their mandatory retirement.

Assistance to meet different career needs
We hold training to foster a sense of career self-
reliance by having employees describe their ideal 
future for both their job and private life when they are 
45, 50 and 55 years old. Employees simultaneously 
create a future financial plan and clarify their own 
strengths and values, leading them to participate in 
various courses for reskilling. As in-person meetings 
are restricted with the prolonged COVID-19 
pandemic, we are implementing a counseling 
framework in which we can have scheduled 
interviews and easily discuss matters by utilizing 
online chatting and creating an environment for video 
conferencing.　

Human capital development 
programs

Revisions to new manager training
In the new manager training (MHPP), we added 
programs encompassing the introduction of OKR 
details and collaboration, challenges to be tackled, 
initiatives, and the sharing of opinions and information 
with the objective of encouraging the divisions in 
each company to take on greater challenges and 
strengthen collaborations. We also incorporated the 
maintenance of psychological safety and 
management theories which are essential for 
fostering a corporate culture that is willing to take on 
challenges. Going forward, in addition to the 
introductory training, we will provide follow-up 
training sessions to review, modify, and create an 
upward spiral for those taking MHPP, and hands-on 
experience.

Implementation of training programs during the 
COVID-19 crisis
Due to the spread of COVID-19 infections, face-to-
face trainings were put on hold in 2021 as well and 
various trainings were conducted online.
 The reviews received from participants indicate 
that the effectiveness of these trainings has been on 
par with the conventional face-to-face training, due to 
the incorporation of the latest online meeting tools 

and the expansion of preliminary and concluding 
topics, in addition to the selection of online training 
formats in accordance with the objectives, content 
and participants of each training program.

Providing employees with diversified 
development support
•  In-house trainers have been cultivated at individual 

Kao business locations, working with speed and 
attention to detail to ensure that all employees 
absorb the Kao Way and Kao’s emphasis on 
Integrity, and acquire necessary business skills.

•  By expanding opportunities for cross-industry 
exchange when employees are reaching milestones 
in their careers, and building networks to expand 
employees’ perspectives, we have provided 
enhanced stimulus for intellectually creative activity.

•  We also made effective use of new learning tools 
such as e-learning and other internet-enabled tools. 
Besides creating new learning environments in this 
way, we also actively supported employees’ own 
self-directed learning efforts.

Working-from-home system
In 2020, we took special measures for employees to 
work from home for any reasons, including childcare 
or family care, due to the spread of COVID-19 
infections. As we proceed with further dialogue and 
discussions on new work styles in the New Normal, 
since July 2021, we have expanded the working-from-
home system at Kao Group in Japan. Thereby, each 
division can select the most effective work style in 
accordance with their respective assignments.
 We are continuing to review new work styles for 
companies outside Japan.

Creating an environment to promote flexible 
work styles
As remote work expands and meetings and 
communications using web conferencing and 
business chat become more common, we are 
increasingly establishing new web conference areas 
and equipment inside the company in conjunction 
with revised office layouts.
 In addition, we are sharing information to 
encourage communication during remote work, to 
promote health and on systems that can be used via 
the internal intranet.
 It is more difficult to ascertain working conditions 
while telecommuting compared to work done inside 
the company, and therefore, as a measure for this, we 

are visualizing PC usage and creating a system to 
leverage in employment management at the 
workplace.

Improvement of dialogue with 
employees and engagement

Employee engagement survey and actions taken 
based on its results
We have implemented the action plan for 2021 based 
on the results obtained in the employee engagement 
survey Find that was implemented globally in 2018.
 Based on our analysis of the job stress 
assessment, we worked specifically on the key 
undertakings for workplaces where issues appear.

Review of employee engagement survey
This fiscal year, we considered reviewing employee 
engagement survey for maximizing the power and 
potential of employees.
 Going forward, we plan to implement the new 
employee engagement survey while also integrating 
other surveys that companies are currently 
implementing, concentrating on visualizing the 
circumstances of employees and the organization.
 To maximize the power and potential of 
employees, in addition to data on the circumstances 
of employees and the organization obtained via the 
new survey, we plan to use this along with a variety of 
data on the organization and human capital such as 

employment data to ascertain up-to-date 
circumstances in real time, identify issues, formulate 
and implement improvement measures for each 
problem through joint initiatives via dialogue between 
members and managers using OKR and dialogue with 
members of the Human Capital Development, which 
will ultimately create a better workplace and improve 
employee engagement.
 The new, revised employee engagement survey is 
scheduled to be implemented from FY2022.

Dialogue with employees
At Kao Forum for the group in Japan, senior 
management has a dialogue with employee 
representatives from each Kao Corporation business 
and employee representatives from the group 
companies. We had unconventional, lively dialogue in 
2021 by holding meetings online, not only could we 
have direct discussions, we could also use the chat 
function, and top executives answered questions from 
employee representatives not only during meeting but 
also afterwards.
 By providing a written response to the 75 themes 
that we were unable to discuss during the Kao 
Corporation Employee–Management Meetings, we 
answered most of our employees’ questions and 
worked to boost engagement.
 The details of these discussions and dialogues are 
broadly disseminated and shared to our employees 
via the company website and the Employee Welfare 
Committee at their worksite.

Initiatives to reform 
organizational culture 
through the introduction of 
OKR

Employees’ voice

After establishing themes to promote an understanding 
and implementation of OKR (i.e. getting more familiar, 
setting OKRs, having dialogues, getting connected etc.) 
and developing various Japanese and English-language 
contents (e.g. interviews, PR videos, various guides) on 
the portal site, we held different types of seminars.

As seen in the testimonials from employees, the 
introduction of OKR appears to be effective. They left 
comments such as, “I feel empowered by being able to 
express and work on my dream,” “In promoting OKR, I 
have come to understand what the meaning of OKR is, 
such as the importance of expressing my aspirations and 
collaboration to achieve them,” and “I could gain a better 
understanding of the role that the management cycle of 
delegating, welcoming challenges, dialogue and 
appreciation plays and how significant it is.”

Going forward, we will plan to disseminate various 
content and to hold round table talks encouraging tackling 
the challenges and collaboration to instill OKR and 
maximize its use. We will also continue implementing 
activities to instill OKR throughout the group.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
Social values and lifestyles are undergoing significant 
changes and are diversifying. In addition, business 
has become globalized, economic and social 
uncertainty has increased. Nowadays as people with 
diverse backgrounds and values are becoming 
consumers and employees, such as Generation Z who 
are said to have newer values compared to older 
generations, people’s mindset about work and life and 
employees’ expectations for their company are 
changing based on thinking that is unconstrained by 
things previously taken for granted.
 In these circumstances, it is essential to actively 
approach these social changes by creating an 
environment and corporate culture where diverse 
employees feel motivated to work by actively 
developing Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) promotion 
activities as a fundamental activity for human capital 
development in order to create continuous corporate 
growth.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
At workplaces where it is a challenge for diverse 
employees to feel motivated to work, employee 
engagement subsides, and it becomes harder to retain 
the employees who are the invaluable treasure of the 

We firmly believe that the vitality and synergy derived from diversity drives our business developments. We therefore strive to create an environment and 
culture where each of our employees is able to maximize their capabilities and individuality, and both individuals and company can develop.

company and hire new outstanding employees. 
Furthermore, homogeneous organizations that do not 
embrace diversity and especially organizations that lack 
diversity including female employees in decision-making 
positions will be unable to adeptly and flexibly respond 
to societal changes and will struggle to contribute to 
their sustainable corporate growth. In recent years, 
along with the increased interest in sustainability of the 
world, interest in corporate D&I promotion activities for 
employees is growing around the world and its 
importance as a basis for investment is also increasing. 
In the midst of this, if we do not sufficiently implement 
D&I promotion activities to leverage this diversity and 
furthermore promote the advancement of female 
employees which is an aspect of diversity related to 
most of our workforce, this could pose a risk to our 
corporate growth, which may lead to reputation risks.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
By deeply ingraining D&I at Kao Group and realizing 
inclusive and diverse workplaces that leverage each 
person’s true diversity extending beyond simple 
demographics, we will attract and retain outstanding 
talent with diverse backgrounds in the company and 
ensure that they stay motivated and are able to 
demonstrate their capabilities. Consequently, new 
business creation is expected to be revitalized leading 
to products and services that meet the needs of 
societal changes and the diversification of people’s 

values, and the productivity of our business activities 
conducted by each employee is expected to be 
strengthened by increasing employee engagement. 
Thereby, further growth as a company is anticipated, 
leading to improved ratings from society at large and 
investors and enabling us to help increase the societal 
momentum of D&I.

Kao’s creating value
In our changing society, it is necessary to bring 
together various ideas based on a wider background to 
provide products and services that are always useful 
for consumers who have different values in differing 
circumstances worldwide. Therefore, it is also essential 
to foster an environment and culture that attracts 
employees with diverse backgrounds and where they 
can sufficiently demonstrate their capabilities. We 
conduct D&I promotion activities to achieve this.
 These activities allow our diverse employees to 
demonstrate their capabilities, make new value 
creation possible based on diverse ideas and 
innovation, and enable us to provide products and 
services that help consumers and customers lead an 
enriched life far into the future.

Policies

We stipulate in the Kao Way, our corporate philosophy, 
that we create inclusive workplaces where every person 
can develop their potential as a professional and a 
human being, that we treat everyone we encounter with 
respect and openness, and that we embrace the world’s 
diversity of cultures, nationalities, beliefs, races, genders, 
identities and abilities and respect and value all people in 
our organization, our business partners and the 
communities we serve, just as they are.
 Moreover, we aim to make diversity our strength and 
contribute to society to become a company that 
continues to grow sustainably in our changing society. 
This means that we aim to be an organization that can 
produce new value by bringing together diverse ideas 
created by our employees demonstrating their unique 
capabilities.
 Therefore, as part of our diversity promotion activities, 
we will retain our workforce in an environment that is 
work-friendly for all our diverse talent, including female 
employees and provide the necessary support to provide 
opportunities equitably. As part of our inclusion promotion 
activities, we will implement education and awareness-
raising activities to foster a culture where all employees 
understand D&I envisioned by Kao and can individually 
put them into practice as well as one where each 
employee feels comfortable to communicate their own 
opinions and can discuss ideas in an unbiased 
environment. In doing so, we aim to become a team with 
diversity, respect each other as individuals, incorporate 
different perspectives and ideas, and transform them into 
the power of our organization, and also aim to create an 

environment where each individual can maximize their 
own capability and individuality.

Education and promotion

In order to make diversity a source of power for our 
organization, we are spreading awareness of the meaning 
of D&I, and providing the knowledge and information 
needed to put it into practice. We conduct training for 
management, who have an important role to play here, 
especially in terms of emphasizing the value of diversity, 
and we implement educational activities for employees 
working with others who are in difficult situations. We 
broadly publicize positive examples of D&I inside the 
company and D&I related activities via intranet with the 
objective of our employees viewing this as relevant to 
them and recognizing the importance of taking initiative. 
Furthermore, to be an organization where employees can 
demonstrate their unique capabilities, we are introducing 
training to deepen all employees’ understanding of 
psychological safety and unconscious bias as a base and 
build the skills to appropriately put this into action. We 
receive feedback from the participants at all activities 
through questionnaires and incorporate our employee 
comments in our activities by reflecting these opinions in 
the next activities.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

Proactive collaboration with NPOs, government agencies 

and other companies promoting D&I is essential to 
encourage understanding and improve awareness of D&I 
inside and outside the Kao Group.
 In supporting balancing work and childcare, for ten 
years, we have endeavored to change mindsets of our 
employees who are raising children in collaboration with 
the NPO, Fathering Japan, which advances initiatives to 
increase the number of happy fathers who can address 
various social issues. For women’s empowerment, the 
President and Chair participated in and discussed issues 
at the 30% Club Japan and the Group of Male Leaders 
Who Will Create a Society in Which Women Shine, an 
initiative organized by the Gender Equality Bureau of the 
Cabinet Office. Kao Corporation’s D&I, HCD is 
implementing initiatives for women’s empowerment 
inside and outside the Kao Group in collaboration with 
other companies through activities with the secretariat’s 
team. In 2021, we newly participated in G20 EMPOWER 
as an advocate company and will further enhance our 
initiatives in the future by collaborating globally with 
other companies and experts. Furthermore, we 
announced our support for The Valuable 500, an 
international initiative established to get companies 
playing a leading role in building an environment in 
which people with disabilities can participate actively in 
business, society and the economy in general, etc., and 
are striving to promote these activities and increase their 
societal momentum. In addition to these activities, we 
also have participated as a member of the study groups 
of government agencies and various organizations, 
giving corporate case study presentations at lectures and 
seminars and arranging tours of our special subsidiary, 
etc.

Mid- to long-term targets
To make diversity our strength, we aim to develop an 
inclusive organizational culture where employees 
demonstrate their unique capabilities and integrate 
them to produce new value. Moreover, to incorporate 
diverse perspectives in a variety of corporate decision-
making, we hire talent from diverse backgrounds and 
encourage their participation, and as one indicator of 
this, we aim to have the same percentage of female 
managers as the percentage of total female 
employees.
 Thereby, we implement activities to formulate Kao 
Group’s D&I vision and instill it globally, awareness-
raising activities to ensure all employees understand 
each other’s diverse backgrounds and properly 
conduct themselves and initiatives to gain a deeper 
understanding of psychological safety and 
unconscious bias as part of our inclusion promotion 
activities. In addition, as part of our diversity 
promotion activities, we strive to conduct human 
capital development from a D&I perspective and to 
advance the participation of women, LGBTQ+ and 
non-Japanese employees, people with disabilities, 
and people with childcare or family care 
responsibilities.
 To check our progress on the mid- to long-term 
targets, we are reassessing our employees’

awareness of “an inclusive organizational culture” and 
continuing to measure the percentage of female

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-

Business impacts
We can provide better products and services based 
on diverse ideas and innovation, which will lead to 
corporate growth. By increasing employee 
engagement, we can strengthen the productivity of 
our business activities conducted by each employee. 
By being a more attractive company, we will improve 
employee retention and competitiveness as an 
employer, which will lower recruitment costs.

Social impacts
We will raise D&I awareness by society as a whole 
through the expansion of D&I in business. Consumers 
will achieve an enriched lifestyle through our provided 
products and services that meet the expectation of 
their diverse values.

Performance in 2021

Performance
Kao Group in Japan
Inclusion promotion activities
We created a video message about our envisioned 
D&I, drafted introductory articles on positive 
examples of D&I inside the company and related 
activities so that employees grasp how D&I is 
relevant to them and put it in action, and created 
an awareness-raising video to encourage further 
understanding of diverse backgrounds, all of which 
were then disseminated company-wide employees 
via intranet. In addition, we implemented seminars 
as new initiatives to gain a deeper understanding 
of psychological safety and unconscious bias, 
which are integral for becoming an inclusive 
organization. We broadcast the recordings of these 
seminars about psychological safety to company-
wide employees. We conduct questionnaires for 
viewers and participants of all activities to clarify 
their merits and areas that need improvement by 
analyzing the scores (e.g. usefulness or clarity of 
content) and comments in these questionnaires 
and use these findings in the next activities.

Diversity promotion activities
To promote human capital development from a 
D&I perspective at every division and affiliated 

company, we provided data on D&I to each 
division and affiliated company, verified the 
implementation of the Diversity Promotion Plan 
and reconfigured the plan.
 As part of our efforts to enhance our training of 
female employees for women’s empowerment, we 
implemented round table talks with female 
executive officers (Women’s Career Café), career 
panel discussions and at KCMK Group, a diversity 
promotion project.
 At Kao Corporation, we held LGBTQ+ study 
sessions about promoting the participation of 
LGBTQ+ employees for all members of Human 
Capital Development to help create an employee-
friendly workplace.
 We conducted interviews with the relevant 
parties to promote the participation of non-
Japanese employees and implemented special 
measures allowing them to visit their home 
countries during the COVID-19 pandemic based on 
the feedback given in those interviews.
 Continuing our activities to promote 
normalization for the advancement of people with 
disabilities, we released materials to promote 
better understanding of disabilities and promoted 
collaboration with Vocational Life Consultants for 
Persons with Disabilities.

 To support childcare, we continued holding 
online seminars for employees returning from 
childcare leave, revised the relevant procedures 
from pregnancy to childbirth, childcare and 
reinstatement intended for employees to take their 
desired childcare leave and for seamless 
operations at the workplace, and drafted 
guidelines that cover information on proper 
workplace communication.
 To support family care, we broadly publicized 
the family care handbooks with awareness-raising 
videos and continued to hold online seminars on 
balancing work and family care started last year.

Kao Group in Americas and EMEA
Inclusion promotion activities
At Americas, we share a different Diversity and 
Inclusion topic each month with employees 
sharing their own personal stories of how they 
overcame challenges of discrimination with a 
monthly column on the intranet, as well as during 
the monthly communications meeting. Throughout 
the year, external speakers have been invited to 
speak to employees and answer questions to help 
promote an inclusive workplace by strengthening 
understanding and awareness. In addition,

sessions were conducted to provide 
understanding of key concepts of bias and how it 
manifests at work, as well as how to recognize 
and address manifestations of racism. Employee 
Resource Group (ERG) continued activities to 
address the needs of specific employee 
populations, such as women and young 
professionals, while guided by Human Capital 
Development. 
 At EMEA, we conducted D&I surveys and 
genba listening tours of our employees with the 
support of external experts, which will form the 
basis of our D&I promotion activities in 2022. To 
raise awareness about the barriers to inclusion, we 
implemented training on unconscious bias and 
held D&I awareness coffee chats around “Pride” 
(LGBTQ community) and “Anti-racism” (EMEA 
BAME* employee group).
* BAME: Black, Asian and minority ethnic

Diversity promotion activities
At EMEA, we advanced the participation of female 
employees by continuing to provide mentoring to 
support career development to become top 
managers. In 2021, we started new mentorships 
for 20 people.
 In group companies in the U.K., we posted job 

opportunities on job boards focused on attracting 
talent from the LGBTQ+, black and ethnic minority 
and disabled communities, and implemented 
initiatives to increase the diversity of our 
organization.

Reviews of performance
Since 2020, we have continued to focus on 
educational activities to help employees grasp 
how D&I is relevant to them aiming to foster an 
inclusive organizational culture. As a result, we 
could disseminate D&I information more 
frequently to our employees and ultimately change 
their mindsets since most of the employees who 
viewed this information gained a better 
understanding of D&I and considered how to 
reflect this in their daily activities. Specifically, we 
secured the understanding of top management on 
the concepts of psychological safety and 
unconscious bias and their importance. While it is 
important that globally all employees fully 
understand this and can apply these concepts, 
this is not sufficient in this regard. We are pushing 
forward further initiatives to foster an inclusive 
organizational culture so that not just employees 
who are sensitive to D&I but all employees, 
including those who are indifferent to these issues 

at present, are genuinely convinced of their 
importance and apply D&I in their day-to-day 
work.
 We were able to work on initiatives for the 
different issues pertaining to diversity promotion 
activities. In addition to these current initiatives for 
women’s empowerment, we collaborated with 
female executives to implement new initiatives to 
raise women’s awareness of how to become 
leaders conducted in different formats, such as 
small round table talks and panel discussions, 
which were able to change the mindsets of 
participants. In 2022, we will further expand the 
scope of these initiatives.

Diversity promotion activities

We implement diversity promotion activities aiming to 
foster an environment and corporate culture where 
diversity in the organization is improved and all 
employees are given opportunities equitably and can 
demonstrate their unique capabilities.

Human capital development from a D&I 
perspective (Kao Group in Japan)
We thoroughly promote, hire, evaluate and educate 
employees based on their individual ability regardless 
of other attributes. We set target values for selecting 
core human capital according to the composition of 
the workforce, and we are steadily implementing 
selecting and development regardless of personal 
attributes. Human capital meetings conducted by 
executive officers engage in discussions while 
confirming that women are included among the 
candidates for senior positions.
 We continued to hold diversity promotion 
meetings, which were newly established in 2020 to 
clarify issues for D&I at each division and group 
companies in Japan and steadily address these issues 
(however, these were only held at divisions that 
request them in FY2021) and shared new information 
with figures on D&I so that we can independently 
review and conduct activities at each organization. In 
conjunction with this, we verify the implementation of 
our action plan drafted last year and formulate further 
promotion plans. In the future, these figures on D&I 
will continue to be shared to measure changes 

Our initiatives

overtime and the diversity promotion meetings will be 
implemented as a place for regular exchange between 
Kao Corporation’s D&I, HCD and each organization, 
enhancing human capital development from a D&I 
perspective within the entire Kao Group.

Women’s empowerment (Kao Group in Japan)
We promote women’s empowerment as one aspect of 
diversity that is related to most of our workforce. As a 
result of our analysis, we believe that it is important to 
enhance the pipeline, especially the managers class, in 
order to increase the percentage of women in decision-
making positions. Thereby, we are committed to 
providing development for human capital to be 
promoted, support for childcare so that our employees 
feel motivated to work and management training to 
achieve unbiased career development and advancement.
 For career development, we mainly provide 
opportunities to participate in leadership training 
sponsored by external women’s organizations (NPOs 
and Public Interest Incorporated Associations), host 
round table talks with female executives and seminars 
to encourage female employees to perceive their own 
unconscious biases and change their professional 
mindset, and provide opportunities to participate in 
different cross-industry study sessions independently 
organized and run by female executives in 
collaboration with executives at other companies. This 
ultimately improves employees’ career motivation, 
expands their perspectives, and allows them to learn 
and network through collaboration with the members 
of other corporations.

Women’s Career Café (Kao Corporation)
We held small round table talks with female executives 
inside the company, Women’s Career Café, aiming for 
female employees to discover their forward-looking 
ambitions to become leaders fostering a professional 
mindset as well as to grasp the challenges that they face 
(both on an individual and organizational level). This activity 
garnered a high degree of satisfaction from participants and 
was able to change their mindset. One participant stated, 
“Being able to hear these talks from veterans in business 
and female leaders from the same generation spurred me 
into action and made me feel more positive about my career 
as well.” Another mentioned, “I got tips to advance my 
career that made me interested in training myself to think 
from the perspective of a leader.” From FY2022, we will 
continue to expand the scope of these activities.

Career panel discussion (Research and 
Development, Kao Corporation)
We held career panel discussions in which female 
executives were panelists initially for the Research and 
Development, which has many female members but 
few female managers, aiming to transform mindsets so 
that a wider range of female employees become 
leaders. These discussions were able to change the 
mindsets of participants. For instance, one commented, 
“Because I’m a woman, I felt the pressure that I had to 
plot out my career path on my own, but I’m relieved 
that there’s another approach to flexibly advance my 
career.” Another one stated, “I would like to find more 
possibilities for myself leveraging my unique insight as 
a woman without being restricted by my gender.”

Diversity promotion project (KCMK Group)
A project is in progress to drive forward the training of 
female employees as one of our strategies for 
diversity promotion to create an organizational culture 
where our talent from diverse backgrounds are able to 
demonstrate their creativity. Employees participate in 
round table talks with executives and retired female 
employees and major meetings. We also have lively 
group discussions with the next generation of leaders 
to lead to employees’ personal growth. The project 
leaders strive to concretely tackle challenges as the 
pioneers and diving force of KCMK transformation 
and lead the next generation of human capital.

Mentoring programs (EMEA)
In Europe, mentoring has been used since 2014 as a 
successful tool to support the career development of 
talented employees to a higher management level. We can 
ensure that know-how transfer, corporate knowledge, 
networking and succession planning are properly 
managed and actively perceived as adding value by 
successful managers. Women in particular are encouraged 
to pursue the mentoring route and further their career to 
senior management levels. We launched a new mentoring 
cycle in 2021 with 20 mentoring relationships. 

Gender pay indicators
The gender pay gap (calculated on the basis of average 
annual salary, defined as base salary + other cash 
incentives) is one indicator of women’s advancement, and 
is 89.7% for managers and 96.1% for non-managers at 
Kao Group globally. In addition, the annual average 

amount of remuneration for men and women at Kao 
Corporation (data assurance performed by a third party) is 
shown on p. 219. We believe that this gap is due to the 
higher percentage of men among employees with longer 
service years, who tend to earn higher salaries, as well as 
among employees in higher-paying job groups, especially 
in Japan, since there is no established wage gap between 
male and female employees in the same roles. Therefore, 
as part of our policy to eliminate the gender pay gap, we 
will continue to take steps to further improve our retention 
of female employees through our initiatives to advance 
women’s participation in the workplace and appropriately 
increase the percentage of women who are managers, 
senior managers and executives to be in line with the 
percentage of total female employees.

LGBTQ+ employees’ advancement (Kao Group in Japan)
To promote employee understanding of LGBTQ+ 
issues, we published basic information on our D&I 
portal site so that employees may refer to them at any 
time. In 2021, we broadcast awareness-raising videos 
about LGBTQ+ related changes in Japanese society as 
well as coming out and outing, which improved our 
employees’ understanding of LGBTQ+ related issues, 
prompting comments such as “I could apply this to 
my own work” and “I found it a valuable resource 
because I had never anticipated coming out.”
 In addition, we are continuing recruitment for 
ALLY*, where 478 employees have made statements 
in support of it to date (as of December 2021). 
Employees who make an ALLY declaration are issued 
with special straps which they are encouraged to 

wear.
* ALLY

Participants are people who express understanding and are supportive 
of LGBTQ+ people.

LGBTQ+ study sessions (Human Capital 
Development, Kao Corporation)
We hosted LGBTQ+ study sessions for all members of 
Human Capital Development, aiming to ensure that the 
staff dealing with personnel acquire the correct information 
and use it in their day-to-day work in order to create an 
employee-friendly workplace for LGBTQ+ employees. At 
these sessions, the speakers communicated issues that 
LGBTQ+ employees often face at the workplace and 
explained considerations for language use and how to 
address these issues from the perspective of providing 
support for employees. In addition, ahead of others in the 
company, the restrooms used primarily by members of the 
Human Capital Development were made available to 
employees in the gender they self-identify as, providing an 
opportunity to consider creating a workplace where 
LGBTQ+ employees can work with greater peace of mind.

LGBTQ+ lecture (Kao Beauty Brands Counseling)
Since 2020, LGBTQ+ lectures have continued to be 
held as part of Advanced Master Training to learn 
more about practical customer service. Lectures 
contained group work with lively discussions on how 
to better serve in store customers. In addition, we are 
making efforts to improve our environment by creating 
a place for information exchange and interaction with 
LGBTQ+ employees utilizing online conference tools 
and the exchange of various opinions.

Promoting the participation of non-Japanese employees
Interviews with parties concerned (Kao Corporation)
We conducted individual interviews for all interested 
non-Japanese employees employed at Kao Corporation to 
identify the challenges that these non-Japanese employees 
with different languages and cultures face while working 
in Kao Group in Japan. We were able to identify their 
strong work motivations, extensive challenges they faced 
including career development and the uncertainties and 
inconveniences during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 
future, we will promote the participation of non-Japanese 
employees and foster multicultural collaboration by 
pushing forward initiatives for each of these challenges.

Homecoming support during COVID-19 pandemic (Kao 
Group in Japan excluding some affiliated companies)
In these interviews with the relevant parties, many 
individuals brought up that they were unable to visit 
their home countries for several years due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we implemented 
special measures to provide support to non-Japanese 
employees in visiting their home countries by permitting 
teleworking from quarantine facilities during the 
quarantine period when entering other countries as part 
of their measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Promoting the participation of employees with disabilities
We position support for people with disabilities as an 
important part of our D&I efforts, and have formulated a basic 
policy of “Striving for a society where people with and without 
disabilities work and live together, we create workplace 
environments for employees with disabilities that make life 

easier for them and foster a sense of pride in one’s work.”

Promoting normalization
•  Every year, we administer a questionnaire to 

employees with disabilities, asking about the current 
status of their disability and any problems they may 
be experiencing at work and work with internal 
stakeholders to help resolve any issues.

•  We also assign Vocational Life Consultants for Persons 
with Disabilities to worksites nationwide to conduct 
consultations for employees with disabilities. We hold 
an Employees with Disabilities Support Meeting once 
each year to help the consultants upgrade their skills 
and strengthen the overall support system for persons 
with disabilities. In 2021, a total of 23 Vocational Life 
Consultants for Persons with Disabilities participated 
throughout Japan and shared the employment issues 
that people with disabilities have at the workplace and 
some solutions. We received feedback from many 
participants indicating that this was a good reference 
when responding at their own workplaces, which will 
ultimately improve the quality of employee support.

•  We prepared a Disabled Person Employment Manual 
and a Communication Sheet and distributed them on 
our D&I portal site to promote mutual understanding 
among employees with disabilities and their colleagues.

•  We introduced UD Talk voice-recognition application 
to support communication with employees who have 
hearing impairments. We are continuing to introduce 
and apply voice recognition tools such as UD Talk and 
live captions for Microsoft Teams inside the company.

•  For prospective employees with disabilities, we provide 

information about the support that the company 
provides for employees with disabilities before they 
join the company, and by confirming in advance what 
support each employee will need, we help to reduce 
worry for these employees after they join the company.

•  We periodically hold seminars, tours of our special 
subsidiary and other events for all employees to 
increase understanding of disabilities. In 2021, we 
drafted materials to better understand disabilities 
and released them on the D&I portal site.

•  The Wasa Welfare Factory was established in April of 
1993 as a place supporting financial and mental 
independence as well as social participation, providing 
work to people with disabilities along with lifestyle 
guidance and health management, in cooperation with 
medical institutions and under Wakayama City and 
Wakayama Prefecture guidance and subsidies. In 
2020, we acquired it from Sumiya Social Welfare 
Corporation in Wakayama City, and are handling its 
operation as the Kao Wakayama Plant (Wasa Group 
Production) now. Currently a total of 26 employees, 
including 21 with disabilities, fill smaller sized bottles 
of shampoo and conditioner as well as an assortment 
of Kao travel sets.

M2M Project (KCMK Group)
We are promoting activities for the M2M Project 
(minority⇔majority) aimed at generating a vitality of diversity 
by encouraging employees with disabilities to express 
themselves. Our employees with disabilities formulate and 
disseminate their plan to promote better understanding of 
disabilities under the theme of “For accurate knowledge and

proper understanding.” We had enthusiastic responses from 
employees who participated, wondering what the best 
practices for communication were and what they can do at 
stores handling customers with disabilities. Furthermore, we 
are showing how employees with disabilities participate at 
the workplace by launching a place for communication with 
employees with disabilities called Kokokara, holding round 
table talks with employees with disabilities and proactively 
publishing related content in the company newsletter.

Measures implemented at special subsidiaries (Kao Peony)
Kao Peony Co., Ltd., a special subsidiary, has actively 
employed persons with severe disabilities, primarily persons 
with intellectual disabilities, since it was established in 2005, 
and the Production Division has achieved the same 
production rates as those on lines operated by persons 
without disabilities. The Office Support Division, established 
in 2017 has been working to expand the scope of its 
business activities and employment. As of January 2022, a 
total of 80 employees work at Kao Peony, including 61 with 
disabilities. In 2021, despite the continued impacts of 
COVID-19 since 2020, we have held activities while 
considering work styles with both divisions. In particular, 
the Office Support Division has promoted diversification 
through activities such as those introduced below.

New challenges (Kao Peony)
Collaborating with the GENKI Project, we supported 
reception work at session venues using the avatar robot, 
OriHime. The members remotely controlled the OriHime 
robot from the Kayabacho Office to check the physical 
condition and the temperature of the participants, and 

guided them into the room, which was well received by the 
participants. (Serving about 320 customers in 4 locations)
 In collaboration with RecyCreation, we created 
exhibitions using Okaeri-blocks sent to stores for two 
businesses that placed collection boxes. This was featured in 
many media interviews, and we have received enthusiastic 
feedback from these businesses that they could visually 
showcase collected and recycled pouches.
 For the Pink Ribbon Campaign, we planned, proposed 
and created origami works as part of our continued 
awareness-raising activities inside the company started 
last year. We created two curtains using 7,000 origami 
cranes and exhibited them at two worksites in Kayabacho 
and Sumida. We have received feedback from employees 
who saw the origami cranes, commenting on how the 
message was conveyed through this work.

Participation in international initiatives
In 2019, Kao Corporation President signed a declaration 
for the approach and initiatives of The Valuable 500, an 
international initiative established to get companies 
playing a leading role in building an environment in 
which people with disabilities can participate actively in 
business, society and the economy in general, etc.
 In 2021, we worked to provide information by 

responding to a global survey for companies who 
joined The Valuable 500 and compiled useful case 
studies.

Employment rate of persons with disabilities 
(Kao Group in Japan)
Currently, persons with disabilities account for 2.60% of 
the total workforce of the Kao Group in Japan, 
exceeding the statutory minimum rate (as of June 2021).

Support for childcare
Under the basic policy for work–life balance support 
aimed at providing support so that each employee 
can fully demonstrate their motivation and skills and 
participate in the workplace while balancing work and 
their personal life, we are creating an environment 
and fostering a corporate culture with the expectation 
that our employees are able to balance their work and 
family life with an easy mind through every life stage 
from the employee’s or their partner’s pregnancy and 
childbirth to childcare and continue to have the 
motivation and capabilities to actively participate in 
the company.

Revised procedures from pregnancy to childcare 
leave and reinstatement
In line with the successive amendment of the Act on 
Childcare Leave, Caregiver Leave, and Other Measures for 
the Welfare of Workers Caring for Children or Other Family 
Members as of April 2022, we revised our procedures 
throughout the process from employees’ or their partners’ 

pregnancy to taking childcare leave and reinstatement 
intended for the relevant employee to take their desired 
childcare leave, and for continuing seamless operations at 
the workplace. In addition, with expert advice, we drafted 
guidelines for the relevant parties and their supervisors 
that contains details the necessary procedures for every 
stage and provides information on proper workplace 
communication. In the future, we will spread these 
guidelines intended for employees to stay motivated to 
work by establishing a work–life balance framework by 
taking childcare leave adjusted to their unique situations.

Seminars for employees returning from childcare leave 
(Tatsuno-oshigoto Seminars) (Kao Group in Japan)
Each year, we conduct seminars for employees 
regardless of gender who are about to return to work 
after having taken over one month of childcare leave 
(Tatsuno-oshigoto Seminars) at Kao Group companies in 
Japan. In addition to encouraging partner participation 
and helping employees prepare their attitudes and raise 
their awareness regarding reinstatement, these 
seminars communicate the importance of building 
cooperative relationships with partners and family both 
in family life and career development. Since 2021, we 
also conducted lectures and group work which were the 
same as the in-person versions via live stream with 
online conference tools. This contains substantial 
content which attained a high level of satisfaction 
leading to improvement in the participants’ awareness 
of reinstatement, with one participant commenting, 
“This was a good opportunity to discuss and think more 
about work styles and my future life with my family.”

Awareness-raising videos to promote paternity 
leave (Kao Group in Japan)
The understanding and support of the workplace is 
important for male employees to take paternity leave 
when their children are born. We used awareness-
raising videos to provide information to acquire the 
knowledge and skills so that other employees can 
lend a hand and take concrete actions. This leads to 
improved manager awareness in relation to paternity 
leave. There was feedback about how useful the 
practical examples to encourage taking leave was and 
how participants wanted to make an environment 
where childcare leave is accessible.

Paternity leave panel discussion (KCMK Group)
We held a panel discussion to encourage male 
employees to take paternity leave. Experienced 
employees who took leave and their supervisors took 
to the stage and discussed how they got the 
understanding from people inside and outside the Kao 
Group, how to handle a request for leave from a 
member of one’s team, and what should be done to 
encourage employees to take childcare leave in the 
future. This was a good opportunity for employees 
who participated to gain new insight. Participants left 
comments, such as “It was easy to understand 
because I can feel the passion of the panelists' 
experiences” and “it was helpful that this allowed me 
understand how my supervisor feels.” There was also 
feedback stating that “it would be interesting to have 
discussions in small groups or something like that.”

Main support for balancing work and 
childcare responsibilities
•  Conducting pre- and post-maternity / paternity leave 

interviews
•  Encouraging communication between employees on 

maternity / paternity leave and their workplace 
supervisors using maternity / paternity leave reports

•  Holding seminars for employees returning from maternity 
/ paternity leave (Tatsuno-oshigoto Seminars)

•  Provision of an on-site day care facility (Merries Garden)
•  Distributing a leaflet with information on systems that 

support the life–work balance targeting male employees
•  Conducting a survey about men’s childcare roles
•  Diversity Management e-learning (for managers)

External evaluation of childcare support measures
In 2016, Kao Corporation was awarded Platinum 
Kurumin certification for creating a supportive 
workplace for employees with children, in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for Measures to Support 
the Development of the Next Generation. Kanebo 
Cosmetics, KCMK and Kao Logistics were respectively 
awarded Kurumin certifications in 2009, 2011 and 2019.

Support for family care
In accordance with our fundamental policies of 
enabling each individual to act independently and 
providing assistance based on a spirit of mutual 
support, we are taking measures to educate employees 
and to promote mutual understanding in the workplace 
with the aim of preventing employees from leaving 
work the cause of family care obligations. In 2021 we 
held an online seminar for employees nationwide 
(approximately 240 participants). This was highly rated 
by the participants who left comments about how they 
learned specific steps to prepare for family care, that 
the instructor’s lecture was based on real-world 
experiences and easy to understand, and how relieved 
they felt that there were many other people in similar 

situations. In addition, we delivered a recording of this 
seminar, for those who could not attend.
 We also undertake the provision of information 
including introduction of family care handbooks, and 
provide consultation services where appropriate.

Inclusion promotion activities

We implement inclusion promotion activities aimed at 
having all employees understand our envisioned D&I 
and developing the skills, environment and culture 
where employees unlock the value of their diversity as 
a source of power for the organization.

Popularization of the vision to promote D&I 
We delved deeper into discussions about Kao Group’s 

D&I promotion vision so that all employees understand 
our envisioned D&I and exemplify this concept. In the 
future, we will exchange opinions globally and push 
forward activities to instill the D&I vision as the Kao 
Group’s global vision in our employees.
 We produced and broadcast a concept movie 
entitled “What is Diversity & Inclusion?” to provide 
tips for every employee to perceive D&I as relevant to 
them and put these concepts into practice.

Fostering an inclusive organizational culture 
We continue to disseminate information via the portal 
site to provide a foundation for inclusion promotion 
activities at Kao Group in Japan. Our key content 
consists of broadcasting awareness-raising videos, 
holding internal seminars and events, and sharing 
positive examples from inside the company on different 
themes pertaining to women, LGBTQ+ and non-
Japanese employees, people with disabilities, and those 
who are balancing work and childcare or family care. 
We update and release content two to three times a 
month under the Inclusion Promotion Plan to encourage 
employees in the group to understand D&I and 
ultimately implement these concepts in the workplace.

Diversity & Inclusion Expo 2021
In October to December 2021, we held our first trial of 
Kao Diversity & Inclusion Expo 2021 on the portal site. 
Under the theme of “We create our Diversity & 
Inclusion,” we streamed the concept movie, held a 
seminar with this theme, and reintroduced the 
awareness-raising content back issues. Many

Diversity management seminar
We held a seminar with an external expert entitled 
“Reasons for having a lively team” in order to gain a 
better understanding of motivation for career and 
diversity management so that employees with diverse 
backgrounds demonstrate their unique capabilities. 
The first part of the seminar conveyed the “key points 
for creating your own career” to employees balancing 
work with childcare, whereas the second part 
imparted considerations for assisting diverse 
employees’ career growth to their managers (with 550 
participants on the day and 550 views of the recorded 
seminar). We received feedback such as, “I want to 
grow in a style that suits me” as well as “I recognized 
anew the importance of dialogue.”

Understanding and exploring psychological 
safety and unconscious bias
Under the theme of “Let’s have a dialogue toward our 
dreams,” as part of our first initiative to improve 
employees’ understanding we hosted seminars in 
Japanese with simultaneous English interpretation 
about psychological safety and unconscious bias, which 
are integral to create an inclusive organizational culture.
 In the seminar entitled “How to create psychological 
safety that encourages dialogue and facing challenges” 
where an external expert were featured, around 600 
people who were mainly managers participated in the 

live stream on that day (and there were 2,000 views of 
the recorded seminar as of the end of December 2021). 
This was a good opportunity for participants to gain a 
deeper insight into psychological safety for effective 
teams and flexibility as part of leadership and to master 
the tips to put this into practice.
 Similarly, in the seminar on unconscious bias 
presented by an external expert, around 550 people 
who were mainly managers participated in the live 
stream on that day (and there were 585 views of the 
recorded seminar). The participants learned how to 
recognize and address unconscious bias and 
examples of this leading to positive results.
 Providing online live streaming and a recording of 
both these seminars enable employees in different 
positions all over the country to participate in and 
view these lectures and leads to a high-level 
satisfaction from participants because not only are 
these lectures straightforward and chock-full of 
examples from each speaker, but also the moderators 
emphasized interactive communication making use of 
the chat and voting features.
 In the future, these activities will be expanded 
globally to gain an understanding of psychological 
safety and unconscious bias and create a better 
organizational culture.

Sharing positive examples and activities inside 
the company
We feature inclusion promotion activities at the 

workplace and by volunteers as accessible and 
positive examples in articles and videos with the 
objective of raising awareness so that employees 
perceive D&I as relevant to them and take initiative. In 
2021, the article featuring a team in Sakata Plant 
which produces diapers entitled “Toward the 
realization of ‘A line that anyone can operate: Changes 
in the workplace born from the welcoming of female 
operators to male employee-only production lines’” 
covered various workplace improvement activities and 
changes in the mindsets of employees to be receptive 
of female employees as line operators at the 
production line for diapers that handles many 
heavyweight materials. This led to the realization of 
the necessity and importance of D&I with employees 
commenting about how they want to incorporate this 
perspective at their own workplace and that it spurred 
them to consider how to create an environment that 
is better for everyone.
 In addition, we presented the community activity, 
“KAKEHASHI” run by volunteers, most of which are 
people with hearing disabilities in Kao Group in Japan. 
(For more information, see p. 47.)

Courageous Conversations (Americas)
A virtual event series for employees was conducted 
throughout the year exploring social justice and racial 
equity topics. The events are intended to encourage 
collective understanding and action and to explore 
how, we as an organization and as individuals, can

Kao was selected for inclusion in the 2021 
Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index
In January 2021, Kao was selected for inclusion in the 
Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for its third 
year in a row. The GEI identifies companies that are 
committed to transparency in gender reporting and to 
advancing equality for women in the workplace. In 
2021, a total of 380 companies were selected for 
inclusion in the GEI, from 44 countries and regions.

Kao was selected by the Ministry of Economy, 
Trade and Industry as a Semi-Nadeshiko Brand
In March 2021, Kao was selected for the Semi-Nadeshiko 
Brand list as a company that has made outstanding 
achievements in advancing women’s participation in the 
workplace. The Nadeshiko Brand is a joint effort between 
the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange to accelerate government efforts 
to promote women’s advancement as the core of its 
growth strategy, with plans to select and publicize 
companies that are promoting active participation by 
women, including the creation of an environment where 
they are able to continue working. At Kao, in order to 
promote a more flexible and diverse work style, we have 
established a flextime system (with no required core 
hours), leave taken in hourly increments, and̶to be 
more compatible with family care including caregiving 
and childcare̶one with reduced hours, a system for 
taking leave and working-from-home system, which we 
encourage our employees to use. These efforts and 
financial performance were thoroughly evaluated.

Topic External evaluation
work to build greater equity in our shared culture and 
communities.

EYPIC activities (Americas)
In Kao CP Americas, a new ERG activity, EYPIC 
(Empowering Young Professionals̶Inspiring Change) 
was launched to create a network of young 
professionals that will promote personal and 
professional empowerment tailored to their unique 
skills and mindsets. It aims to bridge the gap between 
millennials and other generations in the work place, to 
develop young professionals through conversations, 
pathways and plans tailored to young professionals, 
to allow all Millennials in varying departments to 
connect and meet, and to increase exposure of Kao to 
the community using the unique skillsets of 
millennials and young professionals within the Kao 
organization. Through the EYPIC Newsletter, in 
conjunction with Corporate Communications, we will 
highlight employees within Kao organization that have 
a story to tell about volunteering at their local animal 
shelter, coaching a youth sports team, or speaking out 
against racial injustice.

Going beyond women’s  
assumptions

Employees’ voice

Kao Group believes that women’s empowerment is 
essential for the growth of our business as one aspect of 
diversity that is related to most of our workforce. One 
example of a factor impeding women’s empowerment is 
that some women lack confidence and have unconscious 
bias when it comes to imagining roles of female 
employees and leaders. In 2021, we hosted small round 
table talks with female executives, Women’s Career Café 
and at the Research and Development, career panel 
discussions, aiming to encourage participants to be aware 
of their unconscious biases and change their professional 
mindsets and to enable women to discover their forward-
looking ambitions to become leaders. The participants 
brought up that this changed their mindsets. For example, 
one participant commented, “Listening to the stories of 
female leaders and speaking about my own experiences 
made me feel more positive about my career.” Another 
stated, “Because I’m a woman, I felt the pressure, but I’m 
relieved that there’s another approach to flexibly advance 
my career.”

In the future, we will promote awareness-raising 
activities and career development for female employees 
and training for management, aimed at being a company 
where female employees feel confident to demonstrate 
their capabilities.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Social issues we are aware of
Aging
With the global trend toward the aging of the population, there 
has been an increase in the percentage of people affected by 
chronic diseases. Many senior citizens require support or care 
because of disease or deterioration of joints or muscles.
 Within Japan, there has been a steady rise in medical 
expenses because of this situation, and companies’ health 
insurance societies are experiencing significant financial 
problems. 

The spread of infectious diseases
The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the 
world has had a major impact on people’s health and on 
how people live within society, and there has been an 
increase in the number of people reporting physical and 
mental health issues because of being isolated or having to 
work in an unfamiliar environment.

The raising of the retirement age, and increased 
female participation in society
With people tending to work to a more advanced age, and with 
the increase in the number of working women, it has been 
reported that around 30% of people will develop cancer while 
they are still of working age. It can be anticipated that the 

Optimistic, energetic employees (what we refer to as “GENKI employees”) are the foundation of Kao’s business activities. We as a company are only as 
strong as the health of our employees.
Besides promoting Health and Productivity Management® and implementing health promotion to maximize employee power and potential, we also expand 
the scope of application of initiatives that have proved to be effective to include other Kao workplaces, the local community and consumers in general

number of cases of people continuing to work while dealing 
with chronic diseases such as cancer will increase still further.

Kao’s creating value
We believe that it is important for us to provide support to 
help people improve their lifestyle habits in response to the 
New Normal, and to further enhance the support that we 
provide for disease prevention and early diagnosis and 
treatment of medical issues, as well as support for people 
who deal with medical conditions.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030 
We aim to realize a working environment and a society, in 
which a variety of lifestyle habit improvement activities can be 
implemented cheerfully and enthusiastically, to help each 
individual recognize the health issues that are relevant to them 
personally and work to maintain the best possible health status.

The aging of the population has been accompanied by an 
increase in the number of employees affected by lifestyle 
diseases and by diseases such as cancer and 
musculoskeletal disorders, and there is a risk that changes 
in the living environment due to infectious diseases will 
interfere with the health of the individual.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
As a company, we intend to provide support to help 
employees who possess health literacy (in other words, 
being able to recognize the importance of their own health 
issues) to improve their health through self-directed, 

self-disciplined efforts.
 Programs originally designed to help Kao employees 
maintain and improve their health are also made available 
for external use, and are being deployed for health 
maintenance and promotion activities in local communities 
and in workplaces. We hope that the initiatives at Kao will 
have a positive influence on local communities and 
workplaces, and contribute to improved health and 
increased lifespans for society as a whole.

Kao’s creating value
We view the health of our employees and their families as 
being an important asset for the company and as the source 
of the company’s vitality. The Kao Group Health Declaration 
was announced in 2008 as an important message from top 
management, and we have been working for years now to 
promote Health and Productivity Management.
 We continue to endeavor to limit excessive increases in 
medical expenses through preventive initiatives including the 
promotion of lifestyle improvements and active implementation 
of various health guidance measures. We are focusing our 
efforts on the control of long working hours through promotion 
of modulated work styles and mental health training for 
managers from the perspective of promoting pleasant 
workplaces. With respect to employees suffering from chronic 
disease, or from cancer or other diseases, in order to help these 
employees maintain the right balance between managing their 
health issues and their work responsibilities, we offer support 
which, rather than being “one size fits all,” is carefully tailored 
to the actual circumstances of each individual employee.
 One of our key assets in this area is having accumulated 
basic health data (including employees’ health examination

results and records of their participation in related special 
events) over a period of many years. By combining these 
data with job stress assessment results and other 
employment-related information, we are able to implement 
integrated analysis of employees’ health status. A second 
asset is being able to implement health promotion initiatives 
that leverage our own healthcare know-how. A third asset is 
the results achieved through years of Health and Productivity 
Management initiatives, which have given us extensive 
Health and Productivity Management know-how (including 
an awareness of which programs have not been effective).
 Besides working actively to spread awareness of our 
initiatives outside the company, we also provide related 
healthcare services outside the company through our 
GENKI Project.

Cultivation of employees with high health literacy
We are working to make our health promotion 
activities more visible, engaging in Health and 
Productivity Management® using the PDCA cycle to 
improve employee health, with the aim of increasing 
the number of employees with high health literacy.
 We consider employees with high health literacy 
as employees who do the following: 
1.  Reviews and improves lifestyle independently, 

based on health check-up results
2.  When necessary, consults with a family doctor who 

can view their health data and provide advice, 
rather than just consulting occupational physicians

3.  Maintains awareness of their mental health, and 
confers with appropriate professionals as needed

Six health promotion initiatives
Rather than merely fulfilling the minimum requirements 
for health management that we are required to meet as 
a company, we implement health promotion in line 
with the six core themes below. Health promotion 

refers to the independent maintenance and 
improvement of the employee’s own health.
1. Lifestyle diseases
2. Cancer
3. Smoking cessation
4. Mental health care
5. Women’s health
6. Senior health

Education and promotion

We have issued the Kao Group Health Declaration, 
and our employees both within and outside Japan are 
familiarized with this, for example through the 
provision of an English-language version.
 Within Japan, various on-site campaigns, 
seminars and health promotion activities are deployed 
in line with the six core health promotion initiatives.
 As a result of the implementation of these types 
of initiatives, the percentage of employees who have 
taken steps to improve their lifestyle habits now 
stands at 28.0% in the case of male employees 
(representing a year-on-year increase of 0.7 
percentage points) and 21.2% for female employees 
(representing a year-on-year increase of 2.6 
percentage points*). There has also been a decrease 
in presentism (where employees go in to work, but 
are unable to perform properly due to health issues), 
the incidence of which has declined to 23.9%.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders
In order to spread awareness of our employee 
nutrition improvement program throughout the world, 
we have joined the Nutrition Japan Public Private 
Platform, and we are undertaking related activities.
 For mental health care, we collaborate with an 
external Employee Assistance Program to provide 
consultation services for employees and their family 
members.
 Within Japan, we also make effective services that 
we have developed available outside the company, 
based on the needs reported by external experts in 
occupational health promotion and local government 
officials. For example, we have made a useful 
contribution toward the prevention of societal health 
issues such as metabolic syndrome and locomotive 
syndrome.
 To create new health value, we also promote 
collaborative research with external organizations.

Framework

Systematization of the health promotion framework
Our health promotion strategy embodies collabohealth (i.e., 
close collaboration between health insurance providers and 
companies to safeguard employees’ health), with the company 
and the Kao Health Insurance Society working closely together 
to formulate plans for strategy implementation, which are 
discussed at regular, monthly meetings.
 Major strategies are finalized at a company-wide Health 
Promotion Committee meeting after consideration by 
working groups and the committee members of the Kao 
Health Insurance Society with employee representatives. We 
have an appropriate number of health staff who possess 
specialist expertise permanently available, and these health 
staff are actively involved in the implementation of health 

promotion strategies of various kinds. At every individual 
worksite or branch, the manager and staff of the HR section 
work together with occupational physicians and nursing staff.
 Information on the state of progress in Japan is shared 
with group companies outside Japan, and the specifics of 
health management are implemented in line with 
government policy in each country or region.
 In 2020 and 2021, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, we held meetings of the Emergency Response 
Team Headquarters at least once a month, and measures 
taken in response to the pandemic̶including those taken by 
group companies outside Japan̶were shared and confirmed 
during these meetings. Issues relating to these measures 
were shared with risk managers and human resources 
managers via the senior management of individual overseas 
group companies, to facilitate effective implementation.

Increasing the visibility of the Health Promotion 
Management System
Since 2009, we have compiled a statistical summary 
of the previous year’s health data in an anonymized 
format (including medical interviews, check-ups, 
occupations and diseases), and made this information 
available to the 19 health consultation rooms 
throughout Japan.
 Each health consultation room then drafts and 
implements a health services plan based on the health 
data for their respective regions.
 Since 2009, we have held annual Health White 

Paper study sessions so that employees in charge of 
human resource and general affairs and occupational 
health nurses can together learn methods of analyzing 
the various types of health data and of formulating 
measures.

Cultivation of health staff and internal 
information sharing
The annual health staff meeting, which brings 
together managers and staff of HR sections, 
occupational physicians and nursing staff, was held 
online in December 2021, with the aim of spreading 
awareness of Kao Health 2025, the company-wide 
strategy for health, as well as recognizing examples of 
Health and Productivity Management best practice, 
with the aim of realizing horizontal diffusion to other 
worksites and branches.
 In 2021, the gold medal for best practice went to 
the Wakayama Office and Kashima Office for their 
Initiative for Continued Implementation of Health 
Promotion during the COVID-19 Pandemic̶
Wakayama vs. Kashima: Let’s Eat Breakfast 
Campaign. The silver medal went to the Tochigi Office 
for its Making Existing Habits into a Relaxing Time̶
Providing Collaborative Plans for the Effective 
Utilization of Research Results in Health Promotion 

initiative. Bronze medals were awarded to the Tochigi 
Office, for its Initiative to Cultivate Leaders with a 
High Sense of Coherence, to KCMK’s Northeast 
Region Office, for its Effectively Utilizing Kiranes 
Cards program, and to KCMK’s Kinki Region Office, 
for its Special Activity Involving Not Only 
Occupational Physicians and Nursing Staff But Also 
Project Team Formation.

In addition, in January 2022 we implemented a Health 
Guidance Seminar with the aim of enhancing the 
health guidance capabilities of nursing staff. At the 
health staff meetings and Health Guidance Seminar, 
besides discussing strategies, we also hold study 
sessions regarding perspectives on health data and 
occupational health plan formulation methods.
 We also encourage occupational health staff to 
attend training seminars to enhance their skill levels.
 More than 100 occupational health staff have 
participated in these training seminars, including 21 
staff who attended training seminars for specific 
health guidance program specialist staff, 12 staff who 
attended training seminars for mid-ranking and senior 
specific health guidance program staff, 32 staff who 
attended training seminars relating to data analysis, 
and 36 staff who attended training seminars relating 
to health services.

Performance in 2021

Performance
Response to the COVID-19 global 
pandemic
We set the emergency level as “level 3,” 
the highest level, and held a meeting of 
the Emergency Response Team 
Headquarters (headed by the President) 
to decide on response policies focusing 
on ensuring the safety of employees and 
their families and on the continuity of 
business activities.

Reviews of performance
Global
With regard to strategies implemented in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have 
implemented response measures on a global 
basis, based on the overall strategy decided on 
at meetings of the Emergency Response Team 
Headquarters, and in line with the instructions 
received from government agencies in each 
country. As a result, we have been able to 
keep the number of people infected with 
COVID-19 down to a very low level.

Kao Group in Japan
By comparison with 2017, our employees 
have become older, with the average age of 
our employees now being relatively high. 
However, there has been an improvement in 
terms of most lifestyle habits. The share of 
employees reporting high levels of stress 
has fallen, and the invigorated workplace 
ratio has risen. On the other hand, there has 
also been a decrease in the average number 
of steps walked each day, an increase in the 
number of employees who do not sleep 
well, and an increase in the number of 
employees who are overweight.

Employee wellbeing & safety 403-6 (Occupational health and safety 2018)

COVID-19 measures (Japan)

COVID-19 infection prevention awareness-raising activities
As a countermeasure in response to COVID-19, in January 2020 
we established an Infection Countermeasures Team. The team 
formulated rules governing how employees should take care of 
themselves if they feel unwell, and implemented measures 
relating to the working system and workplace environment. We 
also began implementation of health status surveys using our 
safety verification system. If an employee reported feeling 
unwell, nursing staff implemented a follow-up examination.
 In 2021, we continued to implement our existing initiatives. 
In addition, recognizing the importance of preventive action to 
protect each individual employee from becoming infected or 
from infecting others, we have been striving to strengthen 
awareness-raising activities in collaboration with our internal 
Infectious Disease Risk Assessment Project.
 As COVID-19 infection prevention education for new 
employees, we have created awareness-raising video content. 
Health surveys are conducted for new employees during the 14 days 
prior to starting work at the company, and we have endeavored to 
ensure that new employees become aware of the importance of 
infection prevention prior to starting work, and that they have an 
opportunity to learn the Kao Group’s infection prevention rules.
 In July 2021, we implemented an e-learning activity to 
check all employees’ level of understanding of COVID-19.
 In October 2021, to encourage employees to change 
their behavior, we conducted self-checking using the 
implementation assessment system. Based on the results, 
feedback was provided in the form of individual reports.

Support for COVID-19 vaccination
In order to get employees who are willing to be vaccinated 
against COVID-19 vaccinated as early as possible, in line with 

Our initiatives

government policy, the Kao Group in Japan has been promoting 
vaccination in the workplace, with workplace vaccination 
sessions being held at eight Kao worksites in Japan between 
June and October 2021. A total of 16,700 people̶including 
employees, employees of partner companies, and employees’ 
family members̶were vaccinated at these sessions.
 In addition, as an employee support measure, those 
employees who felt unwell on the day of the vaccination or 
the day after due to side-effects were able to take the day 
off. So that employees could make an informed decision, 
we provided accurate information about vaccine 
effectiveness and side-effects on the company intranet.

Health management for Japanese 
personnel on overseas assignment

With regard to employees who are posted to work outside Japan, 
we implement health status grading in accordance with the 
health management guidelines for personnel working overseas, 
and make a determination as to whether it is appropriate for each 
employee to be working overseas. Furthermore, personnel are 
not sent overseas until they have had all of the inoculations 
required by the FORTH criteria established by the Quarantine 
Information Office, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
 Regarding health management for employees working outside 
Japan, those employees requiring follow-up receive frequent 
health follow-up sessions from the health consultation room, and 
on the basis of the results of these sessions they may have an 
appointment made to see an occupational physician. In principle, 
employees stationed outside Japan were entitled to return to 
Japan for a health check-up once a year. However, starting from 
2020, we have switched over to a system whereby such 
employees can have a health check-up at a local medical facility.

 In the case of regions affected by Avian influenza, every 
year employees visiting or stationed in such regions were 
encouraged to get vaccinated against influenza. Starting 
from 2020, as it was possible to subsidize the full cost of 
vaccination for all employees who wished to be vaccinated 
against influenza, employees were encouraged to receive 
the vaccination, regardless of where they are located.

Lifestyle habit improvement initiatives

Events and activities
Smart WASHOKU®
Smart WASHOKU® is a dietary method which causes less 
visceral fat accumulation, while ensuring sufficient 
nourishment. Rather than focusing on the overall quantity 
of food consumed, the Smart WASHOKU® approach 
emphasizes three key points̶(1) the ratio of protein to fat, 
(2) the ratio of dietary fiber to carbohydrate, (3) the ratio of 
Omega 3 to fat̶to provide a diet that enables people to 
eat well while still keeping their visceral fat level down.
•  Smart WASHOKU® online seminars were implemented on 10 

occasions, along with 2 online cooking classes. Approximately 
400 employees and family members participated.

•  A Smart WASHOKU® Challenge was implemented for 
employees and their families as a summer holiday project. 
After participating in a Smart WASHOKU® online seminar, 
employees and their family members who were interested 
in taking part in the Smart WASHOKU® Challenge took on 
the challenge of making Smart WASHOKU® at home. They 
could then post photos of the dishes that they had created 
to an online community. Approximately 300 people 
participated in the online community, of which 30

53 photos of food were submitted.

•  With the increase in the number of employees working at 
home, starting from December 2021, recipe videos for the 
Smart WASHOKU® lunches served at the Kayabacho employee 
cafeteria in Tokyo were disseminated for employees who are 
unable to use company cafeterias to make the dishes at home.

HocoTouch Pedometer Gait Measurement
We hold Gait Measurement at which analysis of how 
employees walk makes it possible to gauge their “walking 
age” and their future living functions risk. We also rent out 
HocoTouch pedometer device, a unique device developed by 
Kao, which can stimulate improvements in daily living habits.
•  HocoTouch devices were rented out for use at 97 spot 

locations by 10,634 personnel.
•  23.0% continued to use the devices, of which 43.6% achieved 

Rank A walking steps and speeds over one day or more.
Note:  A smartphone app has been provided so that HocoTouch can be 

used by employees working at home. 31.7% of continued users 
have made use of this app.

Visceral Fat & Lifestyle Check-ups (lifestyle habit 
analysis and visceral fat measurement)

This service helps to enhance awareness of the need to improve 
lifestyle habits by digitalizing and displaying the results obtained 
through a questionnaire survey of lifestyle habits and measurement 
of visceral fat, which tends to be affected by lifestyle habits.
 Measures have been implemented to strengthen infection 
prevention. For example to reduce the amount of time that people 
needed to spend in the check-up venue, the lifestyle habits 
questionnaire survey was implemented in advance, online, and 
the explanation of the check-up results was performed remotely.
• Event participants: 96 people

Dissemination of information and campaign activities
We have been disseminating health information via the 
company intranet and implementing awareness-raising 
activities so that employees can take steps to improve their 
health, regardless of whether they are working on company 
premises or working from home.

Internal survey on Health and Productivity 
Management activities and personal health

Employee wellbeing & safety 403-6 (Occupational health and safety 2018)

These survey results, along with collated data broken down 
by gender and by job type, have been shared with health 
staff throughout Japan.

Dissemination of health information via the 
company intranet̶GENKI Mori Mori Bulletin
Starting in 2020, the 25th day of every month has been 
designated as GENKI Mori Mori Day, on which we 
disseminate health-related information using the 
company’s intranet. We present seasonally-relevant 
information of the types that employees want to know in 
an easy-to-understand format and in a timely manner 
through collaboration between relevant units and research 
institutes. This year, we presented individual interviews 
with employees who have achieved their targets in various 
health-related 
events, as well 
as reporting on 
the secrets to 
their success 
and their 
lifestyles, with 
the aim of 

providing support for other employees who want to take 
steps to improve their health.

Launching an internal community site
We have established an internal community website that 
all Kao employees can participate in, regardless of which 
unit they belong to or where they are located. Employees 
can post messages or images, and add stickers to indicate 
their response, using a nickname rather than their real 
name. By making it easy to participate, the idea is to help 
employees feel the strength of their connections with 
colleagues.

42-day Weight-loss Challenge
This campaign is held to encourage employees to try to lose 
2kg in weight over the 42-day period between February 15 
and March 29 (except employees with a BMI of less than 19).
 In 2021, the company’s occupational physicians 
distributed diet magazines to employees on a regular 
basis, and participants were able to share their experiences 
of losing weight through communication using Microsoft 
Teams, providing each other with mutual encouragement 
in their efforts to lose weight.
•  A total of 2,678 employees took part (representing a 

participation rate of 12%), of which 1,036 (38.7% of 
participants) succeeded in losing at least 2kg.

•  The combined total of visceral fat lost by all participants 
was 2.6 tons.

Pre-examination Weight-loss Challenge (for employees 
who received specific health guidance in 2020, and 
those on a waiting list for specific health guidance)
This campaign encouraged employees to try to lose weight 

over a 42-day period 2 months prior to their annual health 
examination. The participants in the 2021 campaign had 
Smart WASHOKU® video content disseminated to them, 
along with diet magazines provided by the company’s 
occupational physicians, so that they could learn cooking 
methods and lifestyle habits that help to avoid the 
accumulation of visceral fat, with the aim of making it 
possible to lose weight without a great deal of effort.
•  This has been implemented 5 times, with 645 participants, 

of which 187 (29.0%) lost at least 2kg in weight.

Walking Challenge
The Spring Walking Challenge was implemented over the 
three-month period from April 1 to June 30, 2021. An online 
community was used for posting photos of participants 
walking and of the scenery they saw during their walks, 
etc., making the event a fun experience. By creating a 
situation in which, if someone felt they could not do it on 
their own, they would be able to carry on by doing it 
together with others, the aim was to get employees into the 
habit of walking and improve their overall lifestyle habits.
•  A total of 3,002 people took part (representing a 

participation rate of 11.5%).
•  No. of participants that achieved their target: 1,647 

people (54.9% of the total)

Online Radio Calisthenics Club
The Online Radio Calisthenics Club held calisthenics 
sessions twice a day over the 14-day period from January 
18 to January 31, 2021, and also held morning online 
calisthenics sessions during the periods from October 18 to 
October 22, 2021, and November 15 to November 19, 2021. 
Every day, large numbers of employees took part, engaging

Sports Declaration: I’m Going to Do This!
Over the period from October 11 to November 21, 2021, the 
Sports Declaration: I’m Going to Do This! event was held to 
promote participation in sports. The aim was for the participants 
to take part in a sport of their own choosing at least three times 
a week over a period of 42 days. Participants declared which 
sport they would be taking part in on a community website, 
and then followed through for 42 days. According to the results 
of a questionnaire survey conducted after the event, 70% of 
participants reported that their participation in sports had 
become more frequent than before the event.
•  A total of 1,851 people took part.
•  No. of participants that achieved their target: 991 people 

(53.5% of the total)

Daytime Rest GENKI Challenge
In September 2021, we began promoting the Yasumi Yasumi 
Workstyle, which involves the proactive incorporation of rest 
breaks into the working day. As one such initiative, during 
the month of November 2021, MegRhythm Steam Eye 
Masks were distributed to employees. Participants recorded 
the days on which they used them, and participants were 
also able to share their concerns in regard to taking a rest. 
The aim of this activity was to adjust people’s habits in 
relation to taking daytime rests.
•  Participants: 1,257 people
•  Before-and-after surveys were conducted to examine 

individual performance, and these indicated that 
productivity rose by an average of more than 5%.

Mental health care

By 2021, our system for implementing job stress 
assessments for employees in Japan had been in use for six 
years. We made effective use of job stress assessment 
results to proactively implement mental health care. 
Occupational physicians and nursing staff promptly follow 
up on employees who are assessed as requiring emergency 
treatment in light of their responses to these stress tests, 
and individual follow-up e-mails are sent to employees who 
are judged to display slightly high stress levels.
 As an organization, we also hold briefings based on job 
stress assessment group analysis at company, division, 
worksite and branch levels, and we identify workplaces 
needing priority attention and implement measures to 
improve the working environment at these sites. For example, 
in the case of workplaces where a rapid increase in business 

volume has been accompanied by increased stress, we have 
performed in-depth analysis to gauge the reasons for the 
increase in stress besides supporting individual employees, 
and we have begun to implement activities to improve the 
organizational structure and the communication methods.
 We also aim to enhance the ability of each individual 
employee to treat their own mental health through training 
and provision of information. We are continuing to foster a 
corporate culture in which everyone at Kao, including the 
colleagues at our individual worksites, acquires the ability to 
pay attention to small but significant changes that have 
occurred in their own lives, address problems at an early 
stage, and help each other out in times of difficulty.
 In addition, we are making effective use of our 
guidelines for helping to ensure a smooth return to work 
after long periods of leave. By implementing activities to 
help people avoid mental health problems and to address 
them at an early stage if they do experience them, at the 
level of both individual employees and the organization as a 
whole, we are creating workplaces filled with vitality and 
higher productivity.
 In 2021, we switched over to using Peacemind Inc. as 
the contracted provider of the Kao Mental Health 
Consultation hotline service. We also strove to enhance 
awareness by notifying all Kao employees by e-mail about 
the available internal and external hotline services.
 In addition, we are working to strengthen employees’ 
ability to cope with various types of stress, by making 
self-care seminars available to all employees through live 
streaming.
 We are providing mental health manager training at 
individual worksites and branch offices, and promoting 
mental health care appropriate to each organization.

including the dissemination of messages supporting 
smokers’ efforts to stop smoking, and the holding of 
seminars by occupational physicians.
•  Implementation of the Kao Group Smoking 

Cessation Challenge
In January: A total of 63 employees participated (of 
which 33 succeeded in stopping smoking)
In May: A total of 39 employees participated (of 
which 18 succeeded in stopping smoking)

•  Kao Health Insurance Society-subsidized smoking 
cessation treatment was provided for 2 people.

•  Online smoking cessation program led by Kao

Online smoking cessation program in spring: 24 
employees participated

Women’s health

Within Japan, we have established a Women’s Health 
Consultation Service (for e-mail consultations), which 
arranges for occupational physicians to respond to 
employees’ requests for consultations. Women’s 
Health News is distributed regularly (once every three 
months) using the company’s intranet, to help deepen 
understanding of women’s health issues.
 We hold women’s health seminars throughout the 
country. This year, the seminar at the Tochigi Office focused 
on the problem that women in their 50s have with not 
getting sufficient sleep. Based on internal research evidence 
indicating that daily skin care habits can affect the 
autonomic nervous system (which controls heart rate) and 

Promoting smoking cessation (Japan)
With the aim of realizing healthy, pleasant workplaces, 
in January 2018 we began promoting the prohibition 
of smoking during working hours. Starting from April 
2020, having built consensus with management, we 
have been using the company’s intranet to clearly 
enunciate to employees both the prohibition on indoor 
smoking and the need for consideration for smokers.
 In 2021, we distributed leaflets and messages as 
measures to encourage employees not to start smoking and 
we also strengthened our measures to protect employees from 
passive smoking and encourage employees to quit smoking.

Kao Group Smoking Cessation Week
The week beginning May 31 (which is World No 
Tobacco Day) has been designated as Kao Group 
Smoking Cessation Week. During this week, we

skin condition, a researcher from the R&D gave a skin care 
seminar remotely. A total of 78 people attended the seminar, 
which helped them to develop their own ways of relaxing 
and of using their own free time to maximum effect.
 At a Pink Ribbon Seminar organized by the Social 
Contribution, an occupational physician gave a talk on getting 
cancer screening at gynecological clinics, and what this 
experience involves. The physician stressed how important it 
is to provide the consideration needed to encourage 
employees (or their family members) to get tested.

Expansion of health checks for 
employees working long hours

We are promoting the adjustment of working hours. To 
address the fatigue and stress experienced by employees 
with long working hours, we have undertaken to implement 
more detailed health checks as outlined below. These will 
facilitate early detection of symptoms and identification of 
potential distress signals from such individuals.

(Events, seminars, campaigns, etc.)

Since 2009, we have been providing support for 
specified fertility treatment within Japan.
 Initially, the Kao Health Insurance Society 
subsidized treatment, but in 2013 responsibility was 
transferred to the Kao Family Association (a mutual 
aid association). Subsequently, the program was 
revised several times. In 2017, financial assistance for 
male fertility treatment was added, and in 2020 the 
scope of application was expanded to cover additional 
companies, so that all Kao Group companies within 
Japan are now covered.
 In 2021 the annual total of instances of subsidy 
usage rose to 262 (none of which involved male 
fertility treatment), representing an increase of 35 
instances, and a year-on-year growth rate of 115%.
 We have also put in place an environment in 
which employees can seek to maintain an appropriate 
balance between work responsibilities and treatment, 
by making effective use of the various flexible working 
arrangements that we offer (including a flextime 
system, a working-from-home system, and the ability 
to take leave in hourly increments).

Visualization (Awareness)

Using unique visceral fat measurement 
technology and lifestyle analysis algorithms, 
we hold measurement sessions at worksites 
throughout Japan.
We are able to visualize the issues affecting 
individual employees and individual 
worksites.
Health promotion achievements can be 
realized through changes in visceral 
fat levels.

Effective improvement through lifestyle

We provide our unique Smart WASHOKU® 
lunches, which allow people to eat well without 
increasing their visceral fat levels, at employee 
cafeterias in 11 worksites throughout Japan.
We also hold special lunch seminars, and Smart 
WASHOKU® cooking classes in which 
employees can participate with their families.

●

We have distributed unique HocoTouch pedometers, which enable employees to work 
out their “walking age” based on how far they have walked youthfully in a given day.
HocoTouch stimulates communication among employees, who are eager to 
ask each other “What is your walking age today?”
 We have also launched walking “competitions” for 
the staff at our plants and sales offices.

Promoting the GENKI Project

The GENKI Project, which was put on a systematic 
footing in 2021, involves expanding the application of 
outstanding health solutions that have been implemented 
within Kao to include employees, their family members, 
the local community and society as a whole.

GENKI-Action
In our Human health care, we have for many years 
now been undertaking research on areas such as the 
relationship between visceral fat and lifestyle and the 
relationship between walking and health. The 
knowledge obtained from this research is utilized not 
only in the development of new products, but also to 
improve the health of our employees and their 
families through our health promotion programs. We 
call this unique approach to health promotion Kao 
GENKI-Action. What makes Kao GENKI-Action special 
is the way it realizes visualization of health status and 
lifestyle habits, which helps to boost health 
awareness and encourages people to make effective 
improvements through lifestyle changes. In order for 
people to achieve a health-conducive lifestyle without 
it being too stressful, and so that they can keep it up 
over the long term and enjoy doing it, we provide 
support for building a healthy environment, and offer 
assistance through our company’s products.
 We also make effective use of GENKI-WEB, a 
health community website for Kao employees, as a 
platform for Kao GENKI-Action, with recording of daily 
living activities, implementation of special health 
events, etc.

Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture; Genki! All the Time 
Project to reduce the need for care provision, a 
collaborative project between the local 
government authority and the private sector
In October 2021, we began providing HocoTouch 
pedometer devices and Gait Measurements sessions 
for senior citizens aged 65 or over living in Toyota City. 
In 2021, the first year of implementation, this support 
was provided for approximately 100 people.
 This project is making use of Social Impact Bond, 
Japan’s largest-scale initiative in the healthcare sector, 
and is being implemented as a new initiative for 
working on social issues.

Joint research with COI, Hirosaki University
As part of our efforts to contribute toward the building 
of a sustainable, healthy society, we are undertaking 
collaborative research with the Center of Healthy 
Aging Innovation (COI) at Hirosaki University, which is 
engaged in creating a “lifespan revolution.” Focusing 
on Aomori Prefecture, which has the shortest average 
lifespan in Japan, we are conducting social 
implementation research that integrates basic research 
on visceral fat reduction with its measurement and 
attention to dietary and exercise habits, with the aim 
of preventing metabolic syndrome.
 In 2021, we conducted visceral fat testing at 
quality-of-life health check-ups, an awareness-raising 
type health check-up activity implemented at business 
enterprises and in municipalities in Aomori Prefecture. 
We also provided HocoTouch devices to 743 people 
as follow-up after the health check-ups (as of October 
2021).

Consortium projects focused on senior citizens: 
General Incorporated Payer’s Association for 
Better Healthcare Senior Citizens Research Group

Announcing a commitment at the Tokyo N4G Summit 2021
Participating in a side-event organized by the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
The N4G Summit is held once every four years, hosted by 
whichever country is hosting the Olympics and Paralympics 
that year, with the aim of promoting international initiatives 
to clarify the current status of world nutrition improvement 
and the key issues, and to resolve these issues.
 At the Tokyo N4G Summit in 2021, we announced 
a commitment to expanding the scope of 
implementation of our Smart WASHOKU® and Health 
and Productivity Management support initiatives.

Kao's commitment
We will contribute toward the reduction of premature 
deaths from non-communicable diseases using the 
findings from our own research activities in nutrition.

 As part of that effort, by 2025, we will provide the 
following workplace nutrition improvement programs 
to workplaces that cover 200,000 people annually 
(including 50,000 Kao Group employees and family 
members and 150,000 others) and promote Health and 
Productivity Management and Workplace Nutrition.
(1)  Consulting on Health and Productivity Management
(2)  Health checks related to nutrition (visceral fat 

measurement, etc.)
(3)  Assessment of lifestyle habits
(4)  Education or guidance on healthy eating (Smart 

WASHOKU®*)
(5)  Healthy meals at work (Smart WASHOKU®* meals)
*  Smart WASHOKU® is a healthy eating method to prevent visceral fat 

accumulation by improving the quality of meals rather than changing 
the amount of food eaten.

Through this activity, we will provide opportunities for 
small and medium-sized enterprises and their 
employees, who have less capability on their own to 
implement Health and Productivity Management and 
Workforce Nutrition, to improve health and nutrition.
 In addition, in order to share our findings, methods 
and experiences with the world’s workplaces, we will be 
joining the Workforce Nutrition Alliance by 2025 and 
aiming to play a leading role in the alliance’s efforts.
 In the years ahead, we will be working actively to 
help address global nutrition issues.

Japan–Saudi Arabia Future Shapers Initiative 
initial online learning program
In January 2021, in response to a request from the Japan 
International Cooperation Center (JICE), we gave a 
presentation on Health and Productivity Management to a 

group of young people from Saudi Arabia, including 
students and young businesspeople. Obesity is one of the 
problems affecting society in Saudi Arabia, and we 
responded to the high interest that has been shown in our 
Smart WASHOKU® initiative by introducing a food education 
program that makes effective use of Smart WASHOKU®. The 
presentation was followed by a lively exchange of views, 
with the participants commenting that they felt that methods 
similar to Japan’s workplace nutrition initiatives could be 
applied in Saudi Arabia, and that the idea of using nutrition 
to reduce visceral fat was unique and interesting.

Activities relating to human resources cultivation in the UAE
Seminar on Women’s Healthcare for Promoting 
Female Empowerment
In June 2021, in response to a request from the JICE, we 
participated in an online seminar for participants selected 
by the Department of Health, Abu Dhabi Government, 
United Arab Emirates (UAE), which included personnel 
from related units within the Department of Health, as 
well as medical professionals and researchers specializing 
in the field of gynecological cancers, at which we 
introduced our initiatives to support women’s health.
 The participants asked various questions relating to the 
system for taking leave before and after childbirth, and 
childcare leave, as well as questions relating to the high 
share of employees at Kao who take childcare leave, and 
the incorporation of gynecological examinations into 
periodic health check-ups. Despite the cultural and religious 
differences, there was a shared high level of concern 
regarding women’s health, and a shared awareness that this 
issue needs to be addressed at the level of society as a 
whole. Overall, the discussion was very fruitful.

Stakeholder engagement

aimed at reducing malnutrition from a global 
perspective.　

Expectations and suggestions for Kao
The year 2021 saw the holding of the United 
Nations (UN) Food Systems Summit, and of the 
Tokyo N4G Summit.
 Both of these summits made progress toward 
building a framework for activities aimed at the year 
2030, and led to the setting of goals to address the 
problem of malnutrition, in all its forms, through a 
variety of different channels. A complementary 
nutrition-related commitment to action has been 
made, and this is important for the realization of the 
UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
 The recent N4G Summit did not only address 
malnutrition; it also took as one of its themes the 
“double burden” of malnutrition, specifically the 
need for measures to address metabolic syndrome, 
with the need to provide a nutrition-aware diet (in 
other words, a quality-focused diet) and enhanced 
health literacy as key points. The Health and 
Productivity Management and Workforce Nutrition 
initiatives that Kao has been promoting are in 
alignment with these themes.
 The key point to bear in mind when 

implementing a nutrition improvement project, 
working to maintain motivation, or evaluating the 
results achieved through the project, is the need to 
adopt indicators to measure change in actions and 
change in awareness. Kao’s initiatives, which clarify 
the indicators used at each stage, are truly 
outstanding in this respect.
 While focusing on nutrition status in the first 
1,000 days, it can be anticipated that there may be 
cases when nutrition improvement projects will 
want to target women who are of childbearing age. 
It has been suggested that, for them, using 
indicators such as becoming more beautiful and 
developing smooth skin are likely to be effective in 
maintaining motivation. I hope that Kao will keep 
this point in mind when developing its research 
efforts.
 As a sub-event for the Tokyo N4G Summit, 
Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries organized a special session attended by 
senior managers from those companies that made 
formal commitments during the summit. Although 
Kao was unable to participate in this sub-event this 
time, I hope that Kao will participate in similar 
events in the future, as an opportunity to 
disseminate useful information.

Evaluation of Kao’s Initiatives
The Third N4G Summit was held in Tokyo in 
December 2021. As one of its initiatives to 
improve nutrition in the period leading up to 
2030, Kao proposed promoting widespread 
adoption of the Smart WASHOKU® evidence-
based workplace nutrition improvement program. 
The promotion of this nutrition improvement 
program is linked to visualization by means of 
health checks, and to getting people to recognize 
that health improvement is something which they 
can and should tackle themselves. Kao’s 
incorporation into its activities of efforts to 
provide a solution to these issues (including 
Smart WASHOKU® and health literacy 
enhancement) is to be applauded. Activities that 
foster widespread adoption of successful, 
outstanding projects in the nutrition improvement 
field are very important, and can lead to activities

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
As we have several large-scale chemical plants, 
process safety and disaster prevention needs are 
increasingly heightened in the context of accidents at 
chemical plants and the many natural disasters that 
have occurred recently. Given this situation, providing 
a working environment in which all employees can 
work safely is a vitally important issue for the 
enterprise.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
•  Risk of stoppages to operations due to occupational 

illness resulting from critical disasters or 
compromised operating environments

•  Risk of loss of societal trust in the company due to 
the above

Optimistic, energetic employees (what we refer to as “GENKI employees”) are the foundation of Kao’s business activities. We as a company are only as 
strong as the health of our employees.
Besides promoting Health and Productivity Management® and implementing health promotion to maximize employee power and potential, we also expand 
the scope of application of initiatives that have proved to be effective to include other Kao workplaces, the local community and consumers in general.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
We actively work, by means of thorough risk 
assessments, to eradicate the factors which threaten 
the occupational health and safety of all employees, 
thereby creating workplaces where they can work 
energetically in safety, health and peace of mind.

Kao’s creating value
Kao Group Responsible Care (RC) Policy specifies 
occupational safety and health-related activity 
guidelines, and we strive to safeguard the safety and 
health of everyone working at Kao by implementing 
risk assessment of operations, machinery and 
chemical substances, ensuring thorough 
implementation of health check-ups and related 
follow-up, and implementing activities focused on 
mental health.
 We will deliver workplaces which provide job 
satisfaction and peace of mind for employees and for 
their families, by creating pleasant working 
environments.

Contributions to the SDGs

Policies
Activity guidelines to ensure occupational safety and 
health are clearly stipulated in the Kao Group RC 
Policy, which states that we will “strive to create a 
comfortable working environment and improve the 
health of employees” and that we shall “prepare for 
emergencies by conducting periodical training that 
takes into consideration the need to strengthen 
security.” To protect our employees from accidents or 
disasters relating to our business activities while 
maintaining safe and stable operations, when 
occupational accidents occur, we carefully investigate

Education and promotion
To ensure that work can be carried out safely, we draft 
educational plans related to occupational safety and 
health for employees and temporary workers, and 
conduct training for new hires or reassigned 
personnel. We also identify roles that require special 
training, and implement training for those employees 
that require it as needed.
 By implementing education, we are able to share 
information relating to occupational safety and health 
in the workplace, and are able to undertake activities 
aimed at achievement of related targets.
 In addition, we conduct periodic disaster response 
drills (for scenarios such as a major earthquake) and 
regular training in verifying whether employees are 
safe in the event of a disaster, to make sure that we 
will be ready for an emergency.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

We strive to create workplaces where all employees 
can work with safety and peace of mind every day. 
Furthermore, in order to ensure the safety of 
employees of partner companies who work together 
with us at our worksites, we conduct events related to 
safety and disaster prevention, such as emergency 
rescue seminars and fire-extinguishing training, in 

cooperation with partner companies. Every month, 
we share safety-related information̶including case 
studies of occupational accidents within Kao and the 
steps taken in response̶with partner companies, 
and we strive to become an enterprise characterized 
by safety and peace of mind through collaborative 
promotion of safety activities.

Framework

We have established a promotional framework that 
covers the entire Kao Group, and we implement 
responsible care activities through the selection of 
committee members from each division.
 The Kao Group RC Policy and the promotion 
framework and activities can be found on the 
following page.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance
Mid- to long-term targets
We aim to become a company that meets top-level 
occupational safety and health criteria on a global 
basis by 2030.
 We have set ourselves the goals of reducing deaths 
and serious lost-time accidents to zero, reducing the 
lost-time accident frequency rate to 0.10 or less, and, 
with regard to work-related traffic accidents, reducing 
100% negligence accidents causing bodily injury to 
zero, with respect to both Kao employees and 
employees of partner companies, by 2030.
 We will be working steadily to realize these 
targets, with related backcasting goals and activities 
being adopted as annual RC targets.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
By making it possible for all employees to work safely, we will 
ensure that business activities can be carried on normally, 
thereby controlling unnecessary expenditure and reducing 
overall costs, which in turn will lead to higher revenues.

Social impacts
Enabling all employees to work safely, with peace of mind and 
in good health will facilitate the maintenance of normal 
business operation and the stable supply of products. 
Moreover, this can facilitate the stabilization of product prices.

Performance in 2021

Performance
We implemented activities from the two perspectives 
of “Eradication of occupational accidents” and 
“Creating a pleasant working environment and 
improving employees’ health.” More specifically, with 
regard to the eradication of occupational accidents, 
we have focused on promoting measures to prevent 
non-work-related accidents, upgrading safety 
management systems, implementing risk 
assessments for facilities, operations and chemical 
substances, promoting near-miss reporting and 
improvement reporting activities, ensuring thorough 
implementation of safety management for infrequent 
operations, ensuring proper implementation of safety 
training, sharing information about past accidents, 
and working to prevent traffic accidents by 
expanding provision of traffic safety education.
 In the area of creating a pleasant working 
environment and improving employees’ health, we 
have strengthened management of the working 
environment, ensuring effective implementation 
and follow-up of health check-ups, undertaking 
health promotion activities, stress checks and 
implementing risk assessment for chemical 
substances. In addition, at the Health and Safety 
Committee meetings which are regularly held at 
each worksite, we report on activity plans as well 
as giving performance reports, and we disseminate 
this information to employees.

Employee wellbeing & safety 403-2, 403-4 (Occupational health and safety 2018)

Status of occupational accident 
occurrences
In 2021, a total of 143 regular employees and temporary 
workers were involved in occupational accidents, of which 
50 persons lost work days as a result, with no occupational 
illnesses resulting in lost work days recorded. For 
occupational accidents involving subcontractors, the 
number of persons affected was 28, of which 6 suffered 
injuries resulting in lost work days.
 In China, there was a fatal accident involving a fall, 
affecting a subcontractor. We investigated the actual cause 
of the accident and strengthened preventive measures to 
prevent reoccurrence.
 The most common types of accidents among regular 
employees and temporary workers were slip and fall 
accidents due to carelessness and insufficient confirmation 
(51 employees), accidents involving reactional action (22 
employees) and collisions (15 employees). As slip and fall 
accidents have been the most common type of accident in 
recent years, in implementing our activities we have focused 
mainly on strategies to prevent slip and fall accidents.

Risk assessment of chemical 
substances

As many kinds of chemical substances are handled at our 
manufacturing locations, the risk of damage to human 
health and of environmental pollution is not negligible. With 
this in mind, we evaluate the impacts on people and the 
environment and make provisions to reduce these risks.
 In addition, when installing additional equipment or making 

Our initiatives

changes to existing equipment, and when changing the types 
of raw materials used, we assess the potential impact on 
human health and on the environment in advance as needed.
 These measures have been implemented in response to 
the UN’s Strategic Approach to International Chemicals 
Management (SAICM) initiative.

Expansion of the “no accidents 
with lost work days award system” 
improving safety awareness

With the aim of further strengthening safety awareness, starting 
from 2016 the scope of application of the “no accidents with lost 
work days award system” was expanded to include not only 
plants in Japan but also plants outside Japan. In addition, starting 
from 2021, the scope of application of the safety awards systems 
(including both the “no accidents with lost work days award 
system” and the “traffic safety award system”) was expanded to 
include sales companies and logistics companies in Japan that 
have had significant numbers of occupational accidents.
 In 2021, a total of two plants in Japan, six plants 
outside Japan and five logistics sites received awards.

Sharing safety messages 
globally
With the aim of enhancing safety awareness globally, 
since 2017 we have had the company’s safety slogans 
translated into local languages at our worksites 
outside Japan, and the safety posters on which the 
President appears have been shared globally, being 
displayed at worksites both within and outside Japan.
 Starting from 2018, the safety poster messages 
have been chosen in a global competition.
 In 2021, the message proposed by Fatty Chemical 
(Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. was chosen as the best entry. 
Safety posters using this message were created and 
distributed for display at Kao affiliates both within and 
outside Japan. We also disseminated the President’s 
safety message to all Kao Group companies, both 
within and outside Japan, in video format.
 Going forward, we will continue to promote this 
activity, so as to strengthen safety consciousness on a 
global scale.

The safety poster featuring the company president was 
deployed in 12 different local languages
(Clockwise from top left: Japanese, English, French, 
Chinese [simplified])

Creating a pleasant working 
environment for employees
Besides striving to create a pleasant working 
environment at all worksites, in order to ensure 
compliance with working environment standards and 
relevant laws in each country, we implement surveys 
of the working environment on a regular basis, and 
undertake improvement and maintenance 
management of the workplace environment.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Social issues we are aware of
Chemicals foster our lifestyles and are essential for 
the enrichment of the lives of people globally. On the 
other hand, chemicals can have negative impact on 
human health and the environment.
 The global chemicals market is expected to double 
by 2030 compared to 2017, and environmental 
releases of chemical substances are also expected to 
increase.
 This issue was raised at the 5th United Nations 
Environment Assembly (UNEA-5; held in February 
2021), where chemical pollution was recognized as a 
threat along with climate change and the loss of 
biodiversity. In addition, consumers are becoming 
increasingly concerned.
 At UNEA-5, however, it was suggested that these 
areas are interconnected and have common causes 
and that if they are addressed in an integrated 
manner, interconnected and mutual benefits will be 
delivered, and therefore, chemicals management that 
goes beyond simple reduction is needed.

Kao believes that it is important for people around the world to enjoy the benefits provided by chemicals and to have safety and peace of mind in society with 
the proper management of the risks of chemicals. Through its ESG (environmental, social, governance) initiatives, Kao will take the lead in responsible 
chemicals management to help realize such a society.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
If chemicals are not properly managed, there can be 
adverse effects on human health, the environment 
and society, which can make it difficult to continue 
our business.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
By promoting responsible chemicals management 
that includes measures against climate change and 
biodiversity loss as well, we are contributing to the 
realization of a sustainable society and gaining 
opportunities to earn the trust of society.

Kao’s creating value
We have endeavored to actively undertake chemicals 
management in accordance with the Strategic 
Approach to International Chemicals Management 
(SAICM), an international target for 2020. Based on 
the results of these activities, we have started new 
chemicals management promotion activities centered 
on the responsible chemicals management of the 
Kirei Lifestyle Plan (KLP), our ESG Strategy for the 
period until 2030. Through these activities and by 
applying the Comprehensive Management System for 
Chemical Substances that can respond to substances 
of high social concern, we are contributing to the 
creation of safety and peace of mind in society where 

people around the world can enjoy the benefits of 
chemicals and their risks are properly managed.

Policies

We believe in a safe society where people around the 
world can enjoy the benefits provided by chemicals with 
peace of mind. To that end, the risks associated with 
chemicals should be properly managed. Through our 
ESG initiatives, we want to take the lead in responsible 
chemicals management to help actualize such a society.
 With “walking the right path” as the foundation of 
our activities, we are voluntarily and strategically 
taking action with a focus on the following three 
activities, understanding the essence and values of 
international rules, the laws and regulations of each 
country and region, and voluntary standards of 
industry groups and so on relating to chemicals.

(1)  Develop products and processes with low 
environmental impact

・  Minimize environmental impact throughout the 
product lifecycle

(2)  Use management systems* to optimize risk 
assessment methods, assess risks and 
strengthen risk management

・  Optimize risk assessment methods for efficient 
chemicals management

・  Foster community safety and a sense of trust by 
having zero chemical accidents

*  Chemical information, safety information, legal information, volume 
and application information, etc.

(3)  Actively disclose information concerning 
benefits, safety and our activities and engage 
in continuous communication

・  Make information on chemicals’ benefits and 

safety available in an accessible and easy-to-
understand way

・  Effectively communicate with all people around the 
world to earn trust

Education and promotion

To raise awareness of chemicals management and deepen 
correct understanding among employees, we continuously 
provide training and lectures conducted by outside experts. 
In FY2021, we implemented the following programs.
・  Briefings on chemical laws and regulations for 

workers who handle chemicals
・  Training on the hazards of chemicals at 

manufacturing workplaces
・  Lecture by an outside expert entitled Material Cycle 

and Management: Thinking from the Perspectives 
and Trends Required for a Sustainable Society

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

Mutual understanding is essential for stakeholders 
including consumers to use chemicals safely and lead 

safe lives with peace of mind. We share information 
about chemical risks with stakeholders to reach a 
common understanding (risk communication), and 
ensure community safety and trust via communication.

1.  Collaboration and communication with 
consumers

We engage in continuous communication relating to 
chemical risks so that products can be used safely 
and with peace of mind.
・ Collaboration on university courses

・  Communication with local residents
Our plants in Japan continuously disseminate 
information on their initiatives relating to chemicals 
handled at the plants through plant site reports so that 
neighborhood residents can live with peace of mind.

2. Collaboration with customers and distributors
We share and manage information with customers 
and distributors so that chemicals can be handled 
safely throughout the supply chain and the maximum 
benefits of chemicals can be derived.

Providing information on chemicals in products
In September 2017 we became the first in the 
industry to adopt chemSHERPA*1, an information 
communication scheme for chemical substances in 
products developed under the initiative of the 
Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, 
and we have continued our efforts to use regulatory 
information on chemicals contained in industrial 
products in the supply chain.
*1  chemSHERPA 

A new scheme that facilitates sharing information on chemical 
substances in products across the entire supply chain to address 
broadening regulations and appropriately manage chemical 
substances contained in products on an ongoing basis

GHS-compliant SDS*  and product labeling
We issued SDS that comply with the GHS rules of 
each country and region and applied product labels so 
that industrial products can be used properly in 
accordance with local laws and regulations.
*2  SDS 

Safety Data Sheet 
Document providing information to ensure safe and appropriate 
handling of chemicals, such as names of substances contained in 
the product, information about potential hazards and handling 
precautions

Information provision and sharing via a private 
network
We use a private network with industrial product sales 
distributors to provide information online such as SDS 
and chemSHERPA-CI*3 and hold information sharing 
sessions*4 to continuously encourage chemicals 
management throughout supply chains.
 In October, we conducted biennial online training 
for new employees of sales distributors and explained 
about chemicals management.
*3  chemSHERPA-CI 

Data entry support tool and output format for communicating 
information on specified chemical substances

*4 Including online sessions

3. Collaboration with administrative bodies
We held four meetings with government agencies to 
exchange information so that we can deepen trust 
with regulatory authorities involved with chemicals 
and promote better chemicals management as a 
company that handles chemicals.
 Topics: ESG investment and financing, optimal 
chemicals management in the future, regulatory 
amendments, information transfer and use

4. Collaboration with industry organizations
We have participated in various activities to contribute 
to chemicals management in industries.
 In 2021, a roadmap and assessment results for 
revision of the REACH, CLP, and Cosmetic Products 
Regulations pursuant to the EU’s Chemicals Strategy 

for Sustainability were released. To minimize the 
impact on our future business, we communicated 
with the government through industry groups in 
which we play important roles.

In addition, we planned a forum for dialogue among 
key persons in industry, government and academia in 
Japan, shared our understanding of new ways of 
chemicals management, and broadly presented the 
details to the public through papers and seminar 
presentations. Through these initiatives, we worked to 
gain the trust of society and enhance corporate value.

Responsible chemicals management 102-20

Framework

In addition to “Responsible chemicals management,” we 
formulated the KLP for chemicals including “Safer 
healthier products” and “Full transparency,” and we 
created a framework in which suitable divisions take 
action for each objective and can collaborate at any time.
 The responsible chemicals management 
referenced in this chapter is led by the SAICM 
Promotion Committee, which was established in 2012 
under the ESG Managing Committee, which is 
chaired by the President and Chief Executive Officer, 
to strategically address international goals relating to 
chemicals management.
 The SAICM Promotion Committee is chaired by 
the Managing Executive Officer responsible for 
overseeing the Product Quality Management, and 
members are chosen from key divisions. Proposed 
initiatives are reflected on the day-to-day operations of 
individual divisions. A sound decision-making process 
is maintained by having the decisions made reported 
to the ESG Managing Committee, the Management 
Board or the Executive Officers Meeting, as 
appropriate, at least once a year.
 The committee identified five new core promotion 
activities in 2021 and has established teams 
corresponding to each to undertake action. In addition 
to meetings by individual teams, the SAICM 
Promotion Committee meets three to four times a 
year to conduct planning, receive progress reports, 
review projects, propose and discuss new issues, and 
listen to lectures by outside experts.

Responsible chemicals management 102-11

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance
1. Mid-term targets / 2030 long-term targets
As our interim targets for 2030, we formulated the Kao 
Group Mid-term Plan 2025 (K25) to make Kao a 
company with a global presence, valuable to society. For 
the first target, “Become an essential company in a 
sustainable world,” measures to solve global 
environmental issues will be essential. With “walking the 
right path” as the starting point for our activities, we set 
the following targets to be achieved by 2030 in order to 
develop our business activities in a sustainable manner 
by implementing responsible chemicals management.

(1)  Develop products and processes with lower 
environmental impact

We will contribute to the creation of a sustainable 
society by proposing to society the development and 
manufacture of products that minimize the 
environmental impact of chemicals in all stages of the 
product lifecycle, from raw material procurement to 
development, manufacturing, sales, use, disposal and 
recycling and by promoting the implementation of 
such activities in cooperation with society.

(2)  Use management systems to optimize risk 
assessment methods, assess risks and 
strengthen risk management

We will develop optimal chemicals risk assessment 
methods, use management systems, and promote 
reinforcement of actual risk assessment and management. 
We will strive to achieve zero accidents at plants to ensure 

safety and foster a sense of trust in local communities. In 
addition, we will share the results of research on 
optimization of risk assessment methods and assessment 
results with society to contribute to the appropriate and 
efficient management of chemicals risk throughout society.

(3)  Actively disclose information concerning 
benefits, safety and our activities and engage 
in continuous communication

We will foster the trust and confidence of society 
related to chemicals by providing accurate and easy-
to-understand information on chemicals and our 
specific initiatives and by conducting ongoing 
communications with stakeholders.

We formulated and announced indicators (KPIs) 
regarding this approach in 2020.
KPI 1:  Percentage of chemical products and raw 

materials with disclosed information on benefits 
and safety to ensure safe usage for our customers

KPI 2:  Percentage of areas where impacts on health, 
environment and safety from chemicals are 
managed responsibly and sustainably 
considering their stages from raw materials 
procurement to disposal

2.  Anticipated social impact from achieving 
mid- to long-term targets

(1)  We will reduce the environmental impact of 
chemicals throughout society by continuously 

supplying to markets products developed to minimize 
environmental impact throughout the supply chain.

(2)  Our risk assessment methods can be utilized throughout 
society, and it is expected that the level and efficiency of 
chemicals management in society as a whole will be 
improved by sharing research findings of risk 
assessment method optimization and risk assessment 
results with government agencies and industry groups.

(3)  Stakeholders’ accurate knowledge of chemicals and 
products containing chemicals and their proper 
handling will be improved, thereby fostering safety and 
peace of mind and the trust of society, by disclosing 
information on chemicals and by enhancing 
communication using such information to a wide range 
of stakeholders including consumers, customers, 
employees, distributors and government agencies.

3. Business impacts / Social impacts
Business impacts
By developing products with lower environmental impact 
and continuously bringing them to market, we will 
increase our market share for environmentally friendly 
products, leading to sustainable business growth.

Social impacts
By further strengthening cooperation with industry, 
government and academia and sharing and collaborating 
with society regarding chemicals management 
initiatives, we will ensure the safety and peace of mind 
of people and contribute to solving various social 
problems including environmental problems.

Responsible chemicals management

Performance in 2021

We conducted activities in line with the plan for 
2021. We are continuing our efforts to minimize 
the risk from chemicals through product and 
process development, safety assessments and 
on-site risk management, and to earn the public 
trust and peace of mind regarding chemicals 
through communication including information 
disclosure.

(1)  Develop products and processes with 
lower environmental impact

•  Developed products that contribute to improving 
use of sustainable raw materials, reducing LC-
CO2, conserving water and reducing waste

(2)  Use management systems to optimize risk 
assessment methods, assess risks and 
strengthen risk management

•  Reviewed the selection criteria for Kao priority 
assessment substances and selected assessment 
substances for the next ten years

•  Published a paper about using environmental 
RNA to improve the precision of ecological 
surveys for biodiversity preservation

•  Started creating a system for centralized 
management of environmental safety information 
relating to chemicals in order to reinforce 
chemicals risk management at Kao plants

KPI: Percentage of areas where impacts on health, 
environment and safety from chemicals are managed 
responsibly and sustainably considering their stages 
from raw materials procurements to disposal
We continued to manage impacts on health, 
environment and safety at business sites (GHS 
indication, SDS updates, risk assessments), taking 
into consideration stages from raw materials 
procurements to disposal; 96% of Kao plants

(3)  Actively disclose information concerning 
benefits, safety and our activities and 
engage in continuous communication

•  Created communication materials for accurate 
understanding of the risks and benefits of 
chemicals

•  Amid rising anxiety and expectations regarding 
chemicals, started investigating the thoughts of 
consumers, their background and methods of 
communication to address concerns

KPI: Percentage of chemical products and raw 
materials with disclosed information on benefits 
and safety to ensure safe usage for our customers
We released three safety summaries on Kao priority 
assessment substances evaluated in 2019 (the 
release rate was 14% of the target through 2030) and 
28 GPS Safety Summaries for chemical products.

•  Conducted an exchange of opinions with 
university students relating to chemicals to solve 
the environmental problems

•  Disclosed our policies relating to ingredients of high 
social concern and fragrance ingredient names

In the above efforts, we applied the Comprehensive 
Management System for Chemical Substances and 
endeavored to manage and disclose information on 
safety evaluations results, volume management, 
regulations and substances of high social concern.

The Comprehensive Management System for Chemical Substances provides a database of information on the 
raw materials included in products from industrial to consumer products. The system makes it possible to verify 
the quality, safety, anti-bacterial grade, regulatory and other information on raw materials used in each product. 
If a problem with a raw material arises, or if risk from a new substance of concern emerges, we can rapidly 
identify the scope of impact and take appropriate action.
 We continuously enhance the functions of the system, which aims to manage the latest information related 
to chemical substances used in our products, to adapt to global changes in regulatory requirements and our 
business expansion into new business fields and regions.

Reviews of performance
In our efforts relating to chemicals 
management, we updated our framework 
looking ahead to 2030, formulated an 
activity plan, and steadily implemented 
the 2021 plan. In particular, we worked to 
earn the trust of society by disclosing 
information and engaging in 
communication, and the results of these 
efforts led to the awards. We also actively 
tackled new issues (for example, 
establishing a highly precise ecological 
survey method for conserving biodiversity 
by focusing on environmental RNA) in 
response to growing social interest and 
advances in science and technology.
 Internationally, more ambitious 
stakeholder partnership and collaboration 
is being required for sound chemicals and 
waste management.
 We will contribute to the development 
of a sustainable society by 
comprehensively working on problem 
solving through the fusion of individual 
activities and cooperation with society.

Activity topics

Create forums for dialogue among industry, 
government and academia for social 
implementation of chemicals management
In 2021, in addition to climate change and biodiversity 
loss, the international goals of chemical management 
toward post-SAICM were discussed within and 
outside Japan. It is necessary that all stakeholders 
work together more ambitiously to tackle the various 
chemical substance issues that cannot be solved by 
individual companies on their own (Federal Ministry 
for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear 
Safety, and Consumer Protection, Germany, 2021).
 In order to link past achievements and issues of 
industry, government and academia in Japan to the 
next decade’s efforts to implement chemicals 
management in society, at the 51st Safety 
Engineering Symposium (hosted by the Science 
Council of Japan), issues and measures looking ahead 
to 2030 were discussed and a certain degree of 
common understanding was achieved. We 
participated as a speaker and an organizer, performed 
planning, created opportunities for dialogue, 
coordinated common understanding and documented 
the results.

Common understanding achieved through 
dialogue
Target: Create and independently use a next-
generation framework through public–private 
partnerships in which materials circulate in the supply 
chain without regulation, information is transmitted in 
a value-communicating manner, and knowledge is 
passed on
Background:
•  Changes in society and the environment, limitations 

of regulations due to diversification, increasing 
expectations for self-management

•  Necessity of materials circulation in the chemical 
lifecycle from manufacturing to disposal and 
recycling

In recognition of these results and the results of 
efforts to date, the Society for Risk Analysis Japan 
awarded the Good Practice Award to the industrial, 
governmental and academic stakeholders in Japan 
involved in the promotion of SAICM.

Responsible chemicals management 102-44

Kao’s response to the views expressed last year

In 2021, Dr. Kitano indicated that he expected us to 
engage in new ways of communication targeting 
residents near plants and consumers and to conduct 
chemical safety education for elementary and junior 
high school students.
 In response to this expectation, we disclosed our 
vision and activities for sound chemical management 
beyond 2020 in the site reports of plants in Japan and 
continued dialogues with local residents. In addition, 
since educational support is linked to future 
generations, we conducted chemicals communication 
with university students in cooperation with 
Musashino University in January and with the 
Department of Environment, Saitama Prefecture and 
the Nippon Institute of Technology in July. We also 
organized a panel discussion open to the public for 
dialogue among industry, government and academia 
to discuss new collaboration and disseminate 
information within and outside of Japan for the social 
implementation of chemicals management.
 We continue to promote chemicals 
management in order to fulfill our responsibilities as 
a company that handles household products and 
industrial chemicals.

Dr. Masaru Kitano
President, Akikusa Gakuen Junior College

Stakeholder engagement

In November 2021, stakeholders in industry, 
government and academia involved in the 
promotion of SAICM received the Good Practice 
Award for social implementation of 
comprehensive risk management of chemicals 
through SAICM from the Society for Risk Analysis 
Japan. With respect to industry in particular, I 
believe that the results of the three projects that 
Kao had been implementing under the SAICM 
Promotion Committee since 2012 have made 
significant contributions.
 The five approaches indicated below for 
achieving the vision for 2030 were announced.

1.  Minimize environmental impact throughout the 
product lifecycle 

2.  Foster community safety and a sense of trust 
by having zero chemical accidents 

3.  Optimize risk assessment methods for efficient 
chemicals management 

4.  Make information on chemicals’ benefits and 
safety available in an accessible and easy-to-
understand way 

5.  Effectively communicate with all people around 
the world to earn trust

It goes without saying that all of these are 
important for responsible chemicals 
management.

 I will present my opinions from the 
perspective of the SDGs with respect to 1 and 5.
 Environmental impact is defined in the Basic 
Act on the Environment as “negative effects of 
human activities on the environment which may 
cause hindrances to environmental 
conservation.” The causes of environmental 
conservation issues include not only pollution, 
such as air pollution and water pollution, but also 
resource depletion.
 Specifically, it is necessary to develop 
biodegradable products and switch to sustainable 
raw materials including renewable raw materials 
and recycled materials.
 Responsible consumption and production by 
consumers and industries, respectively, are 
essential in order to maximize the benefits of 
chemical substances and use them wisely. To this 
end, ensuring trust based on the communication 
specified in 4 and 5 is the most important issue. 
Fortunately, consumer confidence in Kao products 
is high when viewed from the perspective of sales 
as well.
 In the future, consumers will select products 
more from the perspective of reliable quality than 
price, which includes not only performance, but 
also environmental impact.
 I look forward to your efforts as a top runner 
toward the fulfillment of the five policies listed above.

Corporate governance 102-18, 102-22, 102-23, 102-24, 102-26

Basic policy
In order to sustainably enhance corporate value over 
the long term while working to realize a Kirei World in 
which all life lives in harmony, which is our purpose, 
and to become an essential company in a sustainable 
world, as raised in K25, Kao positions corporate 
governance as a top-priority management issue and 
continuously strengthens governance in both systems 
and operations. Kao’s corporate governance is a 
framework for transparent, fair, prompt and decisive 
decision-making. It takes into account the 
perspectives of all stakeholders and responds in a 
timely and appropriate manner to changes that are 
increasingly diverse, complex, and difficult to predict 
so that we can contribute to society and continuously 
enhance corporate value. The foundations of our 
efforts to achieve this are establishing and operating 
the necessary management structures and internal 
control systems, implementing the necessary 
measures in a timely manner, and demonstrating 
accountability. In addition, we work to understand 
social trends at all times and actively engage in 
dialogue with stakeholders to review the status of 
corporate governance from time to time and 
implement appropriate and necessary 
countermeasures and improvements.

Features of Kao’s corporate governance
To realize a Kirei World 
in which all life lives in 
harmony

We position the establishment of effective corporate governance systems as the foundation and a driver for achieving our purpose to realize a Kirei World in which all life lives in harmony.

Integrity as the only 
choice

We practice corporate governance that places our corporate philosophy, the Kao Way, at the core of our business management, and with a consistent focus on Integrity as the only choice, which is 
one of values of the Kao Way. Employees work together based on mutual respect and fairness, bring an attitude of sincerity and diligence, and conduct themselves lawfully and ethically, and by so 
doing we are able to maintain the support and trust of all stakeholders and engage in sound and honest business activities.

Innovation for today and 
tomorrow

We have pursued creation of the most optimal structure to respond to changes in the business environment as well as social demands. At the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held in March 
2022, we appointed nine Directors, including one American Director and two female Directors, in order to ensure greater diversity on the Board of Directors and to further strengthen oversight in 
decision-making from the ESG management and global perspectives that Kao seeks. We are working to enhance corporate value by reviewing our systems and operations to achieve a higher level of 
corporate governance.

Use of outside 
executives

We have put in place a system of governance able to maintain a high degree of objectivity, including making 7 of the 14 members of the Board of Directors/Audit & Supervisory Board Members 
independent and outside members and having an Outside Director serve as Chairperson of the Board of Directors, to ensure that the Board of Directors is able to appropriately perform management 
oversight. Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members are designated with priority placed on their independence as well as their expertise and high-level insight. They oversee 
and audit planning and execution of business strategy and the like from their diverse viewpoints, facilitating effective and judicious decision-making.

Strengthening internal 
control

The Internal Control Committee leads discussions on compliance, risk and crisis management, and related topics across the Kao Group to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our business 
processes, ensure the credibility of our financial reporting, comply with laws and regulations in our business activities, and preserve our assets, and we are strengthening internal control throughout 
the Kao Group.

Stance on balance among 
knowledge, experience and 
skills, and on diversity and the 
size of the Board of Directors

At the Board of Directors meetings, Directors present 
the major directions of management strategies, etc., 
and Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board 
Members deliberate on their appropriateness and 
risks involved in their implementation from objective 
and multifaceted perspectives, while appropriately 
supervising and auditing the execution of these 
strategies. To this end, we believe that it is essential 
that Inside and Outside Directors and Audit & 
Supervisory Board Members with diverse knowledge, 
experience, and skills exchange opinions and engage 
in constructive dialogue from a variety of 
perspectives.
 Based on the vision of “protecting future lives” 
and promoting “sustainability as the only path,” as 
stated in K25 in order to realize a Kirei World in which 
all life lives in harmony, which is our purpose, we 
deliver products and services that protect the healthy 
lives of people and consumers and customers by 
leveraging our advanced technologies developed 
through extensive R&D including fundamental 
research from an ESG perspective. In addition, we 
make further strategic investments and expand 
existing businesses with the aim of creating new 

business that protect future lives by utilizing digital 
transformation with an eye toward the global 
environment and human life. To support these 
activities, we supervise from objective and diverse 
perspectives and build systems that can be verified 
from professional perspectives such as accounting, 
finance, and legal with the aim of achieving 
continuous improvement.
 To achieve these objectives, the Board of Directors 
considers it is important for Inside and Outside 
Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members to 
complement each other with each of their knowledge, 
experience, and abilities and to be able to 
demonstrate high effectiveness as a whole.
 In addition to knowledge, experience and ability, 
we recognize the diverse perspectives that come from 
diversity of the Board of Directors in terms of gender, 
nationality, race and age contribute to the promotion 
of business, global expansion and proper supervision 
and auditing, and promotes the appointment of such 
diverse personnel as Directors and Audit & 
Supervisory Board Members. Our target for the ratio 
of female on the Board of Directors is 30% by 2025.
 We set the appropriate size of the Board of 
Directors in consideration of the balance between 
having diverse personnel required to conduct the 
proper deliberations and supervision of execution and 
a small Board of Directors to accelerate decision-
making for dealing with business expansion and other 
matters, on the premise of the delegation of 

Corporate governance 

responsibility to appropriately placed Executive 
Officers. We aim to have Outside Directors comprise 
approximately half of the Board of Directors to ensure 
its diversity and influence and emphasizes their 
independence. In addition, we aim to have a majority 
of Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members who 
meet the Standards for Independence.

The Board of Directors deliberates on major 
management directions from multiple perspectives, 
including risk assessment, and supervises the 
appropriate execution of management strategy. It also 
puts in place an environment conducive to offensive 
management that clearly identifies risks, by 
establishing an internal control system and risk 
management system. In FY2021, the Board discussed 
many topics under K25, engaging in free and open 
exchanges of opinions. In addition to the items noted 
below, the board receives business execution reports 
from Directors serving as Executive Officers, and 
receiving reports on matters discussed during 
meetings of the Management Board from the 
Executive Officer in charge (the Board met 15 times in 
FY2021).

Initiatives to ensure full utilization of the functions of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members 

Specific Initiatives
Frequency 
of imple-

mentation
Content

Provision of information 
prior to meetings of the 

Board of Directors
Monthly

To facilitate productive discussions at meetings of the Board of Directors, relevant materials are 
distributed beforehand to promote understanding of matters such as the background, purpose and 
content of agenda items.

An Outside Director 
serves as Chairperson 

of the Board of 
Directors

―
By appointing an Outside Director to serve as Chairperson of the Board of Directors, an environment has 
been created that fosters the eliciting of views based on a perspective that is neutral and independent 
from the executive function, thereby facilitating more appropriate discussion.

Arranging for the 
Chairperson of the 

Board of Directors to sit 
in on meetings of the 
Management Board

Three 
to four 
times a 
month

Having the Chairperson of the Board sit in on meetings of the Management Board, which constitutes 
the highest executive decision-making body, creates opportunities for the Chairperson to directly access 
information relating to important executive issues and the state of discussion regarding those issues. 
When meetings of the Board of Directors are held, the Chairperson can share the information he/she 
possesses regarding the background to the issues with the other Outside Directors, which makes it easier 
to get to the heart of the discussions more quickly.

Arranging for Outside 
Directors to attend  
R&D presentations

Annually

Having Outside Directors sit in on R&D presentations creates opportunities for them to directly access 
internal information relating to R&D strategy and the state of progress in R&D, etc. Giving Outside 
Directors a more in-depth understanding of internal activities in this way leads to invigorated discussion 
in meetings of the Board of Directors.

Holding meetings at 
which Outside Directors 
and Audit & Supervisory 

Board Members can 
exchange views

Three 
times a 

year

In creating regular opportunities for meetings, the aim is to facilitate the active exchange of views 
regarding issues identified during auditing conducted by Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and the 
making of proposals to address these issues where necessary.

Worksite Visits Twice a 
year

Having Outside Directors and Outside Audit Supervisory Board Members visit Kao’s overseas and 
domestic markets, offices, factories and retailers creates opportunities for them to directly access 
information relating to the frontline of our operations. Since FY2020, due to the spread of the COVID-19 
pandemic, visits were made only to worksites within Japan.

Corporate governance 102-26

Initiatives to enhance the 
effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Kao is implementing the following initiatives to 
ensure that the Board of Directors and Audit & 
Supervisory Board Members fulfills its roles and 
responsibilities in relation to oversight of operational 

execution and decision-making. The effectiveness of 
the Board of Directors is being enhanced by 
promoting the timely and appropriate provision of 
information to Outside Directors and by fostering 
open, frank and constructive discussion and 
exchange of views between Outside and Inside

Results of evaluation of the effectiveness in FY2019

Main implementation items

•  Human capital strategy: A certain amount of discussion was held on finding 
and developing global and diverse human resources, and a common 
understanding of the issues was achieved.

•   Interactive communication between management and execution: Several 
Executive Officers made presentations and discussed forward-looking 
mid- to long-term strategy with the Board of Directors, deepening mutual 
understanding through a direct exchange of opinions.

•  Internal controls: The number of incidents of negative information being sent 
to the Board of Directors and the pace of sending that information improved.

•  Deep discussion on the ESG Strategy resulted in a public declaration of intent.

Future issues

●  Human capital strategy: Deeper discussion will be conducted on finding and 
developing young human capital, using human resources from external sources 
as well as human resource requirements and training plan based on ideals.

●  Internal controls: Further improvements are needed in getting reports from 
operational sites and in facilitating cross-division cooperation. Discussions 
on the background and core elements of events that have happened are 
also needed.

●  It is also necessary to set aside time to discuss key directions of the Kao 
Group, such as the mid-term plan, human capital strategy, global strategy, 
and M&A strategy.

Main implementation items

•  There was discussion on whether or not the degree of achievement of K20 
was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

•  The process of formulating K25 involved a lively exchange of opinions and 
adequate discussion over an extended period of time, which deserves a 
positive evaluation.

•  The composition of the Board of Directors is well-balanced and with 
inappropriate levels for realization of K25.

•  The main direction was fully discussed through deliberation on K25.

Future issues

•  In order to achieve K25, it is necessary to continue discussions on 
mechanisms for monitoring progress, large-scale investment and strategic 
measures, and solutions to circumstances that hinder implementation.

•  Human capital strategy: We should deepen the discussion on the ideal 
direction, as well as discussion on how to retain and cultivate the types of 
human capital that are needed in order to realize K25.

•  Internal controls: Development of systems and operational adequacy need 
to be supervised at all times so that controls can function more effectively.

•  The diversity of the Board of Directors and Executive Officers should be 
discussed and improved.

•  Further discussion is needed regarding global strategies and M&A strategies.

Results of evaluation of the effectiveness in FY2020

Main implementation items

●  The principal themes of K25 were frequently raised by the Board of 
Directors, with active discussions conducted in a timely manner.

●  Measures that emphasize the furtherance of K25 are being conducted, 
including promotion of global-minded personnel and young employees, 
and active utilization of external human capital. Also, a report was made 
on the introduction status of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), a new 
management tool for activating personal growth.

●  Negative information and risk information were appropriately reported in a 
timely manner. In addition, the system now enables rapid response when 
problems occur.

●  A system that enables appropriate monitoring has been established and is 
in operation. The head of the ESG Division reports on its activities, and there 
are reports on other agenda items that touch on their relevance to ESG. 

Future issues

●   It is also necessary to deepen discussions on issues that hinder the 
realization of K25, measures to solve them, and actions that should be 
prioritized, and to conduct periodic verification with a greater awareness of 
the PDCA cycle for the realization of K25.

●   Human capital strategy is a management issue for ongoing consideration, 
and it is necessary to deepen discussions of issues including the promotion 
of human capital needed for realizing K25, assignment and training of 
human capital for that purpose, and the evaluation of executive staff.

●   It is necessary to continuously verify and discuss whether potential internal control 
issues are latent in the organization and ongoing supervision is also necessary 
because problems may arise that were not apparent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

●   It is desirable to further enhance reports on the status of specific activities in 
each country and division, sharing of information on comparison between 
Kao’s ESG activities and social trends and other matters, and how to 
communicate externally and collaborate with other companies.

Results of evaluation of the effectiveness in FY2021

Corporate governance 

On an annual basis, an evaluation is conducted 
at a meeting of the Board of Directors, in order 
to make improvements aimed at enhancing the 
effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Kao 
believes that it is effective for all of those who 
participate in meetings of the Board of 
Directors to perform evaluation by expressing 
their own opinions and engaging in free and 
open discussions, and so evaluation of Board 
effectiveness is performed using self-
assessment. For the FY2021 evaluation, once 
again, a survey was conducted, and feedback 
on the survey results were provided before 
engaging in discussion and exchange of 
opinions.

Activities and evaluation of 
effectiveness in FY2021
The main activities of Audit & Supervisory Board 
Members in FY2021 are as indicated in the table on 
the right. The Audit & Supervisory Board conducts an 
annual effectiveness evaluation to improve the 
effectiveness of audit activities every year. It 
determines evaluation items mainly focused on main 
audit items, each Audit & Supervisory Board Member 
makes evaluation by him/herself and they discuss the 
result of the evaluation and identify issues at the Audit 
& Supervisory Board. The Audit & Supervisory Board 
reflects the results in its next year’s plan and strive to 
continuously improve effectiveness. The Audit & 
Supervisory Board deliberated on the results of the 
evaluation of the effectiveness of audit activities for 
FY2021 and concluded that it was functioning 
effectively. The Audit & Supervisory Board will also 
focus on information disclosures that satisfy the 
demands of society and stakeholders in the coming 
fiscal year.

Activities and evaluation of effectiveness in FY2021

Main Audit 
Items

Main activities (numbers of times are results for FY2021) Evaluation of effectiveness and identified issues

Directors’ 
execution of 

duties

•  Attended meetings of the Board of Directors (15 meetings), checked deliberations 
and resolutions, and expressed opinions, as necessary.

•  Held meetings to exchange opinions with the Representative Directors of Kao and 
its important subsidiaries (6 meetings) as well as with the Outside Directors (3 
meetings) and shared findings obtained from audit activities and made advices.

•  Attended meetings of the Board of Directors and other 
important meetings and spoke without restrictions and 
audit the status of deliberations.

•  In the first year of K25, Audit & Supervisory Board 
Members frankly shared awareness of issues at 
meetings with Representative Directors, confirmed 
the degree of penetration of K25 through interviews 
focusing on dialogue with each division and group 
company, and worked to improve the effectiveness of 
supervision.

•  Progress is being made on new challenges, the 
conventional approach still continues, and in the next 
fiscal year Audit & Supervisory Board will focus on the 
effects of structural reforms and the speeding up of 
implementation.

•  Attended important meetings such as meetings of Management Board, 
Committee, and Internal Control Committee (139 meetings), verified the decision-
making process, and requested explanations, as necessary, and made advices from 
time to time.

•  Verified the degree to which 
K25 had been instilled in Kao’s 
worksites, divisions, and domestic 
and overseas group companies by 
conducting dialog-oriented on-site 
visits and interviews.

•  Attended meetings of the Committee for the Examination of the Nominees for 
Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members, the Compensation Advisory 
Committee for Directors and Executive Officers, and Compensation Advisory 
Committee for Audit & Supervisory Board Members for review and discussion.

Internal 
controls

•  Audited the status of business execution and the establishment and operation of 
internal control systems for worksites, divisions, and domestic and overseas Group 
companies.

•  Audited the status of monitoring with the divisions who are in charges of second 
line of the internal control, such as the Legal and Governance Department and the 
Risk Management and Responsible Care.

•  The above on-site visits and interviews were conducted as in previous years (115) 
while making use of remote auditing techniques such as online meetings in timely 
manner. Approximately 70% of such procedures were attended by at least one 
Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member.

•  The “system to supervise Directors” was generally 
appropriate, as it simultaneously checked the status of 
the development and operation of the internal control 
system. FY2021 was focused on the speed of self-
inspection and improvement in the first line of internal 
control, and the monitoring status in the second line, 
confirming the improvement against the issues in the 
previous fiscal year.

•  The effectiveness of on-site visits and interviews was 
improved as a result of the measures described on the 
left.

•  Going forward, Audit & Supervisory Board will focus on 
steady operation and consideration of diversity such as 
monitoring methods for overseas group companies and 
cooperation with business partners.

•  To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of audits, interviews focused on 
specific topics and the exchange of opinions. The interview method has been 
improved by reconfirming the previously identified issues at the start, arranging the 
Audit & Supervisory Board Members’ comments into requests and advice at the 
end, and extracting and sharing best practices.

Group 
governance

•  Exchanged opinions with the Department of Internal Audit, which is an internal 
audit division, on a regular basis and as-needed basis to improve the effectiveness 
of audits.

•  The Audit & Supervisory Board is promoting co-working 
with the Department of Internal Audit and auditors of 
group companies.

•  On the other hand, there are many auditors at group 
companies who have concurrent positions. As issues are 
being identified through fact-finding surveys, the system 
is being reviewed, and some members of the newly 
established Office of the Audit & Supervisory Board 
in January 2022 will be appointed as auditors of some 
group companies, which will promote cooperation and 
result in improved effectiveness of the audit function in 
the future.

The compensation system for Directors, Audit & 
Supervisory Board Members and Executive Officers is 
aimed at (1) securing and retaining diverse, outstanding 
talent so as to establish and enhance competitive 
advantage, (2) promoting prioritized actions for realizing 
continuous increases in corporate value and (3) sharing 
interests in common with shareholders. Starting in 
FY2017, we have introduced a performance-based share 
incentive plan for our Directors (excluding Outside 
Directors) and Executive Officers. Serving as a highly 
transparent and objective remuneration system that is 
closely linked to company performance, the performance-
based share incentive plan aims to increase awareness of 
contributing to improvements in our financial performance 
and corporate value over the mid- to long-term.
 Regarding Kao’s share incentive plan, in order to 
promote both social contribution and sustainable 
enhancement of corporate value, we made adjustments 
to the long-term incentive compensation indicators 

Compensation system for Directors, 
Audit & Supervisory Board Members 
and Executive Officers 

The Department of Internal Audit reports directly to the 
President and Chief Executive Officer. It conducts internal 
audits on management activities of Kao and Kao Group 
companies in general from the perspective of complying 
with laws and regulations, the appropriateness of financial 
reporting and administrative effectiveness and efficiency. 
Besides providing reasonable assurance as to the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal controls, the 
department also aims to further enhance the internal 
controls system by proposing improvements. The results 
of internal audit activities are reported to the Management 
Board and the Board of Directors at regular intervals.
 Regarding management of subsidiaries, the Group 
Company Policy Manual stipulates which items 
subsidiaries are required to obtain approval for from Kao 
in advance, and which items they are required to report to 
Kao. In accordance with the policy manual, the findings of 
internal audits conducted by the Department of Internal 
Audit, as well as initiatives implemented in response and 
the outcomes of such initiatives, are shared with the 
board of subsidiaries.
 The Department of Internal Audit exchanges 
information and opinions regarding the current state of 
internal audit activities with Audit & Supervisory Board 
Members on a regular basis and as needed. In addition, 
with regard to the development or evaluation of internal 
controls relating to financial reporting and the current 
state of related internal audit activities, the Department of 
Internal Audit shares information as appropriate with the 
Accounting Auditor, and strives for effective mutual 
coordination with the Accounting Auditor.

Internal audit starting in FY2021. Specifically, the new evaluation 
system is multifaceted from three perspectives, moving 
away from the traditional focus on financial indicators to 
include growth potential evaluation indicators that 
measure how well business has grown, ESG potential 
evaluation indicators that measure how well Kao has 
implemented activities for ESG-driven management, and 
management potential evaluation indicators that 
measure the overall implementation of management 
activities through evaluation in employee awareness 
surveys and other measures.
 As regards short-term incentive compensation, EVA 
and consolidated net sales and income are used as the 
evaluation indicators. EVA has been adopted as an 
evaluation indicator in order to provide motivation for 
enhancing corporate value through the implementation 
of long-term strategies that contribute toward the 
resolution of ESG issues. With regard to the adoption of 
consolidated net sales and income as evaluation 
indicators, this represents a goal that is shared with 
ordinary employees. It provides motivation for realizing 
profitable growth and can help to foster a sense of unity 
with employees.

Risk and crisis management 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
The growing severity of social issues̶including the 
issue of waste such as marine plastic waste, climate 
change, the depletion of water resources, 
environmental and human rights issues relating to 
raw materials procurement, the aging of the 
population and issues relating to public health and 
hygiene̶has led to heightened environmental and 
health awareness among consumers, a trend toward 
ethical consumption, and growing demand from 
customers for sustainability. Moreover, the global 
COVID-19 pandemic has only increased this trend.
 On the other hand, stakeholders are also raising 
their expectations and what they require from 
companies in terms of corporate compliance, 
ensuring that products and services provide safety 
and peace of mind, secure information management, 
safeguarding of human rights, respect for diversity, 
and timely and appropriate information sharing and 
disclosure. As these issues become more diversified 
as we head toward 2030, we believe they will also 
become more complex. On the other hand, we also 
believe that under these conditions we can play an 
even greater role as a company that is a part of 
society.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
Our current business environment remains unclear 
due to the spread of COVID-19, intensifying market 
competition and changes in market structure, and 
fluctuations in the raw material market as well as in 
exchange rates. Long-term effects of COVID-19 
increase the possibility that a temporarily suspension 
at our group bases and supply chains could hinder 
our ability to provide products and services, and 
additionally, have transformed consumer awareness 
regarding the environment, health and hygiene, as 
well as consumer purchasing behavior accompanied 
by this awareness change. In addition, heightened 
geopolitical tension has been accompanied by fueling 
divisions among people. There have also been 
increasingly serious environmental problems, and the 
world today continues to experience great turmoil. It 
is vitally important to respond quickly and adequately 
to the risks associated with these kinds of changes in 
the business environment. The Risk and Crisis 
Management Committee and Management Board 
have defined the main 14 risks (see next page) of 
special importance that could occur negative impact 
on sustainable and profitable development, and on 
our contributions to sustainability of the world. 
Managing divisions have established countermeasure 
policies for these risks and are managing their 
progress.

We strive to make improvements to our risk and crisis management system to respond both promptly and appropriately to changes in the business 
environment, to prevent risks from happening and to minimize damage and loss in cases where risks manifest.

Risk and crisis management 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Main risk Detail of risk

1. Risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic • Temporary suspension of operations due to the spread, or long-term effects, of COVID-19 and the effect of highly infectious virus mutations, etc.
• Risk of declining competitivity from insufficient response to changes in consumers’ awareness and values as well as changes in purchasing behavior

2. Risks related to response to social issues • Risk of being unable to provide appropriate products and services in line with changes in consumer awareness and customer needs in relation to social issues
• Risk that our initiatives to address social issues will be perceived as being inadequate

3.  Risks related to changes in the retailing 
environment

•  Risks that would prevent conducting appropriate sales activities for changes and speed in the retailing environment including e-commerce growth and sourcing new 
channels, fusion of real distribution and online as well as mergers and integration across business formats

•  Risks of hindering appropriate response to changes in the logistics environment, including driver shortages and increases in costs due to logistics increase as well as work 
style law reforms that apply to the logistics industry

4. Risks related to business outside Japan •  Risk of significant business planning delays due to slow economic growth, political and social instability, problems with business partners such as retailers and agents, sudden 
changes in laws, regulations and tax systems, an influx of counterfeit products and others

5. Risks related to business investment • Risk of being unable to generate the anticipated level of cash flow, due to worse-than-planned performance, etc. in relation to capital investment and M&A

6. Risks related to product quality
• Risk of serious product accidents or concerns emerging with regard to product safety or environmental issues
•  Risk of not being able to appropriately respond to changes to laws and regulations in each country, and demands for resolving safety or environmental problems and for 

transparency such as product ingredients and safety

7.  Risks related to large-scale earthquakes, other 
natural disasters and accidents

•  Risk of obstacles emerging that hinder our ability to supply our products to the market by the harm to employees, facilities and supply chain as a result of large-scale 
earthquakes, large typhoons associated with climate change, floods and other natural disasters

• Risk of major harm to employees and the surrounding area due to plant fire or explosion

8. Risks related to information security •  Risk relating to personal information disclosure or confidential information leakage as well as temporary disruption of business operations through voluntary acts such as cyberattacks

9. Risks related to reputation • Risk of inappropriate statements in advertising etc. being spread widely via social media
• Risk of the diffusion of critical evaluations of, or misleading information relating to our business activities, brand image, etc.

10.  Risks related to raw material procurement • Risk of dramatic fluctuations in the market price or stable procurement of raw materials
• Risk that our initiatives to achieve sustainable, responsible procurement will be perceived as being inadequate

11. Risks related to compliance • Risk of serious compliance violations at group companies, contractors, etc.

12. Risks related to securing human capital • Risk of being unable to implement the retention and cultivation of human capital with high level specialist skills, leaders able to guide change, etc.

13.  Risks related to currency exchange rate fluctuations • Risk that fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Japanese yen (as a functional currency) and foreign currencies will be greater than anticipated

14. Risks related to litigation • Risk relating to litigation trends and others

to changes in consumer awareness and customer needs 
regarding these issues, or having our initiatives perceived 
as inadequate, also poses risks that could seriously affect 
our management over the long term. For environmental 
issues, this applies in particular to products that reduce 
energy consumption during product use and reduce waste 
after use, and for social issues, to products that are easy to 
understand and use for large numbers of consumers as 
well as products that contribute to improved quality of life.

Main risks

We define new risks that emerge due to changes in the 
business environment, or risks that we are already 
aware of and that may seriously affect management 
over a long-term period as emerging risks, and among 
other major risks, are focusing on the following. During 
our annual review of major risks, we also identify 
emerging risks with focus on the following risks.

Risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic
The spread of COVID-19 has had a major impact on 
social and economic activity as well as people’s lives all 
over the world, and the business environment still 
remains unclear. The prolonged spread of infection leads 
to changes in consumer awareness, values and 

purchasing behavior, and decline in competitiveness due 
to an insufficient response to them can be considered 
risks that may seriously affect management over time.

Risks related to response to social issues
The growing severity of environmental and human rights 
issues, as well as social issues, such as the aging of the 
population and issues relating to public health and 
hygiene, has led to heightened environmental and health 
awareness among consumers and growing demand from 
customers for sustainability. These social issues are 
expected to become more diverse and complex.

that embody our ESG Strategy (Kao Actions) in response

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Faced with social issues and a changing business 
environment, by clarifying the key operational risks 
that we face and strengthening our response to them, 
earning a strong sense of trust from our stakeholders, 
and providing products and services deemed 
necessary by society, we strive to make Kao a 
company with a global presence, valuable to society.

Kao’s creating value
Currently, in line with the Kirei Lifestyle Plan (KLP), our 
business strategy that incorporates an ESG 
perspective, we are promoting innovation based on 
new technologies at every stage from procurement to 
production, usage and product disposal. We aim to 
contribute toward the sustainability of society through 
KLP promotion activities that enable all Kao 
employees to develop a proper understanding of the 
KLP’s goals and content and help them to realize their 
respective roles and responsibilities.
 Risk and crisis management plays an important 
role in underpinning these measures. By prioritizing 
the formulation of countermeasures to address 
significant risks that could have a substantial impact 
on our operations, we aim to provide even better 
products and services without interruption, and to 
maintain good relationships based on trust with 
consumers, customers, business partners and other 
stakeholders.

Contributions to the SDGs

Policies

We regard potential negative impacts on the 
achievement of the management targets and business 
activities as a “risk,” and the manifestation of such risk 
as a “crisis.” We appropriately manage the various 
risks and crises that could occur across our business 
following the response priority detailed in the Kao Risk 
and Crisis Management Policy (1. Protection of human 
lives, 2. Environmental conservation, 3. Continuation 
of operations, 4. Protection of assets). The Risk and 
Crisis Management Committee has established risk 
and crisis management systems and activity guideline, 
and our divisions and affiliates within and outside 
Japan conduct risk management by identifying and 
assessing risks and formulating and implementing 
appropriate countermeasures based on this activity 
guideline. In addition, when a crisis arises an 
Emergency Response Team is launched corresponding 
to the severity of the emergency to promptly and 
appropriately address the crisis in order to minimize 
physical damages and financial losses.

Education and promotion

Spreading awareness of the risk management 
system and activity guideline
The Risk and Crisis Management Committee’s Secretariat 
disseminates information about the designated risk 
management system and activity guideline formulated by 
the committee to individual divisions and affiliates. Then 
through self-audits, we confirm how well each division and 
company understands basic policy and activity guideline, as 
well as the implementation progress of our activities. 
Additionally, through the use of our internal portal site, etc., 
we are able to inform employees about our risk management 
system, response flow, emergency contacts, guidelines and 
so on when crises occur. Moreover, we are working to foster 
understanding and awareness of risks and crises by 
providing alerts and e-learning on various risks and checking 
employee attendance and their level of understanding.

Risk surveys
Risk surveys̶both a comprehensive survey and surveys 
with questions on designated topics̶are conducted at 
each division and affiliate to identify significant risks and to 
facilitate the revision of countermeasures where necessary. 
The results of the surveys are reported back to each division 
and affiliate to promote ongoing improvement in and 
strengthening of the risk management capabilities of the 
organization and its employees. For cross-organizational 
risks and common risks, we are working with each division 
in charge to strengthen our ability to address these, and if 
necessary, we respond to it as a corporate risk theme.

Providing information on risks
On our internal portal site, we provide employees with 
an emergency contact and response structure to be 
used when a risk becomes realized. In addition, to 
promote an understanding of risk and an immediate, 
appropriate response in the event of a crisis, we also 
provide information and education about topics, such as 
how to prepare for and respond to large-scale 
earthquakes, natural disasters, pandemics, information 
security risks or reputation risks, as well as key points to 
note when using social media. Risk education is also 
provided to directors (including our outside directors) at 
least once a year by internal or external lecturers.
 Especially in response to the spread and long-term 
effects of COVID-19, through our internal portal site and 
other means we communicated to employees the status 
of infections nationally and regionally and work systems 
and styles to adopt corresponding to national and local 
government policies as part of our crisis management 
measures, and employees put them into practice. We 
also communicated a wide variety of information related 
to COVID-19 infection protection measures, including 
ways to strengthen infection protections at workplaces 
and at home, the response when employees or their 
family members become infected or are in close contact 
with an infected person, and systems and precautions 
when working from home.

Crisis response training
We conduct emergency response training, 
comprehensive disaster prevention drills, safety 
confirmation drills, media training, risk 
communication training, etc. on a regular basis.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders
When it comes to risk and crisis management, in order to 
quickly and properly address these situations, it is necessary 
to conduct activities that deepen mutual understanding with 
our stakeholders through communication.
 For instance, when it comes to maintaining product 
safety and good quality, stable supply, and fulfilling our 
responsibility toward social issues, working with 
suppliers and contractors is essential. Concerning stable 
procurement risks, we actively promote the facility 
expansion at our major suppliers and the use of 
secondary suppliers for risk diversification, as well as 
collaborative efforts to review supplier contracts. 
Additionally, for sustainable and responsible 
procurement, we are strengthening coordination with 
our suppliers through various initiatives such as the 
monitoring of suppliers by Sedex and the Carbon 
Disclosure Project Supply Chain Program.
 In the event of crises such as large-scale 
earthquakes and typhoons, it is necessary to work not 
only with suppliers and contractors but also with the 
government, local governments and industry groups in 
order to provide relief aid to the affected areas and to 
ensure the continuous supply of needed products and 
services. Participation and information exchange in 
subcommittees and activities is useful for promoting 
in-house activities. In the event of a crisis, we will 
provide information on the status of our group and the 
impact on the market in a timely manner through our 
website and other avenues, striving to eliminate the 
concerns of consumers and customers.

Framework 

The Risk and Crisis Management Committee (which 
meets four times a year) establishes the management 
system and activity guideline for risk and crisis 
management. Divisions and affiliates conduct risk 
management by identifying and assessing risks and 
formulating and implementing appropriate 
countermeasures based on this activity guideline. In 
addition, we have established the Risk and Crisis

Management Promotion Council, held once a month 
as a subordinate organization of the committee, 
which discusses proposals with the committee and 
promotes committee decisions.
 The Risk and Crisis Management Committee and 
Management Board have defined the main 14 risks of 
special importance that could have a particularly 
negative impact on sustainable and profitable 
development, and on our contributions to sustainability 
of the world. Of these main risks, we designate risks

management and that we need to strengthen our 
response to as “corporate risks.” With respect to 
corporate risks, once a year, the Management Board 
revises the risk themes and risk owners responsible for 
addressing them (executive officers) based on internal 
and external risk analysis and informational interviews 
with management, and the Risk and Crisis 
Management Committee manages the progress. 
Additional risk themes are added as necessary, in line 
with changes in the business environment.

Conversely, in the event of a crisis, in the case of 
corporate risks, those risk owners, or in the case of other 
risks, those divisions and affiliated companies responsible 
for addressing them play a central role when it comes to 
establish an organization for countermeasures. In 
addition, depending on the magnitude of the impact on 
the Kao Group as a whole, we also establish Emergency 
Response Team Headquarters with the President or 
executive officer as its general manager to respond to the 

Within the Kao Group, when a crisis occurs, the head of the crisis 
response team will evaluate the level of severity of the crisis on the 
basis of the potential impact on the Kao Group (designating the crisis 
as level one, level two or level three depending on the severity of the 
accident, disaster, epidemic, etc. in question), and an appropriate 
organizational framework will be established for dealing with the crisis 
in accordance with the level of severity.

impact to reduce physical damage and financial loss as 
much as possible. The Risk Management and 
Responsible Care, which operates independently of our 
individual businesses, promotes effective management of 
risk and crisis in all Kao Group member companies. 
Besides submitting proposals for improvement, the group 
also works to identify new risks and risks for which it is 
not clear which unit has responsibility, and formulates 
response strategies. The Management Board undertakes 
verification of risk and crisis management activities on a 
periodic basis (annually) and as needed, and this 
verification is approved by the Board of Directors. The 
Internal Control Committee monitors the status of risk 
and crisis management activities and verifies the 
effectiveness of the activities. 
 Performance evaluation of the Executive Officers 
and the supervising divisions responsible for main 
risks and corporate risks incorporates evaluation of the 
extent to which targets have been achieved in relation 
to measures addressing these significant risks.

Risk and crisis management 102-30

Visualizing for management purposes latent 
risks at business sites and in the business 
environment
•  Regarding our 23 major divisions and 4 major 

subsidiaries within Japan, we conducted a risk 
survey regarding our ongoing themes from FY2020 
of risk and response status regarding COVID-19 
and risks that would hinder the K25. Regarding the 
former theme, the risk of business continuity due 
to the long-term effects of infection spread and 
issues such as the balance between real and 
remote work were mentioned, and related to the 
latter theme, risks related to new businesses, 
business continuity, ESG, etc. were brought up. 
Based on the results and analysis of external 
environments, we conducted informational 
interviews on areas management considered to be 
risks, and reviewed corporate risks.

•  We conducted regular surveys of important risks 
at our locations overseas. We strengthened our 
response as a group to promptly and adequately 
respond to changes regarding our business, with 
each company reviewing important risk 
scenarios and risk and crisis management 
response systems, and additionally, for risks 
common to the global market, improving 
cooperation between our locations overseas and 
our Head Office.

•  At the Risk and Crisis Management Committee, 
we managed progress of corporate risk initiatives 
by reporting on corporate risk theme initiatives 
and discussion.

•  At the Risk and Crisis Management Promotion 
Council, we shared and discussed the risk 
management activities of nine divisions and four 
subsidiaries in Japan in order to promote 
improved coordination and strengthen our 
activities.

Strengthening measures against information 
disclosure
•  We disclosed information about reviewing main 

risks and concrete initiatives in “Business Risks 
and Other Risks” in our Financial Report 2020.

•  We worked to connect and enhance the contents 
of our Financial Report’s “Business Risks and 
Other Risks” as well as contents included in our 
Integrated Report and Sustainability Data Book.

Main training / drills in 2021
•  Comprehensive disaster drills (implemented at 

major plants around the world)
•  Emergency response training and BCP training 

presumed on a large-scale earthquake (Japan)
•  Safety confirmation drills presumed on a large-

scale earthquake (Japan)

Reviews of performance
Regarding the COVID-19 spread and long-term 
effects, we were able to fulfill social responsibilities 
ensuring the safety of our employees and their 
families in each country and a continuous supply 
of hygiene-related products through the united 
response of our entire company. Moreover, in the 
future we will strengthen our response by 
approaching causes of the risk that would hinder 
the K25.

Responsible care activities 102-12, 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

We vigorously implement Responsible Care (RC) activities, which are self-monitoring activities by companies engaged in the chemical industry, to ensure 
safety and environmental conservation in daily operations.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
The stable provision of products and ensuring the 
quality and safety of those products, along with the 
provision of safe and hygienic working environments 
and the reduction of environmental impact from 
business activities, are important social responsibilities. 
These responsibilities must be fulfilled in our capacity as 
a company with a chemical business providing diverse 
materials, products and systems to wide-reaching 
industries with bases both within and outside Japan.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
As all of the RC activities are important activities both 
for inside and outside our company, neglecting any 
one of them will damage our credibility and the image 
of our products.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Building a strong relationship of trust with stakeholders 
by promoting RC activities, which are autonomously 
pursued by corporations, will further facilitate the trust 
of our product brand image and the company.

Kao’s creating value
We have implemented RC activities to autonomously 
ensure aspects of environment, health and safety in the 
chemical industry. We contribute to creating a sustainable 
society while building trusting relationships with society 

from an ethical perspective by promoting these activities. 
As a result, consumers and corporate customers are able 
to use our products with peace of mind, our employees 
are able to work in safety and with peace of mind, and 
communities neighboring our plants and worksites are 
able to live in safety and with peace of mind.

Contributions to the SDGs

Policies

As we are engaged in the manufacture, sale and 
distribution of chemical products, we strive to earn 
enhanced trust from society by ensuring environmental 
conservation, health and safety across the product 
lifecycle (from product development and 
manufacturing to use, consumption, recycling and 
disposal), continuously making improvements to these 
efforts, improving quality of life (QOL) and contributing 
to a sustainable society.
 To achieve this goal, we have established our Basic 
Principle and Basic Policies on Environment and Safety 
and the Kao Group Responsible Care Policy, and 
conduct business activities accordingly.
 The group as a whole remains committed to the 
promotion of RC activities, participating in such 

activities since the 1995 establishment of the Japan 
Responsible Care Council. In 2008, then-President and 
Chief Executive Officer Motoki Ozaki signed a 
declaration of support for the RC Global Charter, and 
again in 2014 then-President and Chief Executive Officer 
Michitaka Sawada signed the revised RC Global Charter. 
To achieve the objective, we have established the Kao 
Group Responsible Care Policy based on the basic pillars 
of RC activities*, that is self-monitoring efforts 
governing the environment, safety and health set out by 
the chemical industry. We set targets each year for our 
group as a whole, including subcontractors, and 
implement those activities based on an annual plan.
 We have been actively promoting the Kao Group 
Responsible Care Policy enacted in 2012, however in 
2014 the International Council of Chemical 
Associations revised the RC Global Charter and in 
addition to this, the Japan Chemical Industry 
Association revised their RC Basic Policy in 2016, and 
so we have also revised our policy in December 2020 
to determine activities and targets for 2030. These 
revisions included updating the content, adding 
continuing education and giving each item a title to 
make it easier for employees to familiarize themselves 
with them.
*  Basic pillars of RC activities: Five objectives of environmental 

conservation, process safety and disaster prevention, occupational 
safety and health, chemical and product safety, and distribution 
safety, and communication with society.

Education and promotion

The philosophy and policy of RC activities to ensure 
environmental conservation, health and safety in the 
product lifecycle must be shared with all Kao 
employees as well as the staff of its business partners. 
To do this, the RC Promotion Committee Secretariat 
and RC promotion staff of the individual divisions in 
charge of RC promotion regularly provide education 
on RC activities including environmental conservation, 
occupational safety and health activities and their

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders
Communication with society is a fundamental aspect 
of RC activities, and all Kao Group companies 
proactively disclose their policies in relation to the 
environment, health and safety, and the status of 
activity implementation, and proactively engage in 

communication with customers, consumers, 
employees, local communities, etc., striving to secure 
the support and trust of all stakeholders.

Framework

The Responsible Care Promotion Committee is 
positioned as one of the Internal Control Committees 
chaired by the President, reporting to the Internal 
Control Committee quarterly. The Internal Control 
Committee gives an overview activity report for its 
subsidiary committees to the Board of Directors. The 
Senior Vice President (Managing Executive Officer) 
serves as the chairperson of the Responsible Care 
Promotion Committee which is composed of 14 

members: representatives from 4 divisions, in addition 
to representatives of the 8 promotional divisions within 
Japan, and the Product Quality Management staff, 
meeting once per year. The Risk Management and RC 
Promotion and Product Quality Management serve as 
the secretariat of the committee.
 Each company involved in Chemical in the group, 
including Kao Corporation, participates in planning at 
the chemical industry association in their respective 
countries to promote RC activities.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance
We are promoting day-to-day RC activities to become 
a top-level global corporation for safety and 
environmental criteria by 2030.
 In order to achieve this, we are striving to take our 
RC activities to an even greater level and expand their 
scope while enhancing management system.
 Therefore, we set our mid- to long-term targets 
until 2030 as Kao Group RC targets, with annual 
backcasting goals for these targets to be incorporated 
into our daily activities.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
Business activities are implemented normally with 
stable provision of products while unnecessary costs 
are cut down.
 In addition, by improving our social reputation, we 
can expect an increase in product and brand 
popularity and the expansion of our business.

Social impacts
There is a possibility of positive influences such as 
reduction in environmental impact, improvements in 
sanitation, and returns to society in the areas of 
business activity, which facilitates a resulting 
improvement in QOL of stakeholders, including 
residents of communities.

In 2021, we convened the group RC Promotion 
Committee on September 27, and the Japan RC 
Meeting on December 17. In addition, the RC 
Promotion Committee Secretariat Audit was 
conducted between July and August at each 
group company within and outside Japan and 
individual divisions in charge of RC promotion.
 As part of the RC Secretariat Audit, the RC 
Promotion Committee Secretariat attends annual 
self-checks conducted by multiple RC promoting 
divisions to confirm that the RC self-checks are 
being conducted correctly in line with regulatory 
and other requirements.
 Continuing from last year, this audit was 
conducted and attended remotely due to 
COVID-19. The RC Promotion Committee 
Secretariat was in attendance for the Safety and 
Disaster Prevention Audit of SCM, which was 
implemented from July to August 2021.
 Initially, RC personnel from each company 
had planned to meet together at the Global RC 
Meeting in November. However, the meeting was 
cancelled due to COVID-19. Similar to last year, 
information was shared online instead.

Reviews of performance
In the area of environment, we met our targets 
for energy consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions, but did not meet our target for water 
consumption. We achieved all of our targets for 
the rate of renewable energy from purchased 
electricity and the rate of disclosure of 
wastewater COD and VOC emissions, which 
were set last year in line with the mid-term 
targets of the Kirei Lifestyle Plan.
 In the area of safety, we did not achieve 
targets for the lost time accident frequency rate 
or the total accident frequency rate. However, we 
did achieve all targets concerning death and 
serious lost-time accidents, lost work days due to 
occupational illness and logistics-related leakage 
accidents, with zero incidents.
 While we were again not able to achieve 
some targets this year, we are not changing our 
initial target values and will aim to make further 
improvements.

Standardization of RC activities

The eight promotional divisions within Japan and all 
affiliated companies outside Japan promote the RC 
activities as shown below based on our RC targets set 
by the Kao Group RC Promotion Committee, through 
drafting activity plans aligned with various operational 
requirements, industries and business categories.

Kao Group RC Promotion Committee 
(September)
At the Kao Group RC Promotion Committee held in 
September of each year, members discuss initiatives 
to clarify courses of action and strengthen the 
management system, and deliberate over the 
following year’s numerical targets and activity targets 
based on the group’s mid-term targets and the results 
of the RC Promotion Committee Secretariat Audit 
conducted in August.

Global RC Meeting (October to November)
At the Global RC Meeting held from October to 
November, the RC Promotion Committee Secretariat 
explains the group’s mid-term targets and targets for 
the upcoming year, as decided at the Kao Group RC 
Promotion Committee, and requests each company to 
devise its respective targets and to plan for the 
upcoming year. Representatives from each company 
present the status of their RC activities and share 
information within the group.

Our initiatives

Japan RC Meeting (December)
At the Japan RC Meeting held in December, based on 
these numerical targets and activity targets for the 
group decided at the Kao Group RC Promotion 
Committee, RC Promotion Committee members of 
promotional divisions announced their respective 
division plans for the upcoming year, which were 
discussed by the committee. The RC Promotion 
members convey the deliberation results to their 
respective divisions, relating the content in detail to 
their activity units in an effort to improve and enhance 
RC activities closely connected to each worksite.

The Kao Group RC Promotion Committee meeting 
was held online on September 27, 2021. The RC 
Promotion Committee Secretariat announced the 
half-year results for our group’s 2021 RC targets, and 
the results of the RC Promotion Committee 
Secretariat Audit and the high-pressure gas safety 
audit. The promoting divisions also announced the 
current status of their promotional activities and finally 
the group’s targets for 2022 were agreed upon for 
deliberation.
 At the Japan RC Meeting, also held online on 
December 17, RC Promotion Committee members of 
promotional divisions reported on their 2021 activity 
results and announced 2022 draft plans for their 
divisions, with the plans then deliberated and 
approved. The RC Promotion Committee Secretariat 
then reported on the group’s 2021 environmental and 

safety record.
 Initially we had planned to hold the Global RC 
Meeting at the Head Office on November 8 and 9 
with the participation of RC promotion staff from each 
country, but this was canceled for the second year 
due to COVID-19. The meeting was held online 
instead, where we furthered understanding of the Kao 
Group RC Policy and confirmed the 2022 targets. In 
addition, we confirmed the status of companies’ RC 
activities and shared best practices, aiming to activate 
and improve the RC activities.
 As we have not been able to hold direct opinion 
exchanges with RC promotion staff in countries 
outside Japan since last year due to COVID-19, we 
held information exchanges remotely with individual 
areas a total of eight times from April to June 2021. 
At these information exchanges, the secretariat 
provided a summary of 2020 and reports on activity 
topics as well as information on 2021 targets and 
activities, while RC promotion staff in each country 
reported on their 2020 activities and topics. 
Participants also exchanged general opinions about 
RC.

reduce both environmental impact and occupational 
accidents.
 The KANCHAN System automatically calculates 
our total GHG emissions and the annual frequency 
and severity rate of occupational accidents, along 
with other data-based practical information used to 
reduce our environmental impact and eliminate 
occupational accidents.
 We are currently exploring to a practical system 
for the efficient use of environmental and safety data 
by the group with Enterprise Information Solutions, as 
part of deliberations on transitions to new systems.
*  Environmental & Safety Data Management System (KANCHAN 

System) 
Data shared among the group under this system includes that 
related to energy consumption, GHG emissions, soot and dust 
emissions, water consumption, wastewater discharged, wastewater 
concentration measurements, soil and groundwater measurements, 
amounts of handling, release and transfer of PRTR materials, waste 
generated and discharged, and final disposal of waste, occupational 
accident statistics and traffic accident statistics.

Implementation status of the 
RC Promotion Committee 
Secretariat Audit

At Kao, individual divisions in charge of RC promotion 
conduct self-checks in July, and the audit team 
selected by the RC Promotion Committee Secretariat 
implements an audit of individual divisions in Japan in 
charge of RC promotion and affiliated companies 
outside of Japan in August, to determine the progress 
of RC activities and challenges to be addressed.
 These results are reported at the Kao Group RC 
Promotion Committee held in September and Global 
RC Meeting held in November and these help 
formulate the following year’s numerical targets and 
activity targets.
 In addition, the audit involves evaluations by 
scoring the implementation status (implemented / not 

implemented; implementation rate) by survey item on 
the checklist used for the audit, as it is implemented 
based on company-wide regulations (B-02-00 The 
Rules for RC Secretariat Audit).
 From July through August 2021, the RC Promotion 
Committee Secretariat Audit was conducted by using 
the checklist sheet at 8 promoting divisions in Japan 
and 19 group companies* with plants outside Japan, 
with consideration to the degree of safety and 
environmental impact. This year, we revised portions 
of the checklist to reflect requirements in ISO 14001 
and ISO 45001 as well as the self-assessment tool 
items of the International Council of Chemical 
Associations, and also made improvements to the 
evaluation content concerning RC activities 
performance.
 In Japan, the status of various items was confirmed 
in remote meetings with RC promoting divisions, such 
as the current status of compliance with regulatory 

requirements and standards, the progress of planning 
and achievement of numerical targets. Outside Japan, 
we conducted a paper audit using the same checklist. 
It has also been confirmed that all findings from the 
2020 audit had been addressed.
 In the results of the 2021 RC Promotion 
Committee Secretariat Audit, many divisions and 
companies earned lower scores than last year due to 
the wide-ranging revision of the checklist. As there 
were a large number of findings on occupational 
safety and environmental conservation, which are 
areas where ongoing monitoring is necessary, we have 
requested further improvements (see table below).

Status of international 
management system certification
We have implemented an RC management system 
throughout the group, with some plants having 
received ISO 14001 certification, the global 
environmental standard, as well as ISO 45001 
certification, which is the standard for occupational 
health and safety, in addition to other certifications in 
respective countries.

Environmental certifications (ISO 14001, etc.)
96% of our plants have received ISO external 
certification, and 2.5% have received external 
certification from the government and other 
authorities (on total production volume weighted 
basis).
 Certifications obtained at 15 individual plants in 
Japan and Asia have been integrated to standardize 
and upgrade operations. We will expand the scope of 
certified plants on an ongoing basis and increase the 
number of integrated plants.

Occupational health and safety certifications 
(ISO 45001, etc.)
Obtaining the occupational health and safety 
management standard is being prioritized for plants 
outside Japan where enhancement of labor 
management is needed. The ratio of certified plants is 
35% (on a total production volume weighted basis).

 Certifications obtained at five individual plants in 
Asia have been integrated to standardize and upgrade 
operations. We will examine expanding the scope of 
certified plants, including by increasing the number of 
integrated plants, while also considering the inclusion 
of our Japanese plants in 2023.

Product quality certifications (ISO 9001, etc.)
95% of our plants have received external certification 
(on total production volume weighted basis). We will 
continue to expand the scope of certified plants.

List of external obtained certifications

Education about RC activities

The RC Promotion Committee Secretariat and RC 
promotion staff in individual divisions in charge of RC 
promotion regularly provide education on RC activities 
including on the environment, occupational safety 
and health, and process safety and disaster 
prevention for Kao employees and staff at business 
partners. In 2021 as well, in response to the increased 
number of employees working from home due to 

COVID-19, we conducted education by effectively 
deploying an online learning (e-learning) format 
instead of in-person instruction.
 Also in 2021, we conducted online training 
covering (1) basic knowledge on disaster prevention 
continuing from last year and (2) the Kao Group RC 
Policy, which was revised last December, as well as a 
verification survey for all group employees in Japan. 
The average attendance rate for these training 
sessions was above 80%. In 2021, the RC Promotion 
Committee Secretariat carried out RC trainings for 
employees 19 times, reaching a total of more than 
51,000 employees.
 Going forward, we will continue to actively use 
e-learning to carry out RC-related education.

Collaboration with stakeholders

Food recycling together with the community 
(Wakayama Office)
The Wakayama Office is conducting a project aiming 
to realize food recycling by composting food waste. 
Daily food waste from the employee cafeteria at 
Wakayama Plant reaches between 100 and 130g per 
person per day, equivalent to about 10% of the total 
amount of food used by the cafeteria. To reduce this 
food waste, it is conducting a project that includes (1) 
eliminating sample food displays and using photos 
instead, (2) removing excess water content from food 
waste, and (3) reducing the amount of food used in 
the cafeteria by predicting the number of people who

Employee cafeteria

will use the cafeteria based on the number of people 
working at the plant and the menu. The plant began a 
project in June 2021 to have the food that still 
becomes waste even after taking these steps get 
used, by installing equipment to treat food waste, 
fermenting it using the power of microorganisms, 
turning it into compost, and then having that compost 
used to grow vegetables.
 Of the waste that was previously treated, 
approximately 20kg/day is currently being used in this 
project. We are aiming to create a food recycling loop, 
where food scraps and food left over in our cafeteria 
is turned into compost, used to grow vegetables, and 
then those vegetables get sent back to our cafeteria 
and turned into delicious lunches.

SCM Division receives Jury’s Special Award

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Policies

Social issues we are aware of
As the movement to conserve the environment grows 
stronger, there is also an increasing interest in how it 
is impacted by chemical substances, and in support 
of movements calling to put an end to animal testing. 
Developed countries are already experiencing aging 
populations, and developing countries are also 
expected to have aging populations in the future. 
Additionally, the spread of COVID-19 has changed the 
hygienic awareness and behavior of consumers 
around the world. As social issues continue to change 
in this manner, it is important for company’s activities 
to actively contribute to resolving these issues. At our 
company, we are working to address social issues 
such as hygiene, health, the aging population and the 
environment, through ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
•  Decline in corporate credibility and financial loss 

resulting from product recalls and/or the occurrence 
of serious quality troubles due to inadequate legal 
compliance or quality confirmation at the 
development stage

•  Adverse effects on human health or the 
environment due to poor management of chemical 

substances
•  A delayed distribution of products incorporating 

technological innovations that bring new lifestyle 
value due to a lack of information provision

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
•  Maintaining a stable product supply by ensuring a 

high level of safety and quality
•  Contributing to sustainability through careful 

chemical substance management
•  Providing new lifestyle value and contributing to a 

sustainable society through technology innovation
•  Offering new value after COVID-19 and for an aging 

society, etc.

Kao’s creating value
We lead a sustainable world by pursuing high level of 
safety and quality together with stakeholders enabled 
by passion to change and the vitality of the 
organization coming from diversity. We also advance 
ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri by ensuring legal 
compliance as well as innovating the way we 
communicate our products’ value to consumers. In 
addition, we build bonds of trust with stakeholders via 
thorough transparency and responsible 
communication.

The foundation of our quality management activities is  
Yoki-Monozukuri, which is expressed by our corporate 
philosophy, the Kao Way. Additionally, the first item of 
the Kao Business Conduct Guidelines, our code of 
conduct, states that “We shall always strive to 
develop and provide socially beneficial and high 
quality products and services that place emphasis on 
the health and safety of our consumers and 
customers to realize sustainable economic growth 
and to resolve social issues.”
 We have implemented consumer- and customer-
driven quality management activities with the 
participation of all employees, in all phases from raw 
material procurement to R&D, production, distribution 
and sales.

We implement Yoki-Monozokuri in order to create a Kirei life from a consumer and customer perspective. At all stages from raw materials to research and 
development (R&D), production, distribution and sales, we pursue product safety at a high level from a thorough consumer and customer perspective, and 
strive to continuously improve the quality of our products, in order to realize a safe and harmonious world for all life.

Basic Policy for Quality Management Activities

•  Consumers / customers decide on the quality of 
the products

•  Providing products that users want to continue 
using

•  Ensuring safe usage for consumers / customers
• Legal compliance
• Transparency and accountability

Product quality management 416-1

Safety management across the 
product lifecycle

Kao’s policy on animal testing

We ensure a high level of product safety and quality so 
that our products can be used safely, securely and 
comfortably, through company-wide safety management 
at every stage from R&D, through commercialization, 
manufacturing and sales, to the after-sales stage.
 As to raw materials selection at the product 
development stage and product ingredients after product 
launch, we regularly collect information on legislation 
and safety within and outside Japan. We evaluate a wide 
range of information from industry sources, NGOs and 
NPOs, etc., from multiple perspectives including the 
scientific approach and society’s concerns, and 
formulate necessary countermeasures.
 In addition, we earnestly listen to all consumer 
feedback following product launch, confirm the 
specifics, and implement precise safety checks and 
safety management in collaboration with a network 
that includes medical professionals and governmental 
authorities.
 We exchange information with managers in 
Europe, the Americas, Asia, etc. on a regular basis to 
utilize consumer feedback from all over the world, and 
undertake activities to enhance our overall level of 
product safety from a global perspective.
 Regarding our household products, cosmetics and 
food products, we set safety standards with the aim 
of ensuring a high level of safety. This is because the 
consumer’s safety is always the highest priority.

 We established new safety standards for cosmetic 
products in April 2014. Based on our standards prior 
to that, we have developed a much wider range of 
databases, wider use of tests and more detailed 
safety inspections.

The global community is taking steps toward the 
abolition of animal testing, and the group supports 
this approach.
 In our development of cosmetics, we do not and 
will not conduct animal testing nor do we outsource 
this task to anyone*1.
 For products other than cosmetics, our policy is to 
not conduct animal testing unless it cannot be 
avoided due to lack of availability of alternative 
methods, regulatory requirements or other similar 
reasons*2.
 Ensuring the safety of our products is our utmost

priority and, in this regard, we have established and 
observe the Kao safety standards. In accordance with 
such standards, we widely collect safety data, make 
use of our safety information database that contains 
the knowledge accumulated over many years and 
adopt alternative methods to animal testing as much 
as possible. After ensuring product safety through the 
above, we conduct further testing of the product in 
actual usage settings.
 We have been working on the development of 
alternative methods to animal testing since the late 
1980s. We believe that alternative methods should be 
official test methods that can be used globally. In this 
regard, we are actively working with research 
institutions globally for the development of alternative 
methods to be adopted as international guidelines. We 
are also a member of the project to develop alternative 
methods to animal testing of Cosmetics Europe. We 
will continue to proactively work on the development 
of alternative methods to animal testing in cooperation 
with industry associations, other companies and other 
related third parties within and outside Japan.
*1  This excludes instances where we need to respond to societal 

expectations to evidence the safety of a product or when required 
to do so by government agencies in particular countries.

*2  If testing on animals is unavoidable, we keep such testing to a 
minimum following the principles of animal welfare of the 3Rs 
(replacement, reduction and refinement).

Education and promotion

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

So that our corporate philosophy permeates 
throughout our group, we provide education and 
training based on the Kao Way and Kao Business 
Conduct Guidelines, which are the foundations of our 
quality management activities. We are further 
strengthening education on quality awareness and 
regulations such as the Pharmaceutical and Medical 
Devices Act, Good Quality Practice (GQP) and Good 
Vigilance Practice (GVP). We also provide education 
for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and various 
ISO standards. At our Manufacturing Division, we 
continue its own QC circle activities based on the 
number of consumer and customer contacts as an 
indicator. We provide various education and 
awareness-raising initiatives through day-to-day 
quality management activities and Quality 
Improvement Study Meetings to ensure permeation 
of our quality management activities policy. We are 
also strengthening education for those who are 
planning to work overseas and group employees 
outside of Japan, and are working to raise the level of 
quality management activities of our entire group. In 
addition, in order to increase motivation for quality 
management activities, we award employees who 
achieved excellent activities every year.
 Furthermore, we have made the Kao Group 
Critical Product Trouble Management System 
available on the company intranet along with 

We believe that collaborating with stakeholders is 
essential to promote legal compliance and achieve 
social sustainability through ESG-driven 
Yoki-Monozukuri. As such, we are promoting 
collaboration with stakeholders while ensuring 
reliability with respect to the following.

Making good use of consumer feedback in 
Yoki-Monozukuri
We use consumer feedback to improve our products, 
information and services by promptly sharing this 
feedback through the Kao ECHO System.

Collaboration with contractors
We hold quality-related meetings with contract 
manufacturers and raw material suppliers to promote 

consumer- and customer-driven quality improvement 
activities. We will cooperate with more business 
partners to develop consumer- and customer-driven 
quality management activities.

Actively engaged in industry initiatives
We actively participate in industry activities in each 
country and region. By actively participating in efforts 
such as establishment of new standards for quality 
and safety as well as new test methods, we strive to 
provide products that can be used with peace of mind 
anywhere around the world.

Collaboration with administrative agency
We share our viewpoints and make proposals in 
administrative meetings held in each country and 
region to contribute to the establishment or revision 
of standards. We also proactively contribute to the 
discussions on safety and new regulations in 
international conferences.

Product quality management 102-20

Framework

We have established a company-wide quality 
management system that involves all employees at all 
stages from product development to post-sales, which is 
from R&D, marketing, production and distribution through 
to sales, in continuous improvement activities.
 Before product launch, we adopt gate control to 
check quality and to verify the evidence comprehensively 
at the searching, development, commercialization and 
production stages, thus sufficiently ensuring our high 
safety and quality standards.
 After product launch, we promote company-wide 
activities in pursuit of continuous product improvement 
and the sincere receipt of consumer and customer 
feedback. In these ways, we strive to be highly 
transparent with the public and to always fulfill our social 
responsibilities.
 In these ways, we strive to achieve Yoki-Monozukuri 
every day. Nevertheless, the possibility of significant 
safety or quality related issues emerging are not 
negligible. For this reason, we have set up the Kao Group 
Critical Product Trouble Management System. The group 
companies both within and outside Japan respond to risk 
events based on this system.
 We also maintain a corporate governance system that 
includes internal control systems, and we hold quarterly 
meetings of the Quality Management Committee, which is 
a sub-body of the Internal Control Committee with the 
President serving as chairperson. At the Quality 
Management Committee, we confirm the efficacy and 
reliability of company-wide quality management activities. 

Following the policies decided on by Quality Management 
Committee, we hold annual Quality Management Meetings 
at respective business field level and confirm the quality 
management activities policy, product quality issues and 
the progress of our quality management activities.
 Furthermore, representatives of relevant divisions 
(Business, R&D, Product Quality Management, 
Procurement, Supply Chain Management (SCM), Sales and 
Consumer Communication Center) attend monthly Quality 
Improvement Study Meetings, held by the president of the 
Business Division, to improve our products, information and 
services, based on consumer feedback. We hold joint 
Quality Improvement Study Meetings between Japan and

at each of our companies in order to strengthen the quality 
management activities of our group companies in Europe 
and the Americas. These company-wide activities are 
coordinated and promoted by Product Quality Management. 
The Managing Executive Officer in charge of quality 
management supervises the division’s activities, submitting 
periodic reports on these activities at meetings of the 
Management Board, and reporting on important issues as 
appropriate. The Managing Executive Officer in charge of 
quality management also participates in discussion

Product quality management

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance
Mid- to long-term targets
1.  Lead a sustainable world by pursuing high level of 

safety and quality together with stakeholders
2.  Advance ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri by ensuring 

legal compliance as well as innovating the way we 
communicate our products’ value to consumers

3.  Build bonds of trust with stakeholders via thorough 
transparency and responsible communication

4.  Grow Genba by passion to change and the vitality 
of the organization coming from diversity

Business impacts
•  Zero financial loss on product recalls
•  Acquiring new customers and increasing our 

number of loyal customers by conveying the value 
of our products and services through efficacy claims 
and advertisements, and gaining consumer affinity 
for influencing their purchasing behavior

•  Contributing to our business through expanding 
quality management education, sharing product 
trouble case studies, and while incorporating 
remote work, continuing audit activities to prevent 
legal noncompliance

•  Contributing to expand overseas business by 
establishing a strategic quality management system 
for complying with regulatory changes in each 
country and region, as well as diversification of 

supply chains by becoming borderless.

Social impacts
•  Contributing to social sustainability by promoting 

ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri in order to address 
social issues including the environment, health, the 
aging population and hygiene, in a situation faced 
with challenges from COVID-19, climate change and 
so on. In response to an aging population and the 
increase in the number of foreign nationals visiting 
and living in Japan, we are promoting Universal 
Design and providing multilingual information to 
reduce the risk of product accidents, thereby 
contributing toward making consumers’ lives safer 
and securer.

•  Waste reduction associated with product recalls
•  Building social reputation through reliability via 

communication with all stakeholders, including 
consumers, customers, government agencies, 
NGOs, NPOs and investors

COVID-19 response
Responding to hygiene and healthcare 
businesses (Lateral deployment in each 
Asian country and region)
As a countermeasure against COVID-19, we 
promoted collaborating between related 
divisions to ensure a stable supply of hygiene-
related products where demand has increased 
and to expand lateral deployment across Asian 
countries and regions. Following 
manufacturing and sales in Thailand, we began 
manufacturing and sales in Taiwan, by 
ensuring prompt and appropriate compliance 
based on the regulatory information collected 
by local Professional Regulatory Affairs staff. 
Furthermore, we were able to start selling our 
Thai products to Malaysia, as well as the 
import and sale of our Japanese products to 
Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia. 
Moreover, we are preparing to begin 
manufacturing in Vietnam in order to secure 
stable product supply in anticipation of future 
growth in demand.

Supporting global expansion of

We developed an original surfactant (Bio-IOS) 
with higher hydrophilicity than previous 
surfactants, which contributes to reducing

environmental impact since it can be derived from 
biomass after manufacturing edible palm oil. Bio-IOS 
can reduce the rinsing process by half when used as 
a cleansing agent arising from its low foaming 
property after dilution. It can therefore significantly 
reduce CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle. In 
addition, it is highly biodegradable, has low aquatic 
biotoxicity and is a sustainable substance that utilizes 
natural byproducts. Starting with its use in our 
laundry detergents, we are developing personal care 
products and cosmetics containing Bio IOS, and are 
also planning to provide this new material to other 
companies. Through its strategic registration in the 
fields of chemicals, household products or cosmetics 
and its area development from Japan to China and 
other countries and regions, we will expand our 
contributions to environmental conservation and 
effective use of resources.

Strengthening our global supply system in 
response to Chinese cosmetics regulation revisions
With the revision of the Cosmetics Supervision 
and Administration Regulations (effective January 
1, 2021), the highest level of regulation that 
controls cosmetics in China, it is necessary to 
strengthen compliance with a wide range of 
requirements in quality assurance, quality control 
and traceability. Moreover, regarding the post-
marketing safety management it is the strictest 

requirement in the world, making it necessary for 
overseas companies to respond to a detrimental 
reaction monitoring system (mandatory reporting 
of side effects, etc.). In order to respond to these 
major changes, we launched a company-wide 
countermeasure project and are continuously 
reviewing our quality and safety management 
system that oversees everything from initial stage 
of product development to post-marketing 
management, as well as the strengthening of 
GMP, GVP and GQP management systems.

Continuing follow-up activities with regards 
to our Declaration of Consumer-orientation
In January 2017, we announced our Declaration of 
Consumer-orientation. Under our corporate 
philosophy, the Kao Way, we promote top 
management’s commitments to all of our 
employees, ensuring corporate governance as well 
as achieving customer satisfaction. Moreover, we 
have declared our commitment to take consumer 
feedback seriously, utilize it to improve our 
products and services, provide information from 
the point of view of consumers and actively engage 
with consumers, with all employees taking part in 
Yoki-Monozukuri to provide products and brands 
useful to the sustainability of society. In 2021 as 
well, we published the annual activity report of the 
previous year in line with the declaration.

Company-wide promotion of quality 
management activities

Reviews of performance
By establishing a global supply system for hygiene 

products as part of our new lifestyle value proposal 
after COVID-19, and through expanding the use of 
sustainable detergent (Bio-IOS) globally, we are 
promoting the diffusion and expansion of products 
that are useful for protecting the environment as 
planned. Regarding the revision of Chinese 
cosmetics regulations, we will promptly respond 
after these subordinate regulations are fixed.

Verifying quality management 
activities through audits and 
self-checks

Strengthening of quality 
management education 
programs

We maintain ISO 9001 and GMP certification at our 
worksites in Japan, Asia, the Americas and Europe. 
Besides, we conduct external and internal audits, 
self-check for contract manufacturers and raw 
material suppliers, and hold quality meetings.
 As part of our efforts to strengthen our product 
quality management audit and self-check frameworks, 
we hold Quality Audit Promotion Meeting with 
participants that include not only Product Quality 
Management Division personnel, but also leaders 
from relevant divisions. These meetings are used to 
help drive audit activities by deciding which areas 
auditing should focus on.
 In 2021, we conducted internal audits of our 
plants in Japan with respect to GMP compliance, and 
conducted internal audits of our ASEAN companies 
with respect to drafting and managing the ASEAN 
Product Information File. We reported the results to 
the Internal Control Committee. In addition, the 
implementation status of external audits for group 
companies in Japan, Asia, the Americas and Europe 
during the previous year was reported to the Quality 
Management Committee.

We have conducted quality management education to 
all departments involved in Yoki-Monozukuri each year 
with the aim of improving quality awareness and 
acquiring knowledge of quality management 
activities. Additionally we have developed and 
implemented an e-learning education system to 
ensure that anyone can access well-designed quality 
management education at any time. With this system, 
we introduced comprehension testing that enables 
the company to constantly monitor and to evaluate 
their understanding of laws / regulations and internal 
rules / standards.
 We continue to expand our educational content 
and provide education through e-learning. In 2021, 
we added content related to the revision of Chinese 
cosmetics regulations (Cosmetics Supervision and 
Administration Regulations) and post-marketing 
safety surveillance and management based on the 
GVP. A total of 2,682 employees have completed the 
courses. We also continue to provide face-to-face 
education for fundamentals related to the 
Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Act as well as 
specific-related issues in each department.

Employees’ voice

Quality management education for employees is 
indispensable to prevent problems related to product 
quality and legal noncompliance. We are working to 
build an education system that allows each employee to 
receive training based on the specifications of their work 
and skills.
 This year, we promoted the development of 
educational content and our e-learning system, focusing 
on employees who require a wide range of knowledge. 
To overcome employee weaknesses identified through 
comprehension tests after e-learning courses, we 
reinforce learning through review lectures and 
supplementary testing. At the same time, we provide 
practical education covering revisions to laws and 
quality case studies. We will continue to improve on-site 
capabilities through these educational activities.

Company-wide consumer- and 
customer-driven quality 
management activities

Promotion of quality management activities 
outside Japan (the Americas and Europe, the 
Middle East and Africa)
In 2021, in order to promote quality management 
activities regarding our consumer care and salon 
businesses in the Americas and Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa (AEMEA), we established the AEMEA 
Quality Management Meeting.
 This meeting is a subcommittee of the Quality 
Management Committee, the Internal Control 
Committee for Kao Group quality management, where 
the chairperson is the Managing Executive Officer in 
charge of our Product Quality Management, and is 
attended by each personnel in charge of related 
Business and Function divisions of Kao Group 
companies. By accelerating our activities through 
sharing company-wide quality management activity 
policy and maximizing the use of group assets, as 
well as responding to quality issues, we aim to 
strengthen internal quality control and improve the 
value of our brands.
 Based on our company-wide quality management 
activity policy, in 2021 we discussed priority 
challenges with regard to our businesses and 
formulated quality management activity policies, 

which have been implemented at related divisions. In 
addition to carrying out these quality management 
activities, at the end of the year we conducted a 
management review of the quality status of our 
businesses, which was actively discussed.
 Through continuous implementation of the PDCA 
cycle, we will improve the quality management 
activities of our businesses in the Americas and 
Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
The rapid development and spread of information 
technology (IT) has resulted in IT spreading to every 
aspect of our lives, and it has become an 
indispensable part of social infrastructure. If the IT 
infrastructure of society is disruptive, this could have 
a major impact on economic activities due to the 
interruption of electricity, gas and water lifelines as 
well as transportation infrastructure. Moreover, 
cyberattacks have resulted in leaks of information 
assets including confidential information and personal 
information from companies, and ensuring 
cybersecurity has become a social issue. With the 
enactment of the Basic Act on Cybersecurity in 
November 2014, the entire country has been working 
on cybersecurity issues.
 At Kao, the ISC in Japan plays a central role in 
establishing incident response structures and 
preparing for incidents in collaboration with the Risk 
and Crisis Management Committee. For technical 
measures, Enterprise Information Solutions takes the 
initiative in conducting risk assessments and 
implementing measures in line with the roadmap for 
security measures. What we seek is to implement 
security measures that will prevent cyberattacks and 
to build and maintain mechanisms and systems that 

We have established 30 business- or region-specific (or country- or territory-specific) Information Security Committees (ISCs). These ISCs formulate common 
policies, rules and guidelines and take action to strengthen information security in order to protect information assets that include confidential information 
(trade secrets [TS]) and personal information as well as IT hardware, software and many kinds of data records.

can minimize damage even if we are subjected to 
cyberattacks.
 Also, the protection of personal information has 
been reinforced in recent years pursuant to the EU 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the 
laws of individual countries. We are aware that 
responding to the increasingly rigorous protection of 
personal information in each country is a social issue. 
The definitions of personal information and the duties 
of business operators relating to the handling of 
personal information vary under the laws of each 
country. We ascertain the details of personal 
information protection laws that are enacted and 
amended, implement the measures that Kao Group 
companies should take, and comply with the personal 
information protection laws of each country.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
The occurrence of cyberattacks that can cause the 
long-term suspension of production, sales, marketing 
and R&D activities, along with the loss of corporate 
trust due to information leaks, is a major risk.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
By strengthening cybersecurity measures and the 
management of information assets including 
confidential information (TS) and personal 

information, such data can be utilized in new ways, 
new business can be created, and new styles of 
working will be enabled through the use of networks.

Kao’s creating value
We hope to contribute to improving the security 
measures of the entire industry by sharing information 
with other companies in the industry about the 
cyberattacks that we have experienced through our 
participation in information-sharing networks: the 
Initiative for Cyber Security Information Sharing 
Partnership of Japan, which is directed by the 
Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan 
(IPA), the National Police Agency’s Cyber Intelligence 
Information Sharing Network, and the early warning 
information system of the Japan Computer 
Emergency Response Team Coordination Center 
(JPCERT/ CC). We also participate in the Security 
Information Management Subcommittee established 
by the Japan Chemical Industry Association, an 
industry organization, and are working to exchange 
information with other companies.

Policies Education and promotion Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

We have formulated our Information Security Policy, 
Guidelines on Handling Trade Secrets, Guidelines on 
Handling Personal Information and IT Security 
Guidelines (for Administrators) (for Users). We also 
carefully manage cybersecurity measures, TS and 
personal information in accordance with the policy 
and guidelines. Such efforts are not only carried out in 
accordance with laws and regulations and the 
guidelines set forth by government agencies and 
committees, but also designed to clarify our 
management framework and management methods.

The way how to handle personal information is 
disclosed in the Kao Group Company’s Privacy Policy. 
Kao Group Company Inquiries and Complaint 
Reception Desk Regarding Personal Information is set 
up for inquiries or complaints. No claims relating to 
personal information were made in 2021.

To ensure that employees throughout the group 
fundamentally understand the issues of protecting TS 
and personal information, in principle, internal 
education is conducted by each division. To do this, a 
general meeting is held every November for the 
members of the TS & Personal Information Protection 
Committee and for Personal Information Controllers 
from each division to (i) give lectures on and raise 
awareness about TS, personal information and 
information security (ii) analyze the number of 
incidents and trends relating to TS and personal 
information and provide feedback and (iii) provide 
educational materials for training in each division. The 
November 2021 meeting was held in conference 
rooms and through web conferencing with 321 TS & 
Personal Information Protection Committee members 
and Personal Information Controllers participating.
 Company-wide educational materials are posted 
and timely warnings for all staff are provided via the 
company intranet portal site. Also, to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the internal education, self-checks are 
performed. On the basis of the results obtained, any 
problems that may exist are identified, improvement 
targets are set, and improvement activities are 
implemented.
 Overseas, each ISC prepares an education and 
self-inspection plan, carries it out, and submits a 
report to Japan in March.

Cybersecurity measures
To undertake security measures for the supply chain 
as a whole, in 2021 we sent security questionnaires to 
logistics service providers (five companies in Asia and 
six in Europe and the Americas) and based on the 
results received, requested improvements where 
necessary.

Personal information protection in Japan
We conducted paper audits of 179 service provider 
companies, confirmed the status of personal 
information management systems, rules and security 
management measures, and supervised service 
providers.

Website vulnerability diagnosis
We performed vulnerability diagnoses of websites 
managed by Kao Group companies within and outside 
Japan and made sure there are no unaddressed 
vulnerabilities that may be exploited in cyberattacks. 
In cases where vulnerabilities were identified, 
software updates were implemented. We made 
improvements, particularly with regard to websites of 
salon brands in Europe and the Americas.

Framework

Information security management system
As a committee under the Internal Control 
Committee, the ISC in Japan supports the protection 
of information assets (including hardware, software 
and various types of data files) such as confidential 
information and personal information in order to 
achieve management goals, takes measures against 
cyberattacks on the Kao Group as a whole, and 
respond to the personal information protection laws 
of each country.
 In Japan, we have appointed executive officers to 
serve as Chair and Vice-Chair of the ISC, and both the 
committee members and the staff of the committee’s 
secretariat are appointed from different divisions, 
including Human Capital Development, Enterprise 
Information Solutions, Marketing, Research and 
Development, Intellectual Property Management, 
Supply Chain Management, and Legal and 
Governance. This allows us to benefit from a wide 
range of perspectives when determining policies, 
formulating internal rules, putting management 
systems in place and implementing awareness-raising 
activities. 
 The ISC reports on its activities to the Internal 
Control Committee, and each quarter the Internal 
Control Committee reports to the Board of Directors 
on the activities of all subordinate committees. The 
report contains the activity targets of the current fiscal 

year, progress status and performance evaluations, 
and in the fourth quarter, the activity targets for the 
coming fiscal year is also reported. In the event of an 
incident that requires an emergency response, the ISC 
works in collaboration with the Risk and Crisis 
Management Committee and reports to management 
immediately.

Mid- to long-term targets
•  Protection of information assets such as TS, 

personal information, hardware, software and many 
kinds of data records, including cybersecurity 
measures

•  In the event of an information leak or other 
emergency, confirmation of facts, decision on a 
response and formulation and implementation of 
measures to prevent recurrence

Business impacts
Cybersecurity measures can reduce costs incurred to 
respond to leaks of TS or personal information by 
preventing such leaks. Also, damage can be 
minimized if measures are in place to respond to the 
leak of TS or personal information.

Social impacts
Implementing cybersecurity measures for the entire 
supply chain will play a part in improving 
cybersecurity for the entire industry and for Japanese 
companies overall.

Performance
TS and personal information protection promotion 
activities conducted in Japan using the PDCA 
cycle were as follows.

Plan: Plan formulation and adjustment
•  Adjustment of the promotion system and 

updating of information access authorizations
̶ Reviews of 208 TS Promotion Committee 

Members and 192 Personal Information 
Controllers

•  Review of confidential information lists
̶ Reviews by 109 divisions, departments and 

affiliated companies in Japan
•  Sharing of implementation plans for awareness-

raising and self-checks
•  Reports from overseas ISCs (previous year’s 

results and this year’s plan)

Do: Awareness-raising activities
•  Re-inspection of the confidentiality level of 

confidential information
•  Submission of a pledge by each Personal 

Information Controller
•  Awareness-raising activities for employees
̶ Awareness-raising activities in 108 divisions, 

departments and affiliated companies in Japan

Check:  Self-checks and auditing of 
outsourcing partners

•  TS and personal information self-checks
̶ Working from home has become prolonged 

since March 2020, so the following questions 
were again reviewed before the TS self-checks 
were carried out.
̶ Storage of confidential information when 

working from home
̶ Necessity of printing confidential information 

when working from home
̶ Self-checks on TS in 123 divisions, departments 

and affiliated companies in Japan
̶ Self-checks on personal information in 97 divisions, 

departments and affiliated companies in Japan
•  Auditing of outsourcing partners that handle 

personal information
̶ Paper audits of 179 outsourcing partners that 

handle personal information

Act: Improvement activities
•  Feedback to and issue sharing with individual 

divisions
•  Improvement measures to address the issues 

raised, enhancing the thoroughness of their 
implementation and setting targets for the next 
fiscal year

Performance in 2021

At Kao, there were no serious incidents related to 
information security, including TS and personal 
information protection. No claims relating to 
personal information were directed to inquiry 
desks.

Reviews of performance
It is necessary to carry out promotion activities to 
protect TS and personal information on a 
continuous basis every year. Since even those who 
fully understood TS and personal information 
protection lose clarity in their knowledge over the 
years, the risk of an incident occurring increases. It 
is important that all employees, including new 
hires and mid-career hires, understand and follow 
our TS and personal information protection rules.
 In order to expand our TS and personal 
information protection promotion activities 
globally, we established systems and created 29 
overseas ISCs, which vary in size among regions, 
company groups and individual companies. 
Overseas ISCs submit activity reports in March of 
each year.

First quarter: Plan formulation 
and adjustment

Our initiatives

Formulation of Japan ISC activity targets
The following ISC activity targets for 2021 were set 
and measures were taken to achieve them.
1. ISC activities at overseas companies

•  Submission of reports to Japan in March (PDCA 
cycle activities, etc.)

•  Security assessment of third-party logistics
2. Cyber insurance coverage

•  Coverage obtained on April 1, 2021. The scope of 
coverage is the entire Kao Group.

•  Insurance coverage: Crisis management response 
costs, third-party liability costs, costs for 
responding to the authorities in foreign countries, 
financial damage to the company, business 
interruption expenses

3.  Confirmation of compliance with personal 
information protection laws (GDPR / CCPA, 
etc.) in each country

•  GDPR: 2018 cookie response method modified
•  Personal information controls reinforced in 

response to the revised Act on the Protection of 
Personal Information coming into effect

4. Reinforcement of cybersecurity measures
•  Security strategy roadmap formulated
•  Measures implemented in line with the security 

strategy roadmap
5. Measures based on the PDCA cycle

•  Awareness-raising materials and TS and personal 
information self-checks questions reviewed

•  Awareness-raising activities implemented (by 
individual divisions)

•  TS and personal information self-checks and 
audits of personal information outsourcing 
partners conducted

•  The TS & Personal Information Protection 
Promotion Meeting held on November 15, 2021

Second quarter: Awareness-
raising activities

Awareness-raising activities implemented by 
individual divisions and affiliated companies
In Japan, rules and general security awareness-raising 
materials are posted on the internal portal site. In 
addition, we undertake awareness-raising activities in 
each division using the educational videos used in the 
TS & Personal Information Protection Promotion 
Meeting held in November of the previous year as 
well as materials regarding TS and personal 
information incidents and self-checks feedback.

Third quarter: Self-checks and 
auditing of outsourcing partners
Self-checks of TS and personal information 
protection
TS self-checks are conducted every year as part of the 
thorough implementation of confidential information 
management including implementation of awareness-
raising activities, maintenance of division manuals 

and implementation of TS marking. In 2021, self-
checks took place from August 2 to September 10.
 Personal information self-checks were similarly 
conducted at the same time regarding management 
of personal information, including implementation of 
awareness-raising activities, retention of personal 
information and outsourced tasks where personal 
information is handled.

Auditing of outsourcing partners handling 
personal information
When outsourced business tasks involve handling 
personal information, we conduct a pre-audit to 
ensure that the outsourcing partner properly manages 
personal information. We also conduct an IT security 
assessment if the partner provides a service such as a 
web campaign. The conclusion of service contracts is 
conditioned on the outsourcing partner passing the 
personal information pre-audit and IT security 
assessment.
 In addition, we manage and monitor partners 
handling personal information by conducting annual 
audits of such partners. In 2021, we conducted such 
audits at 179 companies and confirmed the status of 
personal information management and the systems 
for protecting personal information. If personal 
information is stored by a partner, we confirm the 
number of records and check for consistency with the 
number of data records registered in our personal 
information handling ledger system.

Fourth quarter: Improvement 
activities
Holding of the 28th TS & Personal Information 
Protection Promotion Meeting
The 28th TS & Personal Information Protection 
Promotion Meeting was held on November 15, 2021. 
The meeting was held in person and online with 321 
persons participating. Continuing from the previous 
years, we conducted awareness-raising in the form of 
an explanation of Kao’s current status after watching 
an awareness-raising video created by the IPA.
 After that, a report was given on incidents related 
to TS and personal information in 2021. Feedback 
was then provided on TS and personal information 
self-checks, and improvement targets were set.
 We set as improvement targets steady 
implementation of awareness-raising activities, 
prohibition of bringing out confidential information in 
paper form (documents) from the office in principle, 
and annual resubmission of the pledge when using 
the personal information dedicated server. The annual 
resubmission of the pledge also has the significance 
of calling attention to the handling of personal 
information, and we are considering using Microsoft 
Forms to ensure comprehensive implementation.

Strategic digital transformation (DX) 102-12, 102-15

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
Among the environmental changes concerning global 
society and economy expected by 2030, we recognize 
the following in particular as related to DX.

•  Intensification of global competition in 
conjunction with the Fourth Industrial Revolution

•  Development of a sharing economy
•  Global population shifts and competition to recruit 

human resources
•  Changes in global movement of funds
•  Substantial increases in demand for resources, 

energy, water and food
•  Increased cybersecurity threats

With such significant changes in the environment 
expected, it is hoped that a society will emerge where 
everyone can play an active role, free from various 
restrictions such as region, location, age and 
disability. Also, since the global COVID-19 pandemic 
in 2020, many people have become aware of the new 
value of digital technology, and their daily lives have 
changed significantly as a result of the widespread 
adoption of non-contact and non-face-to-face digital 
technology in many social activities.

Until now, we have used various leading-edge 
technology in all stages of the supply chain and 

implemented DX with a focus on increasing 
operational efficiency.
 Going forward, we hope to implement DX using 
the most recent leading-edge technology, pursue 
value that can be provided only by a company that is 
involved in the lives of people throughout their 
lifetimes, and create a new lifestyle culture in 
cooperation with various partners.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
In order to achieve the three policies established under 
the Mid-term Plan̶become an essential company in a 
sustainable world, transform to build robust business 
through investment, and maximize the power and 
potential of employees̶it is important that we support 
understanding of DX within the company and develop 
environments where we can collaborate with various 
external partners. When undertaking DX, legal compliance 
including protection of personal information and 
countermeasures against the risk of information leaks will 
be indispensable, and we are working in cooperation with 
our Legal and Compliance to ensure compliance with the 
laws of each country and across countries.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
To carry out the three policies of the Mid-term Plan, it 
will be necessary not only to select optimal digital 
technologies, but also to adopt two perspectives: value 

We are promoting a strategic digital transformation (DX). By using the power of digital, which enables communication regardless of location or time, we will 
deliver the value of Yoki-Mono (good products) to customers in more timely and customized formats and strive to provide solutions that increase creativity to 
employees.

proposals that lead to solutions to social issues, and 
what methods should be used to make such value 
proposals. We will of course maintain our commitment 
to manufacturing as in the past, but we will place greater 
emphasis on providing value to each and every individual 
in an optimal form. Depending on the circumstances, we 
will not only focus on our own assets, but also actively 
collaborate with external partners to pursue optimal 
solutions for our customers and end users.

Kao’s creating value
Until today, we have provided value to consumers through 
lifestyle-related products such as household products and 
cosmetics. In the process of product development, we 
accumulate research regarding various aspects of the 
human body, psychology and lifestyles of diverse people. 
We will provide combinations of products and services 
tailored to each individual’s condition by using monitoring 
technologies created from the technologies and 
knowledge we have built up. We will accelerate efforts in 
collaboration with various companies, governmental 
institutions and other partners to make full use of our 
strengths in research assets and product development 
capabilities for solving social issues.

Strategic digital transformation (DX) 102-20, 102-43, 404-2

We seek to become a DX-ready company by 
transforming our business as well as organizations, 
processes, cost structures, and corporate culture.
 Moreover, by multiplying the Kao core value of 
Yoki-Monozukuri with leading-edge technology 
including artificial intelligence (AI), we will enhance 
the level of value provision to all stakeholders 
(employees, customers, shareholders and society) and 
we will continue our efforts so that employees will be 
able to perform fulfilling work and to meet external 
expectations even in 2030.

Education and promotion

While introducing the best DX solutions at the best 
timing to bring maximum benefits to our employees, 
we will also encourage our employees to create their 
own DX solutions by making content widely available. 
Rather than conducting uniform education for all 
employees, we will carry out a policy of developing 
and implementing specific solutions with the 
departments that have actual problems and rolling 
them out company-wide as best practices.

We regard our suppliers as important stakeholders, 
not merely as customer-vendor relationships, and we 
aim to develop relationships that can transform 
companies and create social value together. We share 
a number of social issues in common with 
consumers, and we will maintain relationships that 
enable us to solve those problems together.

Framework

DX implementation is conducted and managed by the 
DX Promotion Committee, which is chaired by a 
managing executive officer (meetings are held 12 
times annually).

Main fields
Reborn Kao
We will redefine our added value with digital 
technology enhancements by providing new 
experiences in both the real-world and the virtual-
world as well as new product development and 
marketing through comprehensive strategies and 
tactics. We will also actively invest in structural 
reforms and DX to build a more robust business 
framework.

Another Kao
We are investigating several business domains that differ 
from the current B2C business model, in which we deliver
value to our consumers through products such as 
household products and cosmetics. These new 
businesses will be launched with the aim of solving a 
number of social issues, but the method of providing 
value will be different from in the past. Some examples 
are B2C (to consumers) business that provides value for 
services rather than products, B2B (to businesses) or B2G 
(to governments and NPOs) business that combines 
goods and services, and B2B (to businesses) business 
that provides value by combining existing research 
knowledge with leading-edge digital technology. All new 
businesses will be developed on different ground from our 
existing business domains, and in the background is the 
utilization of many years of research assets. These include 
knowledge about the human body, psychology and 
lifestyles accumulated through Essential Research and our 
proprietary monitoring technology. By developing these 
business groups in addition to the existing B2C business 
model, we believe that we can take the first steps toward 
becoming a company that is indispensable for a 
sustainable society.

Raising efficiency (internal DX)
Leveraging digital technologies, we plan and implement 
strategy and tactics to fundamentally improve efficiency in 
work processes. Existing data is integrated after 
formatting to improve its usability, and is converted into 
high-value-added information using advanced technology.

Mid- to long-term targets
In light of changes in the external environment 
including the expansion of ethical consumption, 
personalization of consumption, diversification of 
purchasing behavior and the rise of new distribution 
channels, we formulated the Kao Group Mid-term 
Plan 2025 (K25) with “Sustainability as the only path” 
as its vision. By maximizing utilization of accumulated 
technologies and knowledge as well as digital 
technologies, we will create new business for 
protecting lives in the future while reinvigorating 
existing business.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Utilization of leading-edge technology will enable new 
product development that transforms consumer 
experiences and inspires people. We believe that by 
building a digital platform based on the various data 
accumulated through Essential Research and dozens 
of proprietary monitoring technologies as a common 
foundation for both existing and new businesses and 
collaborating with multiple partners, we will establish 
new business models for Kao.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

Performance
While promoting increases in operational 
efficiency by using advanced digital technology, 
we have evolved proposals by creating various 
unique user experience (UX) that use digital 
technologies, mainly in the Cosmetics. In 
addition, we have collaborated with numerous 
partners to develop an automated shelf allocation 
algorithm using AI, automate truck loading and 
unloading in logistics facilities to reduce waiting 
times, and use AI to examine costs.

Hair color simulations using augmented reality 
(AR)
Since October 2021, we no longer offer color swatch 
samples for all our hair dye and hair manicure 
products in Japan as a promotional material to select 
a color at stores. In doing so, 56 tons maximum of 
plastic used yearly to produce these color swatch 
samples were reduced. Instead, we introduced a hair 
color simulation*1 as a support tool for customers 
selecting a hair color. The hair color simulation is easy 
and fun to use anywhere at any time by scanning a 
QR code*2 on an in-store display or the back of the 
product package, and customers can check their own 
hair color after dyeing.
*1  The tool uses the YouCam Makeup browser module, which is an 

AR makeup app provided in collaboration with Perfect Corp.
*2  QR code is a registered trademark of Denso Wave Incorporated.

Makeup diagnoses using AI technology
With regard to cosmetics, in many instances, testers 
for all items are placed in stores so customers can 
check the color and feel, but with today’s heightened 
awareness regarding hygiene, more people are 
refraining from using testers.
 We have introduced unique digital services and 
makeup simulators that recreate the makeup 
experience for each brand website and official LINE 
so that customers can experience cosmetics colors.
 For KATE, we developed a makeup diagnostic tool 
that not only enables customers to find makeup styles 
that will look good on them, but also helps them to 
express themselves so that they can achieve the 
appearance they want to have. KATE Scan uses AI 
technology to measure the ratios of different parts of 
the face and uses the values with the unique KATE 
logic to perform an analysis. Based on facial 
impression analysis, the tool proposes makeup 

Lunasol D2C online sales reduce waste
We launched an initiative to predict sales based on 
advance online sales in order to reduce cosmetic 
product waste. Disposal of unsold products causes 
environmental impact including the release of CO2 
during processing, and it is possible to reduce the 
environmental impact from disposal by reflecting 
advance sales trends in production plans. (Lunasol 
product disposal volume: Approximately one-third the 
volume of the previous year)

Company-wide web accessibility policy 
established with the aim of disseminating digital 
information that is easily accessed by all
Under the KLP, we are taking universal design 
measures to develop and provide products that are 
easy to use by all people to make consumers’ 
everyday more beautiful. We will ensure improved 
web accessibility to provide information via our 
websites so that more people in various 
circumstances can easily find the information they 
need to choose and use our products.

Awareness-raising activities in each division and 
affiliated company
We have used COVID-19 countermeasures as an 
opportunity to accelerate work style reforms through 
the use of digital technologies. We have made major 
changes to work styles including extensive use of 
online conferencing tools by all employees including 
our president.
 We have also created platforms to enable the 
integrated use of data stored in each field, enhance 
the accessibility of all information, and took measures 
to raise work efficiency.
 The application of natural text searches* using AI, 
which started from a research integration search 
system, has expanded. Following application in the 
SCM field in 2020, we worked to apply and deploy 
natural text searching in practical operations such as 
in surveys on the scope of business impacts from 
chemicals of concern.
 We also developed and deployed in-house 
creation of low-code in-house apps and robot process 
automation of repetitive tasks. Development by on-
site employees who are highly familiar with the work 
not only raises work efficiency, it also facilitates 
grassroots digital human talent cultivation activities.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues
Social issues we are aware of
In addition to global-scale social issues such as global 
environmental issues and the COVID-19 pandemic, 
there are also a diverse range of IP-related issues, 
including ongoing discussions from economic 
security perspectives. Collaboration with a wide range 
of industries is essential to solve these issues. In 
addition, while there are needs to quickly provide 
highly varied new value, recently counterfeit products 
mainly in Asia have also become an issue.
 In order to solve these social issues, develop 
industries and contribute to society, we are working to 
promote activities in line with our ESG Strategy, the 
Kirei Lifestyle Plan (KLP). We give importance to 
utilizing our technologies that we created through our 
fundamental values of Yoki-Monozukuri, not only in 
our own products but also in ways that lead to 
solutions for social issues, the development of 
industry and contribution to society. We believe that it 
is necessary to acquire IP and appropriately utilize it in 
order to achieve adequate social implementation and 
to prevent counterfeiting.
 Moreover, in collaboration with outside entities in 
order to solve social issues, it is also necessary for 
both parties to make considerable use of IP.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030

In cases where it is not possible to acquire technology 
development linking industry and public benefit in the 
form of IP, difficulties arise in the ongoing 
development of products due to developed 
technologies easily being counterfeited and hindering 
expected profits, posing a risk related to realization of 
What Kao Aims to Be by 2030. Furthermore, the 
appearance of counterfeit products with inferior 
quality gives rise to the risk of failing to meet the 
expectations of consumers regarding the value of our 
products. In order to eliminate these risks, it is 
necessary to secure IP and exercise our rights 
properly.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Our R&D Division is working on research and 
development by establishing themes for solving social 
issues, in order to realize our KLP. However when it 
comes to solving these social issues more quickly and 
certainly, there are numerous themes that go beyond 
our traditional business domain and are too difficult 
for our company alone. In light of this, we are also 
working to find partners with the same goals and 
partners who make beneficial use of technology 
developed at Kao for achieving social implementation.
 Therefore, in addition to using the IP rights 
acquired through fundamental technologies and 
product development for our own products, going 
forward we are creating opportunities to contribute to 
industry and society by taking into consideration 

At Kao, we are endeavoring to protect R&D outcomes and effectively utilize the rights derived from these outcomes through cooperation between the 
Intellectual Property Department and research institutes / business divisions to realize “Contributions to business and social through intellectual property (IP).”

making IP rights available through open innovation.

Kao’s creating value
We create value that contributes to industry and 
society and transform IP into assets by pursuing its 
true nature through particular attention to 
fundamental technology research and product 
development research. Amidst the need for rapid 
creation of new value, we see not just independent 
development, but also co-creation with outside parties 
as an important method of development. This is the 
fundamental concept announced in the Co-creation 
Innovation and IP Strategy to Accelerate ESG 
Management presentation that the Senior Vice 
President of the R&D Division gave at the Global IP 
Strategy Forum 2020 held by the Japan Patent Office 
(JPO) on January 28, 2020.
 We use the results obtained through research to 
make global contributions through IP-related activities 
conducted by Kao Corporation and its group 
companies both within and outside Japan working in 
tandem. In addition, we are reinforcing collaboration 
with external organizations to respond to social issues 
and ensuring acceleration in the pace of open 
innovation based on our IP strategy.

promote open innovation through collaboration with outside 
parties and strive to provide products and services with 
even higher value to consumers and society. In order to help 
solve global social issues, we will co-create new 
technologies in cooperation with industry and government, 
and will also flexibly license and provide access for others to 
use Kao’s technological assets.

Education and promotion

We have implemented a wide range of IP education and 
training programs for researchers aligned with, for example, 
their years of experience and roles. Not only providing 
seminars on the patent system as well as seminars and 
practical training for creating patent specifications, we also 
provide education that fosters IP management taking 
business into account and strategic thinking utilizing 
patents. In 2021, a total of around 450 researchers 
participated in IP education and training programs. We also 
make effective use of e-learning program to enhance the 
effectiveness of our educational activities. Online learning 
has already been adopted as a tool for IP education and 
training by our researchers in Asia, the Americas and 
Europe.
 As a result, researchers have been taking more initiative 
in acquiring IP rights for technologies and in building IP 
portfolio. It is expected that repeatedly taking these 
educational programs according to the number of years of 
experience enhances the IP literacy of researchers and the 
technologies and products that they develop will become 
sources for the creation of functions and appeals that 

differentiate them from competitors. In fact, through these 
continuous education we believe we have been able to 
maintain high standards of annual applicant numbers and 
registration rates.
 Our IP educational programs were reported in Volume 
295 of Tokugikon (November 2019), a journal published by 
the JPO.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

In order to achieve What Kao Aims to Be by 2030, we 
respond with determination to counterfeiting. By working 
with IP industry organizations and other companies in our 
industry, we have reinforced our measures and are 
contributing to the development of the IP industry as a 
whole.
 As a part of those initiatives, we have created 
opportunities for direct dialogue with management levels in 
the JPO and European Patent Office, as well as in patent 
offices in emerging economies, in order to allow us to 
maintain an accurate grasp of the latest trends in IP 
administration. In 2021, at a JPO-sponsored discussion 
meeting with companies, the commissioner of the JPO, our 
top management and the Senior Vice President of our R&D 
had the opportunity to exchange opinions on IP strategies. 
Through this type of dialogue, while gaining an 
understanding of recent examinational developments, 
which is useful for establishing more stable IP rights, we 
also request government support for solutions to social 
issues we have come up with.

Policies

At Kao, our business divisions employ matrix management, 
where various functions including R&D, production and 
sales are encouraged to dynamically interact, and work 
together organically. In order to realize our business and 
research strategies, we acquire IP, including patents, design 
rights, trademarks and other IP rights, for R&D results and 
names representing brand image generated from the 
management system, and conduct our business activities.
 Under this matrix management, the R&D Division is 
also carrying out inter-divisional activities between 
fundamental technology research and product development 
research, building an IP portfolio based on each of our 
business strategies that make up Another Kao and Reborn 
Kao. We are building a system made of the technological 
assets we have created to utilize in multiple business areas, 
and putting together a strategic IP portfolio to effectively 
utilize in our business activities.
 We also actively pursue the acquisition of rights in Asia, 
the Americas and Europe while vigorously protecting 
ourselves against any infringements of our legal rights, both 
within and outside Japan. Recently, we have been pursuing 
measures against counterfeit products in Asia and other 
regions.
 At the same time, we are strengthening our global 
efforts to respect and avoid infringing on the IP rights of 
other companies, through undertaking R&D in such a way 
as to avoid infringing upon them from the initial stages and 
reconfirming existing patents before new product launches 
and taking action as necessary.
 Meanwhile, in order to maximize the use of IP, we

R&D Intellectual Property

Brand Legal

* As of December 2021

The Brand Legal Department, which forms part of Legal 
and Governance, is in charge of trademark and design 
rights (some design rights are handled by the IP 
Department under R&D). We conduct adequate availability 
searches for new names or designs in order not to infringe 
any rights of third parties. We also try to widen the scope 
of rights acquired to maintain Kao’s brand value.
 Close collaboration with marketing teams is very 
important for our trademark activities in particular. 
Between the Kao Corporation Head Office and three 
offices in Europe and the U.S., we strive for smooth 
communication. Furthermore, in order to ensure timely 
naming, we manage the entire schedule of naming 
processes, from the beginning of name creation through 
trademark filing and name decision. Through these 
activities, we are able to use the product names and 
catchphrases that become the faces of our products, and 
we are able to provide products that consumers can use 
with reassurance.
 We consolidate systems for the early elimination of 
counterfeit products which have been on the rise in 
recent years. We cooperate with governmental 
authorities, e-commerce site managers, and peer 
companies in the industry, while we also reinforce our 
monitoring of markets including e-commerce sites. By 
steadily undertaking these measures in response to the 
damage caused on a daily basis by sophisticated 
counterfeit products, we are contributing to the 
elimination of counterfeit products and the elimination 
of businesses that handle them.

Board deliberated and finalized revisions to the rules for 
compensating inventors and other related parties as an 
important investment in IP, which is a source of our 
technological capabilities. Once each year, useful patents 
and other IP rights that have contributed to business are 
reported to the Management Board, which deliberates 
rewards for employee inventions.
 Our group as a whole works closely together on R&D 
activities. In addition to existing IP operations (applications, 
rights acquisition, contracts, management, information analysis, 
IP education) conducted while collaborating with business 
divisions and group companies outside Japan, taking steps to 
fight counterfeit products and engaging in open innovation, we 
are also leveraging our IP from more strategic perspectives.
 Looking to initiatives aimed at solving ESG issues, we 
are examining building an organizational team and external 
collaboration able to monetize not only IP in our existing 
business frameworks but also IP in new business domains.

 We have also created opportunities for direct dialogue 
with patent attorneys in major countries and regions 
(including Europe, the Americas, South Korea, China and 
Taiwan) and multiple emerging nations to deepen our 
understanding of global IP practice and acquire rights in 
accordance with the legal systems of each country.

Framework

We implement company-wide management of business-
related IP through the coordinated activities of the IP 
Department (under R&D) and the Brand Legal Department 
(under Legal and Governance).
 The IP Department plays a key role strategically applying 
for and exercising rights relating to patents and technology-
based designs, which are indicators of key company values 
from the perspective of technology development capability, 
in a broad range of fields. The responsible party is the Senior 
Vice President in charge of R&D.
 The Brand Legal Department collaborates closely with 
business divisions when submitting applications and 
exercising rights relating to design-based designs and 
trademarks, taking into consideration cost effectiveness. 
The responsible party is the Senior Vice President in charge 
of Legal and Governance.
 The IP Department and the Brand Legal Department 
exchange information through regular liaison meetings and 
strive to build IP mix strategies through organic cooperation.
 When an important issue arises, the IP Department and 
the Brand Legal Department submit it to the Management 
Board for deliberation, and the Board of Directors discusses 
proposals when necessary. Most recently, the Management

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance
Mid- to long-term targets
We continue to build our own patent portfolio, 
optimized for both volume and quality, and create 
cross-category, global structures that can strategically 
use Essential Research results that can generate 
diverse product value. We also provide strong support 
for our R&D from an IP aspect, aiming for the 
realization of our KLP.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
Kao, which deploys numerous products, is able to apply 
Essential Research results to product development in 
multiple fields, and therefore, will be able to increase 
the efficiency of R&D through appropriate IP protection, 
which will lead to higher product revenues.

Social impacts
To be an essential company in a sustainable world, we 
aspire to protect future lives from infectious diseases, 
etc. and lead the sustainable society. In addition to 
contributing to the advancement of technology by 
publicly releasing inventions that we create, we seek 
maximum utilization of Kao IP by undertaking open 
innovation in collaboration with outside parties to 
solve social problems. Also, public release of socially-
beneficial inventions contributes to the public good.

Performance
The number of new patent applications in 2021 
remained at the previous year’s high level thanks 
to active development of new inventions. In 
addition, income from patent licenses also 
remained at a high level as a result of active 
utilization of patent rights, and we are building an 
optimal patent portfolio.
 When we develop new technologies and 
formulations, we employ a mechanism to check 
clearance implementation concerning the patents 
of other companies, to prevent omissions and 
avoid IP disputes with other companies.
 In November 2018, we held a technology 
innovation session and gave explanations of five 
innovations with the aims of creating a forum for 
open innovation, expanding technology exits, and 
proving an even more diverse range of products. 
Following these explanations, we have 
encouraged external collaboration relating to 
these technologies and encouraged activities for 
their social implementation.

Reviews of performance
By engaging in close communication with research 
laboratories and collaborating with business 
divisions, this year we were able to submit 
necessary applications, acquire rights, avoid 

infringement of the patents and other rights of other 
companies, and respond to counterfeit products.
 With the aims of becoming a company with a 
global presence and rapidly providing new and 
diverse value in the future, we will apply for 
additional new patents and other rights and 
encourage their use globally with an eye toward 
broad deployment including overseas.
 In order to respond to social issues, in the past 
we publicly released technologies developed at our 
company, and also 
in recent years, 
we have gradually 
provided access 
to our packaging 
technology aimed 
at reducing the 
amount of plastic 
used. Moreover, 
we have been promoting cooperation with several 
of our partners, including the recycling of plastic 
packaging, and are aiming for further co-creation 
with partners for faster and more reliable social 
implementation.

Examples of technologies publicly 
released: Shampoo bottle notches
We have been placing a notch with a jagged 
shape on the sides of shampoo bottles since 
1991. This enables people with visual 
impairments as well as people with normal vision 
who wash their hair with their eyes closed to 
identify the bottle by touch.
 Believing that a lack of uniformity in the 
industry concerning the use of these notches 
would lead to consumer confusion, we withdrew 
our utility model application and worked through 
the Japan Cosmetic Industry Association to call on 
other companies to adopt an industry standard. As 
a result, the agreement of numerous companies in 
the industry was obtained. Now, most shampoo 
bottles have notches, and the use of notches has 
become an international standard due to Japan 
taking the initiative (ISO 11156: 2011).

Notches first developed in 1991 (left) and current notches 
(right)

In the lead up to 2030, we will strive to be a 
company that continuously contributes to the 
creation of a sustainable society and provides the 
services most strongly needed by consumers.
 To that end, we will continue R&D, secure IP 
rights, and fully leverage our technology assets.

Our initiatives

Handling of IP issues with 
other corporations

We regard IP, including patents, as critical business 
assets, and are making efforts to effectively and 
strategically utilize such resources. In cases where IP 
issues with other corporations arise, we make efforts 
to resolve these issues through dialogue with those 
corporations when feasible, and through patent 
licensing where necessary.

System of reward for employee 
inventions

We have a compensation system for our employees, 
including a compensation system as a bonus for new 
innovation, and an incentive to honor useful 
inventions that contribute to our business operations 
and incentivize further inventions. As for incentives, 
employees are awarded for patents utilized internally 
at Kao, which have led to excellent commercial 
outcomes, as well as license income incentives for 
patents which have produced significant income as a 
result of licensing to third parties. Every year the 
President offers words of appreciation and 
encouragement at an awards ceremony for 
presentation of the incentives to the inventors. In 
2021 we continued to implement our incentive 
system based on internal usage of inventions and

Promotion of IP rights 
management
We consider that the acquiring of the outcomes of 
R&D at group companies as IP rights is an important 
step in realizing our Yoki-Monozukuri globally and in 
responding to local consumers and client needs. For 
this reason, we actively provide platforms for 
exchange and mutual inspiration among employees 
with responsibility for IP at Kao Corporation and group 
companies both within and outside Japan, while 
taking measures to execute related work duties 
collaboratively. We also focus our capacities to 
support IP-related activities at different localities, with 
an emphasis on IP education for researchers in each 
country and region.
 In conjunction with the increase in group 
companies and more energetic invention activity in 
each country and region, we are undertaking IP 
activities with closer ties to countries and regions. In 
2021, there were a large number of new patent 
applications from overseas group companies, 
dialogue among personnel in IP divisions in Japan 
and each overseas country and region increased, and 
we deployed the Kao IP policy globally.

Awards ceremony for presentation of performance incentives in 2021

licensing income, marking 22 consecutive years since 
the launch of this system at Kao Corporation. This 
incentive system undergoes review to keep it up to 
date, and in 2021 we increased our compensation for 
inventions to support R&D aimed toward What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030.
 Systems to reward employee inventions are 
implemented on a country-by-country basis, and 
group companies in Asia, the Americas and Europe 
continued to establish their own incentive systems.

Response to the counterfeit products 
problem in emerging nations
In regard to business expansion in emerging nations, the 
risk posed by the rapid diffusion of counterfeit products 
increases for products which are well-received locally. It is 
thus very important to find appropriate countermeasures 
after having developed a clear picture of the current 
situation with regard to counterfeit products. Some 
counterfeit products are associated with safety concerns. 
In such cases it is not merely a question of protecting the 
brand value of the Kao product being counterfeited. It also 
becomes imperative that countermeasures to ensure the 
health and safety of local consumers are put in place.
 We have set up an internal system that spans 
related departments, including those overseas, to 
handle counterfeit products. We will continue to take 
appropriate measures especially against exact copies 
and counterfeiting technology outside of Japan. China 
in particular could be described as a highly litigious 
society compared to Japan, as there are many more 
cases of IP-related litigation. There may thus be times 
when a resolute stance must be taken to address the 
issue of counterfeit products in a lawsuit, depending 
on the particularities of the case.
 In addition, to help prevent counterfeit products 
from being imported, we have arranged for Kao 
personnel to act as instructors in Customs training 
sessions, teaching Customs personnel the key points 
to identify counterfeit items, and we have also been 
actively involved in seizure of imported counterfeit 
products (border protection).

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Social issues we are aware of
We understand that international efforts such as the 
OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project are 
important measures in maintaining tax transparency 
and preventing aggressive tax avoidance. For 
example, the pricing for transactions between related 
parties is determined under the arm’s length principle 
and in accordance with OECD transfer pricing 
guidelines, calculated based on the functions, assets 
and risks involved.

Kao’s creating value
Based on the fundamental values of “walking the 
right path,” which is our corporate philosophy of the 
Kao Way, we contribute to the creation of social value 
that enriches daily life with sincere and sound 
business practices, acting in accordance with ethics 
and the law, and making adequate tax payments.
 Concerning income from business activity in 
emerging and developing countries, we believe that 
conducting sound tax affairs and paying taxes in 
accordance with tax laws of each country and region, 
without violating local tax rights, serves an important 
role in the economic and social development of each 
country and region in which we operate.

We ensure transparency regarding taxes, as well as compliance with tax laws and regulations in every country and region.
Furthermore, we also provide various types of education on proper tax management, with each and every employee working to raise tax compliance 
awareness.

 We also believe that the use of tax havens or tax 
planning that is not aligned with either commercial 
purposes or business substance impedes the 
appropriate payment of taxes in each country and 
region in which we operate. We strive to prevent the 
use of aggressive tax avoidance and abusive tax 
planning involving, for example, tax havens. We only 
expand internationally or implement global business 
structures where this is aligned with our commercial 
purposes. Moreover, we do not take part in any tax 
structuring used for international tax avoidance.
 As of the end of December 2021, there were no 
Kao Group companies located in countries that are 
classed as tax havens by the OECD.

Contributions to the SDGs

Policies
Aiming to improve corporate tax governance, we 
established tax policy to serve as a standard tax-
related code of conduct.

Education and promotion

At Kao, we believe that it is important for both 
management and employees to promote tax 
compliance awareness in order for the tax compliance 
system to function properly.
 We strive to reduce tax risks through awareness, 
education, information sharing and consultation, 
while ensuring thorough legal compliance.

Tax strategies 102-13, 102-43, 207-2, 207-3 (Tax 2019)

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

We provide timely and appropriate information to the 
tax authorities and strive to build relationships of trust 
by responding to all enquiries expediently and in good 
faith. In order to minimize tax risks, we periodically 
consult with an external tax advisor in order to 
address tax filing accuracy.
 Additionally, we work with the business 
community through industry groups in assisting with 
tax reform requests that contribute to enhancing the 
international competitiveness of Japanese companies.

Collaboration with the Japan Chemical Industry 
Association (JCIA)
Through JCIA, we are actively working on tax reform 
requests that contribute to improving tax practice 
efficiency and enhancing corporate competitiveness.

Framework

The Senior Vice President of our Accounting and 
Finance does business with Administration Tax 
Accounting Group and tax officers in each country or 
region. We share information with tax officers in each 
country or region on a quarterly basis for current and 
future tax risk comprehension and to resolve issues. 

By regularly compiling tax issues in each country or 
region to understand the current situation, our system 
receives information in a timely manner on urgent tax 
issues. In addition, a system has been established to 
coordinate solutions in cooperation with external 
experts.
 Furthermore, important tax issues and strategies 
are reported at regular Management Board and Board 
of Director meetings.

Global accounting and finance collaboration
We regularly hold meetings that bring together global 
leaders in the accounting and finance functions. In the 
meetings, leaders share company-wide policies, 
ensure their implementation and discuss new tax 
issues while communicating with tax officers at our 
overseas subsidiaries.

Tax strategies 207-4 (Tax 2019)

Performance in 2021

Performance report and tax 
payment record
Our effective tax rate for FY2021 was 25.7%. The 
-4.9% effective statutory tax rate difference is 
mainly due to the impact of a tax credit for 
experimental research costs in Japan as well as 
different tax rates applied to subsidiaries. Similarly, 
given that, when compared to the average effective 
tax rate in the industry calculated by S&P Global, 
our effective tax rate is 2.4 percentage points lower, 
we believe that, if the tax credit for experimental 
research costs in Japan referred to above is 
excluded, the amount of tax we pay is roughly the 
same as the industry average.
 Regarding the cash tax rate, which is the 
amount of tax paid divided by net income before 
income tax, our company achieved an appropriate 
rate that was 2.6% higher than the industry average, 
despite the effect of payment timing issues, etc.

Biodiversity 102-12, 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

Social issues we are aware of
Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 (GBO5) was published 
by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological 
Diversity on September 15, 2020 to analyze whether 
the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and 
Aichi Biodiversity Targets are being met. Although 
significant progress was seen for most of the Aichi 
Biodiversity Targets, it showed that none of the 20 
individual targets were fully realized.
 An aspect of current economic activities is that they 
rely on the consumption of precious natural resources. 
In addition, humanity’s destruction of nature and the 
loss of biodiversity are leading people to come into 
contact with species that they never had before, which 
manifests the risk of new communicable diseases. 
Businesses are required to solve these issues.
 In light of these circumstances and a review of the 
past, the post-2020 biodiversity framework is 
expected to be adopted at the 15th meeting of the 
Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the United 
Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in 2022. 
As a member of international society, we are keenly 
aware of the need to take action for the conservation 
and restoration of biodiversity and the regeneration of 

the natural environment with a strong sense of crisis, 
acknowledging that the targets set here must be met.
 At the 26th session of the Conference of the 
Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change held in 2021, the issue 
of biodiversity was also discussed even though it was 
an international conference whose main topic was 
climate change, and a statement was issued 
emphasizing the importance of protecting, preserving 
and restoring nature and ecosystems. In this way, a 
universal recognition that biodiversity and climate 
change are closely related issues that must be 
resolved simultaneously is developing.
 Our businesses operations benefit from many 
biological resources ranging from the procurement of 
raw materials, such as palm oil, to R&D, 
manufacturing, use and post-use disposal. The 
degradation of biodiversity worldwide will significantly 
impact the development and sustainability of our 
business. In R&D, there are technologies that were 
developed by using the wisdom of nature and living 
things as hints, and we consider this to be a benefit of 
biodiversity as well. Moreover, many of the products 
that we manufacture and sell are discharged into the 
environment along with water after use and are 
eventually purified by natural forces, and packaging 
containers, typically plastic, are sometimes disposed 

Our business is made possible throughout the entire product lifecycle by the various ecosystems that exist on the earth and the abundant natural bounty created from biodiversity.
Kao vigorously undertakes sustainable raw material procurement and development of new technologies for the effective use of limited resources to prevent the degradation of 
biodiversity, one of the most pressing issues shared by the entire world. We will also strive to minimize the impacts of our business on biodiversity and to promote social activities 
that lead to biodiversity improvements in regions where we have business sites.
In addition, we support the recovery of already polluted ecological environments by tackling issues such as ocean plastic pollution. Kao will contribute to the conservation and 
restoration of biodiversity and the regeneration of the natural environment by promoting engagement with consumers, suppliers and other stakeholders and by providing products 
and solutions.

of improperly, polluting the environment. Accordingly, 
we are well aware that biodiversity needs to be taken 
into consideration throughout the product lifecycle.
 Establishing a process for sustainable raw material 
procurement is also of particular importance. 
However, in purchasing RSPO certified palm oil, we 
have been facing various issues over the last ten years 
in palm oil tree production regions, including 
deforestation and the loss of biodiversity as well as 
human rights violations of people and farmworkers 
who live in those areas. By taking full advantage of 
our knowledge and human networks acquired so far, 
we aim for a future that brings about a positive 
change for the entire natural environment and all 
stakeholders connected with our business.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
Key raw materials that we use include palm (kernel) oil, 
paper and pulp. Palm (kernel) oil is transformed into a 
surfactant and mixed into many cleansing agents that 
we manufacture and sell including shampoo and body 
soap. Also, pulp is a crucial raw material used in 
sanitary products (such as diapers and sanitary 
napkins), one of our leading product categories.
 Future global scale population growth and 
economic development may increase demand for

Policies

Efforts are now being made around the world to reduce 
negative impacts on nature and biodiversity, increase behavior 
that has positive impacts, and reverse biodiversity loss to 
achieve recovery.
 In 2021, our activities in this area were mainly conducted in 
line with our previously formulated Basic Policies on 
Conservation of Biodiversity.
 With the revision of international targets on biodiversity at 
COP15 in 2022, we have revised our Basic Policies on 
Conservation of Biodiversity looking ahead to the next ten years.
 The revised Basic Policy on Biodiversity contain a total 
of eight policies. They are: (1) Identify the relationship 
between our business activities and biodiversity throughout 
the value chain, (2) Minimize the impacts of our business 
activities on biodiversity, (3) Promote and implement the 
development of innovative technologies, (4) Comply with 
relevant international agreements, (5) Do not damage local 
ecosystems in the vicinity of our business activities, (6) 
Maximize the outcomes of collaboration by sharing 
information and raising awareness among stakeholders 
inside and outside our group, and (7) Pursue cooperation 
with external stakeholders and take action leading to 
conservation and restoration of biodiversity and 
regeneration of the natural environment, as well as the 
newly-added (8) Aim to achieve a harmonious relationship 
between people, nature and chemicals. Taking advantage of 
the opportunity provided by the revision of the Basic Policy 
on Biodiversity, we will raise the level of activities we have 
been conducting and add new activities to them.

cleansing agents and sanitary products, resulting in 
even further growth in demand for palm oil, paper and 
pulp, our main necessary raw materials. Procurement 
of sustainable raw materials that take into 
consideration biodiversity, human rights violations and 
other issues may give rise to additional costs. 
However, if we do not give consideration to 
sustainability in procurement, the inability to procure 
raw materials over the long term or the substantial 
impairment of the company’s reputation may call our 
business survival into question.
 In addition, if we maintain a linear economy in 
which products including packaging are consumed 
without being recycled or reused, resources will be 
further depleted and flow into the environment, 
resulting in increased impacts on biodiversity. We 
need to make the transition to a resource circulating 
economy and to provide products with even more 
added value that use less resources.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
We established the Basic Policies on Conservation of 
Biodiversity in 2011 and have been developing new 
technologies that can contribute to sustainable 
procurement of raw materials and the conservation of 
biodiversity.
 The ESG Promotion Activities with Suppliers, 
which were revised in June 2021, set targets for 
confirming zero deforestation in places of origin for 
palm oil, paper and pulp, and we are increasing the 

possibility of business continuity by taking specific 
initiatives with suppliers to achieve sustainable 
procurement of raw materials in the future.
 Bio IOS, a surfactant that we developed, is a 
completely new surfactant developed by utilizing solid 
fats and oils that are unsuitable for food and avoids 
the issue of competition with food, a concern in 
conjunction with the global scale population increase. 
Applications are expected to expand as a technology 
that solves various problems such as the shortage of 
raw materials.

Kao’s creating value
IPBES* believes that transformative change in 
economies, society, politics, and science and 
technology will be necessary in order to achieve the 
biodiversity targets. We set targets based on visions 
and policies specified by ESG management and push 
forward toward the prevention and restoration of the 
degradation of biodiversity and the development of a 
sustainable society in the future through our 
innovative technologies, products and daily initiatives 
to solve social problems.

Education and promotion

After formulating the Basic Policies on Conservation 
of Biodiversity in 2011, we took other initiatives to 
provide basic knowledge about biodiversity to 
employees by such means as e-learning courses for 
all employees of the Kao Group in Japan and annual 
environmental training for new employees. In 2021, 
we created opportunities to learn about the latest 
global trends regarding biodiversity and how they 
relate to our business activities, primarily through 
training sessions for front-line leaders in the SCM 
Division (with participants from within and outside 
Japan) and follow-up training sessions for new 
employees. Additionally, in the section dealing with 
ESG topics posted on the intranet, we provide tips on 
studying and considering how our lifestyles relate to 
biodiversity as the themes for SDG Targets 14 and 15 
so that our employees can put this into action. For 
employees outside of Japan, we are conducting 
information sharing and awareness-raising activities 

through such venues as the annual Global RC 
Meeting.
 Since COP15 was originally scheduled for October 
2021 (postponed until 2022 due to the COVID-19 
pandemic), there had been considerable action 
relating to biodiversity within and outside Japan. In 
June 2021, we held a lecture given by an external 
expert, investigated the latest international trends 
relating to biodiversity, and discussed the actions that 
we should take. The lecture was archived in both 
Japanese and English for distribution to employees 
within and outside Japan. Afterward, we held a 
dialogue between the divisions responsible for 
biodiversity and the lecturer, and in October, we held 
a lecture and conducted an exchange of opinions for 
management. The content of the recently revised 
Basic Policy on Biodiversity reflects both the latest 
international trends and the results of the dialogue 
with the external lecturer.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

Promote sustainable raw materials procurement

We take into consideration the conservation of 
biodiversity and support zero deforestation in our 
procurement of raw materials including palm oil, palm 
kernel oil, paper and pulp. We continue to procure 
palm oil and palm kernel oil, all of which can be 
traced back to their production area, and to only 
purchase pulp for which its wood material can be 

traced back to its production area.
 We seek to create a sustainable supply chain for 
palm oil and improve and sustain the productivity of 
small oil palm farms in Indonesia. We launched the 
Smallholder Inclusion for Better Livelihood & 
Empowerment program, which seeks to obtain 
certification for sustainable palm oil.
 In August 2021, we released the Supply Chain 
ESG Promotion Guidelines. We collaborate with 
suppliers to contribute to ensuring traceability 
throughout the entire supply chain and solving social 
issues such as resource and environmental 
protection, safety and human rights issues. In addition 
to complying with laws and regulations, we require 
our suppliers to consider social responsibility and the 
environment, and we prioritize procurement from 
suppliers who comply. Consideration for social 
responsibility and the environment includes issues 
that are deeply related to biodiversity, such as forest 
and water conservation.

Biodiversity

Framework

The loss of biodiversity is one of the major social problems 
surrounding our company. Among the 19 actions 
established in the Kirei Lifestyle Plan, measures such as 
responsibly sourced raw materials, decarbonization, zero 
waste (plastic reduction etc.), air & water pollution 
prevention and responsible chemicals management are 
closely related to biodiversity.
 Forests are a source of key raw materials for Kao, and 
are of course important in terms of sustainable raw material 
procurement (related to the KLP action responsibly sourced 
raw materials). Forests are also habitats for diverse 
organisms, places to store water, and sinks for carbon 
dioxide, which is a cause of global warming. Not destroying 
peatlands as sites for storing carbon along with forests is 
extremely important not only from the viewpoint of business 
continuity, but also the viewpoints of biodiversity and global 
warming control (related to the KLP action decarbonization).
 Moreover, we will take action to prevent air and water 
pollution from exhaust and wastewater emissions during 
manufacturing processes, to minimize the environmental 
impact of constituent materials and other substances 
discharged into the environment along with water after 
product use (related to KLP actions air & water pollution 
prevention and responsible chemicals management) and 
the biological and ecological impact of residual plastic 
packaging in the environment resulting from improper 
processing.
 Biodiversity involves complex factors that are 
intertwined, and it is not desirable for any of these activities 

to be missing or for one activity to have a negative impact 
on another. For this reason, it is necessary to organize these 
activities in an integrated manner from the perspective of 
biodiversity. From September to November 2021, we 
conducted discussions within the ESG Managing 
Committee, ESG Promotion Meeting, ESG External Advisory 
Board and other organizations. The ESG Managing 
Committee manages, reviews and approves annual 
progress, according to the respective KLP action KPIs, and 
ensures that the results of this process are reflected in 
actions taken in and after the following year. The ESG 
Managing Committee also reviewed and approved the 
revision of the Basic Policy on Biodiversity.
 We define conservation of biodiversity as one element 
of environmental conservation, which is a part of the 
Responsible Care (RC) activities. We establish policies, 
targets and plans relating to biodiversity and manage them 
along with the progress of measures under the RC 
promotion framework. Appropriate information sharing on 
the progress of measures is conducted at the annual RC 
Promotion Committee meeting, Japan RC Meeting and 
Global RC Meeting (the responsible executive officers 
participate in each of these meetings; in 2021, these 
meetings or exchanges of information were held online).

Ecosystem and biodiversity conservation 
activities in individual countries and regions
We have business sites around the world. Basic policies 
on biodiversity conservation are formulated by the 
Head Office in Japan, but the status of and approaches 
to biodiversity vary in different countries and regions. 
We believe that creating opportunities for the active 
exchange of opinions with various relevant stakeholders 
in each country and region including governmental 
agencies, NGOs, NPOs and experts can facilitate the 
effective implementation of biodiversity conservation 
activities, and we make recommendations to the 
responsible personnel in each country and region.

Awareness-raising
We undertake green space conservation activities at 
each business site in consideration of biodiversity and 
arrange events in which employees can participate. We 
also encourage employees to volunteer for outside 
biodiversity conservation programs. We aspire to deepen 
understanding of biodiversity among all employees 
through their active participation in these activities.
 At the Eco-Lab Museum in our Wakayama Plant 
where the global environment and Kao’s eco 
technologies are on display, we conduct community-
based awareness-raising activities for elementary 
students who will build the future. At the combined 
greenhouse facilities, the hot and humid climate of 
southern countries where palm trees grow is 
recreated and approximately 60 species of plants can 
be seen.

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance
Mid- to long-term targets 2025–2030
The Kao Way, our corporate philosophy, states that our 
mission is to create a Kirei life for all̶providing care and 
enrichment for the life of all people and the planet. From 
the perspective of biodiversity, we believe that caring for 
all people and the planet means maximizing the value to 
people, society and the planet by minimizing reliance 
and impacts on nature without exceeding the capacity of 
natural production and regeneration.

Development of a society that can continue to 
enjoy the benefits of biodiversity
With regard to palm oil, paper and pulp, which are our 
main raw materials, we set targets for confirming that 
there is no deforestation in the places of origin and 
ensuring traceability and are implementing specific 
measures to achieve those targets such as mapping 
deforestation risks and investigating plants 
determined to pose high risks. In 2020, we completed 
the confirmation of traceability back to large 
plantations, and our object by 2025 is to complete 
traceability to small oil palm farms.
 We believe that expanding sustainable production 
of raw materials and establishing procurement 
systems that do not involve deforestation or human 
rights violations will contribute to the formation of a 
sustainable society that permanently maintains the 
benefits of biodiversity for all stakeholders.

Minimizing the impact of products on 
biodiversity
We seek to minimize the impacts on biodiversity in all 
processes of our business activities including the 
impact on the environment from the procurement and 
use of raw materials, product development and 
disposal.
 Palm oil is used in many of our products, and it is 
predicted that future demand will increase steadily as 
a result of population increases on a global scale, 
making deforestation and shortages of raw materials 
issues of concern. We continue to develop 
technologies that use natural, non-edible oil sources 
as alternatives to palm oil. We are developing Bio IOS, 
which is made from an oil raw material that in the 
past posed a challenge in use as a surfactant, as well 
as microalgae, which can produce oil and fat raw 
materials with high efficiency.
 In addition, we are working to minimize the 
quantitative and qualitative impacts of components 
discharged into the environment along with water 
after product use and to solve the problems of plastic 
packaging that have already been discarded and 
ocean plastic pollution.

Assessing impact on biodiversity throughout the 
value chain
We used Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, 
Risks and Exposure (ENCORE), a risk assessment tool 
released under the guidance of the Natural Capital 
Finance Alliance (NCFA), an international financial 

industry organization active in the field of natural 
capital, to identify dependencies on natural capital 
and impact factors within the company. Among the 
identified factors were items for which uniform 
international assessment methods have not been 
established, and it will take a little more time to 
perform an overall evaluation with a certain degree of 
quantitativeness. However, the qualitative indication 
of notable natural capital and hotspots in our value 
chain has made it easier to prioritize our activities. In 
the future, we will reliably catch up on the 
development status of quantification methods and 
improve evaluation accuracy.

Mainstreaming biodiversity
Promoting the procurement and consumption of 
sustainable palm oil through Japan Sustainable Palm 
Oil Network to collaborate with other companies and 
various other measures such as encouraging 
employees to participate in business site green space 
conservation activities and outside biodiversity 
conservation activities contribute to mainstreaming 
biodiversity.
 We also participate in the Japan Business Initiative 
for Biodiversity (JBIB) and the Keidanren (Japan 
Business Federation) working group for the post-2020 
biodiversity framework to understand the latest 
international trends and coordinate and share 
information with other companies. The knowledge 
that we acquire is shared among relevant divisions 
within our company and used in activities.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
Considerable costs are involved in procuring 
sustainable raw materials, but we consider these 
activities an indispensable investment to make our 
business sustainable and a part of our social 
responsibility.
 As the trend toward ethical consumption is 
gaining traction in the European and American 
markets mainly driven by Millennials and Generation 
Z, products using sustainable raw materials with 
consideration for biodiversity are growing in demand. 
Our presence on the rapidly expanding ethical 
consumption market is enhanced through the 
incorporation of a biodiversity approach in the 
products we offer from the procurement of raw 
materials to the product’s design, usage and disposal.
 We expect the results of these activities not only 
to boost our reputation substantially, but also to be of 
financial and non-financial benefit.

Social impacts
These various processes intended to achieve the 2025 
targets relating to sustainable raw material 
procurement will restore and recover forest 
environments at raw material procurement sites and 
lead to improved respect for the human rights of local 
communities that use those environments.
 Forests stabilize global temperatures and climate, 
and play the role of breakwater systems to prevent 

disasters since they retain water. Various resources 
and bounties essential for our everyday lives, such as 
food, medicine, clean water and air, come from 
ecosystems and are estimated to have an economic 
value worth thousands of trillions of yen.
 Companies developing and selling products that 
take into consideration biodiversity from the 
procurement of raw materials to after the product is 
used and consumers choosing such products will 
bring about a society that better understands the 
biodiversity within many peoples’ daily lives and can 
contribute directly and indirectly to biodiversity 
restoration and regeneration of the natural 
environment. If we could use resources at a 
sustainable level considering the productivity of bio 
organisms, we can keep using nature’s bounty and 
sustain a comfortable lifestyle.

Performance in 2021

Performance
A new attempt
Identification of Kao material issues relating to 
biodiversity
In 2021, we used ENCORE, a risk assessment tool, 
to identify dependencies on natural capital and 
impact factors within our company.
 In our business activities, we use palm (kernel) oil 
and pulp as raw materials, and surfactants derived 
from palm oil are formulated into cleansing products. 
Also, after products are used, they are discharged 
into the environment along with used water, and 
some packaging is improperly disposed of and also 
released into the environment. As a result of this, 
ENCORE identified factors arising from the use of 
palm and pulp, the impact on ecosystems after 
products are discarded, greenhouse gases, waste 
and so on. We are also estimating the impacts on 
biodiversity based on climate change scenarios, 
performing risk / opportunity analysis, and estimating 
the financial impacts on our business activities.
 ENCORE is a tool that enables companies to assess 
the risks of the business activities that they directly 
conduct according to their business sectors and is not 
for assessing the entire supply chain. At this time, we 
sought to gain a broad understanding of the effects 
that we have on the natural environment throughout 

the supply chain. We assumed supply chains for 
representative products (assuming products with high 
sales including megabrands) in all of our business fields 
by appropriate sector assignment, covering not only 
operations performed directly by Kao, but also the 
upstream side, which receives supplies of raw 
materials, and the downstream side, up to use 
processes and post-disposal, and then we performed 
the evaluation. Since the results obtained from 
ENCORE are general for each sector, we selected 
results and examined them in light of our 
circumstances. For risk and opportunity analysis, we 
selected 2°C climate change scenarios (IEA’s 2DS 
scenario, IPCC’s RCP 2.6, etc.) and 4°C scenarios (IEA’s 
Current Policy Scenario, IPCC’s RCP 8.5, etc.). We 
conducted scenario analysis using climate change first 
to understand the impact of climate change on natural 
capital when performing various analyses and studies 
of biodiversity in the future and because climate change 
can be organized by a simple parameter, i.e., CO2, 
whereas natural capital involves complex factors and 
cannot be organized by simple parameters. It is also 
because numerous research examples and parameters 
have been proposed for climate change scenarios.
 The material issues relating to biodiversity include 
items for which uniform international assessment 
methods have not been established, and this is a topic 

that cannot be evaluated as a whole with a certain 
degree of quantitativeness. If the Science Based 
Targets for Nature and Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures frameworks are solidified in the 
future, we anticipate that it will be possible to perform 
more quantitative and comparable evaluations. We 
are working to carefully gather information.

Results of ongoing activities
1. Promote sustainable raw materials procurement

2.  Promote business and social contribution 
activities with consideration for local 
biodiversity

While activities were unavoidably limited due to the 
spread of COVID-19, as was the case in 2020, we 
conducted many activities that were possible 
within these constraints.

3. Reduce use of copy paper
The number of sheets printed per person has been 
reduced by 9.8% compared to the previous year, 
and thus, the target of reducing printing to below 
the previous year’s level was achieved.

Biodiversity

We seek to become a company that is essential for 
achieving harmony with nature. It is expected that an 
international agreement will be reached at COP15 and 
also that Japan’s national strategy will be formulated 
based on that agreement. Taking into consideration 
these global developments as well as the material 
issues, ongoing scenario analysis and financial impact 
analysis relating to biodiversity that we identified in 
2021, we will formulate a company-wide policy and 
more specific action plan.

Also, annual targets relating to biodiversity are set and 
managed each year within the RC targets managed 
through PDCA on a one-year activity unit basis. The 
2022 targets are as follows.

1.  Promote sustainable raw materials 
procurement

2.  Promote business and social contribution 
activities with consideration for local 
biodiversity

Based on the results of the biodiversity surveys of all 
Kao Group production sites conducted in 2018 and 
2019, each site plans feasible biodiversity 

Targets for 2022
4. Green procurement
Our green procurement rate in Japan was 
93.7%.

Reviews of performance
There are several cases in which our business 
and social activities with consideration for 
local biodiversity were forced to be suspended 
due to the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in 
2021, as in 2020. However, in some instances, 
these activities could be implemented while 
ensuring everyone’s safety thanks to the 
enthusiasm of the responsible personnel and 
participants, and we came to understand that 
the biodiversity conservation initiatives at each 
site are steadily taking root.
 The significant reduction in the use of copy 
paper in a short amount of time was made 
possible by a higher rate of employees working 
from home as well as active implementation 
by users. In 2021 and later, we will expand and 
undertake these initiatives globally.
 The promotion of green procurement has 
not achieved 100% of its target yet. We will 
work to raise the environmental awareness of 
purchasers and consider reviewing structures 
for purchasing goods compliant with the Act 
on Promoting Green Procurement.

conservation activities and implements them.
3. Reduce use of copy paper
As an activity that all employees can participate in, we 
have started reducing the use of copy paper at the 
Kao Group in Japan. From 2021 onwards, our 
objectives are to promote this activity globally and 
print less pages per person than the previous year.

4. Green procurement
We are promoting green procurement, which places 
priority on purchasing products with the least possible 
environmental impact. We have been taking action in 
this area based on Act on Promoting Green 
Procurement. We have set our 2022 target green 
purchasing rate in Japan at 100%.

Biodiversity 304-2

The ecological footprint assessment completed in 
2013 found that the majority of the environmental 
impact from our business activities resulted from 
carbon sinks, land on which oilseed crops were 
grown, cattle pastures, forests grown for pulp and 
paper, and fishing grounds affected by surfactants.

We use LIME2 (the second version of the Japanese 
version of the life-cycle impact assessment method 
based on endpoint modeling), which enables 
quantification of comprehensive environmental 
impact, to comprehensively assess the impacts of our 
products on various aspects of the environment. We 
conduct environmental impact assessments for 35 
major product categories and gain an understanding 
of the balance of environmental aspects to benefit 
product development. Going forward, we will make 
an evaluation with LIME3 (an environmental impact 
assessment method to attain global scale LCA).

This year, we used ENCORE to identify dependencies 
on natural capital and impact factors within the 
company. ENCORE is a tool for evaluating that portion

Our initiatives

of the supply chain that a company directly conducts, 
and to evaluate the impact on natural capital 
throughout the supply chain, we allocated each 
process in the supply chain to nearby sectors and 
implemented the evaluation.
 As a result, we identified five dependent factors 
and nine impact factors. Each of these factors was 
found to derive from palm and pulp, impacts on 
ecosystems after products are discarded, greenhouse 
gases, waste and so on. We are currently conducting 
risk / opportunity analysis and scenario analysis for 
each of these factors and estimating the financial 
impacts on our business activities.

Reducing the impact of 
business on biodiversity

To reduce the various impacts on biodiversity of our 
business activities, we are continually implementing 
the following measures. These measures are critical 
for Kao’s ESG Strategy, and they are listed in detail in 
this report.

•  Reduce the use of raw materials and switch to 
raw materials that can be sustainably procured 
and have lower environmental impact

•  Reducing CO2 emissions associated with business 
activities

•  Reduce the use of and impact on water resources

• Promote responsible chemicals management
Through appropriate chemicals management 
throughout the entire life cycle of chemicals and 
based on risk assessments with a scientific basis, we 
continue to create products to minimize the burden of 
chemicals on the environment and ecosystem.

For many years, we have produced high-grade 
industrial alcohols using oil and fat raw materials with 
carbon numbers of 12 to 14 that can be collected 
from the fruit of oil palm trees and other sources for 
use in a variety of household products. Fats and oils 
with carbon numbers of 12 to 14 only account for 5% 
of the world’s production of fats and oils. The 
remaining 95% are oils and fats with carbon numbers 
of 16 to 18 (Oil World Annual 2016). Fats and oils with 
carbon numbers of 16 to 18 contain solid parts 
unsuitable to use for human consumption, and as 
such the usage of these solid parts has been limited 
until now. Accordingly, we are generating Bio IOS, a 
high-quality surfactant, by applying materials science 
and synthesis technologies for surfactants. Bio IOS 
has already been put into practical use in Attack 
ZERO, a concentrated liquid laundry detergent, since 
2019.
 In addition, we are conducting research to use oils 
and fats produced by algae as an alternative to palm 
oil, which has low environmental impact and will not 
result in competition by raw materials with food 
applications.
 We believe that the ability to use materials that

previously had been of limited use as new ingredients 
in surfactant and the expansion of possibilities to use 
oils that do not compete with food applications will 
contribute to the sustainable use of biodiversity.
 Additionally, for over 30 years, we have conducted 
R&D on proteins, such as enzymes, and have 
continued to develop technologies to efficiently 
produce proteins using microbes such as bacteria. 
One of these technologies is protein production 
technology using Bacillus subtilis. This technology 
contributes to obtaining VHH antibodies that 
neutralize novel coronavirus, through joint research 
with Kitasato University and Epsilon Molecular 
Engineering, as announced in May 2020. Subsequent 
research results indicated that nasal delivery of the 
obtained VHH antibodies can inhibit replication of the 
novel coronavirus in infected lungs of hamster 
models. Furthermore, the binding pattern between 
the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and VHH antibodies 
was elucidated. These results indicate not only that 
the VHH antibodies are a potential therapeutic agent 
for COVID-19, but also that there is potential to 
expand treatment options using a new administration 
route in the form of nasal delivery.
 We also conducted research on the RNA of 
organisms found in the environment (environmental 
RNA) to establish high-precision ecological survey 
methods for preserving biodiversity. By 
comprehensively analyzing the RNA of fish that are 
abundant in rivers, we clarified that highly accurate 

ecological surveys are possible. DNA is more stable 
than RNA, and therefore, investigations using 
environmental DNA as an index will detect fish that 
do not live in the area, and since RNA degrades more 
easily than DNA, it can solve the problem of false 
positives for organisms that are no longer present and 
could be an effective way of visualizing the true state 
of an ecosystem.
 By leveraging the strength of our protein 
production technology with Bacillus subtilis, we will 
continue to contribute widely to solving social 
problems such as communicable disease measures. 
We will continue our research on environmental RNA, 
and in the future, we seek to contribute to the 
sustainability of society and the environment by 
minimizing biodiversity loss caused by human 
activities through the use of this technology.

We undertake business activities in accordance with 
international agreements and related national and 
regional laws on biodiversity determined by the 
Convention on Biological Diversity and its contracting 
parties, the Conference of the Parties.
 In addition, we were one of the first in Japan to 
announce support for zero deforestation in the 
procurement targets set in the Guidelines for 
Sustainable Procurement of Raw Materials in 2014. 
We also signed the New York Declaration on Forests 
announced at the United Nations Climate Summit 
held in New York in September of that year. Details of 
our activities contributing to the Aichi Biodiversity 
Targets are reported below. Going forward, we will 
contribute to achieving the targets set in the post-
2020 global biodiversity framework, which is expected 
to be agreed on in 2022.

We have been active in our own green spaces and 
have engaged in local contribution activities that 
consider regional biodiversity. There are multiple 
certification systems in Japan for corporate green 
spaces that pursue consideration for biodiversity, and 
we have received certification for the following plants 
and worksites.

Wakayama Plant: SEGES Excellent Stage 1 
certification (2005), Superlative Stage certification 
(2017)

Kashima Plant: ABINC certification (acquired in 2015 
and renewed in 2018 and 2021)
Kawasaki Plant: ABINC certification (acquired in 2018 
and renewed in 2021)

Odawara Office: ABINC certification (acquired in 2020)

Even after acquiring certification, each plant has 
maintained and intensified green space conservation 
activities. The Wakayama Plant obtained SEGES*1 
Superlative Stage certification, the highest level 
among five levels of certification, and has maintained 
that level. Also, the Kashima Plant renewed its 
ABINC*2 certification in 2018 and 2021, while the 
Kawasaki Plant renewed its certification in 2021. In all 
instances, scores are higher than at the time of the 
previous review were obtained.
*1  Social and Environmental Green Evaluation System 

A system that evaluates high-quality green spaces created by 
companies as well as their day-to-day activities and efforts and 
certifies well-maintained green spaces that contribute to society 
and the environment

*2  Association for Business Innovation in Harmony with Nature and 
Community 
An organization whose purpose is to create mechanisms that 
enable people to coexist with living organisms, scientifically and 
technically verify those mechanisms, and promote their  
commercialization

Implementing measures based on global 
biodiversity evaluation criteria
In contrast to this, to the best of our knowledge, there 
are no certification systems for corporate green spaces 
outside of Japan where we have production sites. To 
address this, biodiversity indicators were introduced in

Biodiversity 304-1, 304-2

2017 to determine the extent to which local 
biodiversity-conscious activities are being carried out at 
each location where we conduct business around the 
world, and in 2018 and 2019 we completed biodiversity 
evaluations at all production sites including those sites 
that we recently acquired. By utilizing the indicators, we 
can clarify issues from a biodiversity perspective and 
improve their score by promoting these activities, 
which will make confirming their progress simpler.
 The primary objective of introducing these criteria 
is to contribute to conservation of the biodiversity of 
the local ecosystems of which individual sites enjoy 
the benefits by determining current conditions and 
actively undertaking biodiversity conservation at 
individual sites or in nearby green spaces with a clear 
understanding of targets by employees.
 We believe that our thinking is communicated to 
many involved persons including local residents in an 
expanding circle of activity, thereby contributing to 
the mainstreaming of biodiversity.

Kawasaki Plant
Biodiversity surveys conducted in green spaces
The plant has a green space that is extensive enough to 
contribute to biodiversity, with primarily evergreen trees 
on the plant grounds. It is one of the leading green 
spaces in the region and a healing place for employees. 
Since 2017, we have conducted surveys of the wildlife 
living in the green space (as of October 2020, there were 
262 species of plants, 22 species of wild birds, and 130 
species of insects) and educational activities relating to 

biodiversity. We regularly disseminate information to 
employees concerning the details of conservation 
activities including a breeding protection area for the 
Byasa alcinous. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has 
been necessary to cancel biodiversity-related events 
since 2020, but in 2020 outside experts conducted a 
wildlife survey (conducted every three years), and in 
2021 we conducted a field survey for the purpose of 
organizing and accumulating information on the natural 
environment in order to use the plant green space for 
information dissemination and education. Based on the 
results of surveys to date and the circumstances of the 
tidal flats at the mouth of the Tama River, which is rich in 
biodiversity, we plan to look into forest maintenance and 
the creation of a biotope in the future.

Kashima Plant
Internal educational events taught by outside 
experts held
As a result of many years of efforts to create traditional 
forests with strong community ties since the start of 

The Byasa alcinous lives in the green space at the plant.

operations more than 40 years ago, the plant has a 
forest with abundant biodiversity inhabited by 143 
species of plants, 44 species of wild birds, and 77 
species of insects (based on a 2021 survey). In-person 
events relating to biodiversity were again canceled in 
2021 due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, but 
the advantages of remote events were used and an 
educational event with the targets expanded from new 
employees and worksite environmental promotion staff 
to all plant employees was planned and conducted in 
May 2021. A representative of the Ibaraki Prefecture 
Environmental Management Association, which the 
plant asks to conduct the annual wildlife survey, was 
invited to act as a lecturer, and about 100 employees 
including remote participants attended. This event was a 
good opportunity for many employees to share 
information on the background of the Employees’ Forest 
that they planted and nurtured themselves as well as an 
external evaluation, and we would like to continue this 
event on an annual basis. The Kashima Plant will 
continue to undertake internal and external biodiversity 
activities with the cooperation of all employees.

KSA
Plans to expand the area for planting native wild 
plants
Kao Specialties Americas LLC (KSA) is a company in 
High Point, North Carolina in the south of the United 
States. A mixed forest of various coniferous and 
broad-leaf trees spreads throughout the site. KSA 
conducted a biodiversity assessment in 2019, learning 
that highly varied wildlife including threatened species 
inhabit the area.
 Since then, KSA has been promoting biodiversity 
conservation activities in earnest, and employees are 
also actively participating.
 In 2021, in addition to existing biodiversity 
conservation initiatives, KSA set a target of planting 
1,000m² (10,764ft²) with native wild flowers on the 
site by 2024 and started action to achieve this target. 
The main objectives of this program are as follows.

•  Provide habitats for pollinators such as bees and 
butterflies

•  Reduce lawn mowing and fuel requirements by 
converting traditional lawns to flowering grassland

 In April, KSA employees sowed seeds of wild 
flowers that grow in North Carolina obtained from a 
local seed farm. By June, these plants were blooming 
colorfully, much to the pleasure of the employees.
 In October, KSA employees again conducted their 
annual planting program to plant seedlings that are 
native to North Carolina and that they purchased 
themselves. A total of 44 employees participated and 
14 saplings were planted.

KCSA
Internal education on biodiversity: Selecting the 
Species of the Year
At Kao Corporation S.A. (Spain) (KCSA), we recognize 
the importance of biodiversity in developing the future of 
the planet. In 2018, we formulated Biodiversity Policies 
that include a commitment to maintain and promote 
biodiversity to carry out the Sustainability and Risk 
Prevention Policy. Annual activities in line with the four 
commitments incorporated in the Biodiversity Policies 
(promotion of conservation programs, the provision of 
appropriate resources to those organizing activities, 
raising the awareness of employees and relevant parties, 
and designs with green space and maintenance plans 
that give consideration to ecology networks) include tree 
planting, birdhouse and insect hotel installation, expert-
guided on-site biodiversity tours, and disclosure of 
activity information to employees.
 In 2021, we launched a new initiative to select the 
Species of the Year from among the organisms that live 
on the KCSA sites and present detailed information on its 
ecology. Since there is an extremely large amount of 
information concerning biodiversity, we thought that it 
would be more effective to focus communication on 
explaining one species each year. We selected the 
sparrow as the 2021 species. The main reason for 
selecting the sparrow is that it is a wild bird commonly 
found at all three KCSA sites but is rapidly declining 
around the world, so we wanted to provide detailed 
information concerning its ecology. We created a system 
that makes it easy to learn about the Species of the Year 
by providing basic information and using a quiz format on

We have been participating in the JBIB since its 
establishment in 2008. JBIB is an organization of 
companies from different industries that seriously 
consider biodiversity conservation efforts and 
implement specific initiatives. They are divided into 
multiple working groups on individual topics and 
discuss how companies can contribute to biodiversity 
conservation.

We also collaborate with stakeholders including the 
Organization for Landscape and Urban Green 
Infrastructure (Kao Creating Forest for Everyone 
program) and the Organization for Industrial, Spiritual 
and Cultural Advancement (OISCA) (FURUSATO 
Environment Conservation Project in Northern 
Thailand) to undertake initiatives that will lead to the 
conservation of biodiversity.

the company intranet. In addition, we installed panels in 
the reception rooms or other areas of each plant in 
succession to explain the ecology of sparrows and 
devised methods of sparking employee interest.
 In the future, we hope to encourage more active 
participation by employees such as by having 
employees select the Species of the Year. This 
educational program currently targets employees, but 
when we resume factory tours, we will consider 
making the information available to factory tour 
visitors and other stakeholders as well.

Su nombre científico Passer domesticus hace
clara alusión a su cercanía con el hombre.
También en inglés House sparrow y en francés
Moineau domestique se le distingue por su
vinculación al ser humano. En España se le
denomina pardal dejando claro los colores que
viste.

Es de contextura fuerte y de patas cortas, pero
firmes. Ostenta en la cabeza unas manchas
con distintos tonos de grises. El pico fuerte y
grueso tiene forma cónica. Los ojos son
pequeños y grises. El macho tiene un barbero
negro, es decir, una vistosa mancha negra que
abarca su garganta, cuello y la parte superior
del pecho.

Su talla ronda los 15 cm.

Tiene una envergadura
entre 21 y 25,5 cm.

Castaño con rayas negras
por encima y blanco en la
barriga.

Pesa alrededor de 30 g.

Orden Passeriformes
Familia PasseridaeLos machos ostentan un plumaje rico lleno de

contrastes sobre todo en la cabeza. En invierno
lucen una banda pardo-rojiza detrás del ojo y un
babero bien oscuro. Mientras que las hembras
son menos vistosas. Al observar estas aves entre
agosto y septiembre tendremos más problemas
para diferenciar los machos jóvenes de las
hembras.

We also engage in conservation activities relating to 
the oceans, which are a treasure trove of biodiversity, 
and are currently working with Wakayama City and 
Osaka Prefecture University with the aim of 
conserving the marine environment.
 In 2021, we launched a survey of marine plastic 
waste on Tomogashima in Wakayama City. We are 
conducting research on reusing the recovered marine 
plastic as equipment for beach facilities or as a road 
strengthening agent for cycling paths. We also 
participate in cleanup programs.

Communication with consumers 102-15, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Social issues and Kao’s 
creating value
Social issues we are aware of
1. Societal ideals and current issues
Achieving a sustainable society requires action from 
businesses to facilitate consumers’ ethical 
consumption behavior beyond the effective and safe 
products or services they develop or provide. 
Therefore, they are required to provide products and 
services that are more ESG-focused than ever before. 
In addition, with the popularization of the internet and 
smartphones, distribution methods for these products 
and services are expected to diversify and make 
further advancements. The number of foreign 
nationals living in Japan is also expected to increase 
in the future. As such, new means of communication 
that are conscious of information and communication 
technology and diversity are also required to 
communicate with consumers.

2.  Our current state and assets (including 
production systems and equipment, 
intellectual property, human capital, internal 
and external networks, investments, etc.)

We collect consumer feedback received by the 

By engaging in-depth communication with consumers, we ensure that feedback from customers is utilized to enhance ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri and the 
services we offer, while providing lifestyle information that helps consumers of all ages solve their own problems. The world in which consumers live and 
their mindset are significantly changing. These changes include the COVID-19 pandemic, increased natural disasters due to climate change and improved 
awareness of SDGs. Consumers’ interest in businesses is diversifying to encompass initiatives for a sustainable society in addition to products and services. 
However, with such excessive information, it is becoming difficult to find what you want or accurate information.
We aim to be a trusted partner to consumers, offering support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year with a focus on the changes taking place in consumers’ living 
environments, and we will continue to proactively develop new communication measures for consumers.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
•  Dissatisfaction with the lack of information in 

response to demands for disclosure of ingredients, 
safety information and so on as a result of rising 
consumer awareness regarding safety and security

•  Delayed response or inadequate consideration 
(environmental, safety) for substances of concern

•  Use of products in other countries that were 
developed for domestic use

•  Inadequate consideration for cultural and other 
differences

•  Greater scope of damage from accidents with 
products occurring within and outside Japan, and 
from delays in product safety determinations

•  Reduced consumer convenience from production 
stoppages and delays, increased social unrest from 
products being out of stock

•  Loss of communication capacity with consumers 
during disasters, pandemics and the like

•  Loss of corporate credibility from leaks of obtained 
personal information

•  Spread over social media of inappropriate 
advertising expression, scandals involving celebrity 
spokespersons, etc.

•  Spread over social media of incorrect usage 

consultation desk in the Kao ECHO System, and the 
more than 3 million pieces of wide-ranging consumer 
feedback collected here from people within and 
outside Japan are shared company-wide. After 
analyzing this from different consumer-driven 
perspectives, each division in our company leverages 
this analysis to facilitate global quality improvement 
activities, develop sustainable products and 
information and foster a relationship of trust with 
consumers. By aggregating the CRM system which 
performs these tasks individually, a system to 
customize the receipt and dissemination of 
information for each stakeholder is implemented.

3. What is Kao aiming for?
To achieve ethical and safe consumer behavior that 
takes society and the environment into consideration, 
we aim to develop products and services and provide 
information while being cognizant of consumer 
purchasing and consumption behavior from product 
selection to disposal and repeat purchase when 
companies provide products and services. More than 
just the products and services we offer, we aim to 
become indispensable to consumers by helping to 
resolve the issue they face in their lives.

Kao’s creating value
At our consumer support desk inside our Consumer 
Communication Center, we take feedback from 
individual consumers seriously and strive to 
understand their feelings, solve their problems and 

understand the background to the problems to 
support ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri based on the 
principles of the Kao Way.
 We are taking various steps to serve the needs of 
different consumers. Based on the concept of 
Universal Design (UD), we have set up a support desk 
with dedicated sign language support to serve people 
with hearing impairments. For people with visual 
impairments, we have added descriptive text to the 
images and tables in our product catalog on the Kao 
website that can be read by text-to-speech software. 
We have also set up telephone support desks able to 
handle inquiries in English, Chinese and Korean to 
serve tourists visiting Japan as well as foreign 
nationals living in Japan.
 Using our websites, we provide product catalogs 
and communicate information via FAQs so that 
people attempting to solve problems on their own are 
able to do so with accurate information. Another way 
we are engaging in proactive communication with 
consumers is by providing official support using the 
Q&A service Yahoo! Chiebukuro.
 We are also adopting multi-lingual labeling of 
product information to ensure accurate understanding 
of our products by foreign visitors and residents in 
Japan. Two-dimensional codes are being added to 
product information provided in stores so that 
consumers can immediately access product 
information in Chinese or English on the Kao website.
 We are also striving to communicate information 
that is essential in daily life, including COVID-19 

We are committed to offering products, services and 
information that benefit consumers based on the 
principles of the Kao Way. We will ensure consumers’ 
confidence in us and contribute to ESG-driven Yoki-
Monozukuri for people, society and the planet as is 
suitable for a sustainable society by avoiding various 
major risks such as those related to quality, and 
environmental or societal issues arising during 
support while also diversifying our communication 
methods through digital transformation and 
expanding consumers’ abilities to solve problems on 
their own. Through the establishment of a pandemic-
proof support framework and work style reform for 
communication, we aim to be a trusted partner to 
consumers, offering support 24 hours a day, 365 days 
a year, and we will continue to proactively develop 
new communication measures for consumers.

Education and promotion

We implement regular external evaluations and 
training to maintain a high-quality support and 
consultation and continue to improve this. We strive 
to provide consistent service and information, by 
checking the quality of our support with the Quality of 
Telephone Support Survey conducted by a research 
firm. With the Support Satisfaction Survey targeting 
consumers, we identify customer satisfaction through 
a net promoter score and their willingness to continue 
using the product.
 Apart from the Consumer Communication Center, 
we hold trainings on handling consultations for 
members who handle consultations (Kao Professional 
Services, Chemical Division, DX Strategy Promotion 
Center, e’quipe), and workshops for business divisions 
to study cases based on customer feedback gathered 
in the ECHO System. 
 We also proactively conduct activities to deepen 
employees’ understanding of consumers’ 
perspectives and leverage the voice of consumers.

Exchanging information with consumer affairs 
centers and consumer groups
We strive to maintain positive relationships with 
external institutions and organizations, as well as have 
our approach be better understood, by exchanging 
information about the Consumer Communication 
Center’s annual report, recent consumer trends and 
noteworthy inquiries once a year with public bodies 
and consumer groups, including consumer affairs 
centers led by regional government agencies.

Implementation of exchange activities involving 
consumer-oriented events
At events such as public lectures and consumer fairs, 
we offer to consumers a wide range of information 
concerning laundry, proper hand-washing techniques, 
housecleaning, oral health care, bathing, UD and 
other topics. We position these events as 
opportunities to directly understand the various issues 
faced by consumers from a different avenue than the 
support desks and connect them to ESG-driven Yoki-
Monozukuri.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

Framework

The Consumer Communication Center consists of 
three departments that are active at the Sumida 
Office, Osaka Office, and eight branch offices of Kao 
Group Customer Marketing Co., Ltd.
 Consumers Relations collects the consultation 
details including consumer feedback and opinions 
through open communication with consumers and 
immediately registers these details in the ECHO 
System. In addition, it is responsible for internal 
training and disseminating and responding to 
information on risks such as quality and societal 
issues.
 Product Relations conducts activities that 
contribute to ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri, such as 
addressing quality risks from the consumer’s 
perspective and improving products and displays 
from analysis of consultation data.
 Communication Business Promotion helps to 
ensure smooth operation for consumer 
communication, which encompasses managing the 
ECHO System, preparing information, disseminating 
Q&As about products on the website, gathering 
information on technology and society, drafting 
information for external organizations and managing 
overall operations.

Communication with consumers 417-1

1.  Answering consumer inquiries by means 
such as telephone or e-mail (Global)

In 2021, Kao Corporation, Nivea-Kao Co., Ltd. and 
Kanebo Cosmetics Inc. answered a total of around 
181,000 consumer inquiries in Japan received via 
telephone, e-mail and other means (+1% year on 
year). Telephone support for inquiries, which is a 
major communication channel, was suspended for 
two months in 2020. The hours of operation were 
shortened until August 2021, and this affected the 
number of inquiries received, which was 16% 
lower than in 2019.
 E-mail inquiries fell to 22,000 (-28% year on 
year). One factor for the decrease was the 
substantial increase in e-mail inquiries received 
during the period when telephone support was 
suspended. E-mail inquiries increased 9% 
compared with 2019.
 By business division, the Home Care Business 
had a significant decrease in inquiries related to 
COVID-19, and the Skin Care Business, which had 
higher hygiene-related inquiries in 2020, received 
fewer inquiries at approximately 20,000 (-32% year 
on year). In addition, Cosmetics (Sofina, Curél and 
Kanebo Cosmetics) received approximately 45,000 
inquiries (+11% year on year), which is 28% lower 
than in 2019.

 Among the inquiries related to COVID-19, 
those related to hygiene for sanitizing and viral 
disinfection decreased, and the nature of the 
inquiries changed to include ones about 
vaccinations and feedback about products that 
advertised viral disinfection ability.
 Excluding Japan, globally we received 
approximately 32,000 inquiries (-8% year on year). 
Typically, fewer inquiries are received by telephone, 
while many inquiries are received through e-mail 
and other communication channels. In addition to 
social impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, 
inquiries were also substantially affected by the 
contraction in economic activities, including a 
downturn in MK activities and suspension of retail 
store operations.
 We hold periodic online meetings for members 
engaged in consumer support at Kao companies in 
Asia, which are opportunities to share inquiry 
information and improve the quality of our inquiry 
support.

2.  Providing practical information on our 
website (Japan)

Consumers now have better understanding of 
sanitization and viral disinfection, and we received 
fewer inquiries about viruses at our support desks. 

Performance in 2021

Similarly, views of our product Q&A about 
infection control measures also stabilized.
 Traffic to the website that summarizes 
information on inquiries about infection control 
measures that have recently increased fell sharply 
in 2021 to just 10% of 2020 traffic. Traffic to 
website product Q&A pages in 2021 came to 
approximately 4 million UU* (-52% year on year). 
Meanwhile, traffic to product Q&A pages for 
products other than those related to infection 
control increased 25% year on year.
 We have launched a chat bot and live chats in 
the laundry and cleaning category to expand our 
communication channels. In the future, we will 
expand these to all categories of household 
products. Along with launching the chat bot, we 
are proactively posting product Q&A highlighting 
inquiries we frequently receive identified from 
analysis of call logs, and the number of Q&A we 
published doubled over last year.
 Compared to claims which consumers 
communicate with the company directly and 
interactively, the declining trend is seen in the 
number inquiries in which there are means for the 
consumer to solve the problem on their own, 
without using the telephone or e-mail. The 
Consumer Communication Center views this as

3.  Providing active support for questions 
posted on a Q&A board (Japan)

On Yahoo! Chiebukuro, under the user name 
“kao_official,” Kao Official Support began 
providing answers to consumers’ questions posted 
to the service beginning in 2015. In 2021, an 
estimated total 900 new questions were answered. 
On the Q&A service, the answers to questions stay 
on the feed and can be read by many people with 
similar issues. The yearly number of views in 2021 
of the past questions and answers (approximately 
7,800 questions) was around 1.55 million. As a 
relative high proportion of questions are posed by 
young people, Kao support desks are able to 
answer questions for people unable to 
communicate otherwise. Problems that are 
different from those directly received by telephone 
and e-mail are among the top-viewed answers on 
the site.
 In 2021, questions about viral disinfectant and 
sanitation that were prevalent in 2020 decreased, 
and ones about rough skin when wearing masks 
and concerns over bangs or smudged makeup 

continued to be frequently asked. There were also 
reactions to the period poverty and the reward-
point campaign for cashless payment, both of 
which drew a lot of attention in Japan.

4.  External activities affected by the 
COVID-19 pandemic

Exchanging information with consumer 
groups and consumer affairs centers
Until 2019, we visited around 100 public bodies 
responsible for consumer affairs, primarily 
consumer affairs centers, to exchange information, 
but due to restrictions on people’s movements and 
in-person visits, we sent the public bodies the 
Consumer Communication Center’s activities 
report just like we did in 2020 and made efforts to 
communicate that we were continuing the relevant 
activities.

Implementation of exchange activities 
involving consumer-oriented events
Since there were restrictions on large crowds in 
2021 as well due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
in-person social activities were canceled. However, 
in response to requests from the consumer affairs 
centers, we are committed to online public 
lectures enabling us to hold these lectures in 
regions that we were unable to do so in-person in 

the past. We will continue holding public lectures 
differentiating ones in-person and online in and 
after 2022 as well.

5. Initiatives compliant with ISO 10002
We announced in 2019 our compliance with ISO 
10002: Quality management̶Customer 
satisfaction̶Guidelines for complaints handling in 
organizations, and are operating in compliance 
thereto. In 2021, we also conducted an internal 
audit confirming our compliance.
 With the revision of the Kao Way in 2021, we 
also revised our basic policy, code of conduct and 
self-compliance declaration, and released them on 
our website.
 Affiliated companies outside Japan are also 
starting to apply the inquiry response guidelines 
based on the requirements of ISO 10002.

“Ways of Everyday World-
Making” workshops to balance 
parenting and work

The Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and 
Advancement in the Workplace (Women’s 
Advancement Promotion Law) came into force in 
September 2015. However, the rates of female 
employees in permanent employment or managerial 
roles in Japan are low even when viewed 
internationally, and Japan continues to have a low 
ranking in the World Economic Forum’s Global 
Gender Gap Report, therefore in reality the extent of 
women’s advancement is still meager. In this context, 
many women have concerns and anxiety about 
balancing work and childbirth or parenting.
 Together with Takashi Iba Laboratory of Keio 
University, we researched and created the “Ways of 
Everyday World-Making” pattern language to support 
women who are working and raising children. It 
contains 34 short phrases that represent keys for living 
well while working and parenting. We have released a 
PDF of this booklet on our Lifestyle Research (Kurashi 
no kenkyu) website since 2017, and continue to hold 
workshops which provide opportunities for 
participants to consider how to positively balance 
parenting and work in their own unique way.
 In 2021, these workshops were implemented 
continuing the online format from the previous year 
due to COVID-19, but with cooperation from outside 

Our initiatives

career consultants and post-childcare-leave advisors, 
we held 7 workshops for 55 participants. Participants 
outside the Tokyo metropolitan area increased, taking 
advantage of the workshops being online.
 While the nature of parenting and work is 
changing due to the proliferation of teleworking, we 
have been receiving mostly positive feedback from 
the participants of this workshop. One of which 
stated, “This was a great opportunity to reconsider 
how I want myself and my family to be in the future.”
 Through this activity, we will continue to consider 
together with consumers what a brighter future looks 
like for living well in combination with working and 
parenting and implementing this in our product and 
communication solutions.

As life with COVID-19 continues, we are seeing 
overwhelming interest in measures against communicable 
diseases, how to be productive while staying home, and 
contributing to a sustainable society, thereby businesses 
as well are required to inform consumers of these matters.
 We launched the Lifestyle Research website in 2014

we increased the publication of new articles to three times 
a month, striving to release ever more timely information.
 In the articles on the consumer research report, we 
continue to communicate how lifestyles are changing 
with COVID-19, encompassing perceptions of domestic 
work, parenting and beauty, behavior changes, and 
growing interest in disaster prevention and SDGs during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, and many readers are 
commenting that these insights strike a chord with them. 
The reports on quantitative consumer surveys, which 
observe lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic 
at fixed-points, have been widely featured in newspapers, 
television programs, online news and other media.
 Additionally, in a lifestyle information section, we 
provide timely expertise to make living with COVID-19 
more comfortable, encompassing remedies for inactivity 
or eye strain due to teleworking and staying at home and 
how to approach worries about measures against 
communicable diseases such as sweaty masks, face mask 
tan lines, and rough hands due to hand-washing and using 
disinfectant. We strive to also provide useful and reliable 
information which is easy to understand pertaining to 
facial cleansing, do-it-yourself haircuts and methods for 
online makeup as explained by our researchers.
 The information on the Lifestyle Research website is 
popular with consumers, and has increasingly attracted 
traffic each year, with monthly page views around 
200,000. We will continue to improve our provision of 
useful information for consumers via the Lifestyle 
Research website, with a focus on living in the new 
normal.

We implement process safety and disaster prevention activities with the aim of ensuring the safety of employees and maintenance of safe, stable operations, 
stipulating matters relating to prevention of accidents, emergency response and strengthened security.
Through these activities, we aim to completely eliminate accidents.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

provide regional communities in which local residents 
can live in peace of mind and employees at worksites 
can operate in safety without fear of accidents.

Contributions to the SDGs

Policies

Activities to ensure process safety and disaster 
prevention are clearly stipulated in the Kao 
Responsible Care (RC) Policy, which states that Kao 
will “strive to prevent accidents by improving on-site 
safety competency” and that furthermore, “Top 
management will exercise leadership to continuously 
improve our safety culture and safety infrastructure by 
putting safety first. We will also maintain safe and 
stable operations by systematically implementing 
equipment-related and administrative measures. We 
shall strive to prevent fires, explosions and chemical 
spills, place maximum priority on safeguarding human 
life when responding to natural disasters, and prepare 
for emergencies by conducting periodical training that 
takes into consideration the need to strengthen 
security related to facilities, processes and 
technology.” We are endeavoring to prevent accidents 
and disasters in accordance with this policy.

Education and promotion

Through education planning using past cases, the 
latest technologies and knowledge, as well as 
response drills on process safety and disaster 
prevention, we are able to communicate skills and 
strengthen security. Along with this, we strive to raise 
employees’ disaster prevention awareness by 
planning and conducting drills for natural disasters 
and fires.

Collaboration and engagement 
with stakeholders

By conducting events related to safety and disaster 
prevention in cooperation with partner companies, we 
aim to further raise disaster prevention awareness and 
become a safer, more secure company.
 In addition, by conducting information exchange 
meetings on a regular basis with everyone in the 
regions that surround our plants, we are deepening 
communication with local communities.

Social issues we are aware of
As we have several large-scale chemical plants, their 
process safety and disaster prevention needs are 
increasingly heightened in the context of the recent 
increase in the number and severity of accidents at 
chemical plants and natural disasters.
 As such, we will undertake to enhance our safety 
capabilities, and strengthen our disaster prevention 
measures on a daily basis.

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
We regard outages of stable operations from major 
accidents impacting regions in the vicinities of plants, 
natural disasters or other factors, and the 
accompanying loss of societal trust in the company 
from these things as risks.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
Implementation of thorough safety processes and 
disaster prevention initiatives ensure the safety of 
communities and employees which leads to trust in 
the company and enhancement of its brand image.

Framework

Our daily activities for process safety and disaster 
prevention are conducted as part of the RC promotion 
system. In particular, we have built a framework to 
keep track of accidents or disasters when they occur, 
through our global emergency reporting network. The 
organizational framework used in an emergency 
situation is separate from the Board of Directors, etc.; 
an emergency organization is established, headed by 
the President, and takes action under the direct 
supervision of the President. In addition, when an 
accident or disaster occurs that we anticipate will 
have a major impact on our business activities, we 
will establish an Emergency Response Team 
Organization headed by the President. Together as a 
group, our initial response places top priority on the 
safeguarding of human life as we implement 
measures including our Business Continuity Plan*.
*  Business Continuity Plan 

A plan for continuing key corporate activities through procedures to 
decide in advance which operations and functions should be 
continued, and which methods should be applied to continue 
activities, assuming various situations that cause the interruption and 
/ or shutdown of business activities due to various events and the 
factors behind their occurrence.

Process safety and disaster prevention 403-9 (Occupational health and safety 2018)

Performance
In 2021, to maintain safe, stable operations and 
work toward eradicating process safety accidents, 
we conducted safety assessments at our chemical 
facilities, including policies to prevent dust 
explosions, abnormal reactions and spontaneous 
combustion, and implemented policies to respond 
to natural disasters. In addition, detailed 
implementation specs and plans were drafted for 
respective divisions with the targets of enriching 
disaster prevention drills and enhancing security. 
Also during 2021, the disaster prevention audits 
we normally carry out each year at our plants 
outside Japan, to enhance their level of safety and 
disaster prevention, were postponed to prevent the 
spread of COVID-19.
 Moreover, last year we formulated the Kao 
Grand Design for Process Safety to be achieved by 
2030, and shared the design’s 13 action plans, 
which aim to reinforce our safety culture and 
fundamentals and enhance safety, with related 

Performance in 2021

divisions and plants, and we are promoting 
activities by incorporating the action plans into 
each workplace. Small-scale fires and explosions 
occurred in 2021, but there were no accidents 
involving leakages or logistics-related leakages*1. 
For each safety accident, we conduct an accident 
cause analysis using the 4M5E method*2 and 
implement measures to prevent similar accidents 
in the future. In 2022, we will continue activities 

directed toward our targets of completely 
eliminating on-site fires and accidents related to 
explosion, leakage and logistics-related leakage 
accidents.
*1  Logistics-related leakages 

Accidents involving leakage while products, etc. are being 
transported

*2  4M5E method 
A method for conducting causal analysis from the standpoint of 
four M-factors: Man (people), Machine (machine and facility), 
Media (material and information) and Management  
(management and education), followed by response policies 
from the standpoint of five E-factors: Education (education and 
training), Engineering (technology and engineering), Enforce-
ment (strengthening and strict adherence), Example (model 
and example) and Environment (environment, background)

Reviews of performance
Going forward, we will continue further improving 
our frontline safety capabilities and striving to 
enhance our safety culture and safety 
fundamentals, while fine-tuning and revising the 
Grand Design for Process Safety established last 
year.

Emergency response drills to 
prepare for large-scale disasters
Besides implementing fire response training and 
emergency evacuation training at the level of 
individual worksites, we also conduct training on a 
company-wide basis to prepare for large-scale 
disasters.

Training in the use of the system for reporting 
the safety of Kao employees
To prepare for natural disasters, the Kao Group in 
Japan has adopted a web-based Employee Safety 
Confirmation System. Twice yearly, in March and 
September, all employees undertake personal input 
drills. During the September 2021 drill, we used the 
message field to enter detailed damage-related 
information. We will continue to hold drills on the 
premise on actual disasters as they occurred.
 Below is an overview of uses of the Employee 
Safety Confirmation System in natural disasters in 
2021. Confirmation of employee safety through 
deployment of the Employee Safety Confirmation 
System during these natural disasters resulted in no 
critical human casualties.
 In addition, we are using the Employee Safety 
Confirmation System on a weekly basis to confirm the 
health of our employees during the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Our initiatives

Countermeasures Headquarters carried out the June 
drill from home, using online conferencing tools.
 The content of drills is being reviewed on an ongoing 
basis in light of the lessons learned from past training drills.

Emergency evacuation drills based on the scenario that 
a plant tour is taking place when the disaster occurs
The nine Kao plants in Japan that provide plant tours 
have prepared protective hoods for use by plant 
visitors in the event that an earthquake occurs while a 
plant tour is underway. These plants also implement 
emergency evacuation drills, with employees taking 
on the role of plant visitors, to ensure that in the event 
of emergency visitors can be taken swiftly to a safe 
place. In the future, we will continue to incorporate 
drills based on a variety of different scenarios during a 
plant tour into our annual training plan.

Company-wide earthquake scenario reporting 
and communication training
We are consolidating organizational units for disaster 
response in Eastern Japan and Western Japan 
premised on damage to the Kao Head Office from an 
earthquake in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area. In 
June 2021, we implemented disaster response drills 
premised on an earthquake in the Nankai Trough area, 
involving local organizational units and those in 
Eastern Japan, while in September we repeated these 
drills for organizational units in the Kanto area and 
Western Japan, premised on an earthquake with its 
epicenter directly under the Tokyo Metropolitan area.
 During these drills, based on locations during the 
daytime on weekdays, statuses were confirmed by IP 
radio within major disaster response organizational 
units, and promptly transmitted to Emergency 
Countermeasure Headquarters through our internal 
disaster bulletin board and website and information 
management portal system. Necessary response drills 
were implemented by the organizational units 
responsible for disaster response based on the relevant 
data. Moreover, during the November drill, which was 
premised on an earthquake in the Greater Tokyo 
Metropolitan area, the President participated as head 
of the Emergency Countermeasure Headquarters. Due 
to COVID-19, the members of Emergency

Strengthening process safety 
and disaster prevention

The SCM Division is actively introducing DX 
technologies including AI and IoT, and continues to 
strengthen risk management at chemical facilities 
through hidden hazard, earthquake and natural 
disaster response readiness.
 In 2021, we established a thermal risk assessment 
method to evaluate the prevention of fire and 
explosion accidents originating in abnormal reactions 
in our chemical facilities, and implemented safety 
measures in accordance with the assessment 
guidelines. We also established fire prevention 
methods to prevent spontaneous combustion of tank 
residues, implemented other safety measures to 
prevent spontaneous combustion, and are continuing 
to promote awareness of these measures.
 We also strive to minimize damage due to natural 
disasters. In addition to promoting ongoing diagnosis 
and strengthening equipment racks in our facilities as 
earthquake countermeasures, we continuously consider 
measures that may be necessary to prevent structural 
losses at the Wakayama and Toyohashi plants due to 
ground liquefaction caused by earthquakes.
 Our activities to minimize damage include 
incorporating flood risk countermeasures into our 
basic policy, and in recent years we have been 
considering wind risk countermeasures to prevent 
damage to non-structural members such as roofs and 
external walls.

The Wakayama Plant has been designated an Accredited 
Safety Inspection Executor* pursuant to the High Pressure 
Gas Safety Act. In 2021, a safety audit was implemented by 
the Safety Management in September and a safety 
inspection under the direction of the President, who also 
serves as head of safety management, was implemented in 
November. We were able to confirm that there were no 
issues with regard to process safety activities.
 The high-pressure gas equipment at other Kao worksites 
also has safety inspection performed by prefectural and 
external inspection bodies. Safety audit and safety verification 
for these facilities are also carried out in-house, and a serious 
effort is being made to ensure safe equipment operation.
*  Accredited Safety Inspection Executor 

It is a company or organization authorized by the Minister of Economy, 
Trade and Industry to perform self-inspection, either while equipment 
is in operation or while it is out of operation, to verify whether the 
safety of specified items of equipment conforms to the relevant 
technical standards pursuant to the High Pressure Gas Safety Act.

Process safety and disaster 
prevention educational programs
We create various educational programs for process 
safety and disaster prevention. For example, the 
Monozukuri Training Center of the SCM Division is 
endeavoring to pass on the necessary knowledge and 
skills to younger technicians, who will be responsible 
for production sites, by exposing them to simulated 
technical glitches and hazardous situations.
 Promising leaders of the next generation within 
and outside Japan receive eight months of training to 
learn about production technology and the spirit of 
Yoki-Monozukuri at Kao’s Global Techno School in the 
Wakayama Plant. This training includes process safety 
and disaster prevention. In 2021, due to the spread of 
COVID-19, our Global Techno School activities were 
conducted entirely remotely.
 Every year on Disaster Prevention and Volunteers 
Day, a disaster prevention message is posted to all 
employees in Japan to enhance their disaster 

awareness. In addition, days when accidents occurred 
are designated as Safety Days, to help ensure that the 
efficacy of past drills is not weakened by the passage of 
time. Moreover, the Kao Group Disaster Prevention 
Manual is distributed annually to all employees in Japan.
 In 2021, as in the previous year, in response to the 
increased number of employees working from home 
due to the effects of COVID-19, we enhanced our 
e-learning programs, which can also be undertaken at 
home, and offered them to all employees of our 
affiliates in Japan.
 Following the previous year’s basic and hazard 
map programs, disaster prevention education in 2021 
covered dispersed evacuation and the difficulty of 
evacuation, and encouraged participants to consider 
their own evacuation plan. The training was held in 
June, before the seasons of typhoons and torrential 
rains. The program also trained participants to 
understand the new warning levels revised this year.
 Process safety education in 2021 covered 
dangerous substances as defined by the Fire Service 
Act, which is a necessary area of knowledge for 
employees of companies that handle chemical 
products and a fundamental element of regulation for 
companies. We continued the practical education 
begun in 2020, and trained participants in handling 
actual dangerous substances as defined by the Act.
 Going forward, we will use e-learning actively to 
carry out process safety and disaster prevention 
education.Kao Group Disaster Prevention Manual

Social issues we are aware of
Cleanliness, hygiene and health are the foundation of 
people’s lives, but there are many people who are not 
able to benefit from services made possible by 
modern progress due to inequity stemming from 
economic disparity as well as disparities based on 
gender and other attributes. Furthermore, the threat 
of COVID-19 is taking a drastic toll on the 3 billion 
people* who are in vulnerable situations without 
access to soap or clean water.
 While the issues faced by developed, emerging 
and developing countries are different, what people 
desire more than ever is to be able to lead fulfilling 
and beautiful lives inside and out each day in societies 
where their physical and mental needs are met. 
However, the World Happiness Report indicates the 
reality that negative emotions such as worry and 
sadness are on the rise as a global trend.
 In addition, problems impacting the environment 
that supports our lives, including climate change and 
waste, have become pressing issues that require 
action by the international society as a whole.
 All consumers need to recognize these issues and 
change their daily behaviors.

We conduct our corporate citizenship activities with the goal of achieving the Kirei Lifestyle and a Kirei life for all̶providing care and enrichment for the life 
of all people and the planet.
To address the social issues that Kao is focusing on, we are working in tandem with local communities and NGOs / NPOs with a long-term perspective. We 
also set up employee participation activities aimed at creating connections to society and places where employees can learn, along with support for arts and 
cultural activities in order to further the development of the culture, which is at the foundation of Yoki-Monozukuri. We also implement various activities 
through The Kao Foundation for Arts and Sciences.

Kao’s creating value to address 
social issues

 Along with making contributions through 
business activities to help resolve these social issues, 
it is becoming increasingly important for companies 
to take action with a big picture perspective, through 
technological support leveraging their strengths, 
educational and awareness-raising activities, 
charitable donations and collaborations.

Special focus on inequalities”

Risks related to realization of What Kao Aims to 
Be by 2030
Failure to give proper consideration to stakeholders 
and a lack of engagement may cause customers, 
employees and all other stakeholders to lose trust in 
us and could also potentially damage our brand value 
in the future.

Opportunities related to realization of What Kao 
Aims to Be by 2030
As a manufacturer of consumables, we have always 
stayed close to the lives of consumers in our business 
activities. In recent years, these are not only to 
improve convenience and satisfaction for individual 
consumers, but also to be part of people’s everyday 
lives fulfilling the desire to make the right choices for 
a better society and enable the people around them 

and the society they belong to do the same.
 We believe that the technologies, knowledge and 
networks we have cultivated can contribute to the 
solutions to social issues intimately connected to 
everyday life, such as that of waste, by improving 
sanitation, water, health and the quality of life, and 
that we can conduct activities that respond to 
consumers’ expectations.
 Through these activities, we aim to play an 
essential part in people around the world leading a 
happy, fulfilling, healthy, more comfortable and 
sustainable lives (the Kirei Lifestyle).

Kao’s creating value
In addition to contributing to the sustainability of 
society through our business activities, we also 
contribute to society in broader ways through 
corporate citizenship activities and awareness-raising 
activities, aiming to achieve a society where everyone 
can lead happy, fulfilling, healthy and more 
comfortable lives including the many people in the 
most vulnerable situations whose issues cannot 
directly be addressed through our business activities 
and products.
 In the business fields of beauty, health, 
cleanliness, the environment and life where we have 
leveraged our own resources and strengths, we will

We integrate our business activities and corporate 
citizenship activities with the aim of our purpose of 
realization of a Kirei world in which all life lives in 
harmony, and promote the Kirei Lifestyle of all around 
the world. In our corporate citizenship activities, we 
aim to solve issues that are connected to our business 
fields of beauty, health, cleanliness, the environment 
and life as well as the diverse communities and 
through these activities, we aim to challenge our 
employees and realize their high aspirations.

Corporate citizenship activities 102-43, 404-2

We believe it is important for our employees to give 
consideration to how people around the world live 
their lives and to make contributions to achieving the 
Kirei Lifestyle through our business activities and 
corporate citizenship activities.
 To realize this, it will be necessary to have our 
employees expand their outlook and build their 
creativity and ability to collaborate with others 
through actions such as learning about many diverse 
societies and consumers, networking with people 
trying to solve social issues, and participating in 
corporate citizenship activities, as well as to leverage 
all of this in our manufacturing and corporate 
citizenship activities.
 We regularly share information about social trends 
and other developments via our intranet system and 
proactively provide networking opportunities with 
NGOs and social entrepreneurs as well as 
opportunities to volunteer.
 In 2021, we offered and conducted programs and 
volunteer activities that 5,517 of our employees 
worldwide could participate in, which encouraged the 
participation of many employees.

Education and promotion

We conduct activities with the belief that dialogue 
and collaboration with stakeholders in our corporate 
citizenship activities can encourage people to 
understand on a deeper level what is needed and 
expected by an increasingly complex society and have 
a greater transformational impact than what could be 
done by one company in order to empower people 
around the world to live the Kirei Lifestyle.
 We are collaborating with UN organizations such 
as the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and 
the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), NGOs 
and social entrepreneurs with expertise and deep 
understanding of regional conditions in the areas of 
cleanliness, hygiene and health, and with government 
agencies, local governments, schools and NGOs in 
environmental fields so that we can effectively involve

Mid- to long-term targets
Focusing principally on our business domains of beauty, 
health, cleanliness, the environment and life-related fields, 
we help people around the world to enjoy happy, fulfilling 
and comfortable lives, including people whose issues 
cannot be addressed directly through our business activities 
and products and people who are in vulnerable positions.
 Furthermore, by having employees participate in our 
corporate citizenship activities, create connections with 
society and broaden their perspective, we also aim to bring 
additional benefits to our business and to society at large.

Environmental issues
We engage in environmental communication to 
promote sustainable lifestyles, aiming to create a 
social movement that prompts consumers to make 
changes to their lifestyle.
1.  The Kao International Environment Painting Contest 

for Children 
We plan to hold the 12th Kao International Environment 
Painting Contest for Children. Through activities to 
exhibit past prizewinning works, we create opportunities 
for people to think about the environment.

2.  The Future of Washing Initiative 
We will create venues for government, industry, 
academia and citizens to discuss and make 
proposals about the future of washing.

Pandemics, population aging, and impacts of diversity
We will use our collective capabilities to raise awareness 
among consumers and support and collaborate with them, 

Mid- to long-term targets and 
performance

aiming to create a world in which everyone can age without 
fear and live their life in better health, greater cleanliness and 
confidence in self-expression, while leaving no one behind.
1.  Water and Sanitation Project for Schools in Vietnam 

In the three years from 2021 to 2023, we are 
promoting and increasing access to water and 
sanitation services, with a principal focus on schools in 
regions where support is needed. 
In 3 years, we will reach 26,580 students and teachers.

2.  Improvements in infection control and hygiene at 
hospitals in Vietnam 
We are conducting measures designed to improve 
infection control and hygiene at Hanoi Medical 
University Hospital. The activities are being extended 
to other hospitals over five years starting in 2018.

3.  Hand-washing awareness in elementary schools in Hanoi 
We raise awareness of the importance of hand-
washing in elementary schools in Hanoi, and firmly 
root cleanliness and hygiene habits in children.

4.  Scholarship for Hygiene Management 
We provide a scholarship to one exchange student 
from Vietnam at a time to study food hygiene 
management in a master’s degree program in 
Japan. We are providing assistance to three people 
over six years from 2018.

5.  The Menstrual Hygiene Improvement Project in Uganda 
We will expand our support for a social 
entrepreneur striving to manufacture and sell 
low-cost sanitary napkins, related product launches 
and the widespread use of sanitary products.

6.  Breast cancer prevention awareness through the 
Pink Ribbon Campaign

•  Support for a cancer education project for junior and 
senior high school students

•  Make donations through an in-house program to the 
cancer education project

Harnessing the power and potential of employees
We promote employee participation in corporate 
citizenship activities, are maximizing the growth, power 
and potential of our employees, and harness these to 
create Yoki-Monozukuri and business opportunities and 
make additional contributions to society.

Anticipated benefits from achieving mid- to long-
term targets
Business impacts
As responsible consumption behavior becomes more 
widespread, we can gain customers’ trust by steadily 
carrying out activities aligned with our goals and 
continuing to communicate these externally, which we 
anticipate will help us attract loyal, long-term customers.

Social impacts
By spreading and instilling proper cleanliness, hygiene and 
health habits, we expect to improve hygiene and health in 
the communities we are supporting and contribute to 
improving living standards over the medium to long term.
 We believe that communicating to and raising the 
awareness of consumers about the environment will 
increase the numbers of consumers who change their 
behaviors and have a knock-on effect in their surroundings, 
and create a driving force to attain a sustainable society.
 In addition, encouraging employee participation in 
social activities is expected to stimulate their creativity 
and drive more innovative and valuable Yoki-

Reviews of performance
Due to the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 in 
2021, in-person activities and events were 
limited, but this provided a good opportunity to 
expand the options and possibilities for support 
activities, such as exploring ways to more 
effectively conduct awareness-raising activities, 
even when using online means. In FY2022, we 
plan to establish policies and goals to advance 
our business activities and globally integrated 
activities.

The Kao International Environment 
Painting Contest for Children

Environmental issues

Sustainable lifestyle promotion

We have been holding the Kao International 
Environment Painting Contest for Children annually 
since 2010 in the hope that the paintings and thoughts 
expressed by children around the world, from their 
sincere consideration of environmental efforts around 
them, the earth and its future, will inspire people 
across the globe to lead and take action to changing 
sustainable lifestyles for a better world.

The 12th Kao International Environment Painting 
Contest for Children
In 2021, the contest was again conducted during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. We received 7,009 entries from 
children around the world (689 entries from Japan, 6,090 
entries from the Asia Pacific, 29 entries from the 
Americas, 87 entries from Europe, 70 entries from the 
Middle East and 44 entries from Africa). After a 
preliminary screening by Kao designers, a final screening 
was conducted in December by internal and external 
juries, and 1 entry was selected for the “eco together” 
Planet Earth Grand Prix, 8 for the “eco together” Kao 
Prize, 6 for the Jury’s Special Prize, and 17 for the Eco 
Friend Prize. The invitation of top prizewinners to Japan 
and the awards ceremony at the venue were canceled 
due to the pandemic, and an online awards ceremony 
was held instead on March 27, 2022.

 In June, we held an exhibit with the theme of 
“Wishes for the Future of the Children around the 
World” using panels displaying enlarged paintings 
and message boards at the Gyoko-dori Underground 
Gallery directly connected to Tokyo Station. This was 
an opportunity to communicate impactful 
environmental messages in a location passed by large 
numbers of people instead of within environment-
related facilities only for visitors.

New initiative for raising environmental 
awareness using paintings
Aiming to give more people the opportunity to enjoy 
the prizewinning works and communicate their 
messages even during the pandemic when people are 
going out less, we launched an online museum on 
our corporate website where past prizewinning works 
and their messages can be accessed virtually (only 
the Japanese website this year).

Painting exhibitions in collaboration with NPOs 
and local governments 
We seek out opportunities to exhibit past prizewinning 
paintings to communicate to as many people as 
possible the messages from children around the 
world.
 We are in the fifth year of lending paintings free of 
charge to environment-related facilities operated by 
local governments, NPOs and educational facilities, 
with the NPO BeGood Cafe serving as the secretariat 
of the exhibitions. In 2021, a total of 19 facilities and 
groups had exhibitions which were viewed by 28,993 
people. Compared with 2020 when many exhibitions 
were cancelled due to the facilities being closed, the 
number of visitors to the facilities showed a recovering.
 Kao Group Customer Marketing Co., Ltd. also 
began a new type of activity to lend out and exhibit 
paintings. This year, in addition to internal exhibits in 
six locations, there were 24 exhibit events at  
environment-related facilities of local governments and 
stores throughout Japan, which received more than 
13,000 visitors. Paintings and their messages were 
also shown at six environmental events held online by 
local governments, which also featured a link to the 
online museum of the Kao International Environment 
Painting Contest for Children (Environment Day 
Hiroshima, Toyama Environment Fair 2021, Eco Messe 
in Chiba, Yamagata Hybrid Environment Fair, Nagoya 
Environment Day at Home 2021, Fukuoka 
Environment Festival 2021.) Our website to exhibit 
paintings has received approximately 13,000 views.

The Future of Washing Initiative

Sustainable lifestyle promotion

Kao, Future Earth and The University of Tokyo 
Institutes for Advanced Study Integrated Research 
System for Sustainability Science (currently the 
Institute for Future Initiatives) launched the Future of 
Washing Initiative in 2018, aiming to encourage 

people around the world to lead sustainable, clean 
and comfortable lives. The initiative is gathering 
wisdom from industry, academia and citizens across 
the boundaries of traditional business domains and 
academic fields, and discussing and proposing 
washing solutions for the future.
 In May 2021, we held the seminar, Sustainable 
Laundry (4): Perspectives on detergents, and in June, 
we held the seminar, Sustainable Laundry (5): 
Perspectives on detergent containers, both online. In 
both seminars, there were lectures on three topics by 
academia, companies and NGOs as well as panel 
discussions. More than 160 participants from 
companies, universities and research institutes, and 
environmental groups attended each seminar. 
Panelists from Generation Z also joined the panel 
discussions, which included multifaceted discussions 
of laundry and detergent containers that were well 
received by seminar participants.
 In addition, the Future of Washing Initiative 
website features a blog started in 2020. In 2021, a 
total of 14 reports based on selected information 
related to laundry from Anthropocene Magazine, 
published by Future Earth, were posted on the blog.

Corporate citizenship activities 203-1, 304-3, 413-1

Kao (China) has conducted the Nationwide Cleanliness 
and Water-saving Initiatives campaign jointly with the 
Center for Environmental Education and 
Communications (CEEC), part of the State Environmental 
Protection Administration of China, since 2012. These 
initiatives have been expanded with the commencement 
of the environmental protection contest for university 
students as part of our activities in 2015 and with other 
activities to draw the attention of university students and 
the general public in China to water conservation.
 In 2021, the tenth year of the campaign, initiatives 
kicked off on July 24 with the theme of “Making China 
cleaner and more beautiful,” and an opening ceremony 
was held in Kunming, Yunnan Province. University 
students throughout China were asked to submit activity 
proposals across a wide range of themes, including on 
conserving water and protecting water sources, 
biodiversity, low-carbon emissions, eliminating plastic 
and sustainable development, with 129 proposals 
received from 79 universities in 22 cities and provinces. 
From these, we selected ten projects, which we helped 
implement. University students from around the country 
actively worked to conserve the environment by putting 
into practice activities of their own design and developed 
different activities to improve the environmental 
awareness of people in the community. The tenth year of 
activities concluded in December, and the winning 

China water conservation 
campaign

Sustainable lifestyle promotion

Aiming to improve the situation of rapid deforestation in 
northern Thailand and the water pollution, smoke 
pollution and other environmental problems caused by it, 
we partnered with the Organization for Industrial, 
Spiritual and Cultural Advancement (OISCA) and OISCA 
Thailand to conduct an environmental conservation 
project in the Chiang Khong District of Chiang Rai 
Province in northern Thailand. In the 5 years from 2012, 
the project completed its goal of planting 42,500 trees 
on 35ha of land. Through this activity, community 
residents’ awareness for environmental conservation 
was raised, and momentum was built for appropriate 

FURUSATO Environment Conservation 
Project in Northern Thailand

forest management as well as using the forest to create 
a foundation for daily life. We therefore began 
supporting the second phase of the project in April 2019.

In the afforested area developed in the first phase of 
the project, crops are being cultivated in addition to 
forest management. Planting crops that are edible as 
well as crops that can be sold in the market increases 
the value of the forest and we promote forest 
management with the deep involvement of local 
residents. In the second phase of the afforestation 
project, local residents are continuing to manage the 
forest and saplings are also showing healthy growth.
 When local residents were given a questionnaire 
as part of the project, many commented that a 
foundation for local livelihood, including selling crops 
cultivated in the developed forest, had been created, 
indicating that the forest has enriched their daily lives.

Trees planted in the first phase of the afforestation project have grown bigger.

Kao Creating Forests for 
Everyone program

Decarbonization

With the goal of creating a lush, green environment 
and passing this environment down to the next 
generation, we are partnering with the Organization 
for Landscape and Urban Green Infrastructure and 
implementing a program offering grants for 
developing people who nurture and protect the 
environment. The program is open to NGOs, NPOs 
and citizen groups throughout Japan that are active in 
such areas as forest creation and environmental 
education, with around 20 groups selected each year 
to receive a grant for their activities for 3 consecutive 
years. Through environmental conservation activities, 
we are contributing to solving various issues faced by 
regions today as well as the creation of brighter, 
healthier communities in these regions.
 Local visits were postponed in 2021 to prevent the 
spread of COVID-19, and online tools were used 
instead to hold exchanges with grant recipients while 
hearing about the situation at the project sites and the 
progress of activities. With the conclusion of activities 
at the end of March 2022, we compiled the 
achievements gained through the activities so far and 
broadly communicated them, and will use them to 
make further improvements to the environment in the 
future.

Kao Hygiene Development 
Program in Vietnam

We are implementing the Hygiene Development 
Program in Vietnam with the aim of promoting the 
widespread adoption of cleanliness and hygiene 
practices in Vietnam. This program comprises four 
components: Leader Development for Infection 
Control, the Scholarship for Hygiene Management, 
Enhancing Hygiene in the Community and the Water 
and Sanitation Project for Schools.

Leader Development for Infection Control
We are conducting a program in collaboration with 
Hanoi Medical University in Vietnam to improve 
infection control and hygiene at hospitals. In 2021, we 
examined how to further expand the program 
implemented the previous year to improve the rate of 
hand-washing compliance, but were not able to 
conduct specific activities in hospital wards due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

Scholarship for Hygiene Management
By cultivating food hygiene management experts who 
can play an active role in the health and hygiene field 
in Vietnam, we aim to contribute to healthy living for 
Vietnamese citizens. In cooperation with Kanagawa 
University of Human Services in Japan, we have set 

Pandemics

Improved quality of life

Habits for cleanliness, beauty & health

up the Kao Scholarship for Hygiene Management 
within the university and provide the scholarship to 
foreign exchange students.
 The first foreign exchange student graduated with a 
master’s degree from Kanagawa University of Human 
Services in March 2020, and the second foreign exchange 
student graduated with the same in March 2022.

Enhancing Hygiene in the Community
In collaboration with Hanoi Medical University, we 
started organizing hand-washing awareness activities for 
elementary schools in 2020. We had planned to use the 
insights gained in awareness-raising activities conducted 
at two elementary schools in 2020 to more broadly 
conduct these activities at elementary schools in Hanoi 
in 2021, but as elementary schools were closed due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to conduct 
the activities for elementary school students and only 
made improvements to the educational materials.

Supporting UNICEF’s Water and Sanitation 
Project for Schools
Vietnam has severe economic disparity, and sanitation 
and hygiene conditions in Vietnam’s rural and 
mountainous districts and districts with large ethnic 
minority populations are underdeveloped, with 
chronic diarrhea and other illnesses impeding 
children’s healthy development.
 Since 2016, we have been supporting Water and 
Sanitation Project for Schools through UNICEF.
 Following good results with the program in An Giang 
Province in the Mekong River Delta in the southern part 

of the country, in 2018 we expanded support to Dien 
Bien Province, a mountainous region in the north where 
most people are members of an ethnic minority group.
 In 2021, we held an instructor training on 
conducting school-led hygiene sessions for 48 
teachers, volunteer instructors and public health 
nurses at 7 local governments in 3 districts of Dien 
Bien Province. In addition, we created an activities 
plan for each school based on the results of a small-
scale survey to identify the current level of 
understanding about water and hygiene conducted 
for 600 students in 7 schools in Dien Bien Province.
 We also held school-led hygiene triggering 
sessions at 7 junior high schools (2,396 students, 230 
teachers) in Dien Bien Province. Students and 
teachers learn about the impacts to health and the 
environment caused by open defecation and 
wastewater as well as the proper way to wash hands 
with soap, aiming to improve hygiene habits.
 In addition, a local survey of all preschools under nine 
local governments in the province revealed issues with 
accessibility to clean drinking water. We provided 333 
ceramic filter cores for water purification to 22 preschools 
and elementary schools, enabling reliable access to clean 
water for 7,872 students and 492 teachers. In addition, 18 
events were held at 20 schools in Dien Bien Province in 
conjunction with Global Handwashing Day, where the 
importance of handwashing was directly communicated to 
more than 6,000 people. The events as well as speeches 
by people affiliated with the provincial government were 
also broadcast on a TV program in the province, enabling 
the message to be delivered to even more citizens.

the age of beginning menstruation as well as their 
families and elementary schools for more than 40 
years.
 Our first menstruation education set is a pouch 
that contains an awareness booklet which briefly 
covers menstruation and bodily changes, along with 
sample sanitary products, distributed free of charge. 
In 2017, we began working together with the 
Japanese Association of School Health, aiming to 
expand distribution of our sets to 20,000 schools 
throughout Japan.
 In 2021, we distributed sets to 11,256 schools. 
Additionally, in 2021 we distributed CDs narrating the 
content of the awareness booklet titled “Physical 
changes: What it means to become an adult” to four 
schools at their request.

Menstrual hygiene education for junior high 
school students in Indonesia
Since 2018, we have been supporting UNICEF’s 
Menstrual Hygiene Management Project in Indonesia.
 There is not enough correct knowledge about 
menstruation in Indonesia, where one in four girls 
does not know about menstruation until she actually 
starts having her period. Furthermore, superstitions 
and discrimination regarding menstruation persist. 
Additionally, since schools do not provide enough 
education about menstruation and sanitation facilities 
are inadequate, one in six girls misses at least one day 
of school during menstruation, which is one reason 
for lower school attendance among girls.

 While 2020 had been planned to be the final year 
of the project, as schools have remained closed due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project was extended 
for six months, with all planned activities concluding 
in June 2021. Over the three and a half years, the 
project conducted lessons for approximately 20,000 
students including boys at 40 public junior high 
schools and madrasas (Muslim schools) in Tangerang 
Regency, reaching its target.
 The activities were also broadened to include 
distribution of an educational booklet that was 
completed in 2019 to 65 schools in 3 regencies and 
publishing it on a website used by madrasas.
 An online training was also conducted for 
students in an teenage health peer-group cadre, with 
participation by a total of 1,012 people, including 200 
Cadre members at the 40 schools receiving support 
as well as 812 male and female students interested in 
menstrual hygiene management. After the training, 
students led planning and implementation of a 
menstrual hygiene campaign with assistance from 
supervising teachers, with more than 120 events held 
both online and in person. Around 125 teachers and 
200 students in the health promotion organization 
were involved in the events, which reached 
approximately 20,000 students. In addition, the 
students independently engaged in activities including 
creating a large number of awareness-raising tools, 
primarily videos, for menstrual hygiene management 
and sharing them on YouTube, TikTok and other social 
media.

 In 2022, we will continue supporting efforts by 
schools and communities to improve the hygiene 
environment and establish good hygiene habits, 
including in other regions where hygiene is a serious 
issue.

greater development of Ugandan society as a whole.
 In 2021, EcoSmart exchanged information with 
Kao, received technical advice and worked toward 
market launch by implementing various activities 
including preparing its quality control system and 
conditions on the production line, obtaining facilities 
to improve production efficiency, selecting a 
packaging manufacturer, and preparing to conduct a 
usage survey.
 These processes contribute to developing the 
capability of team members and local affiliate 
company and to employing people in the region.
 Going forward, we plan to continue to contribute 
even more to women’s cleanliness and health in 
Uganda, aiming to launch sanitary napkins for local 
markets once a usage survey is conducted.

 Through these activities, the percentage of 
respondents replying in an end line survey that 
menstruation was a normal biological process 
substantially increased, from 81% to 94%. The project 
also resulted in changes to hygiene habits during 
menstruation, such as more frequent changing of 
sanitary napkins by girl students.

The Menstrual Hygiene Improvement Project in 
Uganda
Since February 2019, we have partnered with UNFPA 
to support the company EcoSmart, which was 
launched by a young social entrepreneur with the 
goal of manufacturing and selling low-priced, 
domestically produced sanitary napkins in Uganda.
 Many women in Africa are unable to purchase 
sanitary napkins due to poverty, and instead use old 
cloth rags and plant leaves. As a result, cases of 
serious infections are also seen. In addition, it is not 
uncommon for girls to stay home from school 
because they are worried about staining their clothing 
from not being able to use sanitary napkins, and end 
up leaving school after falling behind in their classes.
 It is our hope that with our support girls and 
women in Uganda will be able to use sanitary napkins 
on a continuing basis, and will be able to live life 
during menstruation in greater hygiene and comfort. 
We also believe that empowering girls to go to school 
without absences during menstruation and have equal 
opportunity to study as boys will contribute to the

Support for cancer education 
through the Pink Ribbon 
Campaign

Impacts of diversity

implemented a campaign to support women’s health 
by disseminating information through the product and 
brand website and making donations through a click-
to-donate platform. In addition to the cancer 
education project, these donations also went to 
support activities to raise awareness about cervical 
cancer. 
 We conducted an online Pink Ribbon Seminar for 
employees and their families. Breast cancer is not just 
a problem for people at risk of contracting it̶all 
people are potentially touched by it in terms of 
supporting those who are fighting breast cancer, and 
we aimed to make the seminar an opportunity for 
everyone to consider breast cancer as an issue 
relevant to their own lives. We also proactively 
undertook awareness-raising activities, conducting a 
donation program based on employee involvement 
and producing visuals for the Pink Ribbon Campaign 
in collaboration with special subsidiary Kao Peony Co., 
Ltd.
 We are actively conducting other activities, such 
as awareness-raising activities in some stores carrying 
cosmetics within and outside Japan and via online 
media as well as collaborating on projects with 
companies in other industries, to deliver the message 
to as many people as possible.

Since 2007, we have implemented the Kao Pink 
Ribbon Campaign every year during the two months 
of October and November. During this time, we have 
been conducting a variety of activities within and 
outside Japan to raise awareness for early screening 
and detection of breast cancer, with the slogan of 
“For you and your loved ones.”
 One of our main activities in Japan is providing 
support for the Project of Cancer Education by Pink 
Ribbon Advisors organized by the Japan Society of 
Breast Health, an NPO. This project provides cancer 
education in junior and senior high schools, and in a 
world where one in two Japanese people will get 
cancer in their lifetime, is anticipated to raise 
students’ health awareness as well as create 
beneficial effects in their caregivers’ generation.

Activities conducted in 2021 include donating a 
portion of the revenue from eligible product sales of 
the cosmetics brand Kanebo to the cancer education 
project. Through this ongoing initiative since 2013, we 
set a product for the campaign each year and support 
public education activities about breast cancer. In 
addition, our Laurier sanitary products brand

Through the parasport boccia, we work together with 
our employees to solve the social issues of 
diversification and realizing a harmonious global 
society where everyone can live with peace of mind.
 Continuing in FY2021 during the COVID-19 
pandemic, we provided support by delivering hygiene 
products so that athlete conditioning and tournament 
activities could be conducted safely and reliably 
(mainly delivered hygiene products such as 
disinfectant for the 2021 Boccia Tokyo Cup, Tokyo 
2020 Paralympic Games, 2022 Boccia Tokyo Cup 
qualifier and the 2021 Japan Open Championship).
 Viewing the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games as an 
excellent opportunity to establish understanding for 
social inclusion and to expand and build up the sport 
of boccia, we first periodically communicated 
information in a timely manner to employees to raise 
awareness, including about the significance of our 
boccia sponsorship and what the athletes hoped to 
communicate through boccia (five instances of 
internal communications). 
 To increase the velocity of this awareness-raising 
activity after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we 
considered collaborative activities with multiple internal 
divisions and plan to conduct them starting in FY2022. 
In December, we held an in-person informational 

session with staff from the Japan Boccia Association 
for employees serving as ambassadors for this activity, 
while taking measures to prevent the spread of 
COVID-19. The session was an opportunity for 
participating employees to broaden their awareness 
both within and outside the company, with employees 
commenting about how they wanted to introduce 
boccia in schools and how this would lead to higher 
awareness for diversity among the youth generation.
 Through boccia, we will work together with our 
employees to establish understanding for social 
inclusion.

Support for the Japan Boccia 
Association

The Boccia Tokyo Cup, in 
which anyone is able to 
participate, was held while 
taking infection control 
measures.

Barrier-free access to 
information

Universal product design

As a company that offers products necessary in daily 
life, we promote barrier-free environments that allow 
all people living in society to lead fulfilling and 
comfortable everyday lives without discrimination, 
and we conduct activities designed to build this 
understanding.
 As information technology advances, people with 
visual impairments and the elderly are at higher risk of 
being left behind, and we are working to make 
information barrier-free for these groups by providing 
Braille stickers for products free of charge and making 
voice recordings of information about daily life.
 We have also donated videos that discuss barrier-
free topics to schools and other institutions to be 
used as materials for integrated studies to share and 
build understanding for the challenges posed by living 
with various disabilities. We are partnering with the 
Japan National Council of Social Welfare in making 
donations to social welfare facilities, and donating our 
products, especially hygiene-related products 
necessary for the pandemic, to selected groups, 
social welfare facilities and privately operated facilities 
that house people in order to serve their populations.
 As part of our support activities for first 
menstruation education, in 2021 we provided four At the in-house informational session, 

employees experienced the principles 
of boccia competition.

Kao Social Entrepreneurship 
Schools

•  Mina Matsumaru (Director of the nonprofit 
organization Nicori) 
“Days filled with laughter and play for all children”

 This fiscal year, we reviewed the activities 
conducted over the last ten years since the start of the 
initiative and released the Kao Social Entrepreneurship 
Schools Impact Report, which summarizes the 
impacts the Kao Social Entrepreneurship Schools has 
had within Kao and on the wider society, in 
September as well as posted it on our website.
 According to this report, a very high rate of 97% 
of social entrepreneurs who have gone through the 
program are continuing their work, and they have 
increased their budgets and staff by an average of 
300%. In addition, not only have they expanded the 
work of their own organizations, they have also 
impacted policies and programs run by the national 
and local governments and transferred their know-
how to others. They are making these and other 
contributions to effecting social change while 
cooperating and collaborating with stakeholders.
 We have held a series of exchanges between social 
entrepreneurs and our employees since 2012, providing 
opportunities for our employees to gain understanding 
of the social issues and study the entrepreneurial spirit. 
Through FY2020, a total of 679 employees have 
participated in these events, with an average of 96% of 
participants from FY2012 to FY2020 replying that the 
events were “very good” or “good.” Overall a very high 
level of satisfaction was achieved, and the events are 
leading to changes in employees’ awareness and 
behavior.

With the desire to leave a sustainable, brighter world for 
the next generation, we have been operating Kao Social 
Entrepreneurship Schools since 2010 to support the 
development of young social entrepreneurs attempting to 
create solutions to social issues using business methods.
 With the theme of “creating the new lifestyles of 
the future,” we support social entrepreneurs working 
to create the foundation for better lifestyles in ways 
close to consumers’ lives. Over approximately seven 
months, we provide them with opportunities to 
receive advice from specialists, hold group seminars, 
and provide networking and exchange opportunities 
and support to create a central business core and 
accelerate growth. The Social Entrepreneurship 
School Initiative* operates the school.
 In FY2021, we selected the following 3 groups to 
receive support (35 groups supported so far including 
FY2021 support).

On November 25, Takae Moriyama, Representative 
Director of 3 keys and an FY2012 graduate of the 
program, and Fumiya Ito, Representative Director of 
Tsukuba Agri Challenge and an FY2014 graduate of the 
program, were invited as guests who gave 
presentations on their activities. An online interactive 
exchange with employees was held in which current 
program participants shared updates about their 
activities, with 113 employees participating. Participants 
engaged in a lively question and answer session on the 
day of the event, which was a source of inspiration for 
participating employees and led to new realizations.

Former and current program participants took part in the exchange 
with employees and introduced their activities.

Kao Heart Pocket Club

support volunteer activities in which employees take 
part, and provided as emergency relief assistance 
when disasters occur that affect a wide area. 
Decisions about where to send donations and how to 
use the funds are made by a 15-member steering 
committee comprised of member representatives. 
Along with providing aid to support activities aimed at 
solving social issues to create a better society, the Kao 
Heart Pocket Club provides employees with 
opportunities to participate in society and contributes 
to raising their receptivity to society.
 In 2021, we set up an opportunity for beneficiary 
organizations working on social issues that are 
underreported in the media and steering committee 
members to exchange opinions, and this was featured 
in the Heart Pocket Club Newspaper (intranet version), 
an internal PR magazine (published five times a year).
 The Heart Pocket Club also provided community 
grants to a total of 13 groups in Tochigi, Wakayama 
and Ibaraki prefectures to support citizen activities in 
communities where Kao worksites are located. We 
set up online exchanges with groups receiving the 
community grants.
 In addition, we conducted activities for the Mirai 
Pocket Fund, which provides larger grants to back 
activities on a larger scale. To choose where funding 
goes, the steering committee screened applications and 
conducted an online screening where groups gave 
presentations, with five groups then selected for funding.
 In addition to volunteer activities that are 
conducted each year, specifically the White Ribbon 
Run, a campaign to deliver picture books and a 
Christmas card project, while taking steps to mitigate 

infection risk a total of 356 employees also 
participated in the Heartful Project this year, whose 
recipients are medical professionals who are going 
above and beyond the call of duty day after day 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 We will continue to create opportunities to 
increase membership in the Kao Heart Pocket Club 
and for employees to participate in society.

Harmony with communities

Support for arts and cultural 
activities
We support arts and cultural activities for the purpose 
of developing and passing down outstanding arts and 
culture and contributing to the enrichment of people’s 
lives.
 We actively provide support, including support for 
symphony orchestras and sponsorship of music concerts 
and performing arts performances as well as art exhibits, 
so that people of all ages can have access to and 
interaction with the arts, and so that arts and cultural 
activities will be passed down to the next generation.
 In 2021, we continued to provide support for arts 
and cultural activities impacted by the COVID-19 
pandemic. Although an art exhibit we had planned to 
sponsor was postponed, in the music field, we 
provided support to the NHK Symphony Orchestra, 
Tokyo, the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, the Tokyo 
Philharmonic Orchestra and the Japan Philharmonic 
Orchestra, and were a member of the Special 
Corporate Sponsors Group for performances of 
Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony by the NHK Symphony 
Orchestra, Tokyo, and the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 
seasons of the New National Theatre, Tokyo.

Support for young artist 
development

We support development of the next generation of 
artists as part of our contributions to enriching 

people’s lives.
 
Hosting the Tokyo Music Competition
We have organized the Tokyo Music Competition 
(cosponsors: Tokyo Bunka Kaikan, the Yomiuri 
Shimbun, Tokyo Metropolitan Government) since 
2003 to support activities to discover and nurture the 
next generation of Japanese musicians. Support 
focused on professional development is a feature of 
the competition. Winners in each of the sections 
perform together with orchestras in special concerts, 
and Tokyo Bunka Kaikan gives five years of support to 
prizewinners to hold solo recitals and other music 
performances.
 The competition was held as scheduled in FY2021 
during the COVID-19 pandemic while taking 
measures to prevent infections. In April, we received 
entries in the three sections of string instruments, 
woodwind instruments and vocals. A total of 423 
entries were received in the three sections, with 8 
winners selected in the competition held in August.

among the finalists at music competitions within and 
outside Japan.

Special sponsorship for a year-long special 
development project of K-Ballet Youth
Since 2013, we have been a special sponsor of 
performances by K-Ballet Youth, a junior ballet 
company of young dancers whose general manager is 
Tetsuya Kumakawa.
 This endorses K-Ballet Youth to offer a place to 
discover the next generation of dance talent and for 
dancers to practice in an environment equivalent to a 
professional company, designed to develop the next 
generation of artistic performers.
 The fifth anniversary performance of Don Quixote 
scheduled to be performed in 2021 by the K-Ballet 
Youth was postponed until 2022 due to the spread of 
COVID-19. K-Ballet Youth conducted a special one-
year project from August 2020 to May 2021 to 
provide opportunities for young dancers affected like 
this by the pandemic to study their art online. The 
recorded videos of online workshops can be viewed 
on YouTube at any time, which not only helps youth 
improve their technical abilities but also allows 
instructors to teach more efficiently. We are 
supporting efforts that help many children reach for 
new heights, for example by making the technical 
instruction publicly accessible and opening auditions 
for the 2022 program to dancers also from outside 
affiliated K-Ballet Youth studios.

which Midori Goto forms quartets with young 
musicians outside Japan and gives performances in 
developing regions of Asia. These performances could 
not be held in 2020 due to rising COVID-19 cases, but 
an online Listening Program that we helped sponsor 
was held primarily for special education schools in 
Japan to provide as many children as possible with 
opportunities to study music.
 Ms. Goto created a 10-part series of instructional 
videos, which were provided to 72 facilities where 
Music Sharing’s instructional program has been 
conducted in the past as well as to schools and 
hospitals in Japan and Japanese schools in the United 
States, the Netherlands and Cambodia. Special 
education schools that received the videos provided 
feedback that having videos with such robust content 
was a big help during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it 
was difficult to invite outside teachers to the schools.
 We are continuing to sponsor the Listening 
Program through September 2022.

Sponsorship of the instructional program of 
Music Sharing
The certified NPO Music Sharing was founded by 
violinist Midori Goto in 1992, and she serves as its 
president. The program gives people increased access 
to great music and musicians and supports creating 
conditions that enrich the human spirit.
 We have sponsored the music-based International 
Community Engagement Program since 2008, in 

Rebuilding our support for arts and cultural 
activities
We have supported arts and cultural activities for the 
purpose of developing and passing down outstanding 
arts and culture and contributing to the enrichment of 
people’s lives. While continuing a portion of our 
support to uphold the foundation of Japanese arts 
and cultural activities, we will rebuild our activities to 
harness the power of the arts to realize a sustainable 
and enriching society, pursuing innovations that focus 
our support on programs designed to revitalize local 
communities and develop the next generation.

The Kao Foundation for Arts and Sciences is a unique 
foundation combining support for the arts and 
sciences that seeks to promote and further develop 
essential arts and sciences as well as contribute to 
the development of research integrating fields in the 
arts and sciences.
 The foundation was established in 1990 with a 
donation in commemoration of Kao Corporation’s 
100th anniversary. Its main activities center on the 
three projects of awarding grants, giving 
commendations and related projects (support for 
research integrating the arts and sciences).
 The grant project provides grants for art exhibitions 
and music performances among other activities, grants 
for scholarly research on the fine arts and music, and 
in the science and technology field, grant-type 
scholarships for students in master’s programs, and 
grants under the name of the Kao Science 
Encouragement Award, given to young researchers 
conducting unique and pioneering research in the 
fields of chemistry, physics, medicine and biology.
 The commendation project awards the Kao 
Science Award to recognize researchers who have 
achieved distinctive outcomes in basic research in the 
fields of chemistry, physics, medicine and biology.
 In addition to the projects we have conducted so 
far, in FY2021 we launched the new Kao Crescent 
Award, a grant program with a high degree of freedom 
in how the funds are used that gives consideration for 

The Kao Foundation for Arts and Sciences

the work–life balance of women researchers and helps 
them continue conducting research.
 Besides financial support, we will also take steps 
to foster peer connections among women 
researchers and increase their motivation to continue 
conducting research.
 In Japan, the ratio of women researchers to the 
total number of researchers (especially in engineering 
and science fields) is lower than in other countries, 
and many researchers with defined-term employment 

contracts are forced to give up continuing their 
research due to life events. With this new program, 
we aim to increase the number of outstanding 
women role models with defined-term employment 
contracts who are continuing their research, connect 
this to the next generation and contribute to the 
promotion and development of scientific technology 
research in Japan. In addition, the program will 
encourage gender equality and aim to create a better 
society.

Kao Family Concert

With the desire to provide local residents in areas 
where we have worksites with opportunities to hear 
high-quality music and cultivate an appreciation of 
music and the arts, we have held Kao Family Concerts 
since 2002.
 In a program unique to Kao that blends 
community contributions with support for the arts and 
society, these concerts are 100% planned and 
operated by employees.
 We have held a cumulative total of 44 concerts 
since 2002, with a total of 41,327 people attending. 
Additionally, all the revenue from concerts goes to 
music education in the region.
 In 2021, preparations were underway to hold 
concerts at two locations in Sakata, Yamagata 
Prefecture and Mashiko, Tochigi Prefecture. However, 
the performances this year were postponed in light of 
rising COVID-19 cases.
 To upgrade the Kao Family Concerts into a 
program that contributes to regional revitalization and 
development of the next generation, we drew up our 
future vision of the program to encourage community 
involvement and new participation by employees, and 
will implement it from FY2022. Together with 
employees, we aim to create sustainable and 
enriching local communities.

Japan Science & Engineering 
Challenge (JSEC)
We believe that the foundation of Yoki-Monozukuri is 
born from cutting-edge innovations created by science 
and technology, and in order to contribute to a brighter 
future, we support fostering young science researchers.
 As part of this, we are a special sponsor of JSEC, 
which is organized by the Asahi Shimbun Company and 
TV Asahi Corporation and is a contest of independent 
science and engineering research open to high school 
and technology college students nationwide.
 Every year we present the Kao Award and the Kao 
Special Incentive Award to recognize excellent work. 
The review process for selecting the award winners 
starts with our researchers screening participants’ 
papers, and the final screening committee listening to 
high school students’ presentations with a question 
and answer session before judging takes place.
 The final screening committee for JSEC 2021 met 
online on December 11 and 12, 2021. The Kao Award 
was given to Tamagawa Academy High School, and 
the Kao Special Incentive Award went to Shimane 
Prefectural Hamada High School and Miyazaki 
Prefectural Miyazaki Kita High School.
 Top JSEC prizewinners qualify to enter the 
International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), held 
online in 2022. Ryoko Matsui from Tamagawa 
Academy High School, winner of the Kao Award, 
plans to attend ISEF. Also, we will organize a program 

for the award-winning schools to engage in 
discussions with our researchers, thereby providing 
support for senior high school students’ education 
and career planning.

Corporate citizenship activities 413-1

On July 29, 2021, a research and exchange meeting 
was held online with the prizewinners of the Kao 
Award and the Kao Special Incentive Award at JSEC 
2020, with a total of 71 people participating including 
57 of our employees and staff from Asahi Shimbun 
Company. At that event, the research and 
development conducted by Kao was introduced and 
students from the award-winning schools gave 
presentations on their research theme. This 
particularly lively meeting featured a question and 
answer session where Kao judges and participants 
eagerly shared opinions and ideas with one another.
 As a new activity this fiscal year, we have set up 
opportunities to take online tours of the Kao Eco-Lab 
Museum and hold exchanges with young researchers 
to give high school students guidance about future 
careers.

Participating high school students gave feedback 
including, “It was very helpful to get advice about 
how to further develop and advance my research” 
and “I’m truly grateful to get feedback from people 
working at the front lines of research who have 
perspectives that I do not.”

Students from the award-winning schools and Kao judges  
participating in the research and exchange meeting

As a company that manufactures and offers products 
that are essential in everyday life, we support school 
education through museum and plant tours to give 
students the opportunity to learn about manufacturing 
innovation and efforts made to ensure quality, safety 
and security, and considerations for the environment.
 In particular, we have developed programs 
coordinated with social studies units taught in 
Japanese elementary school (third grade: Working 

Support for school education 
through plant and museum 
tours

people and our lives, fifth grade: Our lives and 
industrial production), provide educational materials 
also encompassing pre- and post-tour learning, and 
conduct educational social studies field trip programs 
that include plant tours. The programs are designed 
with the goals of teaching children about the ways in 
which they are connected to society and developing 
their critical thinking skills.

In 2021, tours of our nine factories and two museums 
in Japan were conducted on a limited basis due to the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Of the total 7,889 tour 
participants, 7,535 people took tours conducted 
online. While we were not able to accommodate site 
tours for elementary school social studies field trip 
programs, we held online tours for 1,932 students at 
31 schools. Setting up the remote environments also 
led to trying new things. For example, our Tokyo Plant 
held webinars that mainly featured young employees 
on the production floor, while the Kao Museum held 
webinars on the topic of changes in how laundry is 
done.

Safety campaign through 
logistics

As Kao Logistics Co., Ltd. is engaged in delivering 
products by truck and has to pay close attention to 
traffic safety on a daily basis, the company has been 
conducting awareness-raising activities and events 
related to traffic safety.
 In recent years, Kao Logistics has conducted the 
Children’s Road Safety Class, Nagara Mimamori safety 
campaign activities and traffic safety instruction on an 
ongoing basis for elementary school children in the 
vicinity of seven of its worksites in Japan as part of our 
local contribution activities to save children’s lives.
 It also wrapped delivery trucks in drawings made 
by local children on the theme of traffic safety and is 
conducting other activities to raise traffic safety 
awareness. In 2021, it conducted events at logistics 
centers in Ishikari, Kamagaya (Shonan), Hachioji, 
Kawasaki, Sakaide and Hiroshima in cooperation with 
local elementary schools, boards of education, local 
governments and police departments.
 Halving the number of deaths and injuries from 
road traffic accidents is also one of the SDG targets, 
and these activities help improve the awareness of 
drivers and boost interest in traffic safety among 
people in the region who see these wrapped delivery 
trucks.

Disaster relief

Efforts in response to the Great 
East Japan Earthquake
While mobilizing existing corporate citizenship 
programs and our resources, we are cooperating with 
NGOs, NPOs, other companies and diverse 
organizations to conduct activities that are close to 
consumers’ daily lives and aligned with local needs 
and issues in devastated regions.
 Currently, our activities focus on the two areas of 
providing emotional support and self-directed 
recovery. In terms of emotional support, we have 
been supporting the Smile Tohoku Project since 2012, 
where we visit victims of the disaster living in 
temporary and public housing to interact with them 
and offer support for their new lives. In terms of 
self-directed recovery, we are conducting activities to 
support industrial recovery and community 
development through support for recovery leaders 
and employee volunteer activities focused primarily 
on recovery in the Tohoku region. Activities by Kao 
employees in 2021 are described below.

Recovery support project (at 11 Kao worksites 
around Japan)
As an opportunity for our employees to more broadly 
engage with the Tohoku region with the wish that the 
earthquake and tsunami never be forgotten, we 
offered regional Tohoku dishes made with ingredients 
from the Tohoku region under the theme of 
“Connecting to Tohoku with Food” at 11 Kao 
worksites around Japan from March 8 to 12. To help 
prevent the spread of COVID-19, employees were 

instructed to refrain from talking while eating. We also 
had employees post photos at the same time so that 
employees who were working from home could also 
have an easy way to participate. We received 
comments from employees, including “Eating food 
from Tohoku made me want to visit the region” and “I 
want to continue doing what I can to support Tohoku.”

Smile Tohoku Project
We continued to cooperate with the Smile Tohoku 
Project under the sponsorship of Iwate Nippo, Kahoku 
Shimpo and Fukushima Minpo newspapers.

Conducted events
We had planned to provide support in various forms 
to events scheduled in each prefecture, but the events 
were canceled for the second year due to rising 
COVID-19 cases, and visiting these locations in-
person remained difficult.
 While challenging conditions persist, we 
continued activities to stay loosely connected to 
people and understand how they are feeling in the 

local communities. In cooperation with Tomioka in 
Fukushima Prefecture and local residents, we 
provided support for the Colorful Tomioka Project to 
bring greater activity to the town as well as provided 
other support in collaboration with local project 
members, NPOs and Kao Group employees.

We filmed and made available a special movie to 
bring a tunnel of cherry blossoms and the smiles of 
Tomioka residents to everyone who was not able to 
enjoy cherry blossom season as they would have liked 
to this year. Since the Tour de Tohoku, a cycling race 
along the coastline of Miyagi Prefecture, was 
canceled this year, Kao Group employees all over 
Japan sent thoughtful messages from their location 
on the scheduled day of the race to all the race 
supporters who line the road every year to cheer on 
the riders.

Messages of encouragement collected from supporters are posted on 
a barricade separating the “difficult to return” zone where the tunnel 
of cherry blossoms is located.

Corporate citizenship activities 203-1

We have participated in Michinoku Recovery Partners 
since June 2012 as a main activity of self-directed 
recovery efforts. Four companies* are currently 
participating in this organization established by ETIC 
(a specified nonprofit organization) as a corporate 
consortium to support next-generation recovery 
leaders who will sustain the Tohoku region and 
projects in the disaster-affected region. The 
consortium is engaged in co-creation for self-directed 
recovery, including training to support development of 
groups expected to lead Tohoku in the future.
 In 2021, the tenth anniversary of the earthquake 
and tsunami, we held the ninth symposium on March 
3 online to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
 The symposium broadly communicated 
information on the future of Tohoku with the theme of 
“Reframing questions from Tohoku: Working, living, 
surviving.”
 On June 25, an online seminar was held to 
consider the relationship between innovation and 
social networks that looked at the analysis results of a 
survey on Tohoku leaders’ social network. The 
seminar broadly communicated information to the 
wider society to have the survey results get put to 
use. Around 80 people participated on the day of the 
symposium.

Independent assurance report 102-56

Independent Assurance Report

To the President and CEO of Kao Corporation

We were engaged by Kao Corporation (the “Company”) to undertake a limited assurance engagement of the environmental and 
social performance indicators marked with  (the “Indicators”) for the period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 included 
in its Kao Sustainability Report 2022 (the “Sustainability Report”) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

The Company’s Responsibility
The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Indicators in accordance with its own reporting criteria (the “Company’s 
reporting criteria”), as described in the Sustainability Report.

Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Indicators based on the procedures we have performed. We 
conducted our engagement in accordance with the ‘International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance 
Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ and the ‘ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on 
Greenhouse Gas Statements’ issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The limited assurance 
engagement consisted of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the 
Sustainability Report, and applying analytical and other procedures, and the procedures performed vary in nature from, and are 
less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance provided is thus not as high as that provided by 
a reasonable assurance engagement. Our assurance procedures included:
 Interviewing the Company’s responsible personnel to obtain an understanding of its policy for preparing the Sustainability 

Report and reviewing the Company’s reporting criteria.
 Inquiring about the design of the systems and methods used to collect and process the Indicators.
 Performing analytical procedures on the Indicators.
 Examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the generation, aggregation and reporting of the Indicators in conformity with 

the Company’s reporting criteria, and recalculating the Indicators.
 Making inquiries and reviewing materials including documented evidence of the Company’s Tochigi Plant and PT. Kao 

Indonesia Chemicals selected on the basis of a risk analysis, as alternative procedures to site visits.
 Evaluating the overall presentation of the Indicators.

Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
Indicators in the Sustainability Report are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Company’s reporting criteria 
as described in the Sustainability Report.

Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for 
Accountants, which includes independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 
professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. In accordance with International Standard on 
Quality Control 1, we maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
