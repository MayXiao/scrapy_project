Delivering our 
EverGreen 
strategy
We’re mobilising the organisation 
and deploying EverGreen at scale 
as we pursue our dream to shape 
the future of beer and beyond.”
Dolf van den Brink
Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO

What are your top reflections as CEO of 
HEINEKEN over 2022?
Firstly, I want to thank our people for their commitment, 
care and courage this year. 2022 saw a number of serious 
challenges: the war in Ukraine, energy crisis, supply 
disruption and high inflation – all in the wake of a 
pandemic. Despite these challenges, we’re mobilising the 
organisation and deploying EverGreen at scale as we 
pursue our dream to shape the future of beer and beyond.

The Heineken® brand saw continued strong growth, 
bolstered by the remarkable performance of its line 
extensions. We’re leading the way in premiumisation with 
our portfolio of strong international and local brands. We 
further developed our digital route-to-consumer, reduced 
our carbon emissions and average water usage, 
strengthened our global footprint and invested in our talent 
and capability building. Our cost programme delivered 
significant savings this year, keeping us on track to reach 
our target of €2 billion in savings by the end of 2023. 

There’s nothing more important than the health and 
safety of our people, who have shown immense resilience 
and agility. The HEINEKEN Executive Team and I are 
proud of how our colleagues took care of each other, our 
suppliers and customers and continued to make progress 
on EverGreen this year.

Key highlights of 2022’s business 
performance?
We’re pleased to have delivered a strong set of results in 
2022 despite a continuously challenging and volatile 
environment, growing ahead of the beer category in the 
majority of our markets. Our premium portfolio continued 
to outperform, led by the excellent momentum of 
Heineken®, and the exciting new line extension of our 
iconic brand, Heineken® Silver, which was rolled out into 
25 additional markets. Our innovations in premium, low- 
and no-alcohol and beyond beer categories were well 
received by consumers and are scaling fast, expanding our 
leadership positions in non-alcoholic and in beyond beer.

We’re making good progress with the decarbonisation of 
our breweries, and we have made this part of our incentive 
compensation design. We further accelerated the 
deployment of our business-to-business digital platforms 
and the digitalisation of our route-to-consumer. We made 
significant progress in the delivery of our productivity 
programme, targeting €2 billion savings by 2023, which 
gave us the confidence to declare our new ambition to 
deliver ongoing productivity gains of €400 million year on 
year. We continued to invest in our brands and capabilities. 

The progress on these and many other initiatives make us 
confident that our EverGreen strategy is on course to 
deliver long-term, sustainable value creation.

How is the EverGreen 
transformation progressing? 
EverGreen is our strategy to future-proof HEINEKEN and 
ensure the company thrives for the next 158 years. We’re 
building momentum across each of our five strategic 
pillars: boosting consumer- and customer-centricity by 
focusing on premiumisation and innovation; boosting 
productivity and embedding a continuous cost culture; 
boosting decarbonisation to decarbonise our production 
network globally; boosting digitisation of all our processes 
to become the best-connected brewer; and boosting our 
talent and capabilities to ensure we have highly motivated 
and capable people, the right culture and strong 
organisational health. Overall, we’re leveraging the power 
of our companies and colleagues in over 70 countries to 
deliver on EverGreen.

What is HEINEKEN’s approach to long-
term value creation? How have recent 
acquisitions played a role?
We measure progress on long-term value creation through 
our Green Diamond model. Its four quadrants – growth, 
capital efficiency, sustainability & responsibility, and 
profitability – guide us as we work towards our long-term 
ambitions. Our aim is to strike a balance between short-term 
delivery and long-term sustainability, between top-line 
growth and overall stakeholder value creation. 

One of these ambitions is to deliver balanced superior 
growth, both in terms of volume- and value-driven revenue 
expansion, positioning us among the fastest growing global 
beverage companies. To achieve this, we’re leveraging our 
leading premium brands, developing winning consumer 
propositions in fast-growing segments and continuously 
shaping our geographic and portfolio footprint, whilst 
weaving sustainability and responsibility into each area of 
our business. We’re focused on pioneering growth in low-
and no-alcohol and exploring beyond beer. We’ve led the 
way in premiumisation for many years. All of this ladders up 
to our dream of shaping the future of beer and beyond.

In 2021, we announced our intention to acquire control of 
Distell and Namibia Breweries. The transaction is still subject 
to approval of the Competition Tribunal of South Africa. We 
remain very excited with the opportunity to bring together 
strong businesses to create a regional beverage champion 
for Southern Africa, and we are committed to being a 
strong partner for growth and to make a positive impact in 
the communities in which we operate. We continue to 
expect the transaction to close in Q2 2023.

Chief Executive’s Q&A

 



Your Dream is “To shape the future 
of beer and beyond to win the hearts 
of consumers” – how does innovation 
play a role?
After a long history as successful brand builders, we’re 
further stepping up on both consumer- and customer-
centricity. We’re revitalising and renewing core beer while 
continuously innovating and exploring beyond beer. Our 
approach to innovation can be encapsulated in ‘3x 
Superiority’: superior consumer insight, superior product 
and superior brand.

Building on the health and well-being trend amongst our 
consumers, we’re expanding our lower-calorie, lower-alcohol 
and non-alcoholic beer offerings. The latest exciting 
extension of our iconic brand, Heineken® Silver, offers 
consumers a smooth and extra-refreshing beer. HEINEKEN 
has truly pioneered 0.0 beer. In 2022 our innovation 
pipeline extended 0.0 options within our portfolio of global 
and local brands, including: Desperados Virgin Mojito 0.0%, 
Lagunitas Hoppy Refresher sparkling water, Cruzcampo 
Gran Reserva 0.0 and Zlaty Bazant Fresh Apple Radler 0.0%. 
In Mexico, we are currently introducing Tecate 0.0, a non-
alcoholic variant to our second-largest brand globally by 
volume, aiming to counter the stigma that beer cannot be 
enjoyed during mid-day meal occasions.

We’re staying relevant with younger legal drinking age 
consumers with brands that embody authenticity, diversity 
and a strong desire for connection, such as Birra Moretti 
across Europe, Tiger in Asia Pacific, Messina in Italy and El 
Águila in Spain. 2022 has been a year of experimentation, 
one example being the extension of the beer brand Dos 
Equis in the US into Ranch Water and Lime & Salt. 
Recognising the continued growth in the energy drinks 
category, we launched ZAGG Energy Malt in Nigeria.

As customer and consumer trends 
continue to further shift towards 
digitisation, how is HEINEKEN stepping 
up its digital transformation?
To keep pace with accelerating trends, we’re boosting 
digitisation on the path to becoming the best-connected 
brewer. Shaping the future is also about digitising our route-
to-consumer to unlock more value for our customers as well 
as overall productivity gains. We have significantly stepped 
up our capabilities in eCommerce and data and analytics, 
capturing and organising our data in a more effective way 
that enables us to hone insights to the benefit of both our 
customers and HEINEKEN’s sales organisation.

Our eBusiness-to-business digital (eB2B) platforms aim to 
create a superior customer experience to drive demand. 
We continue to deploy them at speed, and in February 
2023 we announced that we will start migrating them 
under a single banner: eazle, business made easier. The 
transition will enable better features at scale resulting in 
improved customer experience with increased efficiency, 
helping them to grow their business.

How is the Brew a Better World 2030 
strategy progressing? Are you reaching 
your ambitions?
With Brew a Better World, HEINEKEN is on the path to 
zero impact on the environment, an inclusive fair and 
equitable world, and moderation and no harmful use. 
After stepping up our ambitions, we’re building 
operational momentum towards our goals. 

In 2022, we reduced our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 18% 
(against our 2018 baseline), meaning we are on track for 
our 2030 goal. We achieved this while integrating a large 
business in India into the scope of our reporting. We’re 
driving progress in scope 3 by engaging our agriculture, 
packaging and cooling partners globally to set science-based 
targets and unlock low-carbon solutions. We’re recognised as 
‘A Listed Company’ by CDP for tackling Climate Change. 

Our 2030 ambition is to reduce water usage to 
2.6 hectolitre per hectolitre (hl/hl) in water-stressed areas 
and 2.9 hl/hl worldwide. In 2022, we reached 3.0 hl/hl and 
3.3 hl/hl, respectively. Our multi-year water balancing 
programmes and collaboration with stakeholders in the 
same watershed are delivering positive outcomes.

We’re making good progress on our targets for gender 
diversity and have grown from 19% women in our senior 
leadership in 2017 to 27% in 2022. We also want our 
consumers to always have a choice when reaching for 
one of our products. By the end of 2023, we’ll provide a 
no-alcohol option for at least two strategic brands in most 
of our operating companies, which combined account for 
90% of our business by volume. 

How does HEINEKEN prioritise diversity, 
equity and inclusion amongst its people?
At HEINEKEN, people are at the heart of our business. 
Through unlocking the full potential of our people and 
organisation, we’re on a journey to create a workplace and 
culture that attracts, develops and retains talent. Diversity, 
equity and inclusion is a key priority, and we make every 
effort to create an inclusive environment for people to 
work in, a culture of belonging where everybody can be 
themselves when they come to work. 

We’ve set ourselves an ambition of reaching 40% of 
women in senior manager positions by 2030 and we are 
making strong progress reaching 27% at the year-end. As 
part of this ambition, we recently launched the Women 
Interactive Network, where we invite 100 women per year 
at mid-level career to stretch their leadership skills and 
prepare them to take on increasing levels of responsibility.

What has been your approach to leading 
a global company through volatile times?
To me, the key is balance. The risk is that all the energy in 
an organisation goes into managing crises, losing sight of 
the bigger picture. EverGreen as our North Star is about 
building on our strength, addressing vulnerabilities and 
adapting to seize opportunities as we see them emerge.

The world around us is changing rapidly. We’re shifting to 
a more volatile and challenging era with increased 
geopolitical and social tensions, disrupted markets and 
climate change becoming reality. We also see technology 
advances, the potential of AI and a fight for talent. The 
pandemic and successive macroeconomic challenges 
make it all the more important that we future-proof 
the company.

We continue to be shocked and saddened by what is 
happening in Ukraine. In March 2022 we made the 
decision to leave Russia. We were the first global brewer to 
do so. We no longer sell the Heineken® brand in Russia. To 
minimise the risk of our company being nationalised and to 
ensure the ongoing safety and well-being of our employees, 
we concluded that it is essential that we continue with the 
reduced operations during this transition period while we 
seek to transfer our business to a new owner in full 
compliance with international and local laws. We make 
progress to transfer the ownership of our business in Russia 
whilst dealing with frequently changing regulations. We will 
not profit from any sale or transfer of ownership. We aim to 
reach an agreement in the first half of 2023.

What is the outlook for HEINEKEN?
In 2022, we accelerated the deployment of our EverGreen 
strategy to future-proof our business. The continuously 
challenging external environment has highlighted 
opportunities to boost our capabilities, balancing short-term 
delivery with long-term investments whilst sustaining value 
creation. We are encouraged by the strong performance of 
our business, with volume fully recovered compared to 
2019, and how EverGreen is taking shape. We are 
confident we are on course to deliver superior and balanced 
growth to drive sustainable long-term value creation.

Our outlook for 2023 remains unchanged, as was shared 
on 30 November 2022 ahead of our Capital Markets 
Event to reconfirm our guidance. We expect operating 
profit (beia) to grow organically mid- to high-single-digit, 
subject to any significant unforeseen macroeconomic and 
geopolitical developments. This outlook is based on 
continued progress on EverGreen, a challenging global 
economic environment and lower consumer confidence in 
certain markets. We expect further progress towards 
building great brands, our digital route to consumer, 
strategic capabilities and our Brew a Better World activities 
with commensurate investments. 

Wishing you all the joy of true togetherness in 2023!

Our business priorities



Shape the future 
of beer and 
beyond
We aim to drive superior growth by shaping the future of 
beer and beyond, being obsessively consumer- and customer-
centric. We are focused on premiumisation and innovation, 
extending beer into non-alcoholic, flavoured and less bitter 
variants, and exploring beyond beer with cider and refreshing 
line extensions. 
There are big opportunities within and beyond beer. With premiumisation, led by 
Heineken® and including our expanding premium portfolio, we are well positioned to 
focus on scalable opportunities. Lager remains fundamental in capturing new 
consumers in emerging markets. The importance of moderation continues to be a 
motivation for us, and we are well placed to capture share of low- and no-alcohol 
beverages with our portfolio of malts, radlers and 0.0 beers. 

The consumer market continues to grow for low-calorie, alcoholic beverage alternatives. 
We are expanding our portfolio of refreshing alcoholic brands, focusing on line 
extensions as we stretch beyond beer to meet consumers’ evolving needs and explore 
new growth opportunities for our business. 

Shaping the future of beer and beyond is a consumer-
centred vision. To win the hearts of our consumers, we are 
premiumising led by Heineken® and expanding our 
categories with a strong innovation agenda, meeting 
changing consumer demands.”

Driving premiumisation at 
scale, led by Heineken® 

Heineken® continues to win 
value share everywhere
Over the past year we have continued our focus on building 
direct connections with customers and consumers with 
campaigns that express our personality as the most open-
minded brand in the world. Our goal is to be the beer brand 
of choice for Gen Z by 2030. As per the Kantar BrandZ 2022 
global survey, Heineken® was the fastest growing in brand 
value among top alcohol brands, driven by its strong growth 
momentum, innovations and creativity. Heineken® volume 
grew double-digits in more than 50 markets. The largest 
market for our iconic brand is Brazil, followed by the US and 
then China. The outstanding growth of Heineken® Original 
was bolstered by the remarkable performance of its line 
extensions. We continued expansion of Heineken® 0.0, 
which saw particularly strong growth in Europe and the 
Americas regions. Heineken® Silver more than doubled its 
volume, driven by excellent performances in Vietnam and 
China and its global roll-out, reaching 28 markets in total by 
the end of 2022. The exciting line extension provides Gen Z 
with a premium alternative designed to be a smooth beer, 
brewed at -1° Celsius for a fresh taste. The Heineken® 
brand’s world-renowned creativity was recognised at this 
year's Cannes Lions, the prestigious Festival of Creativity, 
winning 21 awards and credited as the most awarded 
alcohol brand.

Heineken® driving meaningfulness, 
sustainability and responsibility
Heineken® connects with millions of consumers every year 
with world-class campaigns and sponsorships to share our 
brand DNA in a meaningful way, as well as to highlight our 
sustainability goals and responsibility initiatives.

In 2022, we launched the ‘Cheers to All Fans’ (CTAF) 
campaign, making our football campaign across both the 
men’s and women’s game about tackling gender bias 
affecting football's players and fans. 2022 was 
Heineken®’s first year as a leading sponsor of the UEFA 
Women’s EURO, with the objective to become the most 
inclusive sponsor of the tournament. The ‘CTAF’ spot was 
used in tournament activations, as well as for the UEFA 
Champion’s League and UWCL. The campaign fuelled 
creativity from our teams around the world. For example, 
HEINEKEN UK launched ‘The 12th Woman’ campaign, 
standing for one passion, one tournament and one subtle 
name change to a familiar football phrase, rallying all fans 
regardless of gender.

The Heineken® Silver launch delivers a new meaningful 
option within our portfolio, for the next generation of beer 
drinkers who crave moments with friends that are ‘Extra 
Fresh, for Real’. We first experimented with the Metaverse, 
launching Heineken® Silver from our virtual brewery before 
expanding to the real world. Inspired by the ‘Instagram vs. 
Reality’ viral trend, Heineken® then teamed up with real 
content creators to show that overly airbrushed advertising 
is a thing of the past. 

In Asia Pacific, we collaborated with The Shoe Surgeon to 
bring to life the smoothness of Heineken® Silver with a 
limited-edition sneaker, allowing consumers for the first 
time ever to walk on beer. Heineken® also launched 
‘Refresh Your Music, Refresh Your Nights’ across Asia, 
featuring local artists who refreshed The Chainsmokers’ hit 
songs before joining the famous duo on stage, allowing 
fans of different cultures, tribes and music preferences to 
come together to expand their music tastes. 

As part of our Brew a Better World strategy, Heineken® 
reinforced its commitment  to responsible consumption. 
In 2022 we launched two bold new ‘When You Drive 
Never Drink’ campaigns, leveraging our partnerships with 
F1™ and W Series to drive real positive behaviour change. 
The campaign was activated across 42 markets, and we 
are on track to spend at least 10% of our global Heineken® 
media budget to reach a minimum of 1 billion consumers 
with this important message. The Heineken® 
#workresponsibly platform highlights the importance of 
sociability and connection. In 2022 we launched The 
Closer, a device that will close your laptop as it opens a 
beer with the aim to spark conversation on work-life 
imbalance, with a smile. The fully sustainable Heineken® 
Greener Bar made appearances in 2022 at the Electric 
Picnic Festival in Ireland, F1™ in Zandvoort, the 
Netherlands, and the UEFA Women’s EURO.

International Brands

The Year of the Tiger
2022 was the year of the tiger in the lunar calendar, and the 
Tiger brand was the #1 international premium beer in Asia. 
Tiger celebrated with a large global campaign, launching 
‘The Year of the Tiger’ across seven Asian markets. The 
campaign celebrated those who uncaged their inner tiger 
and dreamed big for the year ahead. It featured a number 
of firsts for the brand, including the launch of 6,688 Tiger 
NFTs in Malaysia. These sold out within 10 minutes, raising 
over €850,000, 30% of which was allocated by Tiger to 
support up and coming artists and musicians to follow their 
passions. The year of the tiger was the brand’s biggest year 
on record, surpassing 2019 performance as it exceeded 
15 million hectolitres for the first time. Tiger continued its 
strong growth outside of Asia, becoming the fastest 
growing lager in Nigeria, and in the Americas continued its 
strong growth in Brazil, led by on-trade hitting key targets as 
part of the brand’s growth strategy. 

Tiger Crystal continued its strong growth across Asia, led by 
Vietnam and the Tiger Crystal global campaign ‘Brewed for 
Fire’ with the introduction of the new activation platform 
Tiger Crystal Rave.

Birra Moretti – Villa Moretti
Birra Moretti is all about sharing the authentic taste of 
Italy. The brand continues to accelerate across key 
markets in Europe, with outstanding growth in volume and 
value share in the Netherlands, Serbia, Romania, 
Switzerland and Ireland. In the UK, Birra Moretti more 
than doubled in volume and became the market leader of 
the premium segment in value. Birra Moretti continues to 
inspire people around the world to ‘Enjoy Life’s Simple 
Pleasures’ and live the Italian way through a number of 
key initiatives. It successfully launched Villa Moretti in 
Tuscany, a full experiential event for consumers, 
influencers and customers to share in the Italian lifestyle 
with Birra Moretti, from pasta making to viewing Italy 
from the air in the Birra Moretti hot air balloon.  

Amstel – Further spreading the spirit 
of Amsterdam
Amstel, the second-largest international beer in our 
portfolio, is available in over 110 markets across the world 
and has seen exceptional volume growth in 2022. A record 
year for the brand, the 24% volume growth was driven by 
double-digit growth in more than 15 markets. Key markets 
Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, Spain and the Netherlands 
delivered above their ambitious plans, and in China and 
India the brand is growing volume and equity steadily. In 
South America, Amstel successfully extended its sponsorship 
agreement with CONMEBOL for the Libertadores and 
Sudamericana football platforms until 2026. In line with our 
global commitment to inclusion and diversity, Amstel is now 
also a proud sponsor of the Copa Libertadores Feminina for 
the next four years. Additionally, we have partnered again 
with Big Brother Brazil. 

Tapping into consumer trends in health and wellness, 
Amstel Ultra continues to grow rapidly in Latin and South 
America, supported by our global ambassador Rafa Nadal 
smashing historic records in tennis. Amstel 0.0% continues 
to grow steadily, driven by a successfully launched new 
recipe in the Netherlands. Together with the Amstel Malt 
variants in the Africa, Middle East & Eastern Europe region 
in particular, Amstel remains the second-largest contributor 
to our non-alcoholic portfolio.

Lagunitas – Leading the IPA segment 
Born in Northern California in 1993 on a kitchen stove, 
Lagunitas has since been made available in more than 
30 markets. In 2022, Lagunitas continued to grow 
internationally. Brazil, France, Italy and the Netherlands 
grew double-digits and continue to scale up the iconic 
Lagunitas IPA. In the US, the local team successfully 
launched the new range Disorderly Tea House, a 5% ABV 
hard tea brewed with real guayusa tea leaves, accelerating 
the brand’s expansion beyond IPA and beer.

International Brands

Sol – Live from the Sunny Side
Sol grew in key markets this year, such as Chile and South 
Africa, and remains important in Brazil. A new campaign 
called ‘Live from the Sunny Side’ launched in Chile in 
December 2022. The campaign shines a light on optimistic 
young consumers and has been followed by a complete 
visual identity update that makes the brand even more 
distinctive and relevant for newer generations. 

Edelweiss – Chalet Edelweiss
Edelweiss, our premium Wheat Beer from the Alps, kept 
expanding in new markets such as Chile. Since July, 
Edelweiss has been locally brewed in Vietnam, and soon in 
China and Malaysia, to accelerate roll-out. 

Earlier this year, the brand invited a group of 14 famous 
influencers from its different markets to embark on a 
snowy alpine experience at Chalet Edelweiss. Social media 
celebrities were filmed throughout the trip, resulting in a 
new campaign that captures the spirit of freedom and 
playfulness that has become synonymous with the 
Edelweiss brand.

Premiumisation
Premium beer volume grew 11.4% and outperformed the 
broader portfolio with growth in the majority of our 
markets, led by Heineken®. In 2022, we accelerated 
premiumisation at scale via our international brand 
portfolio, complementing Heineken® by connecting with 
an even more diverse range of consumer needs. 

With our Next Generation brands, we have set out to build 
premium brands that connect with the values of Gen Y and 
Z. For example, El Águila in Spain, Messina in Italy and Birra 
Moretti, bringing the authentic taste of Italy to a growing 
number of new consumers across 64 markets. These brands 
are all increasing brand power and accelerating the growth 
and premiumisation of our beer portfolio in Europe by being 
meaningful and different to a new set of consumers.

Desperados – Go Desperados
A strong example of our forward movement in 
premiumisation is our spirited beer brand Desperados, 
which continued its momentum and grew in the mid- 
single-digits. This was driven by its core markets in Europe, 
particularly France, and successful expansion in Africa with 
accelerated growth coming from the launch in Nigeria. 

Desperados Virgin 0.0% expanded into Germany in 
addition to France, the Netherlands, Poland and Belgium. 

The brand continued to embrace its spirit of wild 
experimentation with its Go Desperados creative platform, 
designed to capture the essence of Desperados by inviting 
people to try new things and pour some unusual in their 
lives. This was further reinforced by a new product-focused 
campaign co-created with emerging and established 
artists from Africa and Europe. Desperados also expanded 
its dance-powered app, Rave to Save, to make parties 
more unusual with unexpected rewards as well as through 
raising money for causes that make the dance scene more 
inclusive and diverse. To date, the app has realised over 
15 million dance steps.

Explore beyond beer

Stretching beyond beer
In 2022, we have remained committed to win with our 
expanding portfolio of refreshing brands, focusing on line 
extensions as we stretch beyond beer. The spirit of 
experimentation is happening around the globe, one 
example being the stretch of the beer brand Dos Equis in 
the US into Ranch Water and Lime & Salt, as well as Sol 
Mangoyada in Mexico. Desperados Alcoholic Sparkling 
Water, launched in the Netherlands, is a refreshing 
sparkling water with the known Desperados kick of Tequila 
and Lime.

Recognising the continued growth in the energy category, 
and with an ambition to differentiate, HEINEKEN created 
a new energy drink powered by malt. In the first move, 
HEINEKEN is focusing its efforts in established malt drink 
markets across the Africa, Middle East & Eastern Europe 
region. With distinctive positioning and targeting younger 
generations, we launched ZAGG, a malt-based energy 
drink, entering a new category in Nigeria with potential to 
scale beyond within the region.

Leading the cider category
Continued strong performance and new releases in the 
cider category this year have strengthened HEINEKEN’s 
position as the world’s leading cider producer. Cider volume 
grew low-single-digits to 5.0 million hectolitres with growth 
outside its home market in the UK, mainly driven by 
Strongbow in South Africa, Mexico, Vietnam and Canada. 
The key to this year’s performance has been the launch of 
Strongbow ULTRA, a new and refreshing Cider that has low 
calories per serving. The recipe is specific by country, but 
always less than 100kcal. ULTRA Dark Fruit launched in 
March in the UK, but was quickly followed by launches in 
Canada and Australia. 

Pioneer choice in 
low- & no-alcohol

The global trend for wellness continues, and we see 
continued growth in the hydration segment offering 
healthy adult refreshment without the compromise on 
taste. Our low- and no-alcohol portfolio grew by a low-
single-digit, reaching 15.5 million hectolitres in 2022.  

We remain the global market share leader in the 0.0 beer 
category, led by Heineken® 0.0. We believe you should 
always have a choice of non-alcoholic beverages available, 
and in 2022 we continued to innovate and extend 0.0 
options within our great portfolio of global and local 
brands. These include: Desperados Virgin Mojito 0.0%, 
Cruzcampo Gran Reserva 0.0 and Zlaty Bazant Fresh Apple 
Radler 0.0%. In Mexico, we are currently introducing Tecate 
0.0, a non-alcoholic variant to our second-largest brand 
globally by volume, aiming to counter the stigma that beer 
cannot be enjoyed during mid-day meal occasions.

Our flagship Maltina brand in Nigeria is growing in the 
low-single-digits with the extension of the brand into 
pineapple and coconut flavours. Lagunitas Hoppy 
Refresher, launched in the US this year, is an IPA-inspired 
adult beverage proposition of hop-infused sparkling water 
that is zero alcohol, zero carbohydrate and zero calorie, 
made using everything we know about hops.

Fund the growth, 
fuel the profit
Our growth algorithm aims to deliver superior, balanced 
growth enabled by incremental investments behind the power 
of our brands, digital transformation, capabilities and 
sustainability objectives. We are bringing balance to our 
growth, investing behind the power of our brands which 
enables us to price responsibly. 
To fund the growth and offset inflationary pressures, we are 
structurally addressing our cost base and building a cost-conscious 
culture. We are embedding this into an ongoing continuum of 
productivity improvements to fuel profit growth ahead of revenue 
growth over time. 

We continue to build on the strong foundation of operational 
excellence established across our supply chain, driving end-to-

leveraging our scale advantage and delivering world-class

New cost capabilities in action 
During 2022, we made significant progress in the delivery 
of our productivity programme, targeting €2 billion of 
structural gross savings by 2023, relative to our cost base 
of 2019. 

Around two-thirds of our productivity savings in this 
programme will come from our supply chain, where we 
have been building new cost capabilities whilst addressing 
structural inefficiencies.

For example, in Europe, we are building on the strength of 
our local production footprint with new networked hubs to 
create centres of functional excellence, including in our 
Sales and Operational Planning. This is enabling improved 
service delivery to multiple customers across multiple 
markets, whilst also driving cost efficiencies at scale. 

Our networked approach also supports how we share 
information and implement best practices across 
functions and geographies, to embed the cost-conscious 
culture in our DNA. 

Our commercial productivity programmes are designed to 
optimise the efficiency of sales and marketing investments 
on a more focused portfolio of brands that are driving our 
growth agenda, at scale – including Heineken® Silver, which 
has been launched in 25 new markets in 2022.

We are also making significant steps in FTE productivity, 
consistently in the right direction, whilst investing in the 
talent and future capabilities we need to deliver our 
strategic objectives. The share of employees in our head 
office working on Digital & Technology has increased by 
around 50% since 2020, supporting our ambition to 
become the best-connected brewer. 

Fuel the profit of the future
The EverGreen strategy represents a multi-year journey, 
and our cost-conscious transformation is designed to 
continue to fuel the profit of the future.

During 2022, we made significant progress in the delivery 
of our productivity programme, targeting €2 billion of 
structural gross savings by 2023, relative to our cost base 
of 2019. By the end of 2022, we captured €1.7 billion of 
these gross savings and are well on track to deliver ahead 
of our target in 2023. 

We continued to invest in our business and in addition, we 
reversed the significant cost mitigation actions undertaken 
in 2021 to partially offset the financial impact of COVID-
related restrictions. Last year these represented a reduction 
of expenses (beia) of circa €0.5 billion for the full year 
relative to 2019. 

Our teams are advancing thousands of initiatives across all 
our operating companies and the head office. We are also 
accelerating large-scale transformation programmes, such 
as the transition to a network model for our supply chain 
in Europe.

We are improving our performance on cost and 
embedding cost management in the capabilities of 
the organisation. 

Our continued progress and these achievements gave us 
the confidence to declare our new ambition to deliver 
ongoing productivity gains of €400 million year on year.

Brew a Better 
World 2030 
In 2021, we stepped up our ambition in sustainability and 
responsibility when we announced our Brew a Better World 
2030 strategy. Our approach has three pillars which guide us 
on the path to zero impact on the environment, an inclusive 
fair and equitable world, and moderation and no harmful use. 
Now, it is time to build execution and operational momentum 
towards our goals. Our operating companies have been working to 
implement the new strategy and bring the ambitions to life through 
local initiatives. At the same time, we are embedding the strategy 
across our global business, in every decision we make and action 
we take. 

While we still have much to do, we are making good progress and  
can see the forward momentum achieving results. We are 
supporting delivery through sustainability-linked long-term 
incentives for all our leaders and fully integrated performance 
management across all operations globally. 

Weaving sustainability and responsibility into the fabric of 
our balanced growth strategy, EverGreen, is not just the 
right thing to do – it’s building business resiliency in an 
increasingly volatile environmental and social context.”

Environmental
Mobilising our global organisation 
on the path to net zero impact
HEINEKEN’s Brew a Better World ambition is to operate 
across a net zero value chain by 2040. This is 10 years 
ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement deadline. 

To drive progress, our interim target is a 30% absolute 
reduction in emissions across the value chain by 2030. 
Our first mission is to deliver net zero emissions across our 
operations (scope 1 and 2) by 2030 and to engage 
stakeholders across our value chain to reduce scope 3 
emissions by 21% by 2030. 

In 2022, we reduced our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 18% 
vs. 2018 baseline meaning we are on track for our 2030 
goal. We are driving progress in scope 3 by engaging our 
top packaging, cooling and raw material partners globally 
to set science-based targets and unlock low-carbon 
solutions. We also achieved an “A” score for Climate from 
the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2022.

Investing in renewables
Brewing is an energy-intensive activity, but we are making  
progress globally to shift to renewable sources in our 
production sites. This protects us from rising energy prices 
and supports the journey to net zero. Two-thirds of our 
energy needs are thermal and the remaining one-third is 
electricity. We are joining forces with other companies to 
source renewable energy through Power Purchase 
Agreements and we rely on innovation to drive progress 
and reduce the need for fossil fuels. Examples of projects on 
the ground include: 

– In Cambodia, we opened the country’s first bioenergy 
plant which uses rice husks, an agricultural by-product, 
to supply 100% of the brewery’s thermal energy needs.

– In Spain, we are constructing our first-ever thermal solar 
site, an innovative project that uses the sun’s heat to 
generate renewable thermal energy and is expected to 
reduce the brewery’s carbon footprint by 60%. 

– In South Africa, a new solar plant will reduce the 
brewery’s carbon impact by around 30%. 

Facilitating access to renewable energy 
We are also working to facilitate access to renewable 
energy for key stakeholders in our value chain. 

– In Brazil, we launched Heineken® brand’s purpose to 
‘Green Your City’ based on three pillars: circularity, urban 
reforestation and green energy. In one of the campaigns, 
we facilitated access to renewable energy for consumers 
and customers. A TV ad reached 30 million households, 
which raised awareness to the topic and achieved 
significant results: more than 135,000 customers and 
consumers registered and a total of 10,000 contracts 
were signed to receive renewable energy.

Improving water usage and leading on 
water stewardship    
Our 2030 water strategy – Towards Healthy Watersheds – 
looks beyond traditional water usage to prioritise the health 
of local watersheds, especially in water-stressed areas. As 
well as actively improving our average water usage and 
managing wastewater in our operations, we also look 
closely at the local context to manage our impacts and 
promote water security beyond our brewery walls. Our 
multi-year water balancing programmes and collaboration 
with stakeholders in the same watershed are delivering 
positive outcomes on the ground.

We set a target to reduce our water usage to 2.6 hl/hl beer 
by 2030 in water-stressed areas and 2.9 hl/hl for all sites. 
We have improved average water usage from 
5.0 hl/hl  to 3.3 hl/hl compared to 2008 across all sites, 
representing a 34% improvement.

26 of our 31 sites in water-stressed areas have now started 
water balancing projects and 29% of these sites are fully 
water balanced. Projects range from innovative nature-
based solutions to infrastructure investments and 
development. Other highlights include: 
– Our operation in Mexico continues to be our most water 

efficient operation globally. The Meoquí brewery used 
less than 2 hl/hl of water to brew 1 hl/hl of beer in 2022. 
Up to 40% of effluent reclaimed through the water 
reclamation plant is used for cleaning purposes, 
reducing reliance on freshwater.

– We established three new wastewater plants in Haiti, 
Serbia and Nigeria, which brings us closer to the 2023 
goal to treat 100% of our wastewater.

– In Vietnam, we partnered with the WWF to replant 
forests which help regulate basin water supplies, putting 
us on track to be fully water-balanced there by 2025.

We proudly support the COP27 Business Declaration on 
Climate Resilient WASH to create systemic pathways towards 
universal access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) 
alongside 25+ global businesses and 15 expert organisations. 

Making progress on circularity by focusing on 
reusability and recyclability 
When it comes to circularity, more than 75% of our 
production sites are now landfill-free, meaning 99% of our 
total volume of waste globally was reused or recycled in 2022. 
We are progressing towards our target to send zero waste to 
landfill for all our production sites worldwide by 2025.  

We have started developing a circularity strategy focused 
on key areas where we can reduce our material footprint, 
improve reusability and increase recyclability. Making our 
product packaging returnable is a priority and 
approximately 38% of our packaging is now produced in a 
returnable format. We want to build on this by supporting 
existing and emerging deposit return schemes and other 
mechanisms to drive reuse at scale.

Social
Walking the talk on the path to an 
inclusive, fair and equitable world
HEINEKEN has always believed in fairness, human 
connection and the joy of true togetherness. We think 
inclusion starts with courageous leadership and that we all 
have a role to play to champion a culture of belonging.

In 2022, we launched a new ALL-Inclusive Leadership 
e-learning which is mandatory for people managers and 
available to all employees worldwide. We aim to have all 
managers trained by the end of 2023. 

Between them, our operating companies delivered more 
than 260 engagement initiatives to raise Inclusion & 
Diversity (I&D) consciousness. These included listening 
and dialogue sessions and workshops on cultural diversity.  

We have grown from 19% women in our senior leadership 
in 2017 to 27% in 2022 (2021: 25%). Our aim is to reach 
30% by 2025 and 40% by 2030. We also aim for equal 
pay for equal work between female and male colleagues 
and want to ensure that all employees worldwide earn at 
least a fair wage by 2023. 

As part of our ambition to create a positive impact in our 
communities, we have reached our annual target of 
having a social impact initiative in place in 100% of our 
in-scope markets. Many of these partnerships work to 
reduce social inequality, or focus on the restoration and 
preservation of natural habitats. We also increased the 
volume of locally sourced agricultural ingredients in Africa 
by 26% compared to a 2020 baseline, meaning we are 
halfway to our goal of 50% by 2025. 

Our safety, health and well-being strategy reflects our 
company value of Care and is focused on shaping a leading 
safety culture. We do our utmost to ensure every colleague 
and contractor returns home safely at the end of the day.  

Creating a diverse and inclusive workforce through 
leadership training and career development
We are levelling the playing field for women and men 
through global initiatives that are adapted to local 
contexts, including: 

– Women in Sales, which represents a large part of our 
business. To increase the number of women in senior 
management, we need to develop our full talent pool. 
The Women in Sales initiative puts special focus on the 
recruitment, development and career advancement of 
women in sales, identifying challenges and removing 
barriers to progress. The initiative is implemented locally 
according to the reality of each operating company. 

– In Nigeria, we created a support programme for nursing 
mothers, including daycare and supported female back-
office managers in their transition to frontline roles.

– In Brazil, roles in sales previously required a motorcycle 
licence but only 15% of women who drive have a 
motorcycle licence. We adapted our processes to 
include using a car which increased the number of 
female hires.

– In Cambodia, the number of women in middle 
management sales positions went up from 9% to 32% 
between 2019 and 2022. The drivers included 
implementing an inclusive parental policy, equal 
opportunity via standardised recruitment processes and 
a flexible work policy.

We also champion diversity around the world through 
external initiatives like the 'Cheers to All Fans' campaign and 
sponsorship of the 2022 UEFA Women’s EURO.

As a result of our actions, HEINEKEN was included in the 
Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, as one of 484 
companies worldwide committed to more equal and 
inclusive workplaces. 

Improving working conditions for 
third-party workers
In Nigeria, we have worked with 76 outsourced service 
providers who employ 10,000 people over the last three 
years. Together with the service providers, we have 
improved management systems and business process to 
systematically improve the living standards and working 
conditions of third-party workers. This has resulted in wage 
payments that are 70% above the national minimum, 
provision of medical insurance, pension, and other benefits. 

In 2022, we implemented a 57% wage increase for all 
third-party employees in the country. Our plan is to make 
yearly increases of between 25-30% to achieve our fair 
wage ambition by the year 2025. In addition to this, 
we executed capability development programmes on 
management systems which have further strengthened 
their business process.

A consumer-centric approach on the path 
to moderation and no harmful use
Brew a Better World means empowering consumers by 
providing choice, transparency and zero tolerance of the 
harmful use of alcohol.

Heineken® 0.0 is now available in close to 110 markets 
(2021: 100). By the end of 2023, we aim to provide a zero 
alcohol option for at least two strategic brands in most of 
our operating companies, accounting for 90% of our 
business by volume. By the end of 2022, we were at 46% 
(2021: 43%).

Non-alcoholic products will play an increasing role in 
HEINEKEN’s industry-leading messaging on responsible 
consumption and moderation.

To continue to lead the debate, our operating companies 
invested 11% of Heineken® media spend reaching 
1.2 billion unique consumers worldwide through 
responsible consumption campaigns. 

We take great pride in the creativity and ingenuity of the 
talented people who bring our brands to market and we are 
committed to world-class advertising. Launched in October, 
our refreshed Responsible Marketing Code reflects industry 
best practice and demonstrates our unwavering 
commitment to respectful, truthful and responsible 
marketing aimed at adults. It addresses our growing low- 
and no-alcohol business and digital media initiatives via 
social media, apps, influencers and advertising on gaming 
platforms, in the Metaverse and e-commerce.

Normalising alcohol-free beer 
We don’t want to just brew responsibly – we want 
everyone to drink responsibly too. Our aim is to empower 
consumers to select the right beverage for the right 
occasion, everywhere and at any time of day.

In the UK, we partnered with ITV to normalise alcohol-free 
beer among mainstream TV audiences. Heineken® 0.0 is 
available on draught and drunk by the characters from 
two of the UK’s most famous TV pubs: Coronation Street’s 
Rovers Return and Emmerdale’s Woolpack.

Partnerships to address harmful drinking  
Harmful drinking is damaging to the people involved and 
their communities, as well as our industry and reputation. 

We have set up partnerships around the world to tackle 
harmful use such as drink driving, under-age drinking, 
excessive consumption, drinking while pregnant and 
alcohol addiction.

In South Africa, we partnered with AWARE.org to raise 
awareness on the dangers of drunk walking. The campaign 
was anchored by media activations, including TV, radio spots 
and billboards that encouraged drivers and pedestrians to 
plan their way home safely before having a drink.

In Croatia, our 10-year partnership with the TESA 
Psychological Centre supports parents and teachers to have 
meaningful conversations with teenagers about drinking. In 
2022, 58 schools applied to be part of the programme and it 
continues to grow every year. 

Making moderation cool 
‘When You Drive, Never Drink’ is our long-standing flagship 
campaign which promotes an anti-drinking driving message. 

One of the actions of this campaign is to partner with 
mobility apps to offer consumers a discount coupon to get 
them home safely. After a successful implementation in 
the US last year, the partnership with Uber was extended 
to other markets, including Brazil, Mexico, Spain and 
South Africa. 

100% of our in-scope markets had a partnership to 
address alcohol-related harm by the end of 2022.

Become the 
best-connected 
brewer 
HEINEKEN wants to become the best-connected, most relevant 
brewer, for customers and consumers living in the digital age. 
To achieve this, we are digitally transforming our business and 
modernising our tech landscape at the same time. 
HEINEKEN has increased investments in its digital transformation to 
build a future-proof company. To become the best-connected brewer, 
HEINEKEN needs to digitise its route-to-consumer, unlock the value of 
data, simplify and automate our end-to-end processes, build a more 
modern technology landscape (the Digital Backbone) and create a 
digitally enabled organisation. We have significantly stepped up our 
capabilities in eCommerce and data and analytics, while at the same 
time we continue to rationalise our IT infrastructure.

We are investing further in our digital customer and 
consumer connections, digitally enabling our sales force and 
connecting our equipment as we transform our route-to-
consumer to maximise the customer experience and value 
and to grow our business in a digital world.”

Digitise our route-to-consumer
Our world is moving ever more online, and so are our 
consumers and customers. HEINEKEN is building out its 
competitive advantage by using data to create the best 
consumer insights and to help our customers grow their 
business. Our sales organisation is evolving from order 
takers to ‘data-driven business consultants’.

eB2B platforms
At HEINEKEN, our aim is to always maximise customer 
experience and value with a focus on customer 
convenience. Our eBusiness-to-business (eB2B) continues 
to grow significantly. We have created a global eBusiness 
team, driving this capability across all HEINEKEN markets. 
By the end of 2022 we implemented proprietary apps to 
take orders from our customers in more than 30 markets. 
We will start migrating our eB2B platforms under a single 
brand name and identity: eazle, business made easy. 

In total, more than 50% of our revenue in fragmented 
trade, for instance bars and small independent stores, 
was brought in via our own apps. This is to include modern 
trade, for instance grocery stores and supermarkets, 
where almost 80% of all our orders are now digitised. 

eCommerce (D2C and B2C) 
To continue to adapt to shifting consumer behaviours, 
we further increased investment in eCommerce in 2022. 
We focused on three different platforms. Beerwulf is the 
leading direct-to-consumer (D2C) online beer platform in 
Europe, active in 11 markets. GLUP is our business-to-
consumer (B2C) rapid-delivery company in Mexico, 
using our network of SIX stores with a value proposition 
designed to delight consumers who want beer, beverages 
and more delivered in less than 60 minutes. It also 
leverages on HEINEKEN Mexico’s suite of sponsorships, 
offering consumers the opportunity to access and enjoy 
great sports events or live music experiences. Finally we 
have Drinkies, our eB2B2C platform now used in markets 
such as Egypt and Malaysia.

Data-driven consumer and 
customer insights
In 2022 we continued to expand our footprint with 
connected equipment. Connected equipment can connect 
to the internet (IoT) and helps both our customers and 
HEINEKEN to optimise service and delivery, as well as 
using data that will help grow the business of our 
customers. For example, this year we rolled out the Shelf 
Image Recognition app to increase execution at the point 
of sale and minimise out-of-stocks. This is now available in 
Mexico, Poland and Romania. AIDDA (AI Data Driven 
Advisor) is an event-driven, AI-based app within our 
eBusiness team designed to support our sales reps and 
help our customers to grow. We use data to create 
category insights for HEINEKEN and to make our sales 
organisation more effective and efficient.

Unlocking the value of data
Data analytics has become a central capability across all 
industries, revolutionising the way companies operate by 
extracting previously undiscoverable business insights 
from data. More and more data is becoming readily 
available by the second. HEINEKEN’s internally generated 
data is complemented by machine data, for instance data 
gathered from our breweries, or cash registers in outlets, 
along with increasingly more external sources. Our Global 
Analytics department uses machine learning and artificial 
intelligence (AI) to collect and analyse these inputs in 
order to support smart business decisions across the entire 
value chain, from brewer to distributor and all the way to 
the consumer.

To unlock the value of data, and to scale Global Analytics 
use cases across all our markets, HEINEKEN continues to 
deploy a global Data & Analytics platform. This platform 
allows for easy accessibility and scalability of the most 
relevant use-cases across our entire business. 

Our analytics models deliver both cost savings as well as 
generate additional revenue. Key analytics models that 
have been deployed include product recommendation, 
promotion optimisation, churn prediction, commercial mix 
optimisation and machine stop analysis. 

Since 2018 we have been on a journey to digitise our 
Supply Chain. This programme is called ‘the Connected 
Brewery’. The Connected Brewery supports the shop floor 
in their increasingly complex tasks and unlocks 
opportunities through insights that we never had before. 
We collect machine data to improve productivity, quality 
and sustainability. By the end of 2022, almost 50 
breweries have been connected to the HEINEKEN data 
layer, which has allowed, for example, smart algorithms to 
create actionable insights to improve performance on 
packaging lines. Our unique platform has made these 
algorithms scalable across all our breweries.

Simplifying and automating 
our end-to-end processes

By simplifying and automating our E2E processes, we can 
unlock significant efficiencies whilst improving internal and 
external user experience. 

Our systems for our supporting functions like HR, 
Procurement and Planning are being standardised, where 
we create ‘automation by design’ as well as enhanced user 
experience for our employees. For example, Robotic 
Process Automation, including the use of ChatBots, 
notably in our shared service centres.

Building a modern technology 
landscape (the Digital Backbone)

To become the best-connected brewer, HEINEKEN will 
need to digitally transform both the front-end (our route-
to-consumers and analytics) and the back-end (simplifying 
and modernising our IT landscape). HEINEKEN historically 
has a widely varied technology landscape, with many local 
applications. In 2022, we continued to simplify and 
rationalise our technology landscape, moving applications 
to the cloud and consolidating our ERP systems. 

In 2022 we completed the SHARP-X programme where 
we  simplified and harmonised our finance processes 
across 24 European markets on S/4HANA. By 
transforming and adopting more standardised processes 
and a different way of operating, the Finance function will 
become significantly more efficient and be enabled to 
better focus on adding value to the business.

We also continued preparations for our modern 
technology architecture, our Digital Backbone. The Digital 
Backbone consists of a Digital CORE (a lean ERP system), 
surrounded by specific cloud platforms. This programme 
will move all our operating companies to a lean and 
modern ERP system, playing a pivotal role in data and 
integration. The Digital Backbone builds on the successes 
of the BASE and SHARP-X programmes, which together 
made HEINEKEN more agile and efficient by 
standardising core business processes in Finance, 
Procurement, Production, Logistics and Sales, and aims to 
have a new and modular technology architecture in place 
by 2028.

Create a digitally enabled 
organisation

We have significantly stepped up our capabilities within 
the global Digital & Technology function, with the creation 
of a global eBusiness team, the building up of tech hubs in 
Krakow, Vietnam, Egypt and South Africa and a significant 
‘upskilling’  effort across the entire business.

Unlock the

of our people
At HEINEKEN, we stand by our purpose of ‘brewing the joy of 
true togetherness to inspire a better world’, and we bring it to 
life by promoting true human connections and a ‘we’ culture 
amongst our people. 
People are at the heart of our business. Our success depends on our 
ability to respond to changing market conditions while staying true 
to our company values: passion, courage, care and enjoyment – 
and heritage.

In 2022 we continued to navigate unprecedented changes in the 
workplace, which required us to adapt and continuously embrace 
learning and growth. We are boosting our strategic capabilities, talent 
attraction and development to ensure we have highly motivated and 
capable people, the right culture and strong organisational health. 
We continue to support the business to respond to constantly shifting 
priorities – always putting our people first.

Our business will only thrive if our people and communities 
thrive. We continue shaping a culture of belonging and true 
togetherness that enables growth. Our ambition is to unlock 
the full potential of our people and organisation, by balancing 
our passion to win, care for people and deliver results. ”

Building a bright future

Strengthening our winning culture
For our EverGreen strategy to flourish, we need a culture 
and behaviours that enable the long-term sustainability of 
our business. 

We have developed a refreshed set of eight HEINEKEN 
behaviours that have become a common language for 
recruitment, personal development, leadership 
development, performance and career conversations. We  
take personal accountability to live these behaviours and 
expect the same of each other every day.

We recognise that everyone plays a vital role in 
strengthening our winning culture. As such, we have 
aligned the development of our leaders, people managers 
and individual team players to our desired culture shifts, 
serving as role models to foster the needed agility required 
to adapt to a rapidly changing world.

Talent and leadership development
Our people and our brands are our greatest assets. In 2022 
we began raising the bar on talent and development to 
match our brand positioning.  We have shaped a new talent 
strategy, grounded in new talent beliefs. We also shaped a 
new potential model that considers three fundamental 
elements: drive to win, inspire & engage and being curious. 
These evolutions have led to fact-based talent and 
succession management, including action-oriented people 
reviews to ensure strong pipelines.

We have embarked on a journey with a renewed global 
leadership development curriculum aligned to delivering our 
EverGreen strategy. This year we have 80 participants in our 
HIMAC senior manager programme, 100 women in our 
Women Interactive Network (WIN) programme and 80 
participants in our Accelerate programme. Overall in total, 
our people achieved more than 740,000 training hours.

This year we have also implemented global assessment and 
development centres for General Management and 
Marketing functions. We will carry on creating these for all 
of our key functions to ensure top quality talent to support 
our business with clear and aligned development areas.

Unleash our diverse talent
Our people are as diverse and unique as our brands. In 
2022 we made progress towards our Inclusion & Diversity 
(I&D) strategy, with focus on three key areas: courageous 
leadership, creation of an inclusive environment and 
fostering fair and equal opportunities.

We have the ambition to improve the gender balance 
across our senior management population, with the goal 
of 30% women by 2025 and 40% by 2030. At the end of 
2022, 27% of our senior managers are women. WIN 
(Women Interactive Network) and Women in Sales are 
two of our global initiatives to level the playing field for 
women in leadership at HEINEKEN. 

We are also committed to cultural diversity, aiming for at 
least 65% of country leadership teams to be regional 
nationals by 2023, and 100% of our managers to be 
trained in Inclusive Leadership by 2023.

This year we launched a new ALL-Inclusive Leadership e-
learning, mandatory for all people managers and available 
to all employees worldwide, to embrace learning and 
growth and to champion a culture of belonging. We 
continue to conduct listening and dialogue sessions in every 
country and function, to enable people to share their 
experience of inclusion and to inform improvement actions.

We had even more employees driving positive change 
together this year via our Employee Resource Groups, 
including the launch of the TogetHERness Global Network 
of Women and Allies and new local groups of HEINEKEN 
Open and Proud (HOP) in several countries.

Our brands are embracing I&D in many ways through 
campaigns such as Heineken’s ‘Cheers to all fans’. Our 
Amstel brand partnered with The Human Library 
organisation to ‘unjudge’ people and break stereotypes.

Caring for our people

Safety, health and well-being
At HEINEKEN, the Safety, Health and Well-being strategy 
reflects our company value of Care. We focus on shaping 
a leading Health & Safety culture fully embedded in our 
ways of working, counting on everyone’s leadership, 
engagement and participation.

It has been a challenging time for all in the past year as we 
continued to navigate the pandemic and adjust to a new 
normal. With health and well-being as a key priority at 
HEINEKEN, we focused on supporting our employees 
through our HEI-Life framework. Four dimensions of well-
being were addressed: professional, emotional, social and 
physical. We developed strategies to support our teams in 
areas such as mental health and stress management as 
well as to enable employees to successfully thrive in 
challenging times.

We have collected our global and operating company  
well-being initiatives and best practices under the HEI-Life 
framework, promoting sharing and learning throughout 
our HEI-Life community, fostering a culture where people 
openly discuss and address well-being while embracing 
enjoyment of life. 

Our annual Climate Survey took place in September this 
year with the purpose to better understand how our 
colleagues experience working for HEINEKEN. More than 
79,000 employees from 81 operating companies shared 
feedback – a 92% response rate (91% in 2021).

Social sustainability
People and community remain at the heart of our values. 
These values have grounded us for the past 158 years and 
are the foundation for our future success. 

In 2022 we continued our global Brew a Better World 
ambition to create a fair and safe workplace for our more 
than 85,000 colleagues, as well as third-party employees 
working adjacent to our business. 

Leveraging our partnership with an NGO, The Fair Wage 
Network, we continued to benchmark and adjust 
compensation to ensure every employee will earn a fair 
wage, and not just the legal minimum wage. 
Unfortunately, legal minimum wages are often 
insufficient to afford a decent standard of living, 
particularly in times of unprecedented cost of living 
increases as we saw in 2022. 

In 2022 we made progress on our equal pay for equal 
work ambition, ending the year with 100% of our 
operating companies having completed assessments and 
100% with action plans to close any gaps.    

Beyond HEINEKEN’s direct employees, we continued our 
global initiative to ensure fair living and working standards 
for third-party employees and brand promoters through 
on-site, independent human & labour rights assessments 
by Elevate Ltd.

We saw continued strong growth in 2022 across the region 
building on the post COVID-19 recovery in 2021. In the 
second half of the year there was increased 
macroeconomic volatility and uncertainty in the region, 
driven by significant inflation, currency devaluation, and 
reduced access to hard currency. Consumer purchasing 
power came under increased pressure, governments had 
limited fiscal space, and we saw growing signs of social 
instability in some markets. Despite these challenges we 
retained a very strong performance for 2022 driven by the 
performance of Ethiopia, South Africa, Nigeria and Rwanda. 

In 2021, we announced our intention to acquire control of 
Distell and Namibia Breweries to create a regional beverage 
champion for Southern Africa. The transaction is still subject 
to approval of the Competition Tribunal of South Africa, 
and we continue to expect that it will close in Q2 2023. 
The combined business will be one of the top five operating 
companies of HEINEKEN, perfectly positioned to capture 
significant growth opportunities in Southern and 
Eastern Africa.

In March 2022, we announced our decision to leave 
Russia. We aim for an orderly transfer of our business to a 
new owner in full compliance with international and local 
laws. We continue to make progress to transfer the 
ownership of our business in Russia whilst dealing with 
frequently changing regulations. We aim to reach an 
agreement in the first half of 2023.

We continued to premiumise our portfolio in Africa, Middle 
East & Eastern Europe (AMEE), led by Heineken®. Total 
premium lager (excl. Russia) grew by 4.2%, outperforming 
the region. Heineken® continued its momentum, growing 
double-digit in volume and above 20% in revenue. The 
growth is well-balanced across the region with particularly 
strong performance in South Africa recovering to pre-
pandemic levels. Brand power is growing in the majority of 
markets driven by successful UEFA Champions League 
activation, launch of the ‘Credentials’ campaign, and 
complemented by the ‘Afterwork’ activation platform.

Amstel, the second largest brand in the region, also 
showed good momentum with volume growing double-
digit and revenue growing above 30%. Key contributors 
include South Africa, Burundi and Rwanda. In 2022 we 
launched a new regional positioning, supported by new 
brand campaign and refreshed visual identity.

Tiger continues to grow in Nigeria, becoming the second 
largest premium brand in the market after Heineken®.

We continued to expand our portfolio beyond beer, 
expanding into the Flavoured category with 
Desperados and Strongbow both growing above 30% 
in volume, driven by strong performance in Nigeria and 
South Africa respectively.

Our solid performance of Primus shows the strength of 
Mainstream Lager in Central Africa driven by double-digit 
growth in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) 
and Rwanda.

We continued to build a customer-centric culture across 
the business. All markets launched robust customer service 
measurement, resulting in systematic solutions to meet 
the evolving needs of customers. This has resulted in 
flexible solutions to enable faster, more efficient service 
driven by digital accelerators, increasing precision in 
customer and consumer investment, growing resource and 
investment efficiencies. 

Our Brew a Better World (BaBW) strategy took a 
significant step forward with the launch of the 6.5MW 
solar power plant next to our brewery in Sedibeng, South 
Africa. Believed to be the largest brewery project on the 
continent, 14,000 solar panels track the movement of the 
sun throughout the day to generate around 30% of the 
brewery’s electricity requirements. 

Operating in Africa brings many challenges for HEINEKEN. 
We are determined to learn from these and play our part in 
raising the bar on sustainable and responsible business 
practices. A recent IFC report highlights some of the impacts 
achieved by our long-term barley development programme 
in Ethiopia. Their analysis identified that 180,000 farmers 
are engaged in malt barley production and that another 
137,000 full-time jobs have been created in aggregation, 
transport, processing and marketing. They also estimate 
that the sector contributed close to ETB 18 billion in tax 
revenue in 2021 and saved around USD 800 million via 
import substitution.

We also took important steps in our BaBW social 
ambitions. We believe that all our employees should be 
able to afford a decent standard of living for themselves 
and their families even where national minimum wage 
policies are lacking. That is why all our AMEE operating 
companies have implemented fair wages for employees 
based on independent data from the Fair Wage Network.

The Americas represents the largest profit pool for Global 
brewers, and we are increasing our share. We continue to 
grow in our key markets Mexico and Brazil while 
expanding our footprint in the region in line with our 
EverGreen strategy.

The premium beer portfolio grew double-digit in volume 
led by Heineken® in Brazil and Amstel ULTRA in Mexico. 
Heineken® 0.0 momentum continues with strong double-
digit growth consolidating our position as the leading 0.0 
proposition in the region. Heineken® Silver has been 
recently launched in Mexico and Chile. The Americas 
region is now the largest region for the Heineken® brand. 

In Mexico, revenue grew double-digit due to revenue 
management initiatives with beer volumes growing single-
digit. Our premium beer portfolio grew in the high-teens, led 
by Amstel ULTRA, Bohemia and Heineken®. The Dos Equis 
franchise grew double-digit driven by strong marketing 
investments and the continued growth of the Dos Equis 
Ultra innovation. We remain market leaders in beyond beer 
with continued double-digit growth of Sol “Mezclas” and the 
Strongbow franchise. The On-Premise channel is back to 
growth after lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. Our SIX retail 
business exceeded 16,000 stores and is being leveraged to 
deploy GLUP, our growing eB2C platform which already has 
more than 200,000 active users. Mexico also announced 
the construction of a new can manufacturing plant near 
Meoqui, further enhancing the brewery’s legacy as a 
pioneer in circularity and waste management. 

In Brazil, beer volume grew high-single-digit fuelled by the 
premium and mainstream portfolio. This has translated into 
a sustained market share trajectory growing value share 
ahead of volume share with intentional efforts behind 
premiumisation and accelerated growth of our returnable 
packaging SKUs. We have strengthened our leadership in 
premium led by Heineken®, growing triple-digit versus pre-
pandemic levels, and Sol. Heineken® 0.0 continues to grow 
in the high-teens and has consolidated its position as 
segment leader. HEINEKEN Brazil is also now leading the 
craft beer segment with Lagunitas, Baden Baden, Blue 
Moon, and Eisenbahn styles. Our dual route-to-market 
strategy is proving to be effective in achieving increased 
reach across channels with continuously improved service 
levels to our customers. The Ponta Grossa brewery 
expansion phase 2 was completed and will create further 
capacity for our premium portfolio.

The HEINEKEN USA business went through significant 
supply chain disruptions leading to an overall volume 
decline. The supply chain improved in the second half of the 
year, yet most of the year faced unprecedented challenges 
resulting in out-of-stocks. Heineken® 0.0 holds its position as 
the #1 non-alcoholic beer in both volume and value. The 
Dos Equis brand continues to expand its range via 
innovations including Lime & Salt. We are gearing up for the 
large-scale launch of Heineken® Silver with an investment of 
more than €100 million in 2023.

We continue to accelerate our digital transformation with 
our B2B solution HeiShop reaching close to €3.2 billion 
GMV and 250,000 active customers. We have also 
deployed our Connected Brewery programme over 
15 breweries resulting in efficiencies and scalable 
use cases.

Our regional performance is also supported by a strong 
delivery in our Caribbean markets, particularly Suriname, 
Jamaica, Saint Lucia, and Panama which are offsetting the 
challenging situation in Haiti. Bahamas had a very strong 
year growing top and bottom line by double-digits. We also 
achieved positive results with our joint venture partners in 
Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Paraguay and Belize.

We continue to make strides in our recent market entries 
with Ecuador showing sustained market share gains and 
Peru gaining distribution and setting up the fundamentals 
for growth. 

Within the Brew a Better World agenda, Brazil built a 
sustainability platform called ‘Green Your City’ which is 
based on three pillars: circularity, urban reforestation and 
green energy. For example, during Brazil’s largest music 
festival, Rock in Rio, Heineken® built a 900m2 urban forest 
of native species of the Atlantic Forest to raise awareness 
for a sustainable environment.

Mexico also launched the TECATE 18+ campaign, aiming 
to raise awareness and generate conversations against 
underage drinking. HEINEKEN USA continued with its 
Behind the Label initiative, a multi-year platform 
celebrating the people and passion that make up 
HEINEKEN USA and our industry.

A strong market recovery from the impact of COVID-19 
restrictions and HEINEKEN’s superior relative performance 
drove outstanding results in 2022. A broad range of 
markets contributed to our overall success, including 
Vietnam, India, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia.

Our Asia Pacific region delivered double-digit top- and 
bottom-line growth as we accelerated our recovery post 
COVID-19 with the ongoing execution of our EverGreen 
strategy. Premiumisation is our core engine of growth. We 
continued to build fantastic momentum in our 
international premium brands and broad portfolio of local 
premium jewels that bring relevant and exciting beer 
experiences to our consumers. Our increased investments 
in world-class marketing and communications accelerate 
meaningful differentiation across our brands, to drive 
brand power and strengthen our premium beer leadership 
positions, led by Heineken® and Tiger. 

Innovation to deliver enhanced consumer value and meet 
a diverse range of functional needs remains a high 
priority. We accelerated growth in our easy-drinking and 
premium propositions Heineken® Silver and Tiger Crystal, 
both born in Asia. These consumer-centric innovations are 
now loved by our consumers globally. Heineken® Silver 
was launched in 20 markets outside of Asia Pacific in 
2022, with more to come.

On the digital front, the region is a trailblazer in the digital 
route-to-consumers and the second-biggest region in 
HEINEKEN in terms of revenues earned through digital 
channels. Driven by the speed of digital adoption and the 
high demand for solutions, we launched Tiger Tribe, a 
digital product development & Innovation Hub in 
Vietnam, to accelerate our digital agenda.

We officially opened the Vung Tau brewery extension to 
support our growth trajectory in Vietnam, where we 
continue to evolve our portfolio for broad market leadership 
across premium, mainstream and regional brands. With an 
annual capacity of 11 million hectolitres, it is our largest 
brewery in Asia Pacific. Over the past five years, it has 
undergone multiple expansions to become a state-of-the-
art, highly automated and sustainable brewery. 

Across the region, we continue to raise the bar on our Brew 
a Better World agenda with efforts focusing on making 
significant progress on our Net Zero ambition in scope 1 & 2 
and contributing to healthy watersheds. 

Our success is achieved through intentional partnerships 
and cross-industry collaboration. For example, in Vietnam, 
we work in partnership with WWF to support healthy 
watersheds in Tien Giang and, in India, we work with 
various NGOs to scale our corporate social responsibility 
programmes. Recently, in Indonesia, we created a public-
private platform, Cut The Tosh (CTT), an initiative focused 
on creating meaningful collaboration with organisations, 
government and media partners to collaborate on net 
zero efforts. 

Meanwhile, our focus on people remains strong. We 
sharpened our regional talent development programme, 
BOOST (Build Our Own Sustainable Talent), to be even 
more intentional in driving the talent agenda. In 2022, 
BOOST helped grow our regional talent in senior 
management to two-thirds. We also launched a revised 
HEINEKEN Graduate Programme and enhanced our 
capability to attract the best talent in their markets 
through an Employer Branding intervention.

Asia Pacific’s growth fundamentals remain strong: the 
middle-class population will continue to grow, and the 
citizens will be increasingly urbanised. By 2050, it will be 
home to over 90% of the global middle-class population. 
We will continue to uncage our full potential to shape the 
future of beer and beyond in Asia Pacific.

In a continuously challenging and

We continued to drive towards our regional ambition in 
2022 by investing in our premium portfolio while driving 
innovation at scale. We also showed a strong commitment 
to the initiatives that fuel our EverGreen transformation in 
Europe, including continued efforts to future-proof our 
supply chain and digitise our sales footprint across the region. 
Despite increased inflationary pressure and challenging 
recovery in the on-trade, this sharp focus helped our teams 
deliver a 4.6% increase in beer volume and a 19.2% 
increase in net revenue (beia) compared to last year. In 
addition, our operating companies overcame high input 
and logistics costs with a broad and disciplined approach 
to Revenue Management and by accelerating our 
productivity initiatives.

As we navigated volatility in the region, we also worked 
together to continue building a future-fit HEINEKEN in 
Europe. Within our supply chain, we rolled out production 
excellence initiatives in all breweries, launched a Transport 
Management Hub and reduced the number of unique 
bottles in Europe by 50% through our proven platforming 
approach. We also grew our digital sales in the on-trade by 
about 50% vs. 2021, making our on-trade eB2B platform 
the largest in Europe. These activities deliver far more than 
cost savings – by successfully implementing these 
strategic initiatives, we will continue to win in Europe for 
generations to come. 

Strengthening our portfolio and geographic footprint is 
key to our long-term growth strategy and in 2022 we 
made significant progress on this front. In fact, looking at 
brand power growth by brand by market, nine out of ten 
fastest growing brands belong to the HEINEKEN portfolio 
as reported by Kantar.

With our Next Generation brands, we have set out to build 
premium brands that connect with the values of Gen Y and 
Z. By delivering innovations that are meaningful and 
different, we can grow our gross profit margin and grow our 
business – and we saw progress on this front in 2022. Our 
premium beer volume grew by a high-single digit, boosted 
by the launch of Heineken® Silver and the performance of 
our portfolio of Next Generation brands, including 
Desperados, Birra Moretti and El Águila among others.

In Q2 of 2022, we reached a milestone in our 
premiumisation journey with the launch of Heineken® 
Silver. True to our mission, we did it in a way that was both 
meaningful and different – kicking off in March the first 
virtual beer launch in the Metaverse before launching the 
brand ‘for real’ in April. We also continued to push our 
portfolio beyond beer. Our non-alcoholic offerings 
continued to grow driven by the success of Heineken® 0.0. 

Cider continued growth in the UK, Ireland, Spain and 
Portugal, led by the launch of Strongbow Ultra Dark Fruit 
in the UK.

In September 2022, HEINEKEN UK acquired the 
remaining shares in Beavertown Brewery – one of the 
most popular super premium beers in the UK – assuming 
full ownership of London’s largest brewery. We also 
reaffirmed our continued investment in Poland by 
acquiring 28.2% of the shares of Grupa Zywiec (GZ) to 
secure sole control of the business. These investments 
provide great long-term growth opportunities in high-
potential markets, which is key to delivering our EverGreen 
ambition across Europe.

Our focus on Brew a Better World was visible across the 
Europe region in 2022. In addition to global activations 
our operating companies continued to find innovative 
ways to deepen the relevance of  low- and no-alcohol 
beers among our consumers. A recent example is the 
HEINEKEN UK partnership with ITV to serve Heineken® 
0.0 draught in two of the most iconic pubs on British TV.

We opened a new wastewater treatment plant at our 
brewery in Serbia as part of our aim to support the health of 
local watersheds by treating 100% of our wastewater. 
Furthermore, we are constructing our first-ever thermal solar 
site at our Seville brewery in Spain where eight hectares of 
solar panels will generate 28,700 MWh of thermal energy 
per year and reduce the brewery’s carbon footprint of fossil 
gas by 60%. An important step in the ambition to deliver 
net zero carbon emissions in our production.

The continued drive to Brew a Better World is increasingly 
being recognised across the region. As such HEINEKEN 
Croatia was in October added to the Croatian 
Sustainability Index, the most reputable sustainability 
award in Croatia, and our Athenian Brewery in Greece 
received the 2022 Gold Award from the National 
Corporate Responsibility Index.

Integrated approach
At HEINEKEN, risk management is an integral part of doing 
business, supported by clear governance. Risks are an 
essential element when opportunities are assessed and 
strategies are set. Management decisions are made in line 
with HEINEKEN’s risk appetite. Risks are identified, 
mitigated and monitored on an ongoing basis, as part of 
business routines.

HEINEKEN’s risk management approach addresses the risks 
the Company inevitably faces in achieving its strategy. 
Managing risks in a conscious manner increases the 
likelihood of achieving our strategy and business objectives. 
A proactive approach ensures risk management is part of 
our executive conversations and is embedded in our 
processes. This benefits our decision-making and is 
essential to create and preserve long-term value. 

Risk Management is part of the 
HEINEKEN business framework
The HEINEKEN business framework articulates the key 
elements that the Company relies on to operate effectively 
and deliver long-term value creation while protecting its 
people, assets and reputation.

Our Purpose, Our Dream and Our Values underpin our 
EverGreen strategy, enabled by our organisational structure 
and strong governance. The behaviours give clear guidance 
to all employees on how to act and foster a culture of 
achievement, collaboration and growth, underpinned by a 
Behaviours Framework that reflects the expected attitudes 
in decision-making.

Continuous Risk Management supports the achievement of 
business objectives, based on our Risk Assessment Cycle, 
the HEINEKEN Code of Business Conduct and the 
HEINEKEN Rules. As part of the Risk Assessment Cycle, 
operating companies and their Management Teams 
review and update their risks on a continuous basis 
throughout the year. The Code of Business Conduct and its 
underlying policies set out HEINEKEN’s commitment to 
conduct business with integrity and fairness, and respect for 
the law and our values. The HEINEKEN Rules articulate how 
we work and the Standards to which we commit. They are a 
key element for managing the risks faced by our Company 
and translating our objectives into clear instructions on how 
to conduct our daily business. 

HEINEKEN’s systems of risk management and internal control, which are based on the COSO Enterprise Risk 
Management and Internal Control Reference model, form a fundamental part of the HEINEKEN Business Framework.

Our Business Framework

Risk appetite
HEINEKEN’s risk appetite is the result of its wide 
geographical spread, prudent financial management and 
commitment to long-term value creation. Risks are taken 
consciously, assessing their impact on HEINEKEN’s 
objectives. The level of risk HEINEKEN is willing to take 
depends on the type of objective it impacts (reputational, 
financial or business continuity related).

Reputational
HEINEKEN is reliant on the reputation of its brands and the 
protection of its intellectual property rights. Reputation 
management is of utmost importance to HEINEKEN. We 
have invested considerable effort in protecting our brands, 
including the registration of trademarks and domain 
names. We aim to reduce the risks that could negatively 
impact our reputation to the furthest extent possible, 
accepting that this may come at a cost.

Financial
HEINEKEN is keen on pursuing commercial opportunities 
to deliver superior and balanced growth, accepting 
uncertainties linked to its strategic choices and the context 
of the individual markets in which it operates.

Business continuity
HEINEKEN makes the availability of its brands a priority, 
accepting only minimal disruptions to its operations. In 
addition, HEINEKEN continuously invests in making the 
organisation future-proof and ensuring the sustainability 
of the business.

Risk profile
HEINEKEN is predominantly a single-product business, operating throughout the world in the alcohol industry. 
HEINEKEN is present in more than 70 countries, with a growing share of its revenues originating from emerging markets.

An increasingly negative perception in society towards alcohol could prompt legislators to implement further 
restrictive measures, such as limitations on availability, advertising, sponsorships, distribution and points of sale, and 
increased tax. This may cause changes in consumption trends, which could lead to a decrease in the brand equity and 
sales of HEINEKEN’s products.

HEINEKEN has undertaken business activities with other market parties in the form of joint ventures and strategic 
partnerships and with independent distributors. Where HEINEKEN does not have effective control, decisions taken by 
these entities may not be fully harmonised with HEINEKEN’s strategic objectives. Moreover, HEINEKEN may not be 
able to identify and manage risks to the same extent as in the rest of the Group.

Risk Management



Internal control
HEINEKEN’s internal control activities aim to provide 
reasonable assurance as to the accuracy of financial 
information, non-financial disclosures, the Company’s 
compliance with applicable laws and internal policies, and 
the effectiveness of internal processes.

Internal controls have been defined at operating entity 
level (HEINEKEN Rules – comprising all mandatory 
standards and procedures) and at process level (Process 
and Control Standards) for key processes, including 
financial reporting, IT and Tax. 

Compliance with company policies is periodically assessed. 
Deviations from the defined standards are included in the 
global monitoring and follow-up processes, supporting 
management in addressing these deviations. 
Management is responsible for the definition and timely 
implementation of action plans to remediate any 
deficiency identified as part of these assessments. The 
results are reported to the Executive Board. 

The HEINEKEN Rules, policies and controls are periodically 
updated to reflect both the Company key risks and the 
extent to which the Company is willing and able to 
mitigate them.

Risk Committee
The Executive Board of HEINEKEN is accountable for risk 
management, risk oversight and the protection of 
HEINEKEN’s reputation, value of assets and brands.

The Board is assisted by the Risk Committee, chaired by 
the CFO, in regular reviews of the Group risk assessment 
cycle that summarises the Company’s key risks, associated 
mitigating actions and monitoring activities. These reviews 
consider the level of risk that HEINEKEN is willing to take 
and the type of HEINEKEN’s objectives it impacts.

The Risk Committee identifies changes to the Company’s 
risk exposure and proposes interventions if required.

Organisation
For the organisation of risk management activities, 
HEINEKEN applies a ‘three lines of defence’ model. First 
and most important is the quality and behaviour of 
operational management, the first line of defence. They 
have the ownership, responsibility and accountability for 
assessing and mitigating risks. 

Operational management is supported by the second line 
of defence functions that oversee compliance with 
HEINEKEN’s policies, processes and controls, facilitate the 
implementation of risk management practices and drive 
continuous improvements of internal controls. 

As third line of defence, the internal audit function (‘Global 
Audit’) is mandated to perform Group-wide reviews of key 
processes, projects and systems, based on HEINEKEN’s 
strategic priorities and most significant risk areas. Global 
Audit provides independent and objective assurance and 
consultancy services. It employs a systematic and 
disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the 
organisation’s governance and risk management process 
including reliability of information, compliance with laws, 
regulations and procedures, and efficient and effective use 
of resources. The methodology followed by Global Audit is 
in accordance with the standards of the Institute of 
Internal Auditors.

To support the Executive Board’s external representations, 
a formal bi-annual Letter of Representation process is in 
place. It requires management to take responsibility for 
accurate and complete reporting on financial and non-
financial reporting disclosures, financial reporting controls 
and on compliance with the Code of Conduct and other 
HEINEKEN Rules, as well as identifying and reporting on 
fraud and irregularities.

Processes
HEINEKEN’s risk management activities seek to identify 
and appropriately address any significant threat to the 
achievement of the Company’s strategy and business 
objectives, its reputation and the continuity of 
its operations. 

HEINEKEN’s risk management system enables 
management to identify, assess, prioritise and manage 
risks on a continuous and systematic basis, and covers all 
subsidiaries across regions, countries, markets and 
corporate functions. Ongoing identification and 
assessment of risks, including new risks arising from 
changes in the global or local business environment, 
are part of HEINEKEN’s planning, performance and risk 
management cycles. Risk assessments are performed 
by every subsidiary and all global functions. The 
implementation of responses and progress of risk 
mitigating measures is monitored on a quarterly basis.

Risk assessment outcomes are aggregated at a global level 
and serve as basis for determining HEINEKEN’s risk 
exposure and risk management priorities by the Risk 
Committee. Accountability for mitigating, monitoring and 
reporting on the most significant risks is assigned to 
functional directors who report on progress and residual 
risk levels three times per year to the Risk Committee.

HEINEKEN continues to invest in the evolution of risk 
management in the Company. Building on the existing risk 
and controls mechanisms, improvements are aimed at 
driving business ownership of risks, increasing business 
involvement in risk management and expanding the 
integrated view of risks. In 2022, specific focus has been 
given to climate related-risks, refer to the ‘Strategy and 
climate-related risk management’ section on page 153. 

Main risks
The risk overview on the next pages highlights the main 
risks that could hinder HEINEKEN in achieving its strategy 
and business objectives. 

This is not a full overview of all risks and uncertainties that 
may affect the Company. As new risks emerge and 
existing immaterial risks evolve, timely discovery and 
accurate evaluation of risks are at the core of HEINEKEN’s 
risk management system.

Financial risks are reported separately in note 11.5 in the 
Financial Statements on pages 107–110. 

The Statement of the Executive Board is included in the 
Corporate Governance Statement on pages 44–51. 

The way we manage risks related to Responsible 
Consumption, Business Conduct and Human Rights are 
further detailed in the Sustainability Review section of our 
Annual Report on pages 126–166.

Risk Management



Regulatory changes related to alcohol
What could happen?
The topic of alcohol and health is under scrutiny in many 
markets. This may prompt regulators to take further 
measures limiting HEINEKEN’s freedom to operate, for 
example through restrictions or bans on advertising and 
marketing, sponsorship, availability of products, adding 
health warnings to labels, increased taxes and duties or 
imposing minimum unit pricing. This could lead to lower 
overall consumption or to consumers switching to different 
product categories.  

Recent developments
Authorities and regulators continue to introduce restrictive 
measures on alcohol consumption and sales. Recent 
examples are restrictions in marketing and labelling 
requirements for specific markets. These measures can have 
a negative impact on our business in the affected markets.

What are we doing to manage this risk?
Responsible consumption is an important element of our 
Brew a Better World 2030 strategy, because HEINEKEN 
strongly believes in the importance of reducing alcohol-
related harm. By using the power and reach of our brands 
through campaigns like the award-winning ‘When You Drive 
Never Drink’, HEINEKEN strives to make responsible 
consumption aspirational for all consumers. We aim to invest 
at least 10% of Heineken® media spend into responsible 
consumption campaigns each year, reaching one billion 
consumers. By the end of 2023, HEINEKEN strives to have at 
least two 0.0 options of its brands in the majority of the 
countries where it operates, because we aim to provide 
consumers more options for low- and no-alcohol brands.

We also work closely with stakeholders to prevent and reduce 
the harm caused by abuse such as underage drinking or 
drinking and driving. Our operating companies are engaging 
in formal partnerships with local stakeholders (like 
Governments, NGOs or specialists) to tackle harmful drinking.

We also stepped up our product labelling guidelines to 
provide consumers with more information about our 
products. We are aiming for clear and transparent consumer 
information on 100% of our products in scope, including full 
nutritional information and ingredients on pack, recycling 
and legal drinking age symbols and a QR code on pack that 
links to further information on alcohol and health.

Explore further: Raising the bar on responsible 
consumption, pages 147–148

Economic and political environment
What could happen?
Throughout the world, local or regional economic and 
political uncertainties could impact our business and that of 
our customers. In particular, the risk of an economic 
recession, change of law, trade restrictions, inflation, 
fluctuations in exchange rates, devaluation, nationalisation, 
financial crisis or social unrest could adversely affect our 
revenues and profits. 

Recent developments
Early in the year, COVID-19 still forced major containment 
measures, diminished economic activity and required drastic 
fiscal and monetary actions to protect jobs and markets. 
Additionally, the global economy trends to a slow down due 
to the impact of the war in Ukraine and, until recently, China’s 
zero COVID-19 policy, which have triggered inflationary 
pressure in supply chain and energy prices. This could lead to 
more structural shifts and lead to a prolonged recession of 
the global economy, with governments applying tighter 
monetary policies that weigh on real disposable income and 
consumption. This could increase the risk of bankruptcies and 
the potential failure of certain sectors to fully recover. As a 
consequence, structural unemployment – especially for youth 
– is likely to surge with knock-on effects on consumer 
demand. Public debt, the disruption of global value chains 
and barriers to the cross-border movement of people and 
goods round out the key risks.

Agility has become a priority to enable businesses to 
navigate subsequent changes in laws, currency movements, 
import restrictions, scarcity of hard currencies, commodity 
pricing and their impact on the Company’s profit.

What are we doing to manage this risk?
HEINEKEN has set up various tools to limit the impact of such 
events on its business. They include supplier management, 
short-term liquidity management, tight foreign exchange 
monitoring, prudent balance sheet measures and scenario 
planning in respect to resource allocation including various 
cost and value optimisation initiatives. 

HEINEKEN has monitoring mechanisms in place globally and 
locally to allow us to monitor, report and engage proactively 
on political risks. For events which could threaten the 
continuity of the business, contingency plans are in place. 
With our strategic priority of ‘Fund the growth, fuel the profit’, 
HEINEKEN continuously reviews its cost base to increase 
operating leverage

Explore further: Fund the growth, fuel the profit, 
pages 16–17

Environmental legislation
What could happen?
HEINEKEN not being able to respond to the impact of 
environment-related changes on our operations in a timely 
manner. If new environmental legislation is introduced, this 
could lead to legal claims, increased compliance costs, 
restrictions on production, packaging, distribution, selling and 
marketing of our products, reputation damage, and limits on 
our licence to operate resulting in negative business impact. 

Recent developments
Speed and scope of environment-related changes on our 
operations are increasing. Markets need to be prepared to 
respond and adapt to these changes in a timely manner to 
prevent restrictions in all areas of the value chain and 
significant costs to ensure compliance. 

What are we doing to manage this risk?
Environmental sustainability is one of the priorities of 
HEINEKEN’s Brew a Better World sustainable development 
strategy. HEINEKEN continuously monitors existing and 
emerging environmental issues and regulations across the 
globe to ensure awareness and compliance and to prepare 
the business for future changes. Current and future 
environmental regulations are being assessed and cross-
functional teams assigned to implement the actions needed.

Beyond this, HEINEKEN closely works with experts such as 
NGOs, universities, governmental organisations and suppliers 
across the value chain. It also co-operates with peer 
companies in international and national platforms such as 
The Brewers of Europe, the Beverage Industry Environmental 
Roundtable and the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition.

Changing consumer preferences
What could happen?
Consumers have an ever-expanding choice of beverages and 
brands available to meet their needs. This requires HEINEKEN 
to constantly adapt its product offering, innovate and invest 
to maintain the relevance and strength of its brands. Failure 
to do so would, in the longer term, affect our revenues, 
market share and, possibly, our brand equity. 

Recent developments
Within the beer category, the diversification of taste and the 
rise of low- and no-alcohol products have been the most 
noticeable changes in consumer tastes in recent years. In 
particular, an increased consumer focus on health and well-
being is resulting in a growing interest in low-alcohol, low-
calorie and low-carb propositions. 

Beyond beer, the significant diversification of choice in ready 
to drink beverages is remarkable but volatile, representing 
both risks and opportunities. Long-held boundaries between 
beer, wine, spirits and non-alcoholic beverages are blurring, 
changing the face of competition and stretching brands into 
new domains. 

What are we doing to manage this risk?
HEINEKEN has embarked on an extensive Consumer Inspired 
Growth programme to address this risk and opportunity, 
helping us move from knowing beer to knowing consumers. 
By thoroughly understanding consumer needs in beer and 
beyond and comparing them within and across markets, we 
can uncover scalable innovation opportunities – be it within 
our existing categories, in adjacent categories or in nascent/
emerging sub-categories.

Leadership, talent and capabilities
What could happen?
Our EverGreen ambition requires us to unleash the full 
potential of our people, attract the best diverse talent and 
grow them to their full potential. If HEINEKEN is not 
successful in attracting, developing and retaining diverse and 
talented people and leaders with the required capabilities, it 
may jeopardise our ability to execute our strategy and 
achieve the targeted returns. 

Recent developments
Within the context of EverGreen, we are on a journey to 
increasing our succession bench strength, enhance our 
leaders’ skills, develop key capabilities (including digital) and 
the diversity of our leadership pipeline.

What are we doing to manage this risk?
We have recently updated our Company Purpose, Values and 
Behaviours, which are applicable to all our employees and 
define the shifts we will need to make to build on our 
strengths and address our vulnerabilities. We have refreshed 
our Talent Management strategy to align to EverGreen and 
external best practices and changes. This includes a new 
potential model to identify and develop talent. 

Our revamped I&D strategy includes transparent ambitions 
on gender balance, cultural diversity and development for 
people managers. It focuses on courageous leadership, 
fostering an inclusive environment and creating equal 
opportunities. 

We continue to invest in learning and development, with a 
new learning strategy and investments in developing leaders 
at all levels in the organisation. We launched a refreshed 
Leadership Development Curriculum, aligned to our 
EverGreen strategy. 

We are boosting an intentional and scaled approach to 
capability building by identifying and developing our key 
Company-wide strategic capabilities and harmonising our 
capability framework across the organisation.

Changing beverage landscape
What could happen?
Consolidation and convergence in the beverages industry 
may affect existing market dynamics due to competitive 
disadvantage with suppliers and increased competition on 
commercial spend and customer acquisition strategies. There 
is also a risk from increasing consolidation and competition 
within overall beverages, with non-beer competitors targeting 
the same consumers and occasions as beer players, through 
product offerings such as hard seltzers and pre-mix spirits 
cocktails.

Recent developments
Despite recent market consolidation, beer remains a very 
local industry with respective country shares more relevant 
than global share. Further impact could come from 
consolidation on the customer side. 

What are we doing to manage this risk?
HEINEKEN is constantly working to improve its cost efficiency 
while rolling out a strategy to maintain and develop its 
competitive advantages, in particular in Premium spaces.

Through a number of acquisitions and partnerships, 
HEINEKEN has evolved its footprint to reach an optimal 
balance of higher growth developing markets and more 
stable developed markets and to build an extensive and 
complementary brand and product portfolio, alongside its 
flagship Heineken® brand. 

HEINEKEN is participating in capital- and knowledge-sharing 
to keep the beer category attractive and relevant for 
consumers. To continue winning on the customer side, 
HEINEKEN explores and implements new ways of working 
and new channels, including digital/eCommerce platforms. 
HEINEKEN combines this activity with an acceleration of its 
own internal innovation efforts to develop and bring to 
market new offers for consumers in both beer and other 
beverage categories.

beyond, pages 11–15

Health and safety
What could happen?
HEINEKEN aims to provide a healthy and safe workplace for 
all employees and contractors. Despite the controls in place, 
HEINEKEN employees, contractors and visitors may be 
impacted by uncontrolled events in the brewery, supply chain, 
route-to-market or in our offices, which could lead to illnesses, 
serious injuries or fatalities potentially followed by business 
disruption, losses, reputational or legal claims. 

Recent developments
Despite our continuous efforts to provide safe working 
conditions, in 2022 we have still experienced incidents with 
significant safety impact on our premises, including two fatal 
accidents involving contracted employees, underlining the 
importance of realising further improvements in the area 
of safety and well-being.

It has been a challenging time for all in the past year as we 
continued to navigate the pandemic and adjust to a new 
normal. As the availability of quality (emergency) healthcare 
services varies across the large number of countries and 
regions in which we operate, ensuring access to quality 
medical care to our national and international employees 
and their family members remains a priority. 

What are we doing to manage this risk?
Our Safety, Health and Well-being strategy reflects our 
company value of Care. We focus on shaping a leading 
Health & Safety culture fully embedded in our ways of 
working, counting on everyone’s leadership, engagement and 
participation.

Throughout the Company, the HEINEKEN Life Saving 
Commitments target the activities that carry the greatest 
safety risks to employees and contractors. 

To ensure healthcare coverage, HEINEKEN counts on more 
than 430 health professionals worldwide. Our employees and 
dependants have access to broad medical services including 
screening and lab tests, medicines and pharmacy, health 
benefits, disease prevention and health promotion projects, 
emergency evacuations, health training and education. Within 
the health area, mental health has been identified as an 
emerging risk. To address this risk, we have launched an 
internal well-being programme addressing the four dimensions 
of Well-being: professional, emotional, social and physical.

putting people first, pages 142–146

Product safety and integrity
What could happen?
Poor quality or contamination of HEINEKEN products, be it 
accidental or malicious, could result in health hazards, 
reputational damage, financial liabilities, disruption of the 
supply chain and product recalls. 

Recent developments
The environment in which we operate is constantly changing. 
Changes to our product portfolio, growing insights of hazards 
associated with potential food contaminants, growing 
consumers’ concern on food safety and a more complex legal 
environment, make it necessary to constantly take action to 
adapt and respond to these changes, to ensure food safety 
for our consumers.

What are we doing to manage this risk?
HEINEKEN has established a comprehensive Company-wide 
Quality Assurance programme covering employee 
competencies, production standards, recipe governance, 
suppliers’ governance and production material risks. 
Continuous improvement is achieved through global 
compliance monitoring and systematic gap-closing. 

HEINEKEN anticipates new legislation and emerging risks 
aided by its partners, suppliers and external scientific 
institutions and assures implementation of measures to 
avoid such risks. Should a risk materialise, global recall and 
crisis procedures are in place to mitigate the impact.

Supply chain continuity
What could happen?
Disruptions to the supply chain could lead to the inability to 
deliver products to key customers, revenue loss, brand 
damage and loss of market share. Significant changes in the 
availability or price of raw materials, commodities, transport, 
energy and water will either result in supply shortages or 
increased costs. 

Recent developments
Global supply chains are continuing to face disruptions, with 
the Ukraine war leading to many supply challenges, especially 
across the energy networks. We have seen a number of our 
suppliers impacted by these events at different moments 
throughout the year, leading to previously unseen price 
volatility and contracting issues. Availability of some resources 
is limited, largely driven by the Ukraine war, and by global 
political instability. Climate change and water scarcity are 
starting to have an effect on crop yield and availability as well 
as grain prices. Markets and governments are required to take 
action to adapt and respond to these changes and thus, 
prevent, interruption of production, significant losses of 
revenues and increased costs for business. 

What are we doing to manage this risk?
HEINEKEN has been able to mitigate the impact of 
disruptions by using its global footprint and supplier 
relationships, across both geographies and categories. We 
have used our agile sourcing methodology, coupled with our 
brewery flexibility, throughout our global operations in order 
to ensure supply was not compromised. Business continuity 
plans have been developed for HEINEKEN’s key brands in all 
key markets and back-up plans are in place in operating 
companies. Business resilience is further strengthened 
through ownership of several strategic malteries, long-term 
procurement contracts, water management plans and 
central management of global insurance policies. Taking a 
long-term approach, HEINEKEN has a strategy that is 
focused on watershed health to protect water resources. 
Sustainable sourcing is another priority in our Brew a Better 
World 2030 strategy.

environment for the long-term, pages 134–141

Increased scrutiny and expectations of 
society on multinationals 

What could happen?
Public and employee scrutiny of HEINEKEN should it not 
conform to society’s expectations to mitigate our potential 
negative impacts on the world and maximise our positive 
contribution, can lead to significant reputational damage to 
the Company or to the brands. 

Recent developments
Stakeholder expectations, including those of employees, 
towards companies, their Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) strategies and performance, is on the rise. 
Companies also face growing pressure to increase the 
positive contribution they make, including measures to 
address climate change and other sustainability issues, and 
to share consistent and transparent information that allows 
stakeholders to assess their sustainability performance and 
benchmark them versus peers in their industry. 

What are we doing to manage this risk?
At HEINEKEN we are raising the bar. Our Brew a Better World 
2030 strategy consists of three pillars and nine ambition 
areas. Each ambition area contains one or more concrete 
and measurable commitments. 

Brew a Better World remains our foundation and our 
framework for working with others. Our updated strategy 
raises our ambitions on climate and water action. We will 
accelerate our efforts to support the social agenda and be 
even more ambitious and bold in promoting moderate 
consumption of alcohol. 

We developed The Green Diamond to guide us towards 
‘what winning looks like’: we aim to strike the right balance 
between short-term delivery and long-term sustainability, 
between top-line growth and overall stakeholder value 
creation. “Sustainability and Responsibility” is one of the four 
priorities alongside growth, profitability and capital efficiency. 
We disclose our ESG performance in a combined Annual 
Report, on our website and via social media channels. We 
believe in transparency and, as such, signed up for the WEF 
Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in early 2021. HEINEKEN 
monitors trends and developments in the ESG area across 
the globe, to make sure we respond adequately and in a 
timely manner to increasing societal expectations.

Distribution channel transformation
What could happen?
The digital disruption is creating new routes to customers and 
consumers/shoppers, which is potentially a threat if we would 
be disintermediated and lose connection to transactions and 
consequently visibility on customer and consumer data.

Recent developments
New B2B and B2C players are entering the market. Some key 
consumer packaged goods players, including major 
competitors in our category, are accelerating their 
investments. Major online retailers continue to strengthen 
their omnichannel strategy, owning on- and off-line retail. 
Electronic point of sales systems are increasingly used to 
collect and leverage customer and consumer data. 

What are we doing to manage this risk?
HEINEKEN has accelerated digitalisation in both fragmented 
trade and more traditional Retail eCommerce. For 
Fragmented Trade we have shaped a clear vision, strategy 
and organisational set-up which is structured around the 
customer. We call that the Unified Customer Ecosystem 
(UCE). The goal is to create a seamless experience for our 
customers which will result in a strengthened customer 
relationship and better visibility on what happens at the 
moment of purchase. We are also constantly improving our 
e-retail capability level through clear playbooks and training 
methods. This supports our ambition to be the number one 
partner of choice for our retail partners. 

Explore further: Shape the future of beer and 
beyond, pages 11–15

Information security 
What could happen?
HEINEKEN’s business increasingly relies on technology, both 
in the office environment and in the industrial control 
domain of its breweries. Failure of our systems as well as 
cybersecurity incidents could lead to business disruption, loss 
of confidential information, unauthorised access to our data, 
as well as a breach of data privacy regulations. All of this 
might lead to financial or reputational damage. 

Recent developments
HEINEKEN’s digital footprint is expanding rapidly, in line with 
the strategy to become the best-connected brewer. Our 
Company is and will be more connected with our customers, 
consumers, suppliers and employees than ever. Attacks are 
becoming more sophisticated and potential consequences 
are more punitive and destructive in nature. 

A growing number of attacks, most notably increasing cases 
of malware and phishing are actively blocked by our Cyber 
Defense Operations (CDO) team. Geopolitical tensions  have 
led to an increase of hacktivism as well as a slow increase of 
cyber warfare activities. Both will increase the likelihood of a 
cyber incident. We observe an increase in cyberattacks on our 
customers as well as key suppliers leading to security of 
supplies concerns.

On top of this, regulations continue to place stricter security 
requirements on data processing by HEINEKEN and its 
ecosystem of partners.

What are we doing to manage this risk?
Cybersecurity remains a top priority within HEINEKEN. All 
functions collaborate closely to act promptly and aligned in 
case of cyber incidents at HEINEKEN or one of our suppliers 
or customers. The portfolio of cybersecurity initiatives, which 
is evaluated regularly, is executed to address cybersecurity 
threats in both our office systems and Industrial Control 
Domain. Our Cyber Defence and Operations teams monitor 
and act upon cyberattacks 24/7 globally. 

Our main focus is to enhance the resilience of the current and 
future technology landscape of HEINEKEN, while continuously 
increasing employee security/privacy awareness.

Digital transformation
What could happen?
In recent years, HEINEKEN has engaged in several significant 
digital transformation programmes. Our large number of 
operating companies and fragmented data and technology 
landscape represent specific challenges to these 
programmes. These strategic transformation programmes 
may not deliver the expected benefits or may incur 
significant cost or time overruns. 

Recent developments
The world becomes more digital, and more (inter)connected. 
Data is more and more an asset and technological 
developments and its opportunities quickly evolve. HEINEKEN 
will need to continue to develop its capabilities to stay 
engaged with its consumers, seamlessly serve its customers 
and ensure its processes are efficient as possible. 

What are we doing to manage this risk?
The new Digital and Technology function, with representation 
on the Executive Team, has the objective to deliver business 
value through digital transformation of our route-to-
consumer, whilst modernising and simplifying our data and 
technology landscape across all operating companies.

Programme Management and portfolio management is put 
in place to ensure prioritisation, de-bottlenecking and value 
delivery across both the entire value chain and 
Operating companies.

Explore further: Become the best-connected brewer, 
pages 22–25

Reporting
What could happen?
Historically, HEINEKEN has grown its footprint organically 
and through mergers and acquisitions, leading to a diverse 
landscape of processes and systems and a low level of 
centralisation. Deviations from the common accounting and 
reporting processes and related controls could impair the 
accuracy of financial and non-financial data used for Group 
reporting and external communications. 

Recent developments
Enhanced techniques and technology have become available 
to strengthen the control environment and to deliver more 
efficient and robust financial and non-financial data. 

External non-financial reporting requirements are changing 
fast. Developments in upcoming frameworks like CSRD and 
EU taxonomy are closely monitored and when effective, 
being embedded in the control environment.

What are we doing to manage this risk?
HEINEKEN is utilising enhanced techniques and technology 
to continue to drive the improvement and standardisation of 
its accounting and reporting processes and controls and to 
harmonise its system landscape. 

HEINEKEN has implemented a common framework across its 
operating companies which includes Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting, Common Accounting Policies, Standard 
Chart of Accounts and periodic mandatory training. 

The assurance model includes active monitoring of control 
execution, critical access and segregation of duties. 
HEINEKEN continues to strengthen the governance, 
reporting procedures and control framework around non-
financial data to further improve the quality of the data 
reported under its Brew a Better World programme and the 
new regulatory non-financial reporting frameworks.

statements, pages 75–118. Reporting basis and 
governance of non-financial indicators, pages 
167–184. Other climate related disclosures, page 166

Non-compliance
What could happen?
Changes in the legal and regulatory environment tend to 
increase the risk of non-compliance with local and global laws 
and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and 
regulations could lead to enforcement, fines, civil (damage) 
claims and reputational damage. Across many geographies, 
law enforcement has increased over the past years, in 
particular with regard to anti-bribery and corruption, 
competition and data privacy laws, and human rights. This 
leads to increased risk of allegations of violations of laws and 
regulations by law enforcers as well as by private parties. 

Recent developments
In respect of alleged competition law violations, there is an 
increasing trend of private parties pursuing civil claims for 
damages. Recent health trends may lead to an increased risk 
of consumers making claims. In addition to these trends, 
continuously expanding sanctions and export controls are 
posing increased compliance risks, in particular in respect of 
business in Russia. 

What are we doing to manage this risk?
HEINEKEN is constantly looking to enhance its internal 
compliance system and resilience to adapt to changes in the 
legal environment. HEINEKEN has embedded legal 
compliance in its risk and controls system and has established 
processes and governance to drive implementation and 
compliance with the Company Rules and the HEINEKEN 
Code of Business Conduct. Our sanctions compliance 
framework includes due diligence and ongoing monitoring of 
business partners and transactions against sanctions lists.  

Explore further: Corporate governance statement, 
pages 44–51

Climate risks
What could happen?
Climate changes could negatively impact the availability of 
natural resources such as water and agricultural commodities 
which can lead to interruption of production and loss of 
revenue. In addition, HEINEKEN will be impacted by 
carbon tax. 

Recent developments
In April 2021, we announced our Brew a Better World 2030 
strategy to raise the bar on HEINEKEN’s environmental, social 
and responsible consumption ambitions. The strategy 
underpins our focus on climate action and translates our 
ambition into targets and action plans to reduce emissions, 
help restore healthy functioning watersheds and maximise 
the circularity of products and processes.  

The implementation of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework supported us in 
defining the climate-related risks that are more significant for 
our operations. These are: the impact of carbon pricing on 
our value chain and own operations, water stress impact on 
our own operations and climate-related barley yield losses.

What are we doing to manage this risk?
We understand the impact of climate change on the natural 
resources we use and we collaborate with stakeholders and 
suppliers to secure their supply and protect our licence to 
operate. We continue to focus on delivering our water 
strategy to protect the watersheds from which we source our 
water and build resilience to water availability. In parallel, we 
are adapting our processes, materials, and sourcing/
production regions to create the agility required to ensure 
continuity of supply and we are reducing carbon emissions in 
line with our net zero carbon strategy across the value chain.

Main changes in consolidation 
As part of the organisational redesign of EverGreen, HEINEKEN merged its export business units of Europe and Africa, 
Middle East & Eastern Europe into a single unit, which is now reported under Europe as of 1 April 2021.

On 23 June 2021, HEINEKEN acquired additional ordinary shares in UBL, taking its shareholding in UBL from 46.5% to 
61.5%. On 29 July 2021, HEINEKEN obtained control and consolidated UBL as of that date, following the changes to 
certain provisions in the Articles of Association of UBL.

On 23 December 2021, HEINEKEN reduced its shareholding in Brasserie Almaza in Lebanon to a minority position. 

On 7 September 2022, HEINEKEN has purchased the remaining shares in Beavertown Brewery, achieving full ownership.

At the closing of 2022, HEINEKEN applied hyperinflation accounting in Ethiopia. Fixed assets are revalued for the 
inflation from the time of acquisition to date. The prior year impact from depreciation resulting from the revaluation of 
previous years is recorded as a change in consolidation and is excluded from the organic growth calculation. At the same 
time, all metrics in the income statement are restated to reflect the inflation level as per the reporting date. These 
impacts are recorded as exceptional items. 

Revenue 
Revenue was €34,676 million, an increase of 30.4% (2021: €26,583 million). Revenue (beia) increased 19.1% organically 
to €34,643 million. 

Net revenue 
Net revenue increased 30.9% to €28,719 million (2021: €21,941 million). Net revenue (beia) increased by 21.2% 
organically to €28,694 million, with total consolidated volume increasing 6.4% and an increase in net revenue (beia) per 
hectolitre of 13.9%. Translational currency developments positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €1,582 million, 
mainly driven by the Mexican Peso, Brazilian Real, Vietnamese Dong and the US Dollar. The positive impact of 
consolidation changes was €570 million, related primarily to UBL.

Total other expenses (beia) 
Total net other expenses (beia) were €24,192 million, up 20.7% on an organic basis, driven by the increase in volume, 
inflationary pressures, incremental investments and the reversal of the cost mitigation actions from last year, partially 
offset by cost savings from our productivity programme.

Financial Review



Operating profit
Operating profit declined slightly to €4,283 million as the performance of last year included the remeasurement to fair 
value of the previously-held equity interest in UBL in India. Operating profit (beia) was €4,502 million, up 24.0% 
organically, driven by the volume recovery in Asia Pacific and Europe, pricing for inflation, premiumisation and the 
delivery of our productivity programme, partially offset by inflationary pressures in our cost base and incremental 
investments behind our growth agenda. 

The operating profit (beia) organic growth in the head office was driven by the increase in general proceeds from license 
fees and services, in line with the growth of the business. In addition, we revised the charging rate in 2022 for significantly 
increased global digital and technology investments, with an offsetting impact in the regions, particularly in Europe.  

Currency translation had a positive impact of €258 million, mainly from Mexico, Vietnam and Brazil. Consolidation 
changes had a small positive impact of €12 million.

Net finance expenses (beia)
Net interest expenses (beia) decreased organically by 6.8% to €380 million, reflecting a lower average net debt position. 
The average effective interest rate (beia) in 2022 was 2.8% (2021: 2.7%). Other net finance expenses (beia) amounted 
to €63 million, down 12.3% on an organic basis, driven by a one-off positive mark-to-market gain of long-term green-
energy contracts linked to the surge in market pricing for energy. 

Share of net profit of associates and joint ventures (beia)
The share of net profit of associates and joint ventures (beia) amounted to €263 million, including the attributable profit 
from China Resources Beer (CRB) with a two-month delay (November 2021 to October 2022). The organic increase was 
€29 million, mainly driven by the strong performance of CRB.

Income tax expense (beia)
The effective tax rate (beia) was 27.7% (2021: 29.9%). The decrease is mainly driven by the increase of the profit before 
tax base, more effective use of tax credits and lower non-deductible expenses.

Net profit and loss
The net profit for 2022 was €2,682 million (2021: €3,324 million ). Net profit (beia) increased organically by €627 million 
to €2,836 million. The impact on net profit (beia) of currency translation was positive €198 million, and of consolidation 
changes negative €30 million.

Earnings per share – diluted 
Earnings per share – diluted increased to €4.66 (2021: €5.77 loss). Earnings per share – diluted (beia) increased by 38.9% 
from €3.54 to €4.92.

Exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles (eia)
The 2022 exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles on net profit and loss amount to €155 
million net expense (2021: €1,283 million net benefit). This amount consists of: 

– €333 million (2021: €286 million) of amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles recorded in operating profit.
– €114 million net benefit (2021: €1,355 million net benefit) of exceptional items recorded in operating profit. 

This includes: 
– a net reversal of impairments of €132 million, including impairment reversal of €234 million for Papua New 

Guinea and €88 million impairment for Russia (total net impairments in 2021: €108 million). 

– net restructuring expenses of €70 million (2021: €32 million). 

– €44 million exceptional net benefit recorded as reduction in marketing expense related to tax credits in Brazil 
(2021: €187 million exceptional net benefit recorded in other income related to tax credits in Brazil).

– €44 million exceptional net expense recorded relating to hyperinflation accounting adjustment in Ethiopia (2021: nil).

– €52 million of other exceptional net benefit (2021: €1,308 million other exceptional net benefit, including €1,270 
million gain on previously-held equity interest in UBL).

– €106 million of exceptional net finance benefit, mainly related to the net monetary gain resulting from hyperinflation 
in Ethiopia of €94 million (2021: €99 million, exceptional net finance benefit, mainly related to interest on tax credits 
in Brazil). 

– €40 million of exceptional net expense (2021: €12 million net benefit) included in the share of profit of associates and 
joint ventures, mainly relating to the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets.

– €8 million of exceptional net expense in income tax expense (2021: €73 million exceptional income tax benefit), 
mainly relating to the tax impact on exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets.

– Total amount of eia allocated to non-controlling interests amounts to €6 million net benefit (2021: €30 million).

related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (CAPEX) amounted to €2,011 million (2021: 
€1,597 million) representing 7.0% of net revenue (beia). The investments in the year amounted to €2,183 million (2021: 
€1,769 million) and include capacity expansions in Brazil, Vietnam and Nigeria.

Free operating cash flow amounted to €2,409 million (2021: €2,514 million) behind 2021, mainly because higher cash 
flow from operations was offset by the negative change in working capital from a higher inventory position, higher 
CAPEX and income taxes paid.

Shareholders' equity increased by €2,195 million to €19,551 million, mainly driven by the net profit of €2,682 million, and 
a positive comprehensive income of €357 million, mainly related to translational differences. 

Total gross debt amounted to €16,377 million  (2021: €16,873 million). Net debt decreased slightly to €13,531 million 
(2021: €13,658 million) as the positive free operating cash flow exceeded the cash outflow for dividends, acquisitions 
and the negative foreign currency impact on debt.  . Including the effect of cross-currency swaps, 74% of net debt is Euro-
denominated, and 17% is US dollar and US dollar proxy currencies. 

The pro-forma 12 month rolling net debt/EBITDA (beia) ratio was 2.1x on 31 December 2022 (2021: 2.6x), in line with 
the Company's long-term target net debt/EBITDA (beia) ratio of below 2.5x. HEINEKEN expects this ratio to reduce 
further, in line with operational performance. At the same time, HEINEKEN could deploy capital for purposes beyond the 
organic growth and expansion of its business which could taper this development.

Introduction
Heineken N.V. (the ‘Company’) is a public company with 
limited liability incorporated under the laws of the 
Netherlands. Its shares are listed on the Amsterdam Stock 
Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam.

The Company’s management and supervision structure is 
organised in a so-called two-tier system, consisting of an 
Executive Board (made up of two executive members) 
and a Supervisory Board (made up of ten non-executive 
members). 

The Supervisory Board supervises the Executive Board and 
ensures external experience and knowledge are 
embedded in the Company’s way of operating. The two 
Boards are independent of one another and accountable 
to the Annual General Meeting (AGM).

The Company complies with, among other regulations, 
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code of 8 December 
2016 (the ‘Code’). Deviations from the Code are explained 
in this report in accordance with the Code’s ‘comply or 
explain’ principle. On 20 December 2022, the Corporate 
Governance Code Monitoring Committee published an 
update to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. As the 
new Code came into force as of the financial year starting 
on 1 January 2023, this report does not yet address the 
new Code. The Company has started the assessment and 
implementation of the new Code and will provide details 
in the Annual Report of year 2023.

This report includes the information that the Company is 
required to disclose pursuant to the Dutch governmental 
decree on Article 10 Takeover Directive and the 
governmental decree on Corporate Governance. 
Substantial changes in the Company’s corporate 
governance structure and in the Company’s compliance 
with the Code, if any, will be submitted to the AGM for 
discussion under a separate agenda item.

Executive Board
General
The role of the Executive Board is to manage the 
Company. This means, among other things, that it is 
responsible for setting and achieving the operational and 
financial objectives of the Company, the strategy to 
achieve these objectives, the parameters to be applied in 
relation to the strategy (for example, in respect of the 
financial ratios), the Company culture aimed at long-term 
value creation, the associated risk profile, the development 
of results and corporate social responsibility issues that are 
relevant to the Company (including the sustainability 
strategy and progress). 

The Executive Board is accountable to the Supervisory 
Board and to the AGM. 

In discharging its role, the Executive Board shall be guided 
by the interests of the Company and its affiliated 
enterprises, taking into consideration the interests of the 
Company’s stakeholders. 

The Executive Board is responsible for complying with all 
primary and secondary legislation, for managing the risks 
associated with the Company’s activities and for financing 
the Company.

The Company has four operating regions: Africa Middle 
East & Eastern Europe, Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. 
Each region is headed by a President. 

The two members of the Executive Board and the four 
Presidents, together with five functional Chief Officers      
(i.e. Commercial, Corporate Affairs and Transformation, 
Digital and Technology, People and Supply Chain), jointly 
form the Executive Team. The decision to work with an 
Executive Team is to ensure effective implementation of 
key priorities and strategies across the organisation.

Throughout the year, members of the Executive Team 
and other senior managers were invited to give 
presentations to the Supervisory Board.  

A two-day meeting was held in June 2022 between the 
Supervisory Board and the Executive Team to discuss the 
Company’s strategic priorities and main risks and 
opportunities in light of its long-term value creation, also 
addressing the Company culture and the global people 
and talent strategy. During this meeting, members of the 
Executive Team also presented their respective strategic 
topics and the risks and opportunities per region or 
function, as the case may be. 

Further, in October 2022 a three-day visit to HEINEKEN 
Italy by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board 
took place, with a focus on the European and local 
strategy, outlook, risks and opportunities.

Composition of the Executive Board
Executive Board members are appointed by the AGM 
from a non-binding nomination drawn up by the 
Supervisory Board. 

The Supervisory Board appoints one of the Executive 
Board members as Chairman/CEO. The AGM can dismiss 
members of the Executive Board by a majority of votes 
cast if the subject majority at least represents one-third of 
the issued capital.

The Executive Board consists of two members, Chairman/
CEO Dolf (R.G.S.) van den Brink and CFO Harold (H.P.J.) 
van den Broek.

Heineken N.V.
Annual Report 2022 44

Corporate Governance statement



Best practice provision 2.2.1 of the Code recommends that 
an Executive Board member is appointed for a maximum 
period of four years and that a member may be re-
appointed for a term of not more than four years at a time. 

In compliance with this best practice provision, the 
Supervisory Board has drawn up a rotation schedule to 
avoid, as much as possible, a situation in which Executive 
Board members retire at the same time.

Members of the Executive Board are not allowed to hold 
more than two supervisory board memberships or non-
executive directorships in a Large Dutch Entity. Acceptance 
of such external supervisory board memberships or non-
executive directorships by members of the Executive 
Board is subject to approval by the Supervisory Board, 
which has delegated this authority to the Selection & 
Appointment Committee.

Diversity
We strive to embrace diversity in everything we do, as also 
recognised and described in the Diversity Policy of the 
Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Team. 
The Policy was updated in December 2021 and is 
available on our corporate website. The Policy considers 
the elements of a diverse composition in terms of 
nationality, gender, age and background, including 
expertise and experience. It is the aim of the Company to 
reflect this in the composition of the Supervisory Board, 
Executive Board and Executive Team. 

For the Executive Board, appropriate weight is placed on 
diversity considerations in the selection and appointment 
process, while taking into account the overall profile and 
selection criteria for the appointments of suitable 
candidates to the Executive Board. The aim is that the 
Executive Board comprises of at least 30% male and at 
least 30% female members, as set out in the Diversity 
Policy. Currently, the Executive Board is composed of two 
male members. It is recognised that the current 
composition of the Executive Board leaves room for 
improvement on gender diversity. However, the 
composition is also impacted by the limited size of the 
Executive Board. 

In the event of succession planning, we will continue to 
look for opportunities to strengthen the gender diversity in 
the Executive Board. Furthermore, increasing the gender 
diversity in the Company's senior management is a key 
priority for the Company, as also reflected in the other 
sections of this Annual Report.

Conflict of Interest
The Articles of Association and the Code prescribe how to 
deal with (apparent) conflicts of interest between the 
Company and members of the Executive Board. 

A member of the Executive Board shall not take part in 
any discussion or decision-making that involves a subject 
or transaction in relation to which he has a personal 
conflict of interest with the Company. 

Decisions to enter into transactions under which members 
of the Executive Board have conflicts of interest that are of 
material significance to the Company and/or the relevant 
member(s) of the Executive Board require the approval of 
the Supervisory Board. 

Any such decision shall be published in the Annual Report 
for the relevant year, along with a reference to the conflict 
of interest and a declaration that the relevant best 
practice provisions of the Code have been complied with. 

In 2022, no transactions were reported under which a 
member of the Executive Board had a conflict of interest 
that was of material significance.

Remuneration
In line with the remuneration policy adopted by the AGM, 
the remuneration of members of the Executive Board is 
determined by the Supervisory Board, upon 
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. 

The remuneration policy and the elements of the 
remuneration of Executive Board members are set out in 
the Remuneration Report and Notes 6.5 and 13.3 to the 
Financial Statements. 

The main elements of the service agreements with            
Mr. Van den Brink and Mr. Van den Broek are available     
on our website.

Supervisory Board
General
The role of the Supervisory Board is to supervise the 
management of the Executive Board and the general 
affairs of the Company and its affiliated enterprises, as 
well as to assist the Executive Board by providing advice. 

In discharging its role, the Supervisory Board shall be 
guided by the interests of the Company and its affiliated 
enterprises and shall take into account the relevant 
interest of the Company’s stakeholders.

The supervision of the Executive Board by the Supervisory 
Board includes the achievement of the Company’s 
objectives, the corporate strategy and the risks inherent in 
the business activities, the design and effectiveness of the 
internal risk and control system, the financial reporting 
process, compliance with primary and secondary 
legislation, the Company-shareholder relationship and 
corporate social responsibility matters that are relevant to 
the Company. 

The Supervisory Board evaluates at least once a year the 
corporate strategy and main risks to the business, the 
result of the assessment by the Executive Board of the 
design and effectiveness of the internal risk management 
and control system, and any significant changes thereto.

Supervisory Board members are appointed by the AGM 
from a non-binding nomination drawn up by the 
Supervisory Board. 

The AGM can dismiss members of the Supervisory Board 
by a majority of the votes cast, if the subject majority at 
least represents one-third of the issued capital.

Composition of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board consists of ten members: Jean-
Marc Huët (Chairman), José Antonio Fernández Carbajal 
(Vice-Chairman), Maarten Das, Michel de Carvalho,  
Pamela Mars Wright, Marion Helmes, Helen Arnold, 
Rosemary Ripley, Nitin Paranjpe and Francisco Josue 
Camacho Beltrán.

The Supervisory Board endorses the principle that the 
composition of the Supervisory Board shall be such that its 
members are able to act critically and independently of 
one another and of the Executive Board and any particular 
interests. Each Supervisory Board member is capable of 
assessing the broad outline of the overall strategy of 
the Company and its businesses and carrying out its 
duties properly.

Given the structure of the Heineken Group, the Company 
is of the opinion that, in the context of preserving the 
continuity of the Heineken Group and ensuring a focus on 
long-term value creation, it is in its best interest and that of 
its stakeholders that the Supervisory Board includes a fair 
and adequate representation of persons who are related 
by blood or affinity in the direct line descent to the late   
Mr. A.H. Heineken (former Chairman of the Executive 
Board), or who are members of the Board of Directors of 
Heineken Holding N.V., even if those persons would not, 
formally speaking, be considered ‘independent’ within the 
meaning of best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code.

Annual Report 2022 45

Corporate Governance statement



Currently, the majority of the Supervisory Board (i.e. six of 
its ten members) qualify as ‘independent’ as per best 
practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code. There are four 
members who in a strictly formal sense do not meet the 
applicable criteria for being ‘independent’ as set out in 
the Code: Mr. de Carvalho (who is the spouse of 
Mrs. C.L. de Carvalho-Heineken, the daughter of the late 
Mr. A.H. Heineken, and who is also an executive director 
of Heineken Holding N.V.), Mr. Das (who is the Chairman 
of the Board of Directors of Heineken Holding N.V.), 
Mr. Fernández Carbajal (who is a non-executive director of 
Heineken Holding N.V. and representative of FEMSA) and 
Mr. Camacho Beltrán (who is a representative of FEMSA). 
However, the Supervisory Board has ascertained that 
Mr. de Carvalho, Mr. Das, Mr. Fernández Carbajal and 
Mr. Camacho Beltrán in fact act critically and 
independently. Since Mr. de Carvalho, Mr. Das, 
Mr. Fernández Carbajal and Mr. Camacho Beltrán are 
representing or are affiliated with Heineken Holding N.V. 
and/or FEMSA, who (in)directly hold more than 10% of the 
shares in our Company, the maximum of one 
representative or affiliate per such shareholder of best 
practice provision 2.1.7 sub iii of the Code is not complied 
with. As a consequence, the Company also does not 
comply with best practice provision 2.1.10 of the Code, to 
the extent that this provision provides that the Supervisory 
Board report shall state that best practice provision 2.1.7 
through 2.1.9 has been fulfilled.

In line with the belief that the focus on long-term value 
creation is best ensured by a fair and adequate 
representation of persons who are related by blood 
or affinity in the direct line descent to the late 
Mr. A.H. Heineken (former Chairman of the Executive 
Board), or who are members of the Board of Directors of 
Heineken Holding N.V., best practice provision 2.2.2 of the 
Code, which provides that a person may be appointed to 
the Supervisory Board for a maximum of two four-year 
terms, followed by two terms of two years each with an 
explanation in the Corporate Governance Statement, is 
not applied to Mr. de Carvalho, Mr. Das and Mr. Fernández 
Carbajal. In the interest of preserving the core values and 
the structure of the Heineken Group, the Company does 
not apply the maximum appointment period to members 
who are related by blood or affinity in the direct line 
descent to Mr. A.H. Heineken or who are members of the 
Board of Directors of Heineken Holding N.V.

The Supervisory Board has drawn up a rotation schedule 
to avoid, as far as possible, a situation in which many 
Supervisory Board members retire at the same time. The 
rotation schedule is available on our corporate website.

Profile and diversity
The Supervisory Board has prepared a profile of its size 
and composition, taking account of the nature of the 
business, its activities and the desired expertise and 
background of the Supervisory Board members. The 
profile deals with the aspects of diversity in the 
composition of the Supervisory Board that are relevant to 
the Company and states what specific objective is pursued 
by the Supervisory Board in relation to diversity. 

At least one member of the Supervisory Board shall be a 
financial expert with relevant knowledge and experience 
of financial administration and accounting for listed 
companies or other large legal entities. The composition of 
the Supervisory Board shall be such that it is able to carry 
out its duties properly. The profile is available on our 
corporate website.

The importance of diversity in the composition of the 
Supervisory Board is described in the Diversity Policy of the 
Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Team. 
The Policy emphasises elements of a diverse composition 
in terms of nationality, gender, age and background 
including expertise and experience. 

Dutch law stipulates that supervisory boards of large 
Dutch public companies, such as the Company, are 
deemed to have a balanced composition if they consist of 
at least one-third female and one-third male members. 
The Supervisory Board currently consists of ten members, 
six male (60%) and four female (40%) members. The 
Supervisory Board will continue to take the balanced 
composition requirements into account when nominating 
and selecting new candidates for the Supervisory Board.

The Supervisory Board notes that, in its opinion, gender is 
only one element of diversity, and that experience, 
background, knowledge, skills and insight are equally 
important and relevant criteria in selecting new members 
as is also reflected in its profile.

Regulations of the Supervisory Board
The tasks, responsibilities and internal procedural matters 
for the Supervisory Board are addressed in the Regulations 
of the Supervisory Board and are available on our 
corporate website.

The Supervisory Board appoints from its members a 
Chairman (currently Mr. Huët). The Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board may not be a former member of the 
Executive Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
determines the agenda, chairs the meetings of the 
Supervisory Board, ensures the proper functioning of the 
Supervisory Board and its Committees, arranges for the 
adequate provision of information to its members and 
acts on behalf of the Supervisory Board as the main 
contact for the Executive Board and for shareholders 
regarding the functioning of the Executive Board and the 
Supervisory Board members. The Chairman also ensures 
the orderly and efficient conduct of the AGM.

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is assisted in his 
role by the Company Secretary. All members of the 
Supervisory Board have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for ensuring that procedures are followed and 
that the Supervisory Board acts in accordance with its 
statutory obligations as well as its obligations under the 
Articles of Association.

The Supervisory Board appoints from its members a Vice-
Chairman (currently Mr. Fernández Carbajal). The Vice-
Chairman of the Supervisory Board acts as deputy for the 
Chairman. The Vice-Chairman acts as contact for 
individual Supervisory Board members and Executive 
Board members concerning the functioning of the 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

The Supervisory Board can only adopt resolutions in a 
meeting if the majority of its members are present or 
represented at that meeting. In such meetings, resolutions 
must be adopted by absolute majority of the votes cast.    
In addition, approval of a resolution by the Supervisory 
Board, as referred to in Article 8 paragraph 6 under              
a, b and c of the Articles of Association, requires the 
affirmative vote of the Delegated Member.

Induction and training
After appointment to the Supervisory Board, members 
receive an induction programme drawn up by the 
Company in consultation with the Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board. 

The programme includes a general information package 
in respect of the Company and its corporate governance 
and meetings with members of the Executive Team and 
other senior management leaders. It also includes a visit to 
at least one of our breweries. 

The Executive Board provides regular updates to the 
Supervisory Board on the Company’s operations, results, 
legal matters, corporate governance, accounting, 
sustainability and compliance.

Conflict of Interest
The Articles of Association and the Regulations of the 
Supervisory Board prescribe how to deal with (apparent) 
conflicts of interest between the Company and members 
of the Supervisory Board. 

A member of the Supervisory Board shall not take part in

or transaction in relation to which he has a personal 
conflict of interest with the Company.

Corporate Governance statement



Decisions to enter into transactions under which 
Supervisory Board members have conflicts of interest that 
are of material significance to the Company and/or the 
relevant member(s) of the Supervisory Board require the 
approval of the Supervisory Board. 

Any such decision shall be published in the Annual Report 
for the relevant year, along with a reference to the conflict 
of interest and a declaration that the relevant best 
practice provisions of the Code have been complied with. 
Note 13.3 of the 2021 Financial Statements sets out the 
related party transactions in 2022. 

In 2022, no transactions were reported under which a 
Supervisory Board member had a conflict of interest that 
was of material significance. 

Remuneration
Supervisory Board members receive a fixed annual 
remuneration fee determined by the AGM. 

More information on the remuneration of Supervisory 
Board members can be found in Note 13.3 to the 2022 
Financial Statements.

Resolutions subject to Supervisory Board approval
Certain resolutions of the Executive Board are subject to 
the approval of the Supervisory Board. Examples are 
resolutions concerning the operational and financial 
objectives of the Company, the strategy designed to 
achieve the objectives, the parameters to be applied in 
relation to the strategy (for example, in respect of the 
financial ratios) and corporate social responsibility matters 
that are relevant to the Company (including the 
sustainability strategy). 

Also, decisions to enter into transactions under which 
Executive Board or Supervisory Board members would 
have conflicts of interest that are of material significance 
to the Company and/or to the relevant Executive Board 
member/Supervisory Board member require the approval 
of the Supervisory Board. 

Further reference is made to Article 8 paragraph 6 of the 
Articles of Association, which contains a list of resolutions of 
the Executive Board that require Supervisory Board approval.

Delegated Member
The AGM may appoint one of the Supervisory Board 
members as Delegated Member. Mr. Das currently acts as 
the Delegated Member. The delegation to the Delegated 
Member does not extend beyond the duties of the 
Supervisory Board and does not comprise the 
management of the Company. It intends to effect a more 
intensive supervision and advice and more regular 
consultation with the Executive Board. 

The Delegated Member has a veto right concerning 
resolutions of the Supervisory Board to approve the 
resolutions of the Executive Board referred to in Article 8 
paragraph 6 under a, b and c of the Articles of Association 
of the Company.

The role of Delegated Member is consistent with best 
practice provision 2.3.8 of the Code, except insofar that 
the delegation is not temporary but is held for the term for 
which the member concerned is appointed by the AGM. 
The Company is of the opinion that the position of 
Delegated Member, which has been in existence since 
1952, befits the structure of the Company.

Committees
The Supervisory Board has five committees: the 
Preparatory Committee, the Audit Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee, the Selection & Appointment 
Committee and the Sustainability & Responsibility 
Committee. The function of these committees is to 
prepare the decision-making of the Supervisory Board.

The Supervisory Board has drawn up regulations for each 
committee, setting out the role and responsibility of the 
committee concerned, its composition and the manner in 
which it discharges its duties. These regulations are 
available on our corporate website. 

In 2022, more than half of the members of the Audit 
Committee,  were independent within the meaning of 
best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code. 

As of 1 July 2022, the composition of the Remuneration 
Committee has changed and the independence criteria of 
best practice provision 2.3.4 are met. For the Selection & 
Appointment Committee the independence criteria of 
best practice provision 2.3.4 are not met. 

The Report of the Supervisory Board states the 
composition of the committees, the number of committee 
meetings and the main items discussed.

Preparatory Committee
The Preparatory Committee prepares decision-making of 
the Supervisory Board on matters not already handled by 
any of the other committees, such as in relation to 
acquisitions and investments. 

The current Chair of the Preparatory Committee is Mr. Huët.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee focuses on supervising the activities 
of the Executive Board with respect to: (i) the operation of 
the internal risk management and control systems, 
including the enforcement of the relevant primary and 
secondary legislation and supervising the operation of 
codes of conduct; (ii) the provision of financial information 
by the Company; (iii) compliance with recommendations 
and observations of internal and external auditors; (iv) the 
role and functioning of Global Audit, the internal audit 
function; (v) the policy of the Company on tax risk 
management; (vi) relations with the external auditor, 
including, in particular, its independence, remuneration 
and any non-audit services for the Company; (vii) the 
financing of the Company; and (viii) the applications of 
information and communication technology. The Audit 
Committee also looks after the provision of sustainability 
information by the Company. 

The Audit Committee acts as the principal contact for the 
external auditor if the external auditor discovers 
irregularities in the content of the financial reporting. The 
Audit Committee meets with the external auditor as often 
as it considers necessary, but at least once a year, without 
the Executive Board members being present.

The Audit Committee may not be chaired by the Chair of 
the Supervisory Board or by a former member of the 
Executive Board. At least one member of the Audit 
Committee shall be a financial expert with relevant 
knowledge and experience of financial administration and 
accounting for listed companies or other large legal entities. 

The current Chair of the Audit Committee is Mrs. Helmes.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, inter alia, makes the 
proposal to the Supervisory Board for the remuneration 
policy for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board to be 
pursued, and makes a proposal for the remuneration of 
the individual members of the Executive Board for 
adoption by the Supervisory Board.

The Remuneration Committee may not be chaired by the 
Chair of the Supervisory Board or by a former member of 
the Executive Board. However, given the structure of the 
Heineken Group and the character of the Board of 
Directors of Heineken Holding N.V., the regulations of the 
Remuneration Committee permit that the Remuneration 
Committee is chaired by a Supervisory Board member 
who is a member of the Board of Directors of Heineken 
Holding N.V. 

The current Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
Mr. Das, is a Non-Executive Director (and Chairman) of 
Heineken Holding N.V.

time to time.

The current Chair of the Sustainability & Responsibility 
Committee is Mr. Fernández Carbajal.

General Meeting
Annually, within six months after the end of the financial 
year, the AGM shall be held, in which, inter alia, the 
following items shall be brought forward: (i) the discussion 
of the management report; (ii) the adoption of the 
Executive Board’s and Supervisory Board’s remuneration 
policy insofar as adjustments to those policies lead to a 
new policy or four years after adoption; (iii) the 
Remuneration Report of the members of the Executive 
Board and members of the Supervisory Board; (iv) the 
discussion and adoption of the financial statements; 
(v) the discharge of the members of the Executive Board 
for their management; (vi) the discharge of the members 
of the Supervisory Board for their supervision on the 
management; and (vii) the appropriation of profits. 

According to the Articles of Association, the AGM shall be 
held in Amsterdam. The AGM of 2022 was held on 
21 April 2022 in De La Mar Theatre in Amsterdam. 
Shareholders could attend in person or virtually. 

Convocation
Pursuant to Dutch law, the Executive Board or the 
Supervisory Board shall convene the AGM with a 
convocation period of at least 42 days (excluding the date 
of the meeting, but including the convocation date).

The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are 
obliged to convene an AGM upon request of shareholders 
individually or collectively owning at least 10% of the 
shares issued. Such meeting shall be held within eight 
weeks of the request and shall deal with the subjects as 
stated by those who wish to hold the meeting, failing 
which the shareholders may seek judicial leave to call a 
general meeting.

Right to include items on the agenda
If the Executive Board has been requested in writing not 
later than 60 days prior to the date of the AGM to deal 
with an item by one or more shareholders who solely or 
jointly represent at least 1% of the issued capital, the item 
will be included in the convocation or announced in a 
similar way. 

A request of a shareholder for an item to be included on 
the agenda of the AGM needs to be substantiated. The 
principles of reasonableness and fairness may allow the 
Executive Board to refuse the request.

The Code provides the following in best practice provision 
4.1.6: “A shareholder should only exercise the right to put 
items on the agenda after they have consulted with the 
management board on this. If one or more shareholders 
intend to request that an item be put on the agenda that 
may result in a change in the Company’s strategy, for 
example as a result of the dismissal of one or several 
management board or supervisory board members, the 
management board should be given the opportunity to 
stipulate a reasonable period in which to respond (the 
response time)”.

The opportunity to stipulate the response time should also 
apply to an intention as referred to above for judicial leave 
to call an AGM pursuant to Section 2:110 of the Dutch 
Civil Code. The relevant shareholder should respect the 
response time stipulated by the management board, 
within the meaning of best practice provision 4.1.7.

If the Executive Board invokes a response time, such 
period shall not exceed 180 days from the moment the 
Executive Board is informed by one or more shareholders 
of their intention to put an item on the agenda to the day 
of the AGM at which the item is to be dealt with. The 
Executive Board shall use the response time for further 
deliberation and constructive consultation. This shall be 
monitored by the Supervisory Board. The response time 
shall be invoked only once for any given AGM and shall 
not apply to an item in respect of which the response time 
has been previously invoked.

Record date
For each AGM, Dutch law provides a record date for the 
exercise of the voting rights and participation in the 
meeting, which record date shall be the 28th day prior to 
the date of the meeting. The record date shall be included 
in the convocation notice, as well as the manner in which 
those entitled to attend and/or vote in the meeting can be 
registered and the manner in which they may exercise 
their rights.

Only persons who are shareholders on the record date 
may participate and vote in the AGM.

Participation in person, by proxy or through 
electronic communication
Each shareholder is entitled, either personally or by proxy 
authorised in writing, to attend the AGM, to address the 
meeting and to exercise his or her voting rights.

The Executive Board may determine that the powers set 
out in the previous sentence may also be exercised by 
means of electronic communication.

If a shareholder wants to exercise his or her rights by proxy 
authorised in writing, the written power of attorney must 
be received by the Company no later than on the date 
indicated for that purpose in the convocation notice. 
Through its corporate website, the Company generally 
facilitates that shareholders can give electronic 
voting instructions.

Attendance list
Each person entitled to vote or otherwise entitled to 
attend a meeting, or such person’s representative, shall 
have to sign the attendance list, stating the number of 
shares and votes represented by such person.

The AGM shall be presided over by the Chairman or the 
Vice-Chairman of the Supervisory Board or, in his absence,

Voting
All resolutions of the AGM shall be adopted by an absolute 
majority of the votes cast, except for those cases in

be considered as not having been cast.

The Executive Board may determine in the convocation 
notice that any vote cast prior to the AGM by means of 
electronic communication shall be deemed to be a vote 
cast in the AGM. Such a vote may not be cast prior to the

prior to the AGM by means of electronic communication 
remains entitled, whether or not represented by a holder 
of a written power of attorney, to participate in the AGM.

taken by a secretary to be designated by the chairman of

transfer of the enterprise or the transfer of practically the 
entire enterprise of the Company to a third-party, (b) the 
entering into or the termination of a lasting co-operation 
of the Company or a subsidiary with another legal entity 
or company or a fully liable partner in a limited partnership 
or general partnership, if such co-operation or termination 
is of fundamental importance to the Company and 
(c) acquiring or disposing of a participation in the capital 
of a company by the Company or a subsidiary amounting 
to at least one-third of the amount of assets according to 
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet plus

€921,604,180.80, consisting of 576,002,613 shares of 
€1.60 each. Each share carries one vote. The shares are 
listed on Euronext Amsterdam.

All shares carry equal rights and are freely transferable 
(unless provided otherwise below).

Shares repurchased by the Company for the share-based 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) or for any other purpose

entered into effect. All (bearer) shares in the Company’s 
authorised capital have already been registered as per 
earlier amendment of the Articles of Association. However, 
there still are share certificates for bearer shares circulating 
which are eligible for submission with the Company. 

Pursuant to Dutch law, the Company received 12,037 
certificates for bearer shares without consideration on      
31 December 2020.

Any holder of certificates for bearer shares submitting its

Restrictions related to shares held by FEMSA
Upon completion (on 30 April 2010) of the acquisition of 
the beer operations of Fomento Económico Mexicano, 
S.A.B. de C.V. (FEMSA), CB Equity LLP (belonging to the 
FEMSA Group) received Heineken N.V. shares (and 
Heineken Holding N.V. shares). Pursuant to the Corporate 
Governance Agreement of 30 April 2010 concluded 
between the Company, Heineken Holding N.V., L’Arche 
Green N.V., FEMSA and CB Equity LLP the following applies:

– Subject to certain exceptions, FEMSA, CB Equity LLP, 
and any member of the FEMSA Group shall not 
increase its shareholding in Heineken Holding N.V. 
above 20% and shall not increase its holding in the 
Heineken Group above a maximum of 20% economic 
interest (such capped percentages referred to as the 
‘Voting Ownership Cap’).

– Subject to certain exceptions, FEMSA, CB Equity LLP and 
any member of the FEMSA Group may not exercise any 
voting rights in respect of any shares beneficially owned 
by it, if and to the extent that such shares are in excess 
of the applicable Voting Ownership Cap.

– Unless FEMSA’s economic interest in the Heineken 
Group were to fall below 14%, the current FEMSA 
control structure were to change or FEMSA were to be 
subject to a change of control, FEMSA is entitled to 
have two representatives on the Company’s Supervisory 
Board, one of whom will be Vice-Chairman, who also 
serves as the FEMSA representative on the Board of 
Directors of Heineken Holding N.V.

Share plans
There is a share-based Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for 
both the Executive Board members and senior 
management. Eligibility for participation in the LTIP by 
senior management is based on objective criteria.

Each year, performance shares are awarded to the 
participants. Depending on the fulfilment of certain 
predetermined performance conditions during a three-
year performance period, the performance shares will vest 
and the participants will receive Heineken N.V. shares.

Shares received by Executive Board members upon vesting 
under the LTIP are subject to a holding period of five years 
as from the date of award of the respective performance 
shares, which is approximately two years from the      
vesting date.

Under the Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) for the 
Executive Board, Executive Board members are entitled to 
receive a cash bonus subject to the fulfilment of 
predetermined performance conditions. 

Executive Board members are obliged to invest at least 
25% of their STIP payout in Heineken N.V. shares 
(‘investment shares’) to be delivered by the Company; the 
maximum they can invest in Heineken N.V. shares is 50% 
of their STIP payout (at their discretion).

The investment shares (which are acquired by the 
Executive Board members in the year after the year over 
which the STIP payout is calculated) are subject to a 
holding period of five years as from 1 January of the year 
in which the investment shares are acquired. 

Executive Board members are entitled to receive one 
additional Heineken N.V. share (a ‘matching share’) for 
each investment share held by them at the end of the 
respective holding period. 

The entitlement to receive matching shares shall lapse 
upon the termination by the Company of the service 
agreements of Mr. Van den Brink and Mr. Van den Broek, 
as the case may be, for an urgent reason (‘dringende 
reden’) within the meaning of the law or in case of 
dismissal for cause (‘ontslag met gegronde redenen’) 
whereby the cause for dismissal concerns unsatisfactory 
functioning of the Executive Board member.

In exceptional situations, extraordinary share entitlements 
may be awarded by the Executive Board to employees. 
These share entitlements are usually non-performance-
related and the employees involved are usually entitled to 
receive Heineken N.V. shares after the expiry of a period 
of time.

The shares required for the LTIP, the STIP and the 
extraordinary share entitlements will be acquired by the 
Company on the basis of an authorisation granted by the 
AGM and subject to approval of the Supervisory Board of 
the Company.

Change of control
There are no important agreements to which the 
Company is a party and that will automatically come into 
force, be amended or be terminated under the condition 
of a change of control over the Company as a result of a 
public offer.

However, the contractual conditions of most of the 
Company’s important financing agreements and notes 
issued (potentially) entitle the banks and noteholders 
respectively to claim early repayment of the amounts 
borrowed by the Company in the situation of a change 
of control over the Company (as defined in the 
respective agreement).

Also, some of the Company’s important joint venture 
agreements provide that in case of a change of control 
over the Company (as defined in the respective 
agreement), the other party to such agreement may 
exercise its right to purchase the Company’s shares in the 
joint venture, as a result of which the respective joint 
venture agreement will terminate.

Appointment and dismissal of Supervisory and 
Executive Board members
Members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive 
Board are appointed by the AGM on the basis of a non-
binding nomination by the Supervisory Board.

The AGM can dismiss members of the Supervisory Board 
and the Executive Board by a majority of the votes cast,     
if the subject majority at least represents one-third of the 
issued capital.

Amendment of the Articles of Association
The Articles of Association can be amended by resolution 
of the AGM in which at least half of the issued capital is 
represented and exclusively either at the proposal of the 
Supervisory Board or at the proposal of the Executive 
Board that has been approved by the Supervisory Board, 
or at the proposal of one or more shareholders 
representing at least half of the issued capital.

Acquisition of own shares
On 21 April 2022, the AGM authorised the Executive 
Board (for the statutory maximum period of 18 months) 
to acquire own shares subject to the following conditions 
and with due observance of the law and the Articles of 
Association (which require the approval of the 
Supervisory Board):

The maximum number of shares which may be acquired 
is 10% of the issued capital of the Company as per 
21 April 2022.

Transactions must be executed at a price between the 
nominal value of the shares and 110% of the opening 
price quoted for the shares in the Official Price List 
(Officiële Prijscourant) of Euronext Amsterdam on the 
date of the transaction or, in the absence of such a price, 
the latest price quoted therein.

Transactions may be executed on the stock exchange 
or otherwise.

The authorisation may be used in connection with the LTIP 
and the STIP for the members of the Executive Board and 
the LTIP for senior management, but may also serve other 
purposes, such as acquisitions. A new authorisation will be 
submitted for approval at the next AGM on 20 April 2023.

Issue of shares
On 21 April 2022, the AGM authorised the Executive 
Board (for a period of 18 months) to issue shares or grant 
rights to subscribe for shares and to restrict or exclude 
shareholders’ pre-emption rights, with due observance of 
the law and Articles of Association (which require the 
approval of the Supervisory Board). 

The authorisation is limited to 10% of the Company’s 
issued capital as per 21 April 2022. 

The authorisation may be used in connection with the 
LTIP and the STIP for the members of the Executive Board 
and the LTIP for senior management, but may also serve 
other purposes, such as funding of acquisitions. 

A new authorisation will be submitted for approval to the 
AGM at 20 April 2023.

Compliance with the Code
On 8 December 2016, the current Code was published, 
which came into effect on 1 January 2017. 

The Code can be downloaded at http://www.mccg.nl.

As stated in the Code, there should be a basic recognition 
that corporate governance must be tailored to the 
company-specific situation and, therefore, that non-
application of individual provisions by a company may 
be justified.

The Company, in principle, endorses the Code’s principles 
and applies virtually all best practice provisions. However, 
given the structure of the Heineken Group and, specifically, 
the relationship between the Company and its controlling 
shareholder Heineken Holding N.V., the Company does 
not (fully) apply the following best practice provisions:

– 2.1.7, 2.1.8, 2.1.10 and 2.3.4: Number of independent 
Supervisory Board members as well as number of 
independent members of the Remuneration and 
Selection & Appointment Committees; in that light the 
Supervisory Board report does not state that best 
practice provisions 2.1.7 through 2.1.9 have been fulfilled

– 2.2.2: Maximum terms of appointment Supervisory 
Board members

– 2.3.8: Temporary nature of appointing a delegated 
Supervisory Board member

The agreement with Mr. Van den Brink and Mr. Van den 
Broek with regards to their terms comply with the Code. 

For more information please see the Remuneration Report.

Other best practice provisions which are not applied relate 
to the fact that these principles and/or best practice 
provisions are not applicable to the Company:

– 2.8.1: This best practice provision situation has not arisen
– 3.1.2: sub vii: The Company does not grant options 

on shares
– 4.1.5: This best practice provision relates to shareholders
– 4.2.6: The Company has no anti-takeover measures
– 4.3.1: This best practice provision relates to shareholders
– 4.3.4: The Company has no financing preference shares
– 4.3.5 and 4.3.6: This best practice provision relates to 

institutional investors
– 4.4: The Company has no depositary receipts of shares, 

nor a trust office
– 4.3.3 and 5.1: The Company does not have a one-tier 

management structure

In respect of transactions with related parties as disclosed 
in note 13.3, best practice provisions 2.7.3, 2.7.4 and 2.7.5 
of the Code have been observed.

Statement of the Executive Board
This Report of the Executive Board, together with the 
Sustainability Review, serves as the management report for 
the purpose of Section 391, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

In accordance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the 
Code, we are of the opinion that:

– This report provides sufficient insights into any failings 
in the effectiveness of the internal risk management

Heineken N.V.
Annual Report 2022 54

To the Shareholders



The Supervisory Board has a diverse composition in terms 
of experience, gender, nationality and age. Four out of ten 
members are women and eight out of ten members are 
non-Dutch. There are six nationalities (American, British, 
Dutch, German, Indian and Mexican) and the age of the 
members ranges between 53 and 78. 

The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that a diversity of 
experience and skills is represented on its board. The 
elements of a diverse composition of the Supervisory 
Board are laid down in the Diversity Policy of the 
Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Team as 
per best practice provision 2.1.5 of the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code of 8 December 2016 (the ‘Code’). 
Currently, 40% (i.e. four out of ten) of the Supervisory 
Board members are female. 

The profile of the Supervisory Board and the Diversity 
Policy of the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and 
Executive Team (available on the Company website) 
provides that a minimum of 1/3 of the seats of the 
Supervisory Board shall be held by women and a 
minimum of 1/3 of the seats shall be held by men. The 
composition of the Supervisory Board of the Company is 
compliant with the Diversity Policy and Dutch law. 

Diversity and gender are important drivers in the selection 
process. With reference thereto, the Supervisory Board is 
committed to retain an active and open attitude as 
regards selecting female candidates. The Supervisory 
Board is keen to embrace diversity at large and considers 
gender, experience, background, nationality, knowledge, 
skills and insight equally important and relevant criteria in 
selecting new members. More details on the skills and 
experience of the various Supervisory Board members are 
provided on the previous page.

Composition and AGM 2023
Mr. de Carvalho, Mrs. Ripley and Mrs. Arnold will have 
completed their four-year appointment terms per the end 
of the AGM on 20 April 2023. 

A non-binding nomination for the re-appointment of 
Mr. de Carvalho as member of the Supervisory Board for a 
period of four years shall be submitted to the  2023 AGM. 
Pursuant to best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code, 
Mr. de Carvalho, married to Mrs. C.L. de Carvalho-Heineken, 
who holds indirectly more than 10% of the shares in the 
Company, and is an executive director of Heineken Holding 
N.V., does not qualify as ‘independent’. A re-appointment of 
Mr. de Carvalho for a period of four years is a deviation of 
the maximum appointment term of best practice provision 
2.2.2 of the Code. In the interest of preserving the core 
values and the structure of the Heineken Group, the 
Company does not apply the maximum appointment 
period to members who are related by blood or affinity in 
the direct line of descent to Mr. A.H. Heineken or who are 
members of the Board of Directors of Heineken Holding N.V.

A non-binding nomination for the re-appointment of 
Mrs. Ripley as member of the Supervisory Board for a period 
of four years shall be submitted to the  2023 AGM. 

Mrs. Arnold’s term as Supervisory Board member will end 
at the AGM on 20 April 2023. The Supervisory Board is 
very grateful for Mrs. Arnold’s commitment and her 
meaningful contributions to the Supervisory Board and its 
Audit Committee over the past years. Especially her 
contributions to the Digital and Technology agenda of 
the Company have been very valuable.

A non-binding nomination for the appointment of 
Mr. Hijmans van den Bergh and Mrs. Pardo as members of 
the Supervisory Board for a period of four years.shall be 
submitted to the 2023 AGM. With these nominations the 
Supervisory Board will grow from ten to eleven members, 
in line with the Regulations of the Supervisory Board and 
reflecting an increased composition in times of transition. 
It is the aim of the Supervisory Board that its composition, 
also in terms of skills and expertise, supports the Company 
in its goal to future-proof the business and deliver superior 
and balanced growth with greater focus on meeting the 
needs of consumers and customers.

Independence
The Supervisory Board endorses the principle that the 
composition of the Supervisory Board shall be such that 
its members are able to act critically and independently 
of one another and of the Executive Board and any 
particular interests.

Given the structure of the Heineken Group, the Company 
is of the opinion that, in the context of preserving the 
continuity of the Heineken Group and ensuring a focus on 
long-term value creation, it is in its best interest and that of 
its stakeholders that the Supervisory Board includes a fair 
and adequate representation of persons who are related 
by blood or affinity in the direct line of descent to the late 
Mr. A.H. Heineken (former Chairman of the Executive 
Board), or who are members of the Board of Directors of 
Heineken Holding N.V., even if those persons would not, 
formally speaking, be considered ‘independent’ within the 
meaning of best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code.

Currently, the majority of the Supervisory Board (i.e. six of 
its ten members) qualify as “independent” as per best 
practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code.

There are four members who in a strictly formal sense do 
not meet the applicable criteria for being ‘independent’ as 
set out in the Code: Mr. de Carvalho (who is the spouse of 
Mrs. C.L. de Carvalho-Heineken, the daughter of the late 
Mr. A.H. Heineken, and who also is an executive director of 
Heineken Holding N.V.), Mr. Das (who is the Chairman of 
the Board of Directors of Heineken Holding N.V.), 
Mr. Fernández Carbajal (who is a non-executive director of 
Heineken Holding N.V. and  a representative of FEMSA) 
and Camacho Beltrán (who also is a representative of 
FEMSA). However, the Supervisory Board has ascertained 
that Mr. de Carvalho, Mr. Das, Mr. Fernández Carbajal and 
Mr. Camacho Beltrán in fact act critically and independently.

Remuneration
The AGM determines the remuneration of the members 
of the Supervisory Board. Details of the remuneration can 
be found in Note 13.3 to the Financial Statements.

Meetings and activities of the Supervisory Board
During 2022, the Supervisory Board held eight meetings 
with the Executive Board. Most meetings were held 
in person. 

The agenda for the Supervisory Board regularly included 
topics such as the Company’s strategy aimed at long-term 
value creation as well as the manner in which the Executive 
Board implements the Company’s strategy. Other topics 
discussed were the Company’s culture, the Company’s 
financial position, the business and financial performance, 
acquisitions, large investment proposals, the annual budget 
and plan, management changes and the internal risk 
management and control system. 

During the year, several representatives of senior 
management and the Executive Team were invited to give 
presentations to the Supervisory Board.

The external auditor attended the meeting in which the 
annual results were discussed. 

The Supervisory Board had a two-day meeting in 
Amsterdam, the Netherlands,  with the Executive Team to 
discuss the Company’s strategic priorities. 

The Supervisory Board also visited Milan, Italy, where the 
Management Team of Heineken Italy, the Managing 
Directors of Serbia and of Switzerland and various other 
senior managers presented an update on business 
performance and the organisational risks and opportunities. 
In addition, a market visit to customers and consumers 
provided insights in the local commercial environment.

To ensure permanent education, the Supervisory Board is 
provided with regular deep dives on strategic topics of the 
Company, both in the meetings of the Supervisory Board 
and in the meetings of the committees.

In 2022, the following deep dives were conducted:

– The EverGreen 2025 strategy. 
– The impact of COVID-19 and related measures, 

amongst others, to ensure the health and safety of 
employees and pro-actively take business measures and 
mitigations.

– The impact of the war in Ukraine on people, the 
organisation and the business. Various meetings  
focused on the situation, the actions and the future 
of the Company in Russia.

– The Global People strategy, including succession 
planning, the inclusion and diversity strategy and talent 
management. This also included a reflection on the 
purpose, values and behaviours of the Company.

– Various business development related projects.
– An update of the operationalisation and progress made 

in the execution of the Brew a Better World 
strategy 2030. 

– The  strategy to design a competitive and sustainable 
supply chain for Europe.

– The strategy of Global Procurement.
– The strategy of Global Commerce, including the global 

sponsorship strategy.
– Digital & Technology, with additional attention placed 

on cybersecurity.
– An online education in the area of sustainability. 

Regular Executive Sessions were held without the 
Executive Board being present. The purpose of these 
sessions was to evaluate the Supervisory Board meetings 
and, where relevant, further reflect on particular subjects 
discussed at the meetings. 

One Executive Session was dedicated to the evaluation of 
the Supervisory Board relating to the performance, 
working methods, procedures and functioning of the 
Supervisory Board, its committees and its individual 
members as well as the functioning of the Executive Board 
and its individual members. 

The evaluations were conducted on the basis of individual 
interviews of the Supervisory Board members with the 
Chairman. The conversations covered topics such as the 
composition and expertise of the Supervisory Board, 
access to information, frequency and quality of the 
meetings, leadership developments, quality and timeliness 
of the meeting materials, and the nature of the topics 
discussed during meetings. 

The outcome of the evaluations showed that the 
Supervisory Board members indicated that the Board 
continues to be a diverse and well-functioning team.         
The Supervisory Board reflected on the skills and expertise 
of each member and decided to add a dedicated matrix in 
this Annual Report. A number of suggestions were made 
to further strengthen the Supervisory Board going forward. 
A few changes in the set-up of the committees were 
implemented to align the skills and expertise of all 
members to the right committees.

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board met frequently 
with the CEO and kept the Supervisory Board informed.

An induction programme was set up for Mr. Camacho 
Beltrán. As part of the programme, Mr. Camacho Beltrán.  
had meetings with several senior leaders and visited the 
brewery in Zoeterwoude, the Netherlands.

Committees
The Supervisory Board has five Committees: the 
Preparatory Committee, the Audit Committee, the 
Selection & Appointment Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Sustainability & Responsibility 
Committee. The terms of reference for the Committees 
are available on the Company’s website.

Preparatory Committee
Composition: Mr. Huët (Chairman), Mr. de Carvalho,        
Mr. Das and Mr. Fernández Carbajal. The Preparatory 
Committee met six times. 

The Committee prepares decision-making by the 
Supervisory Board on matters not already handled by any 
of the other committees, such as in relation to acquisitions 
and investments. The Chairman of the Executive Board 
also attends the Preparatory Committee meetings.

Composition: Mrs. Helmes (Chairperson), Mr. Huët,           
Mr. Astaburuaga Sanjinés (until 21 April 2022), Mrs. Arnold

Audit Committee met four times. 

The members collectively have the experience and 
financial expertise to supervise the Executive Board in its 
activities in relation to the publication of Financial 
Statements and operation of the internal risk 
management and control systems, including the risk 
profile of the Company.

The Executive Board attended all meetings, and so did the 
external auditor, the Executive Director Global Audit, as 
well as the Senior Director Global Accounting and 
Risk Management. 

The Executive Director Global Audit has direct access to 
the Audit Committee, primarily through its Chairperson. 
During the year, the Audit Committee met once with the 
external auditors and once with the Executive Director 
Global Audit, in both instances without management 
being present. In addition, the Chairperson of the Audit 
Committee and the Executive Director Global Audit held 
regular update meetings during the year.

The Committee supervises the activities of the Executive 
Board with respect to the publication of financial 
information. The Committee reviews, in the presence of 
the Executive Board and the external auditor, the 
appropriateness of the half year reporting and the annual 
financial statements, focusing on:

– The decisions made on the selection and application of 
accounting policies.

– The reliability and completeness of disclosures.
– Compliance with financial, non-financial and other 

reporting requirements.
– Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions 

used in preparing the reports in respect of, among 
others, accounting for acquisitions and divestments,

various key developments two ad hoc Supervisory Board meetings were convened in 2022 (two out of eight). These 
meetings could not be attended by all members due to prior commitments or other constraints. In case of absence, 
members are fully informed in advance, enabling them to provide input for the meeting, and they are also updated on 
the meeting outcome.

The table below provides an overview of the attendance record of the individual members of the Supervisory Board. 
Attendance is expressed as a number of meetings attended out of the number eligible to attend.

Executive Board composition and remuneration
Composition
Best practice provision 2.2.1 of the Code recommends that an Executive Board member is appointed for a period of four 
years and that a member may be reappointed for a term of not more than four years at a time. 

In compliance with this best practice provision, the Supervisory Board has drawn up a rotation schedule to avoid, as much 
as possible, a situation in which Executive Board members retire at the same time. 

Mr. Dolf van den Brink was appointed for a period of four years during the AGM in 2020 as Chairman and CEO of the 
Executive Board. Mr. Harold van den Broek was appointed for a period of four years during the AGM in 2021 as CFO and 
member of the Executive Board.

Remuneration
The AGM approved the current remuneration policy for the Executive Board in 2022.  

Appreciation
The Supervisory Board wishes to express its gratitude to the members of the Executive Board and all HEINEKEN 
employees for their hard work and dedication in 2022.

To the Shareholders



Annual statement from the Remuneration Committee Chair
Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you the HEINEKEN remuneration report for the year 2022, which includes our current 
remuneration policies for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board and describes how the policies have been put 
into practice during 2022. 

HEINEKEN’s remuneration policy continues to reflect our long-standing remuneration principles of supporting the 
business strategy, paying for performance, and paying competitively and fairly. The remuneration policy and underlying 
principles support our long-term sustainable business growth in the widely diverse markets in which we operate. In 
addition, the perspective and input of internal and external stakeholders as well as public opinion have been taken into 
consideration in establishing and implementing the remuneration policy.

Looking to 2022
Linking pay to ESG performance
In 2022, we modified our Executive Board remuneration policy to introduce ESG-related performance measures in the long-
term incentive plan, linking the Executive Board’s long-term remuneration with HEINEKEN’s Sustainability & Responsibility 
strategy. The revised policy was submitted to the April 2022 AGM and was adopted with 97.5% of the votes. 

Three “Brew a Better World” commitments were selected to be included as long-term incentives ESG performance measures 
with equal weights: carbon emissions reduction, water efficiency and percentage of women at senior manager level. 

Increased level of transparency
The 2021 remuneration report was submitted for an advisory vote to the April 2022 AGM and was approved with 79.5% 
of the votes. From the shareholder engagement in 2022, we noted the request for an increased level of transparency 
around performance conditions for the short-term and long-term incentive plans.

We have acted on this feedback and in this 2022 remuneration report we have added ex-post disclosure of the performance 
targets and intervals as well as the actual achievements for each of the performance measures in our Short-term and Long-
term incentives. Additionally, we have added ex-ante disclosure of the performance targets and intervals for the ESG-related 
performance measures in our 2022-2024 Long-term incentive plan. We believe this decision reflects HEINEKEN’s belief in 
transparent business practices and our commitment to an ongoing, constructive dialogue with our stakeholders.

Executive Board Remuneration outcomes
In the beginning of the year, the Supervisory Board  reviewed the Executive Board’s actual base salary and short-term 
and long-term variable remuneration versus the labour market peer group median. Based on that assessment, the 
Supervisory Board concluded that the Executive Board members would not receive a salary increase in 2022.

As the year progressed, we continued building on our strengths and delivered strong performance against our growth, 
profitability, and strategic targets in a challenging business environment. Within this context, the Supervisory Board 
concluded that the formulaic performance outcomes for the 2022 short-term incentives of 168%, as well as the 
performance vesting of the 2020-2022 long-term incentive award of 186%, are fair and reflective of the Executive Board’s 
true performance and leadership navigating this volatile environment while building a brighter future for HEINEKEN. 

Supervisory Board Remuneration 
The Supervisory Board remuneration policy remained unchanged in 2022.

Looking to 2023
We are not proposing any policy changes for the year ahead. 

We thank shareholders for their continued support, and I look forward to presenting this remuneration report at the 
2023 AGM.

Part I – Executive Board remuneration policy 
Remuneration principles 
The Executive Board remuneration policy is designed to meet four key principles:

– Support the business strategy 
We align our remuneration policy with business strategies focused on creating long-term sustainable growth and 
shareholder value, while maintaining a tight focus on short-term financial results.

– Pay for performance 
We set clear and measurable targets for our short-term and long-term incentive policies, and we pay higher 
remuneration when targets are exceeded and lower remuneration when targets are not met.

– Pay competitively 
We set target remuneration to be competitive with other relevant multinational corporations of similar size 
and complexity.

– Pay fairly 
We set target remuneration to be internally consistent and fair; we regularly review internal pay relativities between 
the Executive Board and the wider employee population and aim to achieve consistency and alignment in, amongst 
others, remuneration changes, salary structures and the design of variable compensation where possible. 

Summary overview of remuneration elements

Remuneration Report 2022



Labour market peer group 
A global labour market peer group was adopted by the AGM in 2011, and subsequently adjusted in 2012 and 2017. The 
median target remuneration of this peer group is a reference point for the target remuneration of the CEO and CFO. 
Each year, the Remuneration Committee validates the peer group to ensure relevance, and recommends adjustments to 
the Supervisory Board if needed. For 2022 (and 2021), the peer group consisted of the following companies:

Anheuser-Busch InBev (BE) Diageo (UK) Nestlé (CH)

Carlsberg (DK) Henkel (DE) Pepsico (US)

Coca-Cola (US) Kimberly-Clark (US) Pernod Ricard (FR)

Colgate-Palmolive (US) Mondelēz International (US) Unilever (NL)

Danone (FR) L’Oréal (FR)

Base salary
Every year, peer group and base salary levels are reviewed, and the Remuneration Committee may propose adjustments 
to the Supervisory Board. HEINEKEN aims to compensate at median on target remuneration of the peer group. However, 
when changes in base salary are considered, broader factors are taken into account, including but not limited to the 
individual and business performance and the internal pay relativities. 

Short-term incentive
The Short-term incentive (STI) is designed to drive and reward the achievements of HEINEKEN’s annual performance 
targets. Through its payout in both cash and investment shares it also drives and rewards sound business decisions for 
HEINEKEN’s long-term health while aligning Executive Board and shareholder interests at the same time. The target STI 
opportunities for 2022 are 140% of base salary for the CEO and 100% of base salary for the CFO. These percentage 
opportunities are well aligned with the labour market peer group medians. 

The STI opportunities are for a weighted 75% based on financial and operational measures for Heineken N.V., and for a 
weighted 25% on individual leadership measures. At the beginning of each year, the Supervisory Board establishes the 
performance measures, their relative weights and corresponding targets based on HEINEKEN’s business priorities for that 
year. The Supervisory Board ensures that a balanced mix of financial, operational and individual performance measures 
is selected, which incentivises executives to achieve our annual business strategy and the growth of shareholder value.

The financial and operational measures and their relative weights are reported in the Remuneration Report upfront (ex-
ante); the numerical performance targets are only disclosed after the close of the financial year (ex-post) as they are 
considered to be commercially sensitive. In the first weeks of the following year, the Supervisory Board reviews the 
Company and individual performance against the pre-set targets, and approves the STI payout levels based on the 
performance achieved. The performance on the financial measures will be reported on actual measure achievement 
results (cf. Part III). 

The STI payout for 2022 is subject to four performance measures: Organic Net Revenue Growth (weight: 35%), Organic 
Operating Profit beia Growth (weight: 15%), Free Operating Cash Flow (weight: 25%) and Individual Leadership 
measures (weight: 25%). The Individual leadership measures are a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures focused 
on the implementation of HEINEKEN’s strategy. The STI payout for 2023 will be subject to four performance measures: 
Organic Net Revenue Growth (weight: 35%), Organic Operating Profit beia Growth (weight: 15%), Free Operating Cash 
Flow (weight: 25%) and Individual Leadership measures (weight: 25%). The individual leadership objectives will be tied to 
achievement of our EverGreen strategy. The detailed individual leadership objectives will be included in the annual report 
as of 2023. 

For each performance measure, a threshold, target and maximum performance level is set with the following STI payout, 
as a percentage of target payout:

Threshold performance
50% of target payout

Target performance
100% of target payout

Maximum performance
200% of target payout.

For each measure, payout in between these performance levels is on a straight-line basis; below threshold performance 
the payout is zero, whereas beyond maximum performance it is capped at 200% of payout at target. 

In line with policy, 25% of the STI payout is paid out in shares, referred to as investment shares. At their discretion, the 
Executive Board members have the opportunity to indicate before the end of the performance year whether they wish to 
receive up to another 25% of their STI payout in additional investment shares. All investment shares thus received are 
then blocked and cannot be sold under any circumstance, including resignation, for five calendar years to link the value of 
the investment shares to long-term Company performance. Withholding tax on the investment shares and on the cash 
part of the STI payout is settled with the cash part at the time of payout. After the blocking period is completed after five 
calendar years, the Company will match the investment shares 1:1 in the first weeks of the following year, i.e. one 
matching share is granted for each investment share. As from then, there are no holding requirements on these 
investment shares anymore, and there are no holding requirements on the resulting matching shares that remain after 
withholding tax on these shares.

According to plan rules, matching entitlements will be forfeited in case of dismissal by the Company for an urgent reason 
within the meaning of the law (‘dringende reden’), or in case of dismissal for cause (‘gegronde reden’), whereby the cause 
for dismissal concerns unsatisfactory functioning of the Executive Board member. With this ‘deferral-and-matching’ 
proposition a significant share ownership by the Executive Board is ensured, creating an increased alignment with the 
interests of shareholders. The Supervisory Board has the power to revise the amount of the STI payout to an appropriate 
amount if the STI payout that would have been payable in accordance with the agreed payment schedule would be 
unacceptable according to standards of reasonableness and fairness. The Supervisory Board is entitled to claw back all or 
part of the STI payout (in cash, investment shares or matching shares) insofar as it has been made on the basis of 
incorrect information about achieving the performance conditions.

Long-term incentive
The Long-term incentive (LTI) is designed to drive and reward sound business decisions for HEINEKEN’s long-term health, 
and to align the Executive Board with shareholder interests by linking rewards to HEINEKEN’s share price performance. 
The target LTI opportunities for 2022 are 150% of base salary for the CEO and 125% of base salary for the CFO.

Each year, a target number of performance shares is conditionally granted based on the aforementioned target LTI 
opportunity percentage of that year, the base salary of that year, and the closing share price of 31 December of the 
preceding year.

HEINEKEN’s strong and long-standing ambition regarding Sustainability & Responsibility is clearly reflected in our 
EverGreen strategy and related Brew a Better World (“BaBW”) commitments. At the 2022 AGM, the Supervisory Board 
proposed to introduce a set of ESG-related performance measures to the Long-term incentive plan, directly linking the 
Executive Board’s long-term remuneration with HEINEKEN’s Sustainability & Responsibility strategy. Three BaBW 
commitments were selected to be included as  performance measures: carbon emissions reduction, water efficiency, and 
percentage of women at senior manager level. The proposal to include these measures in place of the Operating Profit 
performance measure in the Long-term incentive plan was adopted with 97.49% of the votes.

The vesting of the performance shares is contingent on HEINEKEN’s performance over a period of three years on a list of 
performance measures below. 

Organic Net Revenue Growth (25%)
To drive top line growth

Earnings Per Share (EPS) beia Growth (25%)
To drive overall long-term Company performance

Free Operating Cash Flow (25%)
To drive focus on cash

ESG measures (25%):
To drive the sustainability & responsibility agenda (see below table)

The three financial performance measures and the combined ESG -related measures have equal weight to minimise the 
risk that participants over-emphasise one performance measure to the detriment of others. At the beginning of each 
performance period, the Supervisory Board establishes the corresponding numerical targets for these performance 
measures based on HEINEKEN’s business priorities. The numerical targets for the three financial performance measures 
are not disclosed upfront as they are considered to be commercially sensitive. The targets for the ESG-related 
performance measures for the 2022-2024 Long-term incentive are as follows:

ESG Measures Weight Threshold Target1 Maximum

Carbon emissions reduction in production % vs 2018 baseline  8.33 %  -28.0 %  -33.0 %  -38.0 %

Water efficiency improvement % vs 2018 baseline  8.33 %  -9.0 %  -12.0 %  -15.0 %

Women at senior manager level % in 2024  8.33 %  27.0 %  28.5 %  30.0 %

1 Target to have been achieved at the end of the 2022-2024 performance period.

In the first weeks following the end of the performance period, the Supervisory Board reviews the Company’s 
performance against the pre-determined targets, and approves the LTI vesting based on the performance achieved. 
The performance on both the financial and ESG-related measures will be reported on actual measure achievement 
results (cf. Part III). 

For each performance measure, a threshold, target and maximum performance level is set with the following 
performance share vesting schedule:
Threshold performance
50% of performance shares vests

Target performance
100% of performance shares vests

Maximum performance
200% of performance shares vests.

For each measure, vesting in between these performance levels is on a straight-line basis; below threshold performance 
the vesting is zero, whereas beyond maximum performance it is capped at 200% of vesting at target.

The Supervisory Board has the power to revise the amount of performance shares that will vest to an appropriate 
number if the number of performance shares that would have vested under the agreed vesting schedule would be 
unacceptable according to standards of reasonableness and fairness. The Supervisory Board is entitled to claw back all or 
part of the shares transferred to the Executive Board members upon vesting (or the value thereof) insofar as vesting 
occurred on the basis of incorrect information about achieving the performance conditions. The vested performance 
shares that remain after withholding tax are subject to an additional holding restriction of two years, to arrive at a five-
year holding restriction after the date of the conditional performance grant.

Pay mix
The mix between fixed pay and variable pay for various levels of performance is illustrated below. In these charts, fixed 
pay refers to base salary only, excluding pensions and other emoluments, and variable pay consists of the 
aforementioned Short-term and Long-term incentive opportunities, including the ‘deferral-and-matching’ proposition. 
Share price movements during performance and holding periods are hereby not included since these are unknown in the 
context of target remuneration.

Pensions
The members of the Executive Board participate in a defined-contribution Capital Creation Plan. As of 2015, following 
pension reforms in the Netherlands, new members of the Executive Board receive the same contribution as new 
executives under Dutch employment contract below the Executive Board, which is currently 18% of base salary. This 
applies to our current CEO and CFO. Both Executive Board members have chosen to receive their full pension 
contributions as taxable income, as opposed to applying tax deferral to the maximum amount possible.

Benefits
The members of the Executive Board are eligible to receive benefits in line with HEINEKEN’s most senior employees. The 
benefits include, but are not limited to, company car, fuel and health insurance. Other benefits could be offered in 
circumstances where this allows executives to successfully fulfil the responsibilities of their role. For example in case of a 
relocation the appropriate relocation support is provided. The levels of the benefits will be competitive in the relevant 
local market and could be changed year on year.

Loans
HEINEKEN does not provide loans to the members of the Executive Board.

Term of appointment
New members of the Executive Board are appointed by the AGM for the duration of 4 years, subject to reappointment 
by the AGM.

Notice period 
The service agreement may either be terminated by the member of the Executive Board or by the Company. The notice 
period will not be more than 12 months for both the Company and the individual.

Compensation rights on termination of employment/service agreement
If the Company gives notice of termination of the employment agreement of a member of the Executive Board for a 
reason which is not an urgent reason (‘dringende reden’) within the meaning of the law, or decides not to extend the 
service agreement upon its expiry, or if the AGM does not re-appoint them as member of the Executive Board for a 
subsequent term, the Company shall pay an amount equal to one year of base salary. 

The treatment of incentive awards will depend on the circumstances of departure. A proposal will be made by the 
Remuneration Committee to be pursued by the Supervisory Board. In case of dismissal by the Company for an urgent 
reason within the meaning of the law (‘dringende reden’), or in case of dismissal for cause (‘gegronde reden’) whereby 
the cause for dismissal concerns unsatisfactory functioning of the Executive Board member, the unvested incentive 
awards will be forfeited.

Derogation clause
The Supervisory Board, upon recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, may temporarily deviate from any 
sections of the Policy based on its discretion in the circumstances described below:

– Upon change of the Executive Board member in accordance with the new hire policy,
– In any other circumstance where the deviation may be required to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of 

the Company as a whole or to assure its viability.

New hire policy
Our recruitment policy is to offer a compensation package that allows HEINEKEN to attract, retain and motivate the 
individual with the right skills for the required role. When determining remuneration for an Executive Board member, the 
Supervisory Board will, at the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, consider the role’s requirements, 
business needs, the individual’s skills and experience and the relevant external talent market.

Where an individual is recruited externally for an Executive Board member position, the remuneration package in their 
prior role will be taken into account. The Supervisory Board will seek to align the new member’s remuneration package 
with the Executive Board Remuneration Policy. The Company may offer compensation to buy out awards or other lost 
compensation which the candidate held prior to joining HEINEKEN, but which lapsed upon leaving their previous 
employer. The rationale of any such award will be disclosed in the Remuneration Report.

Where an individual is appointed to the Executive Board through internal promotion or following a corporate transaction 
(e.g. an acquisition), the Board retains the ability to honour any legally binding legacy arrangements agreed prior to 
the appointment.

Remuneration Governance
The Remuneration Committee makes the proposal to the Supervisory Board for the Remuneration Policy to be pursued, 
and makes a proposal for the remuneration of the individual members of the Executive Board for adoption by the 
Supervisory Board. In accordance with Dutch Law, the remuneration policy will be submitted for approval to the AGM at 
least every four years, or in case of material amendments to the policy. The Executive Board members shall not 
participate in the decision making regarding their own remuneration to avoid conflict of interest.

Part II – Supervisory Board remuneration policy  
Remuneration principles 
The Supervisory Board remuneration policy is designed to attract and retain high-class and diverse profiles with relevant 
skills and experience that are required to perform the Supervisory Board’s duties and it ensures appropriate corporate 
governance by meeting the following key principles:

– Support the business strategy 
We align our remuneration policy with business strategies focused on creating long-term sustainable growth and 
shareholder value. 

– Pay for purpose
We align our remuneration policy to promote the independence and objectivity of our Supervisory Board members, 
which is a key element to best serve the long-term interest of the company. 

– Pay competitively
We set remuneration levels to be competitive with other relevant multinational corporations of similar size 
and complexity.

While establishing and implementing the policy, the perspective and input of internal and external stakeholders and the 
external environment in which HEINEKEN operates, are taken into consideration. HEINEKEN is also committed to an 
ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks the views of significant shareholders before any material changes to 
remuneration arrangements are put forward for approval.

Summary overview of remuneration elements
The Supervisory Board remuneration policy is simple and transparent in design, and consists of the following key elements:

Element Purpose Description

Base Board Fees – Supervisory Board members receive a 
fixed cash compensation for their 
services.

– In line with the Dutch Corporate 
Governance code, no variable pay and / 
or equity awards are offered.

– In order to provide a fee level that is 
competitive with other companies 
comparable to HEINEKEN, reviews are 
conducted on a regular basis.

– The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
to review the compensation levels on a 
regular basis and to bring forward proposals 
(if any) to the Supervisory Board. Proposals 
are submitted to the Annual General Meeting 
for approval.

– This review is done through a benchmark 
assessment against a pan-European peer 
group consisting of companies that are of 
comparable size to HEINEKEN.

Committee Fees – Supervisory Board members are 
compensated for additional 
responsibilities such as Committee 
membership.

– In order to provide a fee level that is 
competitive with other companies 
comparable to HEINEKEN, reviews are 
conducted on a regular basis.

– Members are eligible to receive additional 
fees in respect of serving as a Chairman or 
Member of a Committee.

– Fee levels between Committees can differ if 
this is deemed appropriate depending on the 
time commitment and responsibilities 
associated with the Committee membership.

– Fees are additive; if a Board member serves in 
multiple Committees, the compensation will 
consist of the Board membership fee and the 
sum of the corresponding Committee fees.

Allowances and 
Benefits

– Supervisory Board members are 
reimbursed and compensated for 
additional efforts that enable them to 
exercise their role.

– Members receive reimbursement of travel 
expenses and are compensated for 
intercontinental travel required to exercise

ad (1) – Base salary
These base salaries have been paid to the members of the Executive Board for 2022.. 

ad (2) – 2022 Short-term incentive 
The 2022 Short-term incentive (STI) relates to the performance year 2022, and becomes payable in 2023. The STI for 
2022 was subject to four performance measures: Organic Net Revenue Growth (weight: 35%), Organic Operating Profit 
beia Growth (weight: 15%), Free Operating Cash Flow (weight: 25%) and Individual leadership measures (weight: 25%). 
The following table shows the performance targets and intervals, as well as the actuals achievements as determined by 
the Supervisory Board for each of these measures:

Performance Measures Weight Threshold Target Maximum Achievement Payout

Organic Net Revenue Growth (%)  35 %  10.0 %  15.0 %  20.0 %  21.2 %  200 %

Operating Profit beia Growth (%)  15 %  10.0 %  20.0 %  30.0 %  24.0 %  140 %

Free Operating Cash Flow (€ m)  25 % 2,000 2,150 2,500 2,409  174 %

Individual leadership measures  25 % – – – –  134 %

Total  100 %  168 %

The specific objectives underlying the Individual leadership measures will be disclosed in the annual report as of 2023.

The resulting STI payout for 2022 is 168% of payout at target level for both members of the Executive Board. In line with 
policy, 25% of the STI payout is paid out in investment shares against the closing share price of 15 February 2022, the 
publication date of these financial statements. In addition, the Executive Board members have had the opportunity to 
indicate before the end of the 2022 performance year whether they wished to receive up to another 25% of their STI 
payout in additional investment shares; for 2022 the Executive Board members elected to receive an additional 25% 
investment shares beyond the mandatory 25% share investment. The investment shares are restricted for sale for five 
calendar years, after which they are matched 1:1 by matching shares. Revision and clawback provisions apply to this 
Short-term incentive, including the related matching share entitlement. The table below provides an overview of the 
investment shares at year-end that were awarded as part of STI payouts in the past, and that have remained blocked 
and await 1:1 matching by the Company, provided the conditions thereto are met. Only when the holding period of the 
investment shares has been completed, will the matching share entitlements be converted into shares and transferred to 
the recipient.

ad (3) – 2020-2022 Long-term incentive: number of performance shares vesting
The 2020-2022 Long-term incentive (LTI) relates to the performance period 2020-2022 and vests shortly after 15 
February 20223 the publication date of these financial statements. The vesting of the LTI award for performance period 
2020-2022 is subject to Heineken N.V. performance on four financial measures with equal weight. The following table 
shows the performance targets and intervals, as well as the actuals achievements as determined by the Supervisory 
Board for each of these measures:

Performance Measures Weight Threshold Target Maximum Achievement Vesting

Organic Net Revenue Growth (%)  25 %  2.0 %  4.0 %  6.0 %  7.2 %  200 %

Organic Operating Profit beia Growth (%)  25 %  2.5 %  4.5 %  6.5 %  10.7 %  200 %

EPS beia Growth (%)  25 %  2.0 %  3.5 %  5.5 %  20.2 %  200 %

Free Operating Cash Flow (€ m)  25 % 5,000 6,000 7,000 6,436  144 %

Total  100 %  186 %

As a result, the vesting of the LTI grant for performance period 2020-2022 will be equal to 186% of the vesting at target 
level. For the CEO, this performance implies that 22,588 shares will vest shortly after 15 February 2023, as a result of the 
12,144 conditional performance shares granted to him in 2020 as  CEO and Member of the Executive Board in 2020. 
The resulting share award are defined in before-tax terms (i.e. before deduction of withholding tax due). Revision and 
clawback provisions apply to this award.

The value of the share awards is based on the ‘Number of shares vesting on the vesting date’ against the share price as 
of 31 December 2022 of €87.88.

ad (10) – Other emoluments
The amounts mainly involve car benefits-in-kind.

ad (11) – Total 
The addition of all remuneration elements as described in points (1) to (10).

Actual remuneration paid to former members of the Executive Board
Mr. Van Boxmeer stepped down as CEO and Chairman of the Board of Heineken on 1 June 2020. Mrs. Debroux
stepped down as CFO and member of the Executive Board of Heineken on 30 April 2021. In line with contractual 
obligations, Mr. Van Boxmeer and Mrs. Debroux’s existing long-term incentive awards (2020-2022  long-term incentives), 
are subject to vesting in accordance with the predetermined performance conditions as well as subject to a holding 
period of two years after vesting. Furthermore, their existing investment shares/share matching entitlements are subject 
to the regular holding period of 5 years. 

The vesting of the LTI grant for performance period 2020-2022 will be equal to 186% of the vesting at target level, this 
implies that 36,743 shares will vest shortly after 15 February 2023, as a result of the 19,754 conditional performance 
shares granted to Mr. Van Boxmeer in 2020. For Mrs. Debroux,  this implies that 20,821 shares will vest shortly after 15 
February 2023, as a result of the 11,194 conditional performance shares granted to Mrs. Debroux in 2020. Furthermore, 
as a result of the investment in shares of part of the STI payout for performance year 2017, below you will find the 
number of matching share entitlements that vested after year-end 2022.

Pay Ratio 
In the Netherlands a revised corporate governance code came into effect as of financial year 2017. This revised code 
requires Dutch stock-listed companies to consider pay ratios between Executive Board members and other employees 
within the Company when formulating the remuneration policy for the Executive Board, and to disclose these ratios in 
the Remuneration Report every year. 

As is commonly understood, such ratios are specific to the company’s industry, geographical footprint and organisational 
model. HEINEKEN has a truly wide geographical footprint, with the majority of its business and employees in emerging 
markets with widely different pay levels and structures compared to the Netherlands and Europe. In addition, HEINEKEN 
has a large number of breweries and in-house sales forces worldwide, which adds to the variety of pay within the Company. 
For other companies in other industries this will be different. Finally, pay ratios can also be quite volatile over time, as they 
may vary with exchange rate movements and can be very dependent on the Company’s annual performance since that 
performance impacts the remuneration of the Executive Board much more than of all other employees. 

The 2022 pay ratios for HEINEKEN are 198 for the CEO and 128 for the CFO. These ratios are obtained by dividing the 
2022 total remuneration for the CEO and CFO by the 2022 average total remuneration of all other employees 
worldwide. The common denominator of these ratios is derived from note 6.4 on page 83 by dividing the 2022 total 
personnel expense (after subtracting the expense for the Executive Board and external contractors), by the reported FTE 
(minus two), leading to an amount of 45,276 versus 40,828 in 2021. The total remuneration for the CEO and CFO is 
retrieved from note 13.3 on page 116. The Executive Board’s remuneration is obtained from note 13.3 to follow IFRS 
standards and ensure comparability with personnel expenses.

The Executive Board’s average pay ratio increased by ca. 9% compared to 2021 results from an increase  in the pay ratio 
of the CFO over 2021 by ca. 23%. This is due to the reason that CFO was appointed as per June 1, 2021. The 
remuneration included for 2021 pay ratio calculation is for 7 months in 2021.

Part V. Adjustments to the remuneration policy for 2023
During 2022 the Supervisory Board reviewed the Executive Board’s remuneration policy and after engaging with shareholders and other stakeholders decided not to submit any changes for approval to the 2023 AGM. The Supervisory Board will 
continue to look for opportunities to increase transparency in the remuneration report in areas where greater transparency will not pose risks to the organization. Consequently, and as previously mentioned, the detailed individual leadership 
objectives included in the short-term incentive will be disclosed in the annual report as of 2023.

Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity



1.    Reporting entity 
Heineken N.V. (the ‘Company’) is a public company domiciled in the Netherlands, with its head office in Amsterdam. The 
address of the Company’s registered office is Tweede Weteringplantsoen 21, 1017 ZD, Amsterdam. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Company as at 31 December 2022 comprise the Company, its subsidiaries (together referred to 
as ‘HEINEKEN’) and HEINEKEN’s interests in joint ventures and associates. The Company is registered in the Trade Register 
of Amsterdam No. 33011433. HEINEKEN is primarily involved in the brewing and selling of beer and cider. Led by the 
Heineken® brand, HEINEKEN has a range of more than 300 international, regional, local and speciality beers and ciders.

2.    Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements are: 

– Prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union 
(EU) and comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. All 
standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) effective year-end 2022 have been adopted by the EU. 
Consequently, the accounting policies applied by the Company also fully comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB  

– Prepared by the Executive Board of the Company and authorised for issue on 14 February 2023 and will be submitted 
for adoption to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 20 April 2023 

– Prepared on the historical cost basis unless otherwise indicated
– Prepared on a going concern basis
– Presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency  
– Rounded to the nearest million unless stated otherwise  

3.    Significant events in the period and accounting estimates and judgements 
(a) Significant events in the current reporting period
Trading conditions remained challenging throughout 2022 and were marked by increased input cost inflation and supply 
chain disruptions. Despite continued volatility and challenges across many markets, HEINEKEN reported a net profit of 
€2,682 million for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: €3,324 million).

On 28 March 2022, HEINEKEN announced its decision to leave Russia. The Russian business is classified as a disposal 
group held for sale as at 31 December 2022. An impairment loss of €88 million was recognised in relation to the write 
down of the Russia disposal group classified as held for sale. For more information refer to note 10.2 ‘Assets or disposal 
groups classified as held for sale’. 

HEINEKEN applied hyperinflation accounting for its operations in Ethiopia. In 2022, the three-year cumulative inflation in 
Ethiopia exceeded 100% and as a result, hyperinflation accounting was applied for the year ended 31 December 2022. 
For more information refer to note 5(c) ‘Hyperinflation economies’.

During its financial reporting process, HEINEKEN has assessed the impact of its main risks including increased exposure 
on risks related to supply chain continuity, commodity prices and macro-economic environment on its estimates and 
judgements. The impact on financial estimates and judgements is mainly reflected in impairment of financial and non-
financial assets, and other financial instrument disclosures (including credit management). All significant estimates and 
judgements are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (if applicable). Notes containing the most 
significant estimates and judgements are referred to in note 3(c). 

(b) Climate change
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, HEINEKEN has considered climate change, including climate change 
scenarios and the Brew a Better World (BaBW) goals, on the estimates and judgements used in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. 

The following impacts were assessed in the consolidated financial statements:

– The impact of climate change on the residual values and useful lives of assets were considered in determining the 
carrying value of non-current assets (refer to note 8.1 and 8.2). 

– The impact of climate change was considered in relation to the recognition and measurement of provisions and 
contingencies (refer to note 9.2 and 9.3). 

– The impact of climate change was considered in relation to indications of impairment and the forecast of cash flows used 
in the impairment assessments of non-current assets including goodwill (refer to note 8.1 and 8.2).   

For the year ended 31 December 2022, no material impact on financial reporting judgement and estimates arising from 
climate change were identified, as a result the valuations of assets or liabilities have not been significantly impacted by 
climate change risks.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



(c) Significant accounting estimates and judgement
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and judgements that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.  

The application of accounting policies requires judgements that impact the amounts recognised. Additionally, amounts 
recognised are based on factors that are by default associated with uncertainty. Actual results may therefore differ from 
estimates. Where applicable, the estimates and judgements are described per note within the consolidated 
financial statements.  

The following notes contain the most significant estimates and judgements:

4.    Changes in accounting policies 
(a) Changed accounting policies in 2022  
No new standards or amendments to existing standards, effective in 2022, had a significant impact on HEINEKEN's 
consolidated financial statements.

(b) Upcoming changes in accounting policies for 2023 
No new standards or amendments to existing standards, effective in 2023, will have a significant impact on HEINEKEN 's 
consolidated financial statements.  

5.    General accounting policies 
General 
The accounting policies described in these consolidated financial statements have been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements.

(a) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared as a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and 
its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by HEINEKEN. HEINEKEN controls an entity when it has power over the 
investee, is exposed or has the right to variable returns from its involvement with that entity and can affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. Control is generally obtained by ownership of more than 50% of the voting rights.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by HEINEKEN. 

On consolidation, intra-HEINEKEN balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and 
expenses arising from intra-HEINEKEN transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with 
associates and joint ventures (refer to note 10.3) are eliminated against the investment to the extent of HEINEKEN’s 
interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that 
there is no evidence of impairment. 

(b) Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of HEINEKEN entities using the 
exchange rates at the transaction date, except for HEINEKEN entities in hyperinflationary economies, refer to note 5(c). 
Receivables, payables and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated to the 
functional currency using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The resulting foreign currency differences are 
recognised in the income statement, except for foreign currency differences arising on re-translation of Fair Value 
through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) investments and financial liabilities designated as a hedge of a net 
investment, which is recognised in other comprehensive income. 

Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are re-translated 
to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a 
foreign currency that are measured at cost are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the 
transaction date.  

Foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, and of 
intercompany loans with a permanent nature (quasi-equity) are translated to Euro at the exchange rates at the reporting 
date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Euro at the exchange rates that approximates the 
exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions, except for foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies. 

Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and are presented within equity in the 
translation reserve. However, if the operation is not a wholly-owned subsidiary, the relevant proportionate share of the 
translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests. The cumulative amount in the translation reserve is 
(either fully or partly) reclassified to the income statement upon disposal (either fully or partly) or liquidation.

(c) Hyperinflation economies
To determine the existence of hyperinflation, HEINEKEN assesses the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the 
economic environment of the country, such as the cumulative inflation rate over the previous three years. 

The Ethiopian economy was designated as hyperinflationary for the period ending 31 December 2022. As a result, 
application of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ has been applied to Heineken Ethiopia, whose 
functional currency is the Ethiopian Birr. On the application of IAS 29 a cumulative inflation factor was applied using the 
consumer price index (CPI) in Ethiopia, published by the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia. The movement in the CPI 
for the year ended 31 December 2022 was 34% (2021: 35%). 

 The application of IAS 29 includes the following:

– Adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for the change in purchasing power caused by 
inflation from the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date

– Adjustment of the income statement for inflation during the reporting period
– The income statement is translated at the period-end foreign exchange rate instead of an average rate 
– A net monetary gain/(loss) adjustment, recognised in the income statement, to reflect the impact of inflation and 

exchange rate movement on holding monetary assets and liabilities in local currency

(d) Cash flow statement  
The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method. Assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business 
combination are included in investing activities (net of cash acquired). Dividends paid to shareholders are included in 
financing activities. Dividends received are classified as operating activities, as well as interest paid. 

(e) Offsetting financial instruments 
If HEINEKEN has a legal right to offset financial assets with financial liabilities and if HEINEKEN intends to either to settle 
on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously, financial assets and liabilities are presented in 
the statement of financial position as a net amount.

Reconciliation of segment profit or loss
The table below presents the reconciliation of operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-
related intangibles (operating profit beia) to profit before income tax. 

In millions of € 2022 2021

Operating profit (beia)  4,502  3,414

Share of profit of associates and joint ventures  223  250 

Net finance expenses  (336)  (399) 

Profit before income tax  4,170  4,334 

The 2022 exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles in operating profit amount to
 €219 million, net exceptional expense (2021: €1,069 million, net exceptional benefit). This amount consists of:  

– €333 million (2021: €286 million) of amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles recorded in operating profit.
– €114 million net benefit (2021: €1,355 million net benefit) of exceptional items recorded in operating profit. 

This includes:
– a net reversal of impairments of €132 million, including an impairment reversal of €234 million for Papua New 

Guinea and an impairment of €88 million for Russia (total net impairments in 2021: €108 million)
– net restructuring expenses of €70 million (2021: €32 million)
– €44 million exceptional net benefit recorded as reduction in marketing expense related to tax credits in Brazil 

(2021:€187 million exceptional net benefit recorded in other income related to tax credits in Brazil)
– €44 million exceptional expense recorded relating to hyperinflation accounting adjustment in Ethiopia (2021: nil)
– €52 million of other net exceptional benefit (2021: €1,308 million other exceptional net benefit, including 

€1,270 million gain on previously-held equity interest in UBL)

  Accounting estimates and judgements
Due to the complexity and variety in tax legislation, significant judgement is applied in the assessment of whether excise 
tax expenses are borne by HEINEKEN or collected on behalf of third parties.  

HEINEKEN makes estimates when determining discount accruals in revenue at year-end, specifically for conditional 
discounts. Refer to note 7.3 for more explanation on how discount accruals are estimated. 

  Accounting policies  
Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported consistently with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Board, which is 
considered to be HEINEKEN’s chief operating decision-maker. An operating segment is a component of HEINEKEN that 
engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that 
relate to transactions with any of HEINEKEN’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed 
regularly by the Executive Board to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its 
performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.    

The first four reportable segments as presented in the segmentation tables are HEINEKEN’s business regions. These 
business regions are each managed separately by a Regional President, who reports to the Executive Board, and is 
directly accountable for the functioning of the segment’s results, assets and liabilities. The Head Office operating 
segment falls directly under the responsibility of the Executive Board. The Executive Board reviews the performance of 
the segments based on internal management reports monthly.    

Segment results, assets and liabilities that are reported to the Executive Board include items directly attributable to a 
segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated result items comprise net finance 
expenses and income tax expenses. Unallocated assets mainly comprise deferred tax assets.  

Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets other than goodwill.  

Performance is measured based on operating profit (beia), as included in the internal management reports that are 
reviewed by the Executive Board. Beia stands for 'before exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangibles'. Exceptional items are defined as items of income and expense of such size, nature or incidence, that in the 
view of management their disclosure is relevant to explain the performance of HEINEKEN for the period. Exceptional 
items include, among others, impairments of goodwill and fixed assets (and reversal of impairments), gains and losses 
from acquisitions and disposals, redundancy costs following a restructuring, past service costs and curtailments, 
hyperinflation accounting adjustments, the tax impact on exceptional items and tax rate changes (the one-off impact on 
deferred tax positions).

Operating profit and operating profit (beia) are not financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. Operating 
profit (beia) is used to measure performance as management believes that this measurement is the most relevant in 
evaluating the results of the segments. Beia adjustments are also applied to other metrics. The presentation of these 
financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences 
in the ways the measures are calculated.  

HEINEKEN has multiple distribution models to deliver goods to end customers. There is no reliance on major clients. 
Deliveries to end consumers are country dependent and include deliveries via own wholesalers and pubs, direct to 
customers and via third-party distribution. As such, distribution models are country-specific and diverse across HEINEKEN. 
In addition, these various distribution models are not centrally managed or monitored. Consequently, the Executive 
Board does not allocate resources or assess performance based on business type information. Accordingly, no segment 
information on business type is provided.    

Inter-segment transfers or transactions are determined on an arm’s length basis. As net finance expenses and income tax 
expenses are monitored on a consolidated level (and not on an individual regional basis) and Regional Presidents are not 
accountable for that, net finance expenses and income tax expenses are not provided for the reportable segments.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



Revenue 
The majority of HEINEKEN's revenue is generated by the sale and delivery of products to customers. The product range 
of HEINEKEN mainly consists of beer, soft drinks and cider. Products are mostly own-produced finished goods from 
HEINEKEN's brewing activities, but also contain purchased goods for resale from HEINEKEN's wholesale activities. 
HEINEKEN's customer group can be split between on-trade customers like cafés, bars and restaurants and off-trade 
customers like retailers and wholesalers. Due to HEINEKEN's global footprint, its revenue is exposed to strategic and 
financial risks that differ per region. 

Revenue is recognised when control over products has been transferred and HEINEKEN fulfilled its performance 
obligation to the customer. For the majority of the sales, control is transferred either at delivery of the products or upon 
pickup by the customer from HEINEKEN's premises.  

Revenue is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of returns, discounts, sales taxes and excise taxes 
collected on behalf of third parties.  

Other revenues include rental income from pubs and bars, royalties, income from wholesale activities, pub management 
services and technical services to third parties. Royalties are sales-based and recognised in profit or loss (consolidated 
income statement) on an accrual basis in accordance with the relevant agreement. Rental income, income from 
wholesale activities, pub management services and technical services are recognised in profit or loss when the services 
have been delivered.

Discounts 
HEINEKEN uses different types of discounts depending on the nature of the customer. Some discounts are unconditional, 
like cash discounts, early payment discounts and temporary promotional discounts. Unconditional discounts are 
recognised at the same moment of the related sales transaction.  

HEINEKEN also provides conditional discounts to customers. These contractually agreed conditions include volume and 
promotional rebates. Conditional discounts are recognised based on estimated target realisation. The estimation is 
based on accumulated experience supported by historical and current sales information. A discount accrual is recognised 
at each reporting date for discounts payable to customers based on their expected or actual volume up to that date.  

Other discounts include listing and shelving visibility fees charged by the customer whereby the payments to customers 
are closely related to the volumes sold. HEINEKEN assesses the substance of contracts with customers to determine the 
classification of payments to customers as either discounts or marketing expenses.   

Discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue. Only when these payments to customers relate to a distinct 
service, the amount is classified as operating expense. 

Excise tax expense 
Local tax authorities impose multiple taxes, duties and fees. These include excise on the sale or production of alcoholic 
beverages, environmental taxes on the use of certain raw materials or packaging materials, or the energy consumption in 
the production process. Excise duties are common in the beverage industry but levied differently amongst the countries 
HEINEKEN operates in. HEINEKEN performs a country by country analysis to assess whether the excise duty is sales-
related or effectively a production tax. In most countries, excise duties are effectively a production tax as excise duties 
become payable when goods are moved from bonded warehouses and are not based on the sales value. In these 
countries, increases in excise duties are not always (fully) passed on to customers and HEINEKEN cannot, or can only 
partly, reclaim the excise duty in the case products are eventually not sold to customers. Excise tax is borne by HEINEKEN 
for these countries and shown as expenses. Only for those countries where excise is levied at the moment of the sales 
transaction and excise is based on the sales value, the excise duties are collected on behalf of a tax authority and 
consequently deducted from revenue. Due to the complexity and variety in tax legislation, significant judgement is 
applied in the assessment of whether taxes are borne by HEINEKEN or collected on behalf of a third party. 

To provide transparency on the impact of the accounting for excise, HEINEKEN presents the excise tax expense on a 
separate line below revenue in the consolidated income statement. A subtotal called 'Net revenue' is therefore included in 
the Income Statement. This 'Net revenue' subtotal is 'revenue' as defined in IFRS 15 (after discounts) minus the excise tax 
expense for those countries where the excise is borne by HEINEKEN.

In 2021, other income mainly related to the gain on previously held equity-interest in United Breweries Limited (UBL) in 
India (€1,270 million) after obtaining control of UBL on 29 July 2021 and tax credits recognised in Brazil (€196 million) 
related to unduly paid PIS/COFINS1 for the period 2001 until 2021. 

  Accounting policies 
Other income is recognised in profit or loss when control over the sold asset is transferred to the buyer. The amount 
recognised as other income equals the proceeds obtained from the buyer minus the carrying value of the sold asset.  

As part of a step acquisition, any previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value on the date of 
the acquisition. The difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the previously held equity interest is 
recognised in other income.  

1 PIS/COFINS: PIS (Program of Social Integration) and COFINS (Contribution for the Financing of Social Security) are federal sales taxes based on turnover of 
companies

Other expenses  2,347  1,921 

 18,618  13,535 

The increase in raw materials, consumables and services is mainly driven by inflation in commodity and energy prices 
related to raw materials and non-returnable packaging.

Other expenses in raw materials, consumables and services mainly include consulting expenses of €321 million 
(2021: €242 million), telecom and office automation of €300 million (2021: €277 million), warehousing expenses of 
€245 million (2021: €189 million), travel expenses of €113 million (2021: €54 million), other taxes of €124  million 
(2021: €118 million), short-term lease expenses of €86 million (2021: €61 million) and low-value lease expenses of 
€32 million (2021: €30 million). 

  Accounting policies 
Expenses are recognised based on accrual accounting. This means that expenses are recognised when the product is 
received or the service is provided regardless of when cash outflow takes place. Costs related to power purchase 
agreements are included as part of 'Energy and water'.

6.5    Share-based payments 
HEINEKEN has the following share-based compensation plans: long-term incentive plan, extraordinary share plan and 
matching share plan (as part of the Short-term incentive plan of the Executive Board). 

Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) 
HEINEKEN has a performance-based LTIP for the Executive Board and senior management. Under this LTIP, share rights 
are conditionally awarded to participants on an annual basis. The vesting of these rights is subject to the performance of 
Heineken N.V. on specific internal performance conditions and continued service over a three-calendar year period by the 
employee. The share rights are not dividend-bearing during the performance period. 

During 2022, a combined ESG-related performance measures, with equal weighting, were included in the LTIP. The 
performance conditions for LTIP 2022-2024 are organic net revenue growth, earnings per share beia growth, free 
operating cash flow and combined ESG-related measures. The performance conditions for LTIP 2020-2022 and 
2021-2023, are organic net revenue growth, organic operating profit beia growth, earnings per share beia growth and 
free operating cash flow. The performance conditions are equally weighted.

At target performance, 100% of the awarded share rights vest. At threshold performance, 50% of the awarded share 
rights vest and at maximum performance, 200% of the awarded share rights vest.

At vesting, HEINEKEN deducts a number of shares to cover payroll taxes and mandatory withholdings on behalf of the 
individual employees. Therefore, the number of Heineken N.V. shares to be received by LTIP participants is a net 
(after-tax) number. Ownership of the vested LTIP 2020-2022 shares will transfer to the Executive Board members 
shortly after the publication of the annual results of 2022 and to senior management on 1 April 2023.

Other share-based compensation plans 
In 2022, under the Extraordinary share plans for senior management, 500 shares were granted (2021: 58,566) and 
32,505 (gross) shares vested (2021: 17,878). These extraordinary grants only have a service condition and vest between 
one and five years. The expenses relating to these additional grants are recognised in profit or loss during the vesting 
period. In 2022, expenses amounted to €2 million (2021: €4 million).

Matching shares granted to the Executive Board are disclosed in note 13.3.

Personnel expenses  
The total share-based compensation expense that is recognised in 2022 amounts to €57 million (2021: €51 million

Accounting estimates 
The grant date fair value is calculated by adjusting the share price at the grant date for estimated foregone dividends 
during the performance period, as the participants are not entitled to receive dividends during that period. The foregone 
dividends are estimated by applying HEINEKEN's dividend policy on the latest forecasts of net profit (beia). 

At each balance sheet date, HEINEKEN uses its latest forecasts to calculate the expected realisation on the performance 
targets per plan. The number of shares is adjusted to the new target realisation and HEINEKEN increases/decreases the 
total plan cost. The cumulative effect is recorded in the profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 

Expenses related to employees that voluntarily leave HEINEKEN are reversed as they will not receive any shares from the 
LTIP. The expense calculation includes the estimated future forfeiture. HEINEKEN uses historical information to estimate 
this forfeiture rate. 

  Accounting policies 
HEINEKEN's share-based compensation plans are equity-settled share rights granted to the Executive Board and senior 
management.  

The grant date fair value is calculated by deducting expected foregone dividends from the grant date during the 
performance period share price. The costs of the share plans are adjusted for expected performance and forfeiture and 
spread evenly over the service period.  

Share-based compensation expenses are recorded in the profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

6.7    Earnings per share 
The calculation of earnings per share (EPS) for the period ended 31 December 2022 is based on the profit attributable to 
the shareholders of the Company (net profit) and the weighted average number of shares outstanding (basic and 
diluted) during the year ended 31 December 2022.

  Accounting policies  
HEINEKEN presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the 
profit or loss attributable to shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during 
the year, adjusted for the weighted average number of own shares held in the year. Diluted EPS is determined by dividing 
the profit or loss attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding, adjusted for the 
weighted average number of own shares held in the year and for the effects of all dilutive potential shares which 
comprise share rights granted to employees and the Executive Board. The effects of anti-dilutive potential ordinary 
shares are ignored in calculating diluted EPS.

In 2022, the change in inventories written off to net realisable value was €9 million, release (2021: €11 million, write off). 

  Accounting policies 
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on a weighted 
average cost and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other 
costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Cost of inventories are generally updated on 
annual basis except if a structural change is identified during the period such as the impact of inflationary pressure on 
input costs.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and selling expenses.

  Accounting estimates
HEINEKEN determines on each reporting date the impairment of trade and other receivables using a model (e.g. flow 
rate method) which estimates the lifetime expected credit losses that will be incurred on these receivables. Individually 
significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed 
collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. Due the macro-economic environment and uncertainties 
including increasing inflationary pressure on HEINEKEN’s customers, more judgement is required in the calculation of 
expected credit losses compared to the prior year. As part of these assessments, HEINEKEN has incorporated all 
reasonable and supportable information available such as whether there has been a breach of payment terms or 
deterioration of payment against payment terms, a request for extended payment terms or a request for waived 
payment terms. For more information on HEINEKEN's credit risk exposure refer to note 11.5. 

  Accounting policies  
Trade and other receivables are held by HEINEKEN to collect the related cash flows. These receivables are measured at 
fair value and subsequently at amortised cost minus any impairment losses. Trade and other receivables are 
derecognised by HEINEKEN when substantially all risks and rewards are transferred or if HEINEKEN does not retain 
control over the receivables.

7.3    Trade and other payables 
In the ordinary course of business, payable positions arise towards suppliers of goods and services, as well as to other 
parties. Refer to the table below for the different types of trade and other payables.

In millions of € 2022 2021

Trade payables  5,852  4,631 

Accruals  1,802  1,615 

Taxation and social security contributions  1,103  999 

Interest  172  177 

Dividends  25  23 

Other payables  329  305 

 9,283  7,750 

In 2022, the increase in trade payables is mainly due to inflation in commodity prices related to raw materials and 
increased prices for transport.  

  Accounting estimates 
HEINEKEN makes estimates in the determination of discount accruals. When discounts are provided to customers, these 
reduce the transaction price and consequently the revenue. The conditional discounts in revenue (refer to note 6.1) are 
estimated based on accumulated experience supported by historical and current sales information. Expected sales volumes 
are determined taking into account (historical) sales patterns and other relevant information. A discount accrual is recognised 
for expected volume and discounts due to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period.

  Accounting policies 
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. Trade payables are 
derecognised when the contractual obligation is either discharged, cancelled or expired. 

7.4    Returnable packaging materials 
HEINEKEN uses returnable packaging materials such as glass bottles, crates and kegs in selling the finished products to 
the customer.  

Returnable packaging materials  
The majority of returnable packaging materials are classified as property, plant and equipment. The category 'Other 
fixed assets' in property, plant and equipment (refer to note 8.2) includes €1,018 million (2021: €830 million) of 
returnable packaging materials.  

Returnable packaging deposit liability 
In certain markets, HEINEKEN has the legal or constructive obligation to take back the materials from the market. A 
deposit value is generally charged upon the sale of the finished product, which is reimbursed when the empty returnable 
packaging material is returned. 

In millions of € 2022 2021

Returnable packaging deposits  545  476 

  Accounting estimates  
The main accounting estimate relating to returnable packaging materials is determining the returnable packaging 
materials in the market and the expected return thereof. This is based on circulation times and losses of returnable 
packaging materials in the market.  

  Accounting policies  
Returnable packaging materials   
Returnable packaging materials may be classified as property, plant and equipment or inventory. The classification 
mainly depends on whether ownership is transferred and if HEINEKEN has the legal or constructive obligation to buy 
back the materials. 

Refer to note 8.2 for the general accounting policy on property, plant and equipment. Specifically for returnable 
packaging materials, the estimated useful life depends on the loss of the materials in the market as well as on 
HEINEKEN's sites. 

Returnable packaging deposit liability   
HEINEKEN recognises a deposit liability when a legal or constructive obligation exists to reimburse the customer for 
returnable packaging materials that are returned. The returnable packaging deposit liability is based on the estimated 
returnable packaging materials in the market, the expected return thereof and the deposit value.

In light of increasing inflationary pressures and HEINEKEN’s BaBW ambitions, the deposit value for a number of returnable 
packaging materials were increased. In the event the deposit value is increased, the relating liability is remeasured through 
profit and loss taking into account the returnable packaging materials which are already in the market.

Goodwill impairment testing
For impairment testing, goodwill in respect of Europe, Americas (excluding Brazil) and Asia Pacific (excluding India) is 
allocated and monitored on a regional basis. For Brazil, India, subsidiaries within Africa, Middle East & Eastern Europe and 
Head Office, goodwill is allocated and monitored on an individual country basis. The total amount of goodwill of 
€12,250 million (2021: €11,810 million) is allocated to each (group of) Cash Generating Unit (CGU) as follows:

The increase in goodwill of €440 million compared to 2021, mainly relates to application of hyperinflation accounting in 
Ethiopia of €157 million and the movement in exchange rates of €174 million.

The carrying amount of a CGU is compared to the recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amounts of the (group 
of) CGUs are based on the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and value in use (VIU) calculations. CGUs 
for which the recoverable amount is based on a VIU model represent 94% of goodwill. VIU is determined by discounting the 
future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the CGU using a pre-tax discount rate.  

The key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows: 

– Cash flows are projected based on actual operating results and the approved business plan. Cash flows thereafter are 
extrapolated up to a 10-year period (Europe 5-year) using an expected annual volume growth rate per country, which 
is based on external sources. The extrapolated cash flows are therefore projected using steady or progressively 
declining net cash flow growth rates. Based on past experience, management considers this period to reflect the long-
term development of the local beer business.

– The beer price growth per year, after the forecast period, is assumed to be the expected country-specific annual long-
term inflation, which is based on external sources. 

– Cash flows after the first 10-year period (Europe 5-year) are extrapolated using a perpetual growth rate equal to the 
expected 30-year average inflation to calculate the terminal recoverable amount. For Europe, a return on inflation-
linked bond rates is used to extrapolate cash flows. 

– A CGU-specific pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was applied per CGU in determining the recoverable 
amount of the units. 

The values assigned to the key assumptions used for the VIU calculations are as follows:

Asia Pacific (excluding India)  13.6  3.3  1.4 

Head Office  13.5  3.3  1.7 

In 2022, there has been a general increase in the WACC applied across most CGUs, due to increased interest rates. 

Impairment losses 
The annual goodwill impairment test did not result in an impairment loss for the current year (2021: nil). The impairment 
test required as a result of the identification of impairment indicators resulted in an impairment reversal of €189 million 
on intangible assets other than goodwill (2021: €72 million on intangible assets other than goodwill, net impairment), 
which was charged to profit and loss (refer to note 8.2).

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions 
The outcome of a sensitivity analysis of a 200 basis points adverse change in key assumptions (i.e. lower growth rates or 
higher discount rates respectively) did not result in a materially different outcome for the impairment test. 

Brands, customer-related and contract-based intangibles   
The main brands capitalised are the brands acquired in various acquisitions. The main customer-related and contract-
based intangibles relate to customer relationships (constituted either by way of a contractual agreement or by way of 
non-contractual relations) and re-acquired rights.  

  Accounting estimates and judgements  
The cash flow projections used in the value in use calculations for goodwill impairment testing contain various judgements 
and estimations as described in the key assumptions for the VIU calculations. Such judgements and estimates are subject to 
change because of changing economic conditions and climate impact and actual cash flows may differ from forecasts. The 
below additional considerations have been applied by HEINEKEN regarding the potential financial impact of the macro-
economic environment and uncertainties including increasing inflationary pressures worldwide: 

– Changes in the interest rate environment are taken into consideration when determining the discount rates
– Terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term annual inflation rate of the country or region, thus excluding any 

increased inflation growth experiences in the short-term
– Sensitivity scenarios are applied to the key assumptions used in the impairment testing.

The impact of climate change risk on future cash flows have also been considered at an CGU and asset level, including 
committed capex and operational expenditure. No material financial impacts to the current year impairment assessment 
were identified.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



For intangible assets, other than goodwill, estimates are required to determine the (remaining) useful lives. Useful lives 
are determined based on the market position (for brands), estimated remaining useful life of the customer relationships 
or the period of the contractual arrangements, or estimates on technological and commercial developments (for 
software/development expenditure). 

Amortisation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. HEINEKEN believes that 
straight-line depreciation most accurately reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits 
embodied in the intangible asset. 

  Accounting policies  
Goodwill  
Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and the transaction price of the 
acquisition. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the 
associates and joint ventures.   

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to individual or groups of CGUs 
for impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment. Negative goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss as 
other income. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. 

Brands, customer-related and contract-based intangibles 
Brands, customer-related and contract-based intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are recognised at 
fair value. Otherwise, these acquired intangibles are recognised at cost and amortised over the estimated useful life of 
the individual brand, respectively over the remaining useful life of the customer relationships or the period of the 
contractual arrangements.  

Strategic brands are well-known international/local brands with a strong market position and an established brand name.  

Software, research and development and other intangible assets  
Purchased software is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation. Expenditure on internally developed software is 
capitalised when the expenditure qualifies as development activities, otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss when incurred. 

Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge, is recognised in 
profit or loss when incurred.  

Amortisation  
Amortisation is calculated over the cost of the asset less its residual value. Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful 
lives are as follows:  

– Strategic brands  40 – 50 years  
– Other brands  5 – 25 years  
– Customer-related and contract-based intangibles  5 – 25 years  
– Re-acquired rights  3 – 12 years  
– Software  3 – 7 years  
– Capitalised development costs  3 years   

The amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually. Changes in useful lives or residual 
value are recognised prospectively.  

De-recognition of intangible assets 
Intangible assets are derecognised when disposed of or sold. Gains on sale of intangible assets are presented in profit or loss 
as other income (refer to note 6.2); losses on sale are included in amortisation. Goodwill is derecognised when the related 
CGU is sold.  

Impairment of non-financial assets 
At each reporting date, HEINEKEN reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (except for inventories and 
deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount is estimated. The existence of any immediate or short-term physical threats due to climate change 
were also considered in assessing for any indication of impairment. Furthermore, HEINEKEN assesses goodwill and other 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life annually for impairment.  

For impairment testing, assets are grouped into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing 
use. The CGU for other non-financial assets is often the operating company on a country level. The recoverable amount 
of an asset or CGU is the higher of an asset’s FVLCD and VIU. In assessing the VIU, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and risks specific to the asset or CGU. 

An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are first allocated to goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. A remaining 
impairment loss is then allocated to the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. In respect of other assets, impairment 
losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no 
longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



Land and buildings include the breweries and offices of HEINEKEN as well as stores, pubs and bars. The plant and 
machinery asset class contains all the assets needed in HEINEKEN's brewing, packaging and filling activities. Other fixed 
assets mainly consist of returnable packaging materials, commercial fixed assets and furniture, fixtures and fittings. Refer 
to note 7.4 for further information on returnable packaging materials that are included in this category. 

Impairment losses 
A net impairment reversal of €27 million on owned P,P&E (2021: €16 million, net impairment), €4 million impairment 
reversal on ROU assets (2021: €20 million, net impairment) and €189 million impairment reversal on intangible assets with 
finite useful life (2021: €72 million, net impairment) were recorded for the year ended 31 December 2022. The net 
impairment reversal mainly relates to impairment reversal in the CGU Papua New Guinea (€234 million) which is included in 
the Asia Pacific operating segment. The reversal is primarily driven by an improved performance and stronger recovery from 
COVID-19 in a more favourable macro-economic environment, since the recognition of the impairment in 2020. 

The determination of the recoverable amount of Papua New Guinea is based on a VIU valuation, which is based on a 
discounted 10-year cash flow forecast. The key assumptions used to determine the cash flows are based on market 
expectations and management's best estimate. Cash flows thereafter are extrapolated using a perpetual growth rate 
equal to the expected 30-year compounded average inflation, in order to calculate the terminal recoverable amount.   

Impairments (reversals) are recorded on the line 'amortisation, depreciation and impairments' in the Income Statement. 
For a split per asset class, refer to the movement schedules in notes 8.1 and 8.2.

See the table below for the key assumptions:

Right of use (ROU) assets 
HEINEKEN leases stores, pubs, offices, warehouses, cars, (forklift) trucks and other equipment in the ordinary course of 
business. HEINEKEN has around 36,000 leases with a wide range of different terms and conditions, depending on local 
regulations and practices. Many leases contain extension and termination options, which are included in the lease term if 
HEINEKEN is reasonably certain to exercise the option. Refer to the table below for the carrying amount of ROU assets 
per asset class per balance sheet date:

In 2022, €218 million was added to the ROU assets as a result of entering into new lease contracts and the

  Accounting estimates and judgements 
Estimates are required to determine the (remaining) useful lives of fixed assets. Useful lives are determined based on an 
asset's age, the frequency of its use, repair and maintenance policy, technology changes in production, redundancies or 
changes due to climate risks and expected restructuring.  

HEINEKEN estimates the expected residual value per asset item. The residual value is the higher of the expected sales 
price (based on recent market transactions of similar sold items) and its material scrap value. 

Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of P,P&E. 
HEINEKEN believes that straight-line depreciation most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the 
future economic benefits embodied in the asset.  

Judgement is required to determine the lease term. The assessment of whether HEINEKEN is reasonably certain to exercise 
such options impacts the lease term, which as a result could affect the amount of lease liabilities and ROU assets recognised.  

  Accounting policies 
Owned assets  
A fixed asset is recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the P,P&E item will flow to 
HEINEKEN and when the cost of the P,P&E can be reliably measured. The majority of the P,P&E of HEINEKEN are owned 
assets, rather than leased assets.  

P,P&E are recognised at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost includes all 
costs directly attributable to the purchase of an asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes all directly attributable 
costs to make the asset ready for its intended use. Spare parts that meet the definition of P,P&E are capitalised and 
accounted for accordingly. If spare parts do not meet the recognition criteria of P,P&E, they are either carried in inventory 
or consumed and recorded in profit or loss. 

Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is probable that the expenses will lead to future economic benefits and can be 
measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. 
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. 

For the contractual commitments on ordered P,P&E refer to note 13.2.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



Depreciation and impairments 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful life of the asset class. 
The estimated useful lives of the main asset classes are as follows:  

– Buildings 15 – 40 years  
– Plant and equipment   5 – 30 years  
– Other fixed assets   3 – 10 years  

Land and assets under construction are not depreciated. When assets under construction are ready for their intended use, 
they are transferred to the relevant category and depreciation starts. All other P,P&E items are depreciated over their 
estimated useful life to the asset's residual value.  

The depreciation method, residual value and useful lives are reassessed annually. Changes in useful lives or residual value 
are recognised prospectively.  

HEINEKEN reviews whether indicators for impairment exist on a CGU level. When an indicator of impairment exists, 
assets are tested for impairment. Impairment losses on assets, other than goodwill, recognised in prior periods are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indication of a reversal, due to observable indications that the asset's value has 
increased significantly or other significant changes with favourable effects.   

Derecognition of Property, plant and equipment 
P,P&E is derecognised when it is scrapped or sold. Gains on sale of P,P&E are presented in profit or loss as other income 
(refer to note 6.2); losses on sale are included in depreciation.  

Right of use (ROU) assets
Definition of a lease 
A contract contains a lease if it provides the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for an amount payable to the lessor. The right to control the use of the identified asset exists when having the right to 
obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that asset and when having the right to direct the use of 
that asset. 

HEINEKEN as a lessee 
At the start date of the lease, HEINEKEN (lessee) recognises a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The 
ROU asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. For measurement of the lease liability, refer to note 11.3. 

HEINEKEN applies the following practical expedients for the recognition of leases: 

– The short-term lease exemption means that leases with a duration of less than a year are expensed in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis.  

– The low-value lease exemption, meaning that leased assets with an individual value of €5,000 or less if bought new, 
are expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis. 

HEINEKEN as a lessor  
A lease is classified as a finance lease when it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards relating to ownership of the 
underlying asset to the lessee. For contracts where HEINEKEN acts as an intermediate lessor, the subleases are classified 
with reference to the ROU asset. 

Lease related notes 
For lease liabilities, refer to note 11.3 Borrowings. For short-term and low-value leases, refer to other expenses in note 6.3 
Raw materials, consumables and services. For the lease receivables, refer to other receivables in note 8.4 Other non-
current assets and other receivables in note 7.2 Trade and other receivables. For the contractual maturities of lease 
liabilities, refer to note 11.5 Credit, liquidity and market risk.  

8.3    Loans and advances to customers 
Loans and advances to customers are inherent to HEINEKEN's business model. Loans to customers are repaid in cash on 
fixed dates while the settlement of advances to customers is linked to the sales volume of the customer. Loans and 
advances to customers are usually backed by collateral such as properties.

  Accounting estimates
HEINEKEN determines at each reporting date the impairment of loans and advances to customers using an expected 
credit loss model, which estimates the credit losses over 12 months. If a significant increase in credit risk occurs (e.g. more 
than 30 days overdue, change in credit rating, payment delays in other receivables from the customer), credit losses over 
the lifetime of the asset are incurred. Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual 
basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. Due to 
the macro-economic environment and uncertainties including increasing inflationary pressure on HEINEKEN’s customers, 
more judgement is required for the calculation of expected credit losses compared to the prior years. For more 
information on HEINEKEN's credit risk exposure refer to note 11.5. 

  Accounting policies  
Loans and advances to customers are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost minus any 
impairment losses. 

8.4    Other non-current assets 
Other non-current assets mainly consist of Fair Value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) investments, long-
term prepayments and other receivables with a duration longer than 12 months.

In millions of € Note 2022 2021

Fair value through OCI investments  154  135 

Non-current derivatives  11.6  56  6 

Loans to joint ventures and associates  15  28 

Long-term prepayments  461  392 

Other receivables  544  509 

Other non-current assets  1,230  1,070 

The FVOCI investments primarily consist of equity securities. HEINEKEN designates these investments as FVOCI as these 
are not held for trading purposes.

Other receivables include lease receivables of €137 million (2021: €148 million). The average outstanding term of the 
lease receivables, including the short-term portion of lease receivables, is 2.9 years (2021: 3.0 years). It further includes 
tax credits of €137 million (2021: €161 million) recognised in Brazil (refer to note 6.2). The remainder of other receivables 
mainly originate from the acquisition of the beer operations of FEMSA and represent a receivable on the Brazilian 
authorities on which interest is calculated in accordance with Brazilian legislation. The collection of this receivable is 
expected to be beyond a period of five years. A part of the aforementioned qualifies for indemnification towards FEMSA 
and is provided for. 

Sensitivity analysis – equity securities 
An increase or decrease of 1% in the share price of the equity securities at the reporting date would not have a 
material impact. 

  Accounting estimates 
HEINEKEN determines on each reporting date the impairment of other receivables using an expected credit loss model, 
which estimates the credit losses over 12 months. Only in case of a significant increase in credit risk occurs (e.g. more than 
30 days overdue, change in credit rating, payment delays in other receivables from the customer) the credit losses over 
the lifetime of the asset are incurred. Individually significant other receivables are tested for impairment on an individual 
basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. For 
more information on HEINEKEN's credit risk exposure refer to note 11.5.

  Accounting policies 
Fair value through OCI investments 
HEINEKEN’s investments in equity securities are classified as FVOCI. These investments are interests in entities where 
HEINEKEN has less than significant influence. This is generally the case by ownership of less than 20% of the voting 
rights. Upon the sale of these equity securities the accumulated fair value and currency translation changes are 
transferred to retained earnings. 

FVOCI investments are measured at fair value (refer to note 13.1). The fair value changes are recognised in OCI and 
presented within equity in the fair value reserve. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss. 

Non-current derivatives 
Refer to the accounting policies on derivative financial instruments in note 11.6. 

Other 
The remaining non-current assets as presented in the previous table are initially measured at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost minus any impairment losses.

9.1    Post-retirement obligations 
HEINEKEN makes contributions to pension plans that provide pension benefits to (former) employees upon retirement, 
both via defined benefit as well as defined contribution plans. Other long-term employee benefits include long-term 
bonus plans, termination benefits, medical plans and jubilee benefits. Refer to note 6.4 for the contribution to defined 
contribution plans. This note relates to HEINEKEN's defined benefit pension plans. Refer to the table below for the 
present value of the defined benefit plans as at 31 December.

The vast majority of benefit payments are from pension funds that are held in trusts (or equivalent), however, there is a 
small portion where HEINEKEN fulfils the benefit payment obligation as it falls due. Plan assets held in trusts are 
governed by Trustee Boards composed of HEINEKEN representatives and independent and/or member representation, 
in accordance with local regulations and practice in each country. The relationship and division of responsibility between 
HEINEKEN and the Trustee Board (or equivalent) including investment decisions and contribution schedules are carried 
out in accordance with the plan's regulations.  

The defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands (NL) and the United Kingdom (UK) represent the majority of the 
total defined benefit plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations.

Refer to the table below for the split of these plans in the total present value of the net obligations of HEINEKEN.

Defined benefit plan in the Netherlands 
HEINEKEN provides employees in the Netherlands with an average pay pension plan based on earnings up to the legal 
tax limit. Indexation of accrued benefits is conditional on the funded status of the pension fund. HEINEKEN pays 
contributions to the fund up to a maximum level agreed with the Board of the pension fund and has no obligation to 
make additional contributions in case of a funding deficit.

During 2022, the coverage ratio of the Dutch pension fund improved significantly. Rising interest rates lowered the fund’s 
net defined benefit obligations given its relatively low interest hedging policy. The fund’s financial position allowed for 
pension indexation in 2022. In July 2022, the Board of the pension fund decided to provide an annual discretionary 
indexation of accrued benefits of 3.42% to all its members. In December 2022, the Board of the pension fund decided to 
provide an annual discretionary indexation of accrued benefits at 1 January 2023 of 14.33%. 

In 2022, the decrease in the fair value of defined benefit plan assets is mainly due to a decrease in the value of bonds, 
interest rate swaps, mortgages and equity instruments. The lower defined benefit obligation is mainly due to a higher 
discount rate assumption, partially offset by a higher indexation assumption. HEINEKEN’s cash contribution to the Dutch 
pension plan was at the maximum level. The same level will apply in 2023. 
Defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom 
HEINEKEN’s UK plan (Scottish & Newcastle pension plan 'SNPP') was closed to future accrual in 2011 and the liabilities 
thus relate to past service before plan closure. Based on the triennial review finalised in early 2019, HEINEKEN has 
renewed the funding plan (until 31 May 2023) including an annual deficit reduction contribution of GBP39.2 million in 
2018, thereafter increasing with GBP1.7 million per year. At the end of 2018, an agreement (the 'Funding Agreement') 
was reached with the UK pension fund Trustees on a more conservative longer-term funding and investment approach 
towards 2030. This agreement has been formalised during 2019 and signed in early 2020, which leads to a gradual 
decrease in investment risk. The current schedule of deficit recovery payments until May 2023 will remain in place. As of 
June 2023, deficit recovery payments will stop. Going forward recovery payments will be conditional on the funding 
position of the pension fund and capped on the current contribution level. 

In 2022, the decrease in the fair value of defined benefit plan assets is mainly due to the lower value of debt 
investments, as a result of an increase in interest rates. The increase in interest rates lowered not only the plan assets, but 
also the plan liabilities. As the fund is closed to future accrual, the strategic asset allocation is more conservative with high 
interest and inflation hedging levels.
Defined benefit plans in other countries 
In a few other countries, HEINEKEN offers defined benefit plans, which are individually not significant to HEINEKEN. The 
majority of these plans are closed for new participants.

The HEINEKEN pension funds monitor the mix of debt and equity securities in their investment portfolios based on 
market expectations. Material investments within the portfolio are managed on an individual basis. Through its defined 
benefit pension plans, HEINEKEN is exposed to several risks, the most significant are detailed below. 

Risks associated with defined benefit plans

Asset volatility 
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to AA corporate bond yields. If the return on the 
plan assets is less than the return on the liabilities implied by this assumption, this will create a deficit. The plan in the 
Netherlands holds a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long 
term while providing volatility and risk in the short term. 

In the Netherlands, an Asset-Liability Matching (ALM) study is performed at least on a triennial basis, the last ALM study 
was performed in 2021. The ALM study is the basis for the strategic investment policies and the (long-term) strategic 
investment mix. As at 31 December 2022, the strategic asset mix comprises 33.5% of plan assets in equity securities, 
25% in bonds and swaps, 18% in alternative investments, 11% in mortgage and 12.5% in real estate.  

In the UK, an actuarial valuation is performed at least on a triennial basis. The valuation is the basis for the funding plan, 
strategic investment policies and the (long-term) strategic investment mix. The valuation was performed in 2021. As at 
31 December 2022, the strategic mix of assets comprises 30% of plan assets in liability-driven investments, 26.5% in 
corporate bonds, 15% in higher-yielding credit, 15% in private markets, 7.5% in long lease property and 6% in equities. As 
part of the Funding Agreement, the strategic asset mix will evolve between now and 2030 to provide greater certainty of 
return, lower volatility and higher cash generation. 

Interest rate risk 
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the 
value of the plans’ fixed-rate instruments holdings. 

In the Netherlands, interest rate risk is managed through fixed-income investments and interest rate swap instruments. 
These investments and instruments match the liabilities by 38% as at 31 December 2022 (2021: 24%). In the UK, 
interest rate risk is managed through the use of a mixture of fixed income investments and interest rate swap 
instruments. These investments and instruments match 96% of the interest rate sensitivity of the total liabilities as 
measured on a Gilts +1% liability basis (2021: 96% as measured on the same basis).

Inflation risk 
Some of the pension obligations are linked to inflation. Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in most 
cases caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation. The majority of 
the plan assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will 
increase the deficit.  

HEINEKEN provides employees in the Netherlands with an average pay pension plan, whereby indexation of accrued 
benefits is conditional on the funded status of the pension fund. In the UK, inflation risk is partly managed through the 
use of a mixture of inflation-linked derivative instruments. These instruments match 96% of the inflation-linked liabilities 
as measured on a Gilts +1% liability basis (2021: 96% as measured on the same basis). 

Life expectancy 
The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will 
increase the plans’ liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK plan, where inflation-linked increases result in higher 
sensitivity to changes in life expectancy. In 2015, the Trustee of HEINEKEN UK's pension plan implemented a longevity 
hedge to remove the risk of a higher increase in life expectancy than anticipated for the 2015 population of pensioners.

Principal actuarial assumptions as at the balance sheet date  
Based on the significance of the Dutch and UK pension plans compared with the other plans, the table below refers to 
the major actuarial assumptions for those two plans as at 31 December:

The Netherlands UK1

In % 2022 2021 2022 2021

Discount rate as at 31 December  3.8  1.1  5.0  1.8 

Future salary increases  2.0  2.0  —  — 

Future pension increases  2.9  1.3  3.1  3.4 

1 The UK plan is closed for future accrual, leading to certain assumptions being equal to zero. 

For the other defined benefit plans, the following actuarial assumptions apply as at 31 December:

Europe Americas

In % 2022 2021 2022 2021

Discount rate as at 31 December 2.3-3.9 0.3-1.1 9.4-13.0 8.0-8.2

Future salary increases 0.0-3.4 0.0-3.1 0.0-4.5 0.0-4.5

Future pension increases 0.0-2.3 0.0-2.0 0.0-3.5 0.0-3.5

Medical cost trend rate  —  — 5.1-7.5 5.1-7.0

Assumptions regarding future mortality rates are based on published statistics and mortality tables. For the Netherlands, 
the rates are obtained from the ‘AG-Prognosetafel 2022’, fully generational. For the UK, the future mortality rates are 
obtained by applying the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2021 projection model. 

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 16 years 
(2021: 18 years). 

Except for the reduction in recovery contributions for the UK pension fund, HEINEKEN expects the contributions to be 
paid for the defined benefit plans for 2023 to be in line with 2022.

Sensitivity analysis 
As at 31 December, changes to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions that are considered reasonably possible, 
holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the following amounts: 

2022 2021

Effect in millions of €

Medical cost trend rate (0.5% movement)  3  (3)  4  (3) 

Life expectancy (1 year)  318  (317)  484  (479) 

  Accounting estimates 
To make the actuarial calculations for the defined benefit plans, HEINEKEN needs to make use of assumptions for 
discount rates, future pension increases and life expectancy as described in this note. The actuarial calculations are made 
by external actuaries based on inputs from observable market data, such as corporate bond returns and yield curves to 
determine the discount rates used, mortality tables to determine life expectancy and inflation numbers to determine 
future salary and pension growth assumptions.  

  Accounting policies 
Defined contribution plans 
A defined-contribution plan is a post-retirement plan for which HEINEKEN pays fixed contributions to a separate entity. 
HEINEKEN has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets 
to pay out employees. 

Defined benefit plans 
A defined benefit plan is a post-retirement plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans 
define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more 
factors such as age, years of service and compensation.  

HEINEKEN’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior 
periods; those benefits are discounted to determine its present value. The fair value of any defined benefit plan assets is 
deducted. The discount rate is the yield at balance sheet date on high quality credit-rated bonds that have maturity 
dates approximating to the terms of HEINEKEN’s obligations and are denominated in the same currency in which the 
benefits are expected to be paid.  

The calculations are performed annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. When the 
calculation results in a benefit to HEINEKEN, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits 
available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate 
the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any 
plan in HEINEKEN. An economic benefit is available to HEINEKEN if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on 
settlement of the plan liabilities. When the benefits of a plan are changed, the expense or benefit is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 

HEINEKEN recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans immediately in other 
comprehensive income and all expenses related to defined benefit plans in personnel expenses and other net finance 
income and expenses in profit or loss.  

For changes to a defined benefit plan, which result in a plan amendment or a curtailment or settlement, HEINEKEN 
determines the amount of any past service cost, or gain or loss on settlement, by remeasuring the net defined benefit 
liability before and after the amendment, using current assumptions and the fair value of plan assets at the time of the 
amendment. In case the net defined benefit liability is remeasured to determine the impact of the changes, current 
service cost and net interest for the remainder of the year are remeasured using the same assumptions and the same fair 
value of plan assets.

9.2    Provisions 
Provisions within HEINEKEN mainly relate to restructuring, and claims and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of 
business. The outcome depends on future events, which are by nature uncertain.

Claims and litigation 
The provisions for claims and litigation of €150 million (2021: €196 million) mainly relate to civil and labour claims in Brazil.

Taxes 
The provisions for taxes of €283 million (2021: €344 million) relate to indirect taxes not within the scope of IAS 12 and 
mainly relate to Brazil. Tax legislation in Brazil is highly complex and subject to interpretation, therefore the timing of the 
cash outflows for these provisions is uncertain.  

Other provisions 
Included are, among others, provisions for credit risk on surety and guarantees issued of €50 million (2021: €53 million).

  Accounting estimates 
In determining the likelihood and timing of potential cash outflows, HEINEKEN needs to make estimates. For claims, 
litigation and tax provisions, HEINEKEN bases its assessment on internal and external legal assistance and established 
precedents. For a large restructuring, management assesses the timing of the costs to be incurred, which influences the 
classification as current or non-current liabilities. 

  Accounting policies 
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A provision is recognised when HEINEKEN has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable (>50%) that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. In the case of accounting for business combinations, 
provisions are also recognised when the likelihood is less than probable but more than remote (>5%). 

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, using a 
pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as part of net finance expenses.  

The impact of climate change is also considered in identifying whether HEINEKEN has a present legal or constructive 
obligation related to fines or penalties. 

Restructuring 
A provision for restructuring is recognised when HEINEKEN has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and 
the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for. 
The provision includes the benefit commitments in connection with early retirement and redundancy schemes.  

Onerous contracts  
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be received by HEINEKEN are lower than 
the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the 
lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract, and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before 
a provision is established, HEINEKEN recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.  

Other provisions  
A provision for guarantees is recognised at the time the guarantee is issued (refer to note 9.3 for the total guarantees 
outstanding). The provision is initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of the amount determined 
in accordance with the expected credit loss model and the amount initially recognised.

9.3    Contingencies 

HEINEKEN’s contingencies are mainly in the area of tax, civil cases and guarantees.

Tax 
The tax contingencies mainly relate to tax positions in Latin America and include a large number of cases with a risk 
assessment lower than probable but possible. Assessing the amount of tax contingencies is highly judgemental, and 
the timing of possible outflows is uncertain. The best estimate of tax-related contingent liabilities is €1,489 million (2021: 
€1,139 million), out of which €73 million (2021: €77 million) qualifies for indemnification. For several tax contingencies 
that were part of acquisitions, an amount of €173 million (2021: €175 million) has been recognised as provisions and 
other non-current liabilities in the balance sheet (refer to notes 9.2 and 11.6). 

Other contingencies  
Brazil civil cases
Part of other contingencies relates to civil cases in Brazil. Management's best estimate of the potential financial impact 
for these cases is €57 million (2021: €47 million).

Other 
Part of other contingencies relate to two follow-on damage cases for a total amount claimed of €478 million, which 
arose as a result of the fine imposed by the Greek Competition Commission in 2014 against our subsidiary Athenian 
Brewery for alleged abuse of its dominant position. It is not possible to estimate the outcome of these claims with any 
degree of certainty for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the fact that (i) Athenian Brewery’s appeal 
against the fine imposed by the Greek Competition Commission is pending before the Greek Council of State, (ii) the 
question whether the Dutch courts can assume (international) jurisdiction over these claims, insofar they are made 
against Athenian Brewery, is pending before the Dutch Supreme Court, and (iii) Athenian Brewery and HEINEKEN have 
raised defences against these claims, both on procedural grounds and on the merits. The amount of these potential 
liabilities (if any) can therefore not be measured with sufficient reliability. There are no reimbursements applicable for 
these cases.

As at 31 December 2022, €37 million (2021: €37 million) of other contingencies related to acquisitions is included in 
provisions (refer to note 9.2).

Guarantees  2,438  1,411  888  139  2,374 

Guarantees to banks for loans relate to loans and advances to customers, which are given to external parties in the 
ordinary course of business of HEINEKEN. HEINEKEN provides guarantees to the banks to cover the credit risk related to 
these loans (refer to note 9.2 for the provision for credit risk on these guarantees).   

Other guarantees include a €1.1 billion (2021: €1.1 billion) guarantee issued concerning the offer to acquire Distell Group 
Holdings Limited (refer to note 13.2).

  Accounting estimates and judgements 
HEINEKEN operates in a high number of jurisdictions and is subject to a wide variety of taxes per jurisdiction. Tax 
legislation can be highly complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, HEINEKEN is required to exercise significant 
judgement in the recognition of taxes payable and determination of tax contingencies. 

Also for the other contingencies including climate change, HEINEKEN is required to exercise judgement to determine 
whether the risk of loss is possible but not probable. Contingencies involve inherent uncertainties including, but not 
limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions.  

  Accounting policies 
A contingent liability is a liability of uncertain timing and amount. Contingencies are not recognised in the balance sheet 
because the existence can only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not wholly within the control of HEINEKEN or because the risk of loss is estimated to be possible (>5%) but not 
probable (<50%) or because the amount cannot be measured reliably. 

10.    Acquisitions, disposals and investments 
10.1    Acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and non-controlling interests 
Acquisition and disposals of subsidiaries in 2022
During 2022, there were no significant acquisitions or disposals.  

Acquisition of non-controlling interests
In 2022, transactions with non-controlling interests mainly consists of a transaction where HEINEKEN purchased 
3,409,660 shares and 95,798 shares of Grupa Żywiec S.A. from Harbin B.V. and other minority shareholders, respectively. 
This increased HEINEKEN’s shareholding from 65.16% to 99.28%. The consideration paid for the acquisition of non-
controlling interest in 2022 and the related equity impact are disclosed in the table below:

Total  391  18  373 

  Accounting policies
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and 
therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do 
not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.

Russia disposal group classified as held for sale
On 28 March 2022, HEINEKEN announced its decision to leave Russia. Efforts to sell the disposal group are continuing 
and HEINEKEN expects to reach an agreement in the first half-year of 2023. The disposal group is included in the 
reportable segment Africa, Middle East & Eastern Europe (refer to note 6.1). 

An impairment loss of €88 million was recognised in relation to the write down of the Russia disposal group classified as 
held for sale for the year ended 31 December 2022. The determination of the fair value less cost of disposal amount 
involves judgement considering the general uncertainties around Russia. 

  Accounting estimates and judgements  
HEINEKEN classifies assets or disposal groups as held for sale when they are available for immediate sale in their present 
condition, are expected to be sold within 1 year, and the sale is highly probable. HEINEKEN should be committed to the 
sale and it should be unlikely that the plan to sell will be withdrawn. This might be difficult to demonstrate in practice and 
involves judgement. 

  Accounting policies 
Assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather 
than through continuing use are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, 
or components of a disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.  

Intangible assets and P,P&E once classified as held for sale are not amortised or depreciated. In addition, equity 
accounting of equity-accounted investees ceases once classified as held for sale.   

10.3    Investments in associates and joint ventures 
HEINEKEN has interests in several joint ventures and associates. The total carrying amount of these associates and joint 
ventures was €4,296 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: €4,148 million) and the total share of profit and other 
comprehensive income was a profit of €177 million in 2022 (2021: €304 million). The share of profit of associates and 
joint ventures includes an impairment loss of €4 million (2021: €10 million, impairment reversal). 

The associate CRH (Beer) Limited (‘CBL’) is considered to be individually material. HEINEKEN holds a shareholding of 40% 
in CBL as of 29 April 2019. CBL holds a controlling interest of 51.67% in China Resources Beer (Holdings) Co. Ltd. 
('CR Beer'), a company incorporated in Hong Kong and listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong 
Limited, operating in the beer business in China. Consequently, HEINEKEN has an effective 20.67% economic interest in 
CR Beer. Based on the closing share price of HKD54.55 as at 31 December 2022 (2021: HKD63.85), the fair value of this 
economic interest in CR Beer amounts to €4,398 million (2021: €4,847 million). The carrying amount of CBL as at 
31 December 2022 amounts to €2,908 million (2021: €2,752 million). 

Set out below is the summarised financial information of CR Beer, not adjusted for the percentage of ownership held by 
HEINEKEN. The financial information has been amended to reflect adjustments made by HEINEKEN when using the 
equity method (such as fair value adjustments). Due to a difference in reporting timelines, the financial information is 
included with a two-month delay. This means that the financial information included relates to the period November 
2021-October 2022. The reconciliation of the summarised financial information to the carrying amount of the effective 
interest in CR Beer is also presented.

1 Includes the investment in CR Beer, which is considered to be individually material. The other joint ventures and associates are considered to be 
individually immaterial. 

  Accounting policies  
Associates are entities in which HEINEKEN has significant influence, but not control or joint control. Significant influence 
is generally obtained by ownership of more than 20% but less than 50% of the voting rights. Joint ventures (JVs) are the 
arrangements in which HEINEKEN has joint control.  

HEINEKEN’s investments in associates and JVs are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, meaning they 
are initially recognised at cost. The consolidated financial statements include HEINEKEN’s share of the net profit or loss of 
the associates and JVs whereby the result is determined using the accounting policies of HEINEKEN. 

When HEINEKEN’s share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture, the carrying amount is 
reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that HEINEKEN has an obligation or 
has made a payment on behalf of the associate or JV.

11.    Financing and capital structure 
11.1    Net finance income and expense 
Interest expenses are mainly related to interest charges over the outstanding bonds, commercial paper and bank loans 
(refer to note 11.3). Other net finance income and expenses comprise dividend income, fair value changes of financial 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value, transactional foreign exchange gains and losses (on a net basis), monetary 
gain resulting from hyperinflation accounting, unwinding of discount on provisions and interest on the net defined 
benefit obligation.

Interest expenses include the interest component of lease liabilities of €49 million (2021: €58 million). The line other in 2021 
mainly includes €96 million of finance income due to the recognition of tax credits in Brazil, refer to note 6.2. 

In 2022, a net monetary gain was recognised related to applying hyperinflation accounting in Ethiopia, refer to note 5(c). 

  Accounting policies 
Interest income and expenses are recognised as they accrue, using the effective interest method. 

Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date that HEINEKEN’s right to receive payment is 
established, which is the ex-dividend date in the case of quoted securities.   

11.2    Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. In general bank overdrafts form an integral part of 
HEINEKEN’s cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of 
cash flows.

HEINEKEN operates in several territories where there is limited availability of foreign currency resulting in restrictions on 
remittances. Mainly as a result of these restrictions, ¤418 million (2021: ¤401 million) of cash included in cash and cash 
equivalents is restricted for use by the Company, yet available for use in the relevant subsidiary’s day-to-day operations.

  Accounting policies 
Cash and cash equivalents are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.   

HEINEKEN has cash pooling arrangements with legally enforceable rights to offset cash and overdraft balances. Where 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, cash and overdraft balances relating to the cash pooling arrangements are 
reported on a net basis in the statement of financial position.  

11.3    Borrowings 
HEINEKEN mainly uses bonds, commercial paper and bank loans to ensure sufficient financing to support its operations. 
Net interest-bearing debt is the key metric for HEINEKEN to measure its indebtedness.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



Changes in borrowings  
In 2022, the decrease in borrowings is mainly due to the repayment of bonds and bank loans, which exceeds the 
proceeds from bank loans and other interest-bearing liabilities incurred. 

Cash flows from financing activities are mainly generated by bonds, commercial paper, bank loans and other interest-
bearing liabilities presented above. Additionally, HEINEKEN also uses derivatives related to its financing, which can be 
recognised as assets or liabilities. The above table details the reconciliation of the liabilities and assets arising from 
financing activities to the cash flow from financing activities. Bank overdrafts form an integral part of HEINEKEN’s cash 
management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. For more 
information on derivatives refer to note 11.6. 

The average effective interest rate on the net debt position as at 31 December 2022 was 2.8% (2021: 2.7%). The 
average maturity of the bonds as at 31 December 2022 was 7 years (2021: 8 years).  

Centrally available financing headroom 
The centrally available financing headroom at Group level was approximately €3.6 billion as at 31 December 2022 
(2021: €4.6 billion) and consisted of the undrawn revolving credit facility and centrally available cash.

  Accounting estimates and judgements 
Judgement is required to determine the lease term and the incremental borrowing rate. The assessment of whether 
HEINEKEN is reasonably certain to exercise extension options or not to make use of termination options impacts the 
lease term, which as a result could affect the amount of lease liabilities recognised. The assumptions used in the 
determination of the incremental borrowing rate could impact the rate used in discounting future payments, which as a 
result could have an impact on the amount of lease liabilities recognised.

  Accounting policies 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequently, the borrowings are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Borrowings included in a fair value hedge are stated at fair value 
in respect of the risk being hedged.  

Borrowings for which HEINEKEN has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the balance sheet date are classified as non-current liabilities. For the accounting policy on cash and cash 
equivalents and derivatives refer to notes 11.2 and 11.6, respectively. 

Lease liabilities 
Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments to be paid during the lease term, discounted 
using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease 
liabilities and decreased by lease payments made. The lease liabilities will be remeasured when there is a change in the 
amount to be paid (e.g. due to indexation) or when there is a change in the assessment of the lease terms. 

The IBR is determined on a country level. For each country, there are separate rates depending on the contract currency 
and the term of the lease. The IBR is calculated based on the local risk-free rate plus a country default spread and a credit 
spread.

The lease term is determined as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with:  

– Periods covered by a unilateral option to extend the lease if HEINEKEN is reasonably certain to make use of that option 
– Periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if HEINEKEN is reasonably certain not to make use of that option 

HEINEKEN applies the following practical expedients for the recognition of leases: 

– Apply a single discount rate per country to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics 
– Include non-lease components in the lease liability for equipment leases 

11.4    Capital and reserves

Translation reserve 
The translation reserve comprises foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the assets and liabilities of 
foreign operations of HEINEKEN (excluding amounts attributable to non-controlling interests) as well as value changes of 
the hedging instruments in the net investment hedges. HEINEKEN considers this a legal reserve.  

Hedging reserve 
This reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging 
instruments where the hedged transaction has not yet occurred. HEINEKEN considers this a legal reserve. 

Fair value reserve 
This reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of FVOCI equity investments. HEINEKEN transfers 
amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised. HEINEKEN 
considers this a legal reserve. 

Other legal reserves 
These reserves relate to the share of profit of joint ventures and associates over the distribution of which HEINEKEN does 
not have control. The movement in these reserves reflects the share of profit of joint ventures and associates minus 
dividends received. For retained earnings of subsidiaries that cannot be freely distributed due to legal or other restrictions, 
a legal reserve is recognised. Furthermore, part of the reserve comprises a legal reserve for capitalised development costs.  

Reserve for own shares 
The reserve for own shares comprises the treasury shares held by HEINEKEN. Refer to the table below with the changes 
in 2022.

Interim dividend current year €0.50, respectively €0.28 per qualifying share  288  161 

Total dividend declared and paid  840  564 

For 2022, a payment of a total cash dividend of €1.73 per share (2021: €1.24) will be proposed at the AGM on 20 April 
2023. If approved, the final dividend of €1.23 will be paid on 2 May 2023, as an interim dividend of €0.50 per share was 
paid on 11 August 2022. The payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax.  

After the balance sheet date, the Executive Board proposed the following appropriation of profit. The dividends, taking 
into account the interim dividends declared and paid, have not been provided for.

The non-controlling interests (NCI) relate to minority stakes held by third parties in HEINEKEN consolidated subsidiaries. 
The total NCI as at 31 December 2022 amounted to €2,369 million (2021: €2,344 million), refer to note 10.1 for more 
information. 

Capital management 
There were no major changes in HEINEKEN’s approach to capital management during the year. The Executive Board’s 
policy is to maintain a strong capital base to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business and acquisitions.  

HEINEKEN is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than the legal reserves. Shares are purchased 
from time to time to meet the requirements of the share-based payment awards, as further explained in note 6.5.  

  Accounting policies 
Shares are classified as equity. When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration 
paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is net of any tax effects recognised as a deduction from equity. 
Repurchased shares recorded at purchase price are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the reserve for own 
shares.  

When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and 
the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from retained earnings.  

Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



11.5    Credit, liquidity and market risk 
This note summarises the financial risks that HEINEKEN is exposed to, and HEINEKEN’s policies and processes that are in 
place for managing these risks. For more information on derivatives used in managing risk refer to note 11.6.  

Risk management framework  
The Executive Board sets rules and monitors the adequacy of HEINEKEN’s risk management and control systems. These 
systems are regularly reviewed to reflect changes in market conditions and HEINEKEN’s activities.

Managing the financial risks and financial resources includes the use of derivatives, primarily spot and forward exchange 
contracts, options and interest rate swaps. It is HEINEKEN's policy not to enter into speculative transactions.  

In the normal course of business HEINEKEN is exposed to the following financial risks: 

– Credit risk  
– Liquidity risk  
– Market risk  

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of a loss to HEINEKEN when a customer or counterparty fails to pay.  

All local operations are required to comply with the Global Credit Policy and develop local credit management procedures 
accordingly. HEINEKEN reviews and updates the Global Credit Policy periodically to ensure that adequate controls are in 
place to mitigate credit risk.  

Credit risk arises mainly from HEINEKEN’s receivables from customers like trade receivables, loans to customers and 
advances to customers. At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. 

Loans and advances to customers  
HEINEKEN’s loans and receivables include loans and advances to customers. Loans and advances to customers are 
usually backed by collateral such as properties. HEINEKEN charges interest on loans to its customers.

Trade and other receivables  
HEINEKEN’s local management has credit policies in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing 
basis. Under these policies, all customers requiring credit above a certain amount are reviewed and new customers are 
analysed individually for creditworthiness before HEINEKEN’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are 
offered. This review can include external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references. Credit limits are 
determined for each customer and are reviewed regularly. Customers that fail to meet HEINEKEN’s credit requirements 
transact only with HEINEKEN on either a prepayment or cash on delivery basis. 

Customers are monitored, on a country basis, according to their credit risk characteristics. A distinction is made between 
individuals and legal entities, type of distribution channel, geographic location, ageing profile, maturity and existence of 
previous financial difficulties. 

HEINEKEN has a policy in place in respect of compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Laws. HEINEKEN considers it 
important to know with whom business is done and from whom payments are received.  

Allowances 
HEINEKEN establishes allowances for impairment of loans and advances to customers, trade and other receivables using 
an expected credit losses model. These allowances cover specific loss components that relate to individual exposures, and 
a collective loss component established for groups of similar customers. The collective loss allowance is determined based 
on historical data of payment statistics and updated periodically to incorporate forward-looking information. 

The loans and advances to customers, trade and other receivables are written off when there is no reasonable 
expectation of recovery. 

Due to the macro-economic environment and uncertainties including increasing inflationary pressure on HEINEKEN’s 
customers, more judgement is required in the calculation of expected credit losses compared to previous years. As part of 
these assessments, HEINEKEN has incorporated all reasonable and supportable information available such as whether 
there has been a breach of payment terms or deterioration of payment against payment terms, a request for extended 
payment terms or a request for waived payment terms. 

Investments  
HEINEKEN invests centrally available cash balances in deposits and liquid investments with various counterparties that 
have strong credit ratings. HEINEKEN actively monitors these credit ratings.

Guarantees  
HEINEKEN’s policy is to avoid issuing guarantees unless this leads to substantial benefits for HEINEKEN. For some loans 
to customers HEINEKEN does issue guarantees. In these cases, HEINEKEN aims to receive security from the customer to 
limit the credit risk exposure.  

Heineken N.V. has issued a joint and several liability statements to the provisions of Section 403, Part 9, Book 2 of the 
Dutch Civil Code with respect to legal entities established in the Netherlands. Refer to note A.1 of the Company financial 
statements.   

Exposure to credit risk

Liquidity risk  
Liquidity risk is the risk that HEINEKEN will have difficulties meeting payment obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities, like payment of financial debt or trade payables when they are due. HEINEKEN’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without 
incurring unacceptable losses. We have strict credit policies in place, which help safeguard liquidity especially in macro-
economic downturn.

HEINEKEN remains focused on ensuring sufficient access to capital markets to finance long-term growth and to 
refinance maturing debt obligations. HEINEKEN seeks to align the maturity profile of its long-term debts with its 
forecasted cash flow generation. More information about borrowing facilities is presented in note 11.3. Furthermore, 
strong cost and cash management, as well as controls over investment proposals, are in place.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and 
equity prices, will adversely affect HEINEKEN’s income or the value of its financial instruments. In 2022, we witnessed 
increased volatility in financial and commodity markets. The objective of HEINEKEN's market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable boundaries. 

HEINEKEN enters into derivatives and other financial liabilities to manage market risks. Generally, HEINEKEN seeks to 
apply hedge accounting or establish natural hedges to minimise the impact of market risks in profit or loss. Foreign 
currency, interest rate and commodity hedging operations are governed by internal policies and rules. 

Foreign currency risk  
HEINEKEN is exposed to:   

– Transactional risk on (future) sales, working capital, (future) purchases, deposits, borrowings and dividends 
denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of HEINEKEN entities 

– Translational risk, which is the risk resulting from the translation of foreign operations into the reporting currency of 
HEINEKEN  

The main currencies that give rise to this risk are the US Dollar, Mexican Peso, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Vietnamese 
Dong and Euro. In 2022, the transactional foreign exchange risk was hedged in line with the hedging policy to the extent 
possible. The resulting transactional impact was slightly negative, whereas the translational impact was positive.  

In managing foreign currency risk, HEINEKEN aims to ensure the availability of foreign currencies and to reduce the 
impact of short-term fluctuations on earnings. Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange 
rates and the availability of foreign currencies, especially in emerging markets, will have an impact on profit. 

HEINEKEN hedges up to 90% of its net US Dollar export cash flows on the basis of rolling cash flow forecasts of sales and 
purchases. Material cash flows in other foreign currencies are also hedged on the basis of rolling cash flow forecasts. For 
this hedging, HEINEKEN mainly uses forward exchange contracts. The majority of the forward exchange contracts have 
maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date. 

HEINEKEN has a clear policy on hedging transactional exchange risks. Translation exchange risks are hedged to a limited 
extent, as the underlying currency positions are generally considered to be long-term in nature. The result of the hedging 
of translation risk, using net investment hedges is recognised in the translation reserve, as can be seen in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. 

HEINEKEN's policy is to hedge material recognised transactional exposure like trade payables, receivables, borrowings 
and declared dividends. For material unrecognised transactional exposures like forecasted sales in foreign currencies, 
HEINEKEN hedges the exposure between agreed percentages according to the policy.  

It is HEINEKEN’s policy to provide intra-HEINEKEN financing in the functional currency of subsidiaries where possible to 
prevent foreign currency exposure on a subsidiary level. The resulting exposure at Group level is hedged by means of 
foreign-currency denominated external debts and by forward exchange contracts. Intra-HEINEKEN financing in foreign 
currencies is mainly in British Pound, US Dollar and Swiss Franc. In some cases, HEINEKEN elects to treat intra-HEINEKEN 
financing with a permanent character as equity and does not hedge the foreign currency exposure.  

HEINEKEN has financial liabilities in foreign currencies like US Dollar and British Pound to hedge local operations, which 
generate cash flows that have the same or closely correlated functional currencies. The corresponding interest on these 
liabilities is also denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of HEINEKEN. 

In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of 
HEINEKEN, HEINEKEN ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies 
at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.    

Exposure to foreign currency risk 
Based on notional amounts, HEINEKEN's transactional exposure to the US Dollar and Euro as at 31 December is as 
follows. The Euro column relates to transactional exposure to the Euro within subsidiaries which are reporting in other 
currencies. The amounts below include intra-HEINEKEN cash flows.

Profit/(Loss)  (67)  (10)  (33)  (5) 

The sensitivity analysis above shows the impact on equity and profit of a 10% strengthening of the US Dollar against the 
Euro or, in the case of the Euro, a strengthening of the Euro against all other currencies as at 31 December 2022. This 
analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. In the case of a 10% weakening, the 
effects are equal but with an opposite effect.

Interest rate risk  
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates affect the fair value or cash flows of a financial 
instrument. The most significant interest rate risk for HEINEKEN relates to borrowings (note 11.3). 

By managing interest rate risk, HEINEKEN aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on earnings. Over the 
longer term, however, permanent changes in interest rates will have an impact on profit.  

HEINEKEN opts for a mix of fixed and variable interest rate financial instruments like bonds, commercial paper and bank 
loans, combined with the use of derivative interest rate instruments. Currently, HEINEKEN’s interest rate position is more 
weighted towards fixed than floating. Interest rate derivative instruments that can be used are (cross-currency) interest 
rate swaps, forward rate agreements, caps and floors.

Interest rate risk – profile  
At the reporting date, the interest rate profile of HEINEKEN’s interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:

In millions of € 2022 2021

Fixed rate instruments

Financial assets  171  196 

Financial liabilities  (14,285)  (14,862) 

Cross-currency interest rate swaps  469  441 

 (13,645)  (14,225)

Financial liabilities  (2,092)  (2,010) 

Cross-currency interest rate swaps  (463)  (463) 

 631  1,061 

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments  
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates constantly applied during the reporting period would not have a material 
impact on equity and profit or loss. 

Commodity price risk  
Commodity price risk is the risk that changes in the prices of commodities will affect HEINEKEN’s cost. The objective of 
commodity price risk management is to manage and control commodity risk exposures within acceptable parameters, 
giving forward guidance of key input costs to allow for business planning. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, commodity 
markets have become increasingly volatile, coupled with increasing inflationary pressures, 2022 saw some of the largest 
price increases witnessed over the last 20 years. The main commodity exposure relates to the purchase of aluminium 
cans, glass bottles, malt and utilities. Commodity price risk is in principle mitigated by negotiating fixed prices in supplier 
contracts with various contract durations.  

Another method to mitigate commodity price risk is by entering into commodity derivatives. HEINEKEN enters into 
commodity derivatives for aluminium hedging and to a certain extent other derivatives for commodities like fuel, corn 
and sugar. HEINEKEN does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet HEINEKEN’s expected usage and 
sale requirements.  

Sensitivity analysis for aluminium hedges 
Despite the increased prices of aluminium, a 10% change in the market price of aluminium would not have a material 
impact on equity.  

11.6    Derivative financial instruments 
HEINEKEN uses derivatives in order to manage market risks. Refer to the table below for the fair value of derivatives 
recorded on the balance sheet of HEINEKEN as per reporting date:

Generally, HEINEKEN seeks to apply hedge accounting or make use of natural hedges in order to minimise profit and loss 
or cash flow volatility. Refer to the table below for derivatives that are used in hedge accounting:

Cash flow hedges 
The hedging of future, highly probable forecasted transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges 
are entered into to cover commodity price risk and transactional foreign exchange risk. 

Net investment hedges
HEINEKEN hedges its investments in certain subsidiaries by entering into local currency-denominated borrowings, 
forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps, which mitigate the foreign currency translation risk arising from 
the subsidiaries net assets. These borrowings, forward contracts and swaps are designated as net investment hedges and 
fully effective, as such, there was no ineffectiveness recognised in profit and loss in 2022 (2021: nil). As at 31 December 
2022, the fair value of these borrowings was €33 million (2021: €188 million), the market value of forward contracts 
was €1 million positive (2021: €1 million negative) and the market value of these swaps was €13 million positive 
(2021: €23 million negative).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



Fair value hedges 
HEINEKEN has entered into several cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) which have been designated as fair value 
hedges to hedge the foreign exchange rate risk on the principal amount and future interest payments of certain US 
Dollar borrowings. The borrowings and the cross-currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms. The 
accumulated gain arising on derivatives as designated hedging instruments in fair value hedges amounts to €3 million as 
at 31 December 2022 (2021: €13 million loss). The loss arising on the adjustment for the hedged item attributable to the 
hedged risk in a designated fair value hedge accounting relationship also amounts to €3 million as at 31 December 2022 
(2021: €13 million gain).

Hedge effectiveness 
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the start of the hedge relationship and periodically through a prospective 
effectiveness assessment to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument. This assessment is done qualitatively by comparing the critical terms, and if needed quantitative assessments 
are done using hypothetical derivatives. For the current hedges, no hedge ineffectiveness is expected. 

  Accounting policies  
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent accounting for derivatives depends on 
whether or not the derivatives are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow, fair value or net investment hedge. 
Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities. Refer to note 13.1 for fair 
value measurements. Virtual power purchase agreements (such as power purchase agreements with a net settlement 
mechanism and no physical delivery of energy) are accounted for at fair value and are included as part of derivatives 
assets and liabilities.

Cash flow hedge 
Changes in the fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve within 
equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. The ineffective part is recognised as other net finance income/(expense). 
When the hedged risk impacts the profit or loss, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are 
recycled through other comprehensive income and transferred to the same item in the profit or loss as the hedged item. 
When the hedged risk subsequently results in a non-financial asset or liability (e.g. inventory or P,P&E), the amount 
previously recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve is directly included in its carrying amount and does not affect other 
comprehensive income. 

Fair value hedge 
The fair value changes of derivatives used in fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss. 

Net investment hedge 
The fair value changes of derivatives used in net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
presented within equity in the translation reserve. Any ineffectiveness is recognised in profit or loss.

Net tax assets/(liabilities)  618  682  (2,138)  (1,971)  (1,520)  (1,289) 

Of the total net deferred tax assets of €618 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: €682 million), €84 million 
(2021: €566 million) is recognised in respect of subsidiaries in various countries where there have been losses in the 
current or preceding period. Management’s projections support the assumption that it is probable that the results of 
future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilise these deferred tax assets. This judgement is performed 
annually and based on budgets and business plans for the coming years, including planned commercial initiatives. 

No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates, with an impact of €573 million (2021: €521 million). This is because HEINEKEN is able to control the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 

Tax losses carried forward 
HEINEKEN has tax losses carried forward of €3,802 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: €3,752 million), out of which 
€389 million (2021: €236 million) expires in the following five years, €158 million (2021: €128 million) will expire after 
five years and €3,255 million (2021: €3,388 million) can be carried forward indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not 
been recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward of €2,470 million (2021: €1,959 million) as it is not probable that 
taxable profit will be available to offset these losses. Out of this €2,470 million (2021: €1,959 million), €276 million 
(2021: €198 million) expires in the following five years, €37 million (2021: €10 million) will expire after five years and 
€2,157 million (2021: €1,751 million) can be carried forward indefinitely.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements



  Accounting estimates and judgements 
The tax legislation in the countries in which HEINEKEN operates is often complex and subject to interpretation. In 
determining the current and deferred income tax position, judgement is required. New information may become 
available that causes HEINEKEN to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes 
to tax liabilities will impact the income tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. 

  Accounting policies 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected income tax payable or receivable in respect of 
taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustment to income tax payable in respect of previous years.   

Deferred tax is a tax payable or receivable in the future and is recognised in respect of temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax is not 
recognised on temporary differences related to:  
– The initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither 

accounting nor taxable profit or loss  
– Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to the extent that HEINEKEN is able to control the timing of the 

reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable (>50% chance) that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future   
– The initial recognition of non-deductible goodwill  

The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of recovery or settlement of the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates (substantively) enacted, at year-end. 

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which they can be utilised.  

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, 
and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable 
entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously. 

Current and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement (refer to note 12.1), except when it relates to a business 
combination or for items directly recognised in equity or other comprehensive income (refer to note 12.3).

13.1    Fair value 
In this note, more information is disclosed regarding the fair value and the different methods of determining fair values. 

Financial instruments - hierarchy 
The financial instruments included on the HEINEKEN statement of financial position are measured at either fair value or 
amortised cost. To measure the fair value, HEINEKEN generally uses external valuations with market inputs. The 
measurement of fair value can be subjective in some cases and may be dependent on inputs used in the calculations. 
The different valuation methods are referred to as ‘hierarchies’ as described below.  

– Level 1 - The fair value is determined using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
– Level 2 - The fair value is calculated using inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable 

for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). 
– Level 3 - The fair value is determined using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market 

data (unobservable inputs). 

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities according to their fair 
value hierarchy.

The fair values for the level 3 fair value through OCI investments are based on the financial performance of the 
investments and the market multiples of comparable equity securities.   

  Accounting estimates 
The different methods applied by HEINEKEN to determine the fair value require the use of estimates.

Investments in equity securities   
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and fair value through OCI is determined by reference 
to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date or, if unquoted, determined using an appropriate valuation 
technique. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where available.  

Derivative financial instruments 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on their listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is 
not available, fair value is in general estimated by discounting the difference between the cash flows based on 
contractual price and the cash flows based on the current price for the residual maturity of the contract using observable 
interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. These calculations are tested for reasonableness by 
comparing the outcome of the internal valuation with the valuation received from the counterparty. Fair values include 
the instrument’s credit risk and adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the HEINEKEN entity and counterparty 
when appropriate.  

Non-derivative financial instruments  
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes or when fair value hedge accounting is applied, is calculated based 
on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting 
date. Fair values include the instrument’s credit risk and adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the HEINEKEN 
entity and counterparty when appropriate.

with Distell, NBL and Ohlthaver & List Group of Companies (O&L), to integrate their respective and relevant businesses in 
Southern Africa into one enlarged company. The shareholders of NBL and Distell approved the proposed transaction on 
20 December 2021 and 15 February 2022, respectively. Completion of the proposed transaction is conditional on

2  Stepped down as CFO and member of the Executive Board as of 1 May 2021.

The matching share entitlements for each year are based on the performance in that year. The Executive Board members 
receive 25% of their STI pay in (investment) shares. In addition, they have the opportunity to indicate before year-end 
whether they wish to receive up to another 25% of their STI in (investment) shares. All (investment) shares are restricted for 
sale for five calendar years, after which they are matched 1:1 by (matching) shares. For 2022 the Executive Board members 
elected to receive additional (investment) shares, hence the ‘Matching share entitlement’ in the table above is based on a 
50% investment. The corresponding matching shares vest immediately and as such a fair value of €1.9 million was 
recognised in the 2022 income statement. The matching share entitlements are not dividend-bearing during the five-
calendar year holding period of the investment shares. Therefore, the fair value of the matching share entitlements has 
been adjusted for missed expected dividends by applying a discount based on the dividend policy and vesting period.

Brew a Better 
World 2030
We are building execution and operational momentum to bring our 
stepped-up Brew a Better World 2030 ambitions to life. This means  
weaving sustainability into the fabric of how we run our business 
and the decisions we make, every day.
Achieving our Brew a Better World ambitions will require a number of 
shifts – from good progress to next-level ambition, from solid 
execution to global learning and sharing, from effective local 
partnership working to strategic global partnerships, and from stand-
alone performance tracking to fully integrated performance 
management. We have also introduced long-term incentive targets 
linked to Brew a Better World progress for all our leaders globally. 

None of us have done this before and we are learning together, 
sharing experience and collaborating internally, across our operating 
companies, and externally with our partners and peers.

Brew a Better World 2030 strategy



Inspiring a better world 
We brew the joy of true togetherness to inspire a better world. Our Brew a Better 
World 2030 strategy directly contributes to the UN SDGs and is woven into the 
fabric of our balanced growth strategy, EverGreen. 

Agriculture Brewing Packaging. Logistics Customers Consumers
We use natural ingredients to brew 
our beer and make our cider. By 
supporting sustainable farming, 
we aim to have 100% of our main 
ingredients (barley and hops) 
sustainably sourced by 2030. 
Developing responsible agricultural 
supply chains to increase our 
volumes of sustainable raw 
materials is a key priority for growing 
our business and a crucial lever for 
reducing our carbon footprint. In 
2022, we worked on more than 200 
projects of our Low Carbon Farming 
Programme around the world.

During 2022, we operated 186 
breweries, malteries, cider plants and 
other facilities globally. We are on 
the path to net zero carbon 
emissions in scopes 1 and 2 by 2030 
and across our full value chain by 
2040. Our water strategy focuses on 
working towards healthy watersheds 
by combining internal and external 
efforts to support water security. All 
our production sites are on track to 
send zero waste to landfill by 2025. 

Our packaging must be distinctive 
and visible without burdening the 
environment. By investing in design 
and innovation, we aim to develop 
low carbon and circular solutions.  
We work closely with our suppliers to 
create and scale efficient and 
sustainable packaging, launching 
initiatives to reduce the amount of 
material in our packs, reuse 
packaging waste and increase 
returnable packaging. 

Every second, our products are on 
the move somewhere in the world 
on trucks, trains and ships. We aim to 
reduce the environmental impacts of 
our logistics and lower emissions by 
optimising routes, supporting 
suppliers to adopt low carbon 
technologies, shifting to renewable 
energy in our warehouses and using 
fuel-efficient transport in distribution. 

Our drinks are sold via bars, 
restaurants and retailers around the 
world. Our Green Cooling programme 
has resulted in 100% of newly 
purchased fridges meeting low 
carbon footprint standards meaning 
they emit over 55% less carbon than 
those purchased 10 years ago. 
By 2030, we aim to have all fridges 
used by customers to cool our 
beverages to be in one of the Energy 
Efficiency Index’s top energy classes. 

Brew a Better World means 
empowering consumers by 
providing choice, transparency and 
zero tolerance of the harmful use of 
alcohol. Our ambition is to serve 0.0 
always, everywhere – ensuring our 
consumers around the world have a 
choice. Non-alcoholic products play 
an increasingly significant role in 
our industry-leading messaging 
on responsible consumption 
and moderation.

Our impact from Barley to Bar



Stakeholder engagement 
and materiality
We defined our Brew a Better World priorities through open conversations and 
engagement with our stakeholders – both internal and external. This ensures we are 
addressing the most important issues and those on which we have the greatest 
potential impact – both positive and negative. We listen and learn from others and 
use our voice, reach and influence to help drive positive change.

Engaging with our stakeholders
Ongoing dialogue is instrumental in shaping our 2030 
agenda. It helps us understand the issues, risks and 
opportunities that are most relevant to our business 
and stakeholders. 

We engage with NGOs, academic experts, customers, 
investors, government representatives and industry peers 
to learn and gather feedback on our strategy, ambitions 
and progress. This dialogue is an opportunity to share 
experiences and dilemmas and discuss industry trends 
and opportunities for innovation and collaboration. 
Discussions cover our sustainability performance, overall 
agenda and future plans. We zoom in on key issues like 
carbon, water, responsible consumption, human rights, 
local sourcing and the opportunities and challenges of 
doing business in Africa. 

In 2022, we engaged with a wide range of stakeholders. 
We held ESG meetings with over 20 key investors and 
80 investors joined our Capital Markets Event 
in December. 

We attended COP27 where we joined panels and met with 
civil society and government officials. We also participated 
in advocacy initiatives through the Alliance for CEO 
Climate Leaders, the World Economic Forum, UN Global 
Compact, the Water Resilience Coalition, RE100, the 
RE-Source Platform and the Dutch Sustainable Growth 
Coalition. We held regular meetings with NGOs like Human 
Rights Watch, WWF and the Fair Wage Foundation.

We actively engaged with our top suppliers in agriculture, 
packaging and cooling to help deliver our Brew a Better 
World goals and engaged with customers like Tesco, 
Carrefour and Walmart on our carbon footprint. 

We collaborated and built on best practices with peer 
industries through platforms like Climate Week NYC, 
The Climate Pledge, the Consumer Goods Forum, and 
the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable.

Important themes in 2022 
Our stakeholder meetings highlighted a number of 
relevant and recurring themes. In the table opposite, 
we summarise some of the most common questions we 
received from stakeholders in 2022 and our response. 

Theme Our response 
Carbon emissions We take a long-term view on the investments needed to deliver our Brew a 

Better World ambitions. Many of these are positive to margins and will be 
funded in the short term by our €2 billion cost-saving programme. More 
importantly, the required investment is generally significantly lower than the 
cost would be if we do not invest. More detail on the risks can be found in our 
TCFD section. We have ring-fenced the CAPEX needed in our strategic and 
annual planning processes for carbon and water to ensure these remain 
priorities for action within the business.

How much will you invest to deliver 
ambitious goals such as net zero in all 
your breweries? 

Biodiversity Biodiversity and the health of ecosystems are closely connected with our 
actions to support healthy watersheds, reach net zero emissions across the 
value chain and aim for 100% sustainably sourced barley and hops. However, 
we realise we need to do more to understand and address biodiversity risks 
and opportunities in a more coherent way. We closely monitor developments 
and guidance of the Taskforce on Nature related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD) and Science Based Targets for Nature (SBTN). We are developing an 
improved accounting approach for land use change and have joined the 
Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) consultation group. We are building on 
existing programmes that address biodiversity and exploring further 
opportunities, including regenerative agriculture.

What’s HEINEKEN’s view on 
biodiversity and its importance on the 
ESG agenda? 

Inclusion and diversity We believe in fair and equal opportunities for all our employees. We are 
working towards equal pay for equal work between female and male 
colleagues and are working to achieve gender and cultural balance in our 
leadership teams. We are also exploring how to make certain benefits, like a 
life and disability insurance, accessible for all employees worldwide, 
regardless of their family situation.

How do you ensure that everyone has 
a fair access to opportunities within 
HEINEKEN?

Responsible consumption We believe that alcohol, when consumed in moderation, can be part of a 
well-balanced lifestyle. Our purpose is to brew the joy of true togetherness, 
and responsible consumption is key to this. Our 2030 goals are focused on 
making moderation cool, addressing the harmful use of alcohol, providing 
consumers with a choice (with our growing 0.0 portfolio) and providing the 
right information through fully transparent labelling.

How can an alcohol company be 
viewed positively through an ESG lens 
given the harm that the abuse of 
alcohol causes?

Human rights We continue to be shocked and saddened by what is happening in Ukraine. 
At the end of March 2022, we concluded that HEINEKEN's ownership of the 
business in Russia is not sustainable nor viable in the current environment. 
As a result, we decided to leave Russia and sell our business. The transfer to a 
new owner will be in full compliance with international and local laws. We will 
not profit from any sale or transfer of ownership.

Will you leave Russia, given the war 
in Ukraine?

Transparency We are enhancing our reporting capabilities and approach, including 
transitioning non-financial reporting to be a responsibility of the Finance 
team. This will increase the rigour of our reporting in alignment with 
emerging requirements while ensuring that we focus on the issues that 
matter to us. For more information, see the TCFD section and Other climate-
related disclosures.

Are you ready for the new reporting 
regulations and requirements, such as 
CSRD, EU Taxonomy, ISSB and TCFD?

Stakeholder engagement and materiality



Materiality assessment
We updated our materiality matrix in 2020 as a 
foundation for developing our 2030 strategy. The 
materiality assessment process enabled us to identify and 
prioritise our most material issues, based on the extent to 
which they are found to:

– have a significant current or potential impact on our 
business or vice versa;

– be of significant interest to our stakeholders; and
– be an issue over which we have a reasonable degree of 

control where it comes to our impacts.

We used the outcomes of the assessment to shape our 
Brew a Better World strategy and reporting.

Our 2020 materiality assessment process comprised a 
number of steps:

Our materiality matrix
The materiality matrix plots our most material sustainability issues based on their impact on our business and interest to 
stakeholders. In line with the upcoming CSRD framework, we are planning to conduct a double materiality exercise in 2023  
and will publish an updated matrix in our next report.

ESG benchmarks and disclosure 
frameworks
We participate in a selection of benchmarks, ratings and 
disclosure frameworks that matter most to our stakeholders. 

In 2022, we were included on the CDP  ‘A list’ for Climate 
Change and scored A- for Water. We were also rated AA in 
MSCI’s ESG rating for the third consecutive year, and 
according to Sustainalytics HEINEKEN is top-rated among 
companies in its industry group.

We support convergence towards universal, comparable 
disclosures as discussed in the chapters on TCFD, EU 
Taxonomy and the World Economic Forum (WEF) 
Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.

Read more about our performance in the 
Benchmarks and Ratings section of our website

How engagement impacts local decisions
Multi-stakeholder engagement influences our local 
decision-making as well as global strategy. For example, 
the city of Monterrey, Mexico, which also houses our 
largest brewery, faced an unexpected drought in 2022. 
Although the beer industry uses less than 1% of the water 
in Monterrey, the drought impacted the community. 

Working together with government, NGOs and other 
businesses within the framework of the Monterrey 
Metropolitan Water Fund, we mobilised to provide 
500,000 litres of drinking water weekly to the most 
affected communities in Monterrey. We also supplied 
public hospitals and the Red Cross with 7.5 million cans of 
drinking water. In addition, we also financed the search 
and drilling for a new deep well for public use and 
temporarily transferred part of our water rights to the 
public utilities.

Our Brew a Better World 2030 goals and progress



Acting now to protect 
the environment for 
the long-term
Our Brew a Better World strategy is built on the 
understanding that we can only thrive when our planet is 
healthy and thriving. Climate change has already altered 
ecosystems and it is negatively impacting agriculture and 
people’s health and livelihoods around the world. We 
must act now to dramatically reduce the long-term 
devastating impacts on our climate, biodiversity, water 
and natural resources, with business playing a central role.

We are leaning into our biggest 
opportunities and challenges with our 
ambition to reach net zero carbon 
emissions in our production and across 
our entire value chain. Maximising the 
circularity of products and processes and 
contributing to the health of local 
watersheds is central to this mission.

Reach net zero carbon 
emissions

As well as being a global threat to humanity, climate 
change impacts our business in a myriad of ways. 
HEINEKEN is committed to taking action that will help 
limit global warming to 1.5°C and safeguard the planet. 
This ambition will shape the way we do business for the 
decades to come. 

Our strategy is aligned with the sixth report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and 
translates ambition into action to reduce emissions and 
help restore healthy functioning ecosystems. 

In April 2021, we disclosed our Brew a Better World 
ambition to aim for net zero carbon emissions across our 
entire value chain by 2040. We also set intermediate goals 
to reach net zero in scope 1 and 2 and reduce our scope 3 
emissions by 21%, by 2030. This means we are aiming 
to reduce our emissions across our value chain by 30% 
by 2030. 

We continuously review our strategies and goals against the 
latest science. This includes measuring progress against 
verified science-based targets which determine how much 
and how quickly we need to reduce emissions to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 

In 2022, we kick started our strategy, setting up a team of 
experts and developing robust governance while engaging 
with external stakeholders including suppliers, peers and 
partners to take collaborative action to drive the low-
carbon transition.

Science Based Targets initiative 
We joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 
2019 and we have contributed to their Net-Zero Standard 
and Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) standard as 
technical advisor. 

The SBTi has approved our 2030 near-term target to 
reach net zero emissions in scope 1 and 2 and reduce our 
total emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3) by 30% by 2030. In 
2023, we will work to gain validation of our long-term 
target to reach net zero emissions across the entire value 
chain by 2040.

Reducing emissions from barley to bar
Our strategy is based on the four Rs: Reduce, Replace, 
Remove and Report. We are working to decrease absolute 
carbon emissions across the entire value chain – from 
barley to bar – with supplier engagement and sustainable 
sourcing playing an important role.

We are reducing fossil energy demand by delivering 
production efficiencies and process innovations, developing 
new capabilities to improve our manufacturing processes 
and sharing our capabilities to empower suppliers. 

We are replacing the remaining energy used by our 
suppliers, breweries and customers as much as possible 
with renewable energy. Aligned with the SBTi Net-Zero 
Standard, we strive to only compensate for residual carbon 
emissions that we have not been able to reduce or replace 
as a last resort by investing in verified high-quality 
offsetting projects. We are monitoring the voluntary 
carbon market and plan to develop a strategy for carbon 
compensation in 2023. 

We will continue to report transparently on our successes 
and challenges on the path to net zero. We are improving 
emissions reporting and working closely with the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) and Climate Group’s RE100 to 
provide granular data that is consistent, transparent and 
understandable to external audiences.

This year, out of nearly 15,000 companies, we are proud 
to have earned a place on CDP’s Climate Change A List 
for leadership in environmental transparency on 
climate change.

Empowering our employees
We are mobilising our employees and educating them 
about climate change and the importance of HEINEKEN’s 
response to develop the capabilities they need to help 
reach our ambitions. Climate upskilling training is designed 
to equip people with scientific knowledge, tools and 
inspiration with content personalised to make the learning 
experience as meaningful as possible. Since its launch, 
900 employees have taken up the training and we will 
continue to engage with the rest of our employees.

Total carbon footprint 2021

2030 goal

Net zero carbon emissions in 
scope 1 and 2
Meeting our goal to reach net zero in scope 1 and 2 by 
2030 requires us to optimise our processes, reduce energy 
demand and replace fossil fuels with renewable energy 
across all our sites. In 2022, we reduced our scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 18% vs. 2018 baseline meaning we are on 
track for our 2030 goal.

Net zero in production
Emissions from our production sites (breweries, malting 
and cider plants) represents 87% of total scope 1 and 2 
emissions and the rest of scope 1 and 2 is related to our 
own logistics activities and offices. 

One of the key actions of our net zero strategy is to reduce 
energy consumption in our breweries for both thermal 
energy (70%) and electricity (30%).

In 2022, we launched a new programme, called 
Integrated Net Zero Production, and established a 
cross-functional team of internal experts and external 
suppliers to drive progress. The programme started with 
30 production sites spanning all regions and will accelerate 
to eventually cover all production sites. 

To date, we have identified 90 good practices to reduce 
electricity and thermal energy consumption. These are 
being implemented across our production sites. In Austria, 
we piloted an initiative to improve the thermal energy 
consumption during the pasteurisation process of our 
products, achieving around 17% reduction in energy 
consumption. In Poland, we delivered several energy 
efficiency projects including a system to recover energy 
from cold filtered beer and reuse it in the cooling process. 
While in Brazil and Hungary, we piloted a new internal 
cleaning process for packaging lines with tunnel 
pasteurisers at ambient temperatures, reducing around 
30% of their thermal energy. More breweries will now 
implement this improved cleaning process. 

The current average combined energy consumption of all 
our production sites is 90.4 MJ/hl (2021: 89.5 MJ/hl).

Since 2018, we have reduced absolute carbon emissions in 
production by 17%. Without our recent acquisition of 
United Breweries in India, we would have achieved a 23% 
reduction vs. the 2018 baseline. This acquisition triggers 
an adjustment of our baseline to year 2022.  

Shifting to renewable energy
Shifting our energy use to renewable sources is at the core 
of our net zero strategy. It has also been valuable in 
future-proofing our operations from potential energy 
security risks emerging from geopolitical conflicts.

In 2022, 58% of total electrical energy came from 
renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro) while 28% of total 
thermal energy demand was renewable (biogas, waste 
heat pumps, biomass). This means we have increased 
our total share of combined renewable energy to 37% 
(2021: 27%).

We aim for all our electricity to eventually come from 
renewable sources. As a member of RE100, we adopt a 
hierarchy of renewable energy solutions. This prioritises 
new assets – both on-site wind, solar and hydro power that 
supply electricity directly to our breweries and off-site 
assets, including wind and solar, supplied through long-
term power purchase agreements (PPAs).

Renewable energy sources

37% energy from renewable sources

In South Africa, we built a new solar plant to power our 
Sedibeng Brewery outside Johannesburg with 6.5 MW of 
electricity. The installation includes 14,000 solar panels 
and can meet 30% of the brewery’s electricity demand. 

In Nigeria, we are supplying renewable electricity to two 
sites through an off-site PPA which supplies electricity 
generated by a hydro-power project.

There are still significant barriers to sourcing renewable 
energy in some countries. Rather than waiting, we aim to 
stimulate our operating companies by procuring Energy 
Attribute Certificates (EACs) through International 
Renewable Energy Certificates (I-RECs) as a first step until 
barriers are removed. 

In 2022, we procured I-RECs in Vietnam from recent solar 
projects as well as in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. This is a 
temporary step towards meeting our goal and we will 
continue working with these operating companies to 
develop new renewable capacity.

In Europe, we partner with RE-Source to develop a legal 
framework for corporates to source renewable electricity.

Our aim is to source thermal energy used in production 
from renewable sources by 2030. Thermal energy 
accounts for 70% of our total production energy demand 
but it is the most challenging to replace with renewable 
thermal solutions. This is because the renewable thermal 
market is not as mature as the electricity market and 
progress requires a site-by-site approach. 

Through our Integrated Net Zero Production Programme, 
our central technical experts are working with breweries to 
develop roadmaps that rely on technologies such as 
bioenergy (biomass, biogas, biomethane) while piloting 
innovative technologies such as heat pumps or 
solar thermal.

One example is our brewery in Cambodia which, like 
Vietnam and Indonesia, has started to use agricultural 
waste as a sustainable source of biomass. The aim is to 
deploy this solution across our remaining Southeast Asian 
breweries. To ensure the sustainability of feedstock, we 
joined the Roundtable of Sustainable Biomass (RBS) to 
develop policy and audits of our biomass suppliers.

In partnership with Engie, our Seville Brewery in Spain 
commissioned the construction of the first-ever solar-
thermal plant. This innovative project uses the sun’s heat 
to generate renewable thermal energy. While in France, 
we secured our first contract of biomethane from a local 
farmer near our Mons Brewery, allowing us to cover 100% 
of our thermal energy demand.

Shifting to renewable electricity at production sites also 
allows us to tackle our logistics warehousing emissions 
(scope 1 and 2). In 2022, we increased the share of 
renewable electricity for our warehouses to 46% and we 
continue to replace our fossil-fuel forklift trucks with 
electric ones.

2030 and 2040 goal

Absolute reduction scope 3 of 21% 
by 2030
Net zero emissions in our total carbon footprint 
by 2040 
Our ambition to reduce scope 3 emissions by 21% vs. 
2018 baseline will help us achieve our 2030 goal and set 
us on the path for net zero across our value chain by 2040. 

Scope 3 emissions accounted for 92% of our total 
company carbon footprint in 2021. Every year, we 
improve the accuracy of the calculation of scope 3 
categories to properly size our footprint and our aim is to 
disclose them annually with our scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
We will disclose our 2022 scope 3 emissions in the second  
quarter of 2023 on our Company website. 

Our 2021 total carbon footprint reduced by 2% and our 
scope 3 emissions decreased by 0.4% versus the 2018 
baseline, but increased against last year due to volume 
recovery in key markets after COVID-19 and global supply 
chain issues that impacted our sourcing strategy. This is a 
temporary impact and we will continue to deliver on our 
scope 3 reduction strategy.

From barley to bar, we collaborate with suppliers to set 
science-based targets and engage with strategic partners to 
decarbonise the industry. We also work to reduce emissions 
by optimising our processes, shifting to renewable energy, 
and piloting innovative technologies in our top four 
categories: agriculture, packaging, cooling and logistics. 

Supplier engagement 
Reducing emissions across the entire value chain will not be 
possible without engaging with our suppliers across all 
categories. Our role is to educate suppliers and support 
them in creating decarbonisation roadmaps. We joined 
Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (SLoCT), an 
industry consortium launching a climate school to develop 
40 suppliers across packaging, agriculture and cooling with 
an additional 28 suppliers due to join in 2023.

Agriculture accounts for 33% of our carbon footprint. We 
are continuing our Low-Carbon Farming Programme by 
partnering with suppliers and farmers. We have now 
completed 200 pilots to test low carbon agricultural 
practices, especially for our main crops – barley and maize 
– across different markets. We measure the results and 
impact of these practices on both carbon reduction 
and sequestration.

Packaging accounts for 27% of our total footprint. We have 
launched a new programme – Packaging the Future – 
through which our top 50 suppliers, accounting for 80% of 
our packaging-related emissions, have committed to set 
science-based targets by 2023. Through this programme, 
suppliers set targets to move to 100% renewable electricity 
in key markets by 2025, followed by the remaining markets 
by 2030.

To tackle the 8% of our carbon footprint that is related to 
refrigeration of our products, we engaged with the top 23 
fridge suppliers and Beverage Industry Environmental 
Roundtable (BIER) members in the first-ever ‘CoolBIER’ 
conference to discuss opportunities for a radical change in 
energy efficiency (and circularity) of commercial 
refrigeration. The outcome was an agreement to establish a 
value-chain coalition – including our suppliers and retailers – 
to standardise energy protocols and set guiding principles 
for circularity. 

Optimisation
Optimising our operations to reduce energy consumption 
remains a priority, especially for categories where 
technology is not yet scalable. For packaging, we are 
reducing emissions by shifting to returnable rather than 
single-use bottles, light weighting bottles and optimising 
pack size. 

While for logistics activities, which represent10% of our 
total carbon footprint, we are focused on optimising 
logistics operations by developing transport management 
and warehousing capabilities and advancing digital 
tooling. For example, we are deploying a Global Truck 
Utilisation Improvement programme in 41 markets to 
optimise how we utilise our fleet. We encourage our fleet 
managers and suppliers to reduce fuel consumption by 
deploying fuel management capabilities.

In Mexico, we set performance indicators on fuel 
consumption, driver behaviour and preventive truck 
maintenance which resulted in saving 557,000 litres of fuel. 

We are also reducing the use of heavy-duty trucks, which 
now comprise 90% of our transport, by shifting to other 
modes such as barge and rail. We have continued to 
increase the share of cabotage in Brazil and started to use 
rail transport in 2022.

Innovations
Innovation is a big part of our culture and piloting modern 
technologies and understanding how to deploy them will 
be pivotal in our net zero journey. To improve the cooling 
of our products, we have completed the prototype for two 
different technologies: a fast-cooling technology called 
‘Chill it’ that allows cooling of our products within 30 
seconds, and an IoT (Internet of Things) solution for retail 
to track the effectiveness of our fridges at points of sales. 

We are also piloting medium-sized electric trucks for city 
distribution. In 2022, we allocated a central budget and 
purchased eight electric trucks in Europe, Mexico and 
Brazil, which encouraged these markets to invest in an 
additional 15 trucks. 

In Spain, we are using electric scooters to deliver beer in 
three Spanish cities. After a successful pilot in Seville, the 
project has been expanded to Madrid and Málaga. This 
innovation will avoid an estimated 25,000 kilos of CO2-
equivalents per year by delivering beer to bars in a quieter 
and less polluting way.

Strategic partnerships
Partnerships with non-profit organisations, suppliers and 
peer companies are key to achieving our net zero goal. 

We played an active role at Climate Week in NYC and 
COP27 in Egypt to advocate for accelerated action on 
climate change and learn from other organisations. 
We are also engaged in multiple platforms such as 
World Economic Forum (WEF), CEO Climate Alliance, 
Climate Group’s RE100, Amazon’s the Climate Pledge, 
Race to Zero and Business Ambition for 1.5oC to drive 
systemic change across industries. 

In addition, we pursue category-specific partnerships.

In 2022, we extended our existing membership with 
Smart Freight Center and joined Smart Freight Buyers 
Alliance (SFBA) to collaborate with peer companies on 
catalyst projects in the freight sector. 

We have also established a global partnership with our 
draught beer equipment suppliers and technical lab 
(Re-gent) to optimise the energy consumption of 
our equipment.

We also engage in local partnerships to benefit 
communities while doing business. For example, in Brazil 
we entered in a partnership to collect and recycle our glass 
bottles especially since making our packaging more 
circular is one way to reduce emissions.

Looking ahead
In 2023, we will continue our efforts to accelerate the 
delivery of our goal of net zero in scope 1 and 2. For scope 
3 we will focus on key areas that allow us to scale impact 
including strategic sourcing across our main categories, 
developing a portfolio of low-carbon products and 
investing in specific intervention in the value chain to 
stimulate transition. Additionally, we will develop our 
approach to identify the right carbon removal strategy 
that generates credible, impactful and high quality carbon 
credits to address residual emissions. 

Our long-term target is to reach net zero across our value 
chain by 2040. In 2023, we aim to submit our 2040 target 
to SBTi and, given the improvement made in our 
methodology and the integration of new businesses such 
as United Breweries in India, we intend to report our future 
performance based on 2022 carbon footprint.

For more information, see page 155 in TCFD section.

2030 goal

100% sustainably sourced ingredients 
(hops, barley) 
Developing responsible agricultural supply chains to 
increase our volumes of sustainable raw materials is a key 
priority for our growing business and a crucial lever for 
reducing our carbon footprint. 

Growing the raw materials that are used in our products 
makes a significant contribution to our value chain 
emissions. Other environmental impacts relate to water 
resources, soil health and biodiversity. 

We have a goal for 100% of our barley and hops to be 
sustainably sourced by 2030. We will achieve this by 
increasing our support to suppliers and committing to 
higher agricultural standards. 

We base our standards for sourcing sustainably cultivated 
crops on the globally recognised Sustainable Agriculture 
Initiative Platform (SAI) principles. This requires the 
efficient production of safe, high quality agricultural 
products in a way that protects and improves the natural 
environment, enhances the social and economic 
conditions of farmers, their employees and local 
communities, and safeguards the health and welfare of 
farmed species. 

Improving farming practices
We have made good progress in improving farming 
practices and sourcing sustainable crops by working with 
local suppliers. 

In 2022, 96% of our hops (2021: 92%) and 73% of our 
barley (2021: 66%) came from sustainable sources, 
resulting in 73% coming from hops and barley. 

Overall, 67% of all our crop-related raw materials came 
from sustainable sources (2021: 65%).

We made great efforts to increase our local sustainable 
sourcing by intensifying our partnership with suppliers and 
improving farming practices.

In Australia, we didn’t have access to sustainable barley, 
but we started partnering with a local supplier that will 
deliver sustainable sourced barley accredited to SAI Silver 
level. This is a huge step forward in the region.

Low Carbon Farming Programme
We launched our Low Carbon Farming Programme in 
2020 to reduce CO2 emissions from agriculture by shifting 
to low carbon farming practices. 

In most cases, we engage with farmers via our malted 
barley and maize suppliers. They advise the farmers on the 
different regenerative protocols (e.g. cover cropping, no 
tillage, organic matter use), seeds and fertilisers that can 
be used. The farmers decide which protocol(s) to apply, to 
lead their own farming and harvesting process. 

Pilots in 2021 show a 25% CO2 emissions reduction and 
40% increase in CO2 sequestration. In 2022, we continued 
working on more than 200 projects globally, including in 
Mexico, Brazil, France, UK, Ireland and Australia.

Maximise circularity
Unsustainable patterns of consumption and production 
are a major cause of climate change, biodiversity loss, 
waste generation and pollution. But demand for finite 
natural resources will continue to increase with global 
population growth. 

The current economy is mainly linear, meaning we take 
resources to make products which we use and then throw 
away. To protect the planet and ensure enough food and 
water for all, we must move to a circular economy which 
stops waste being generated in the first place. 

We have started to develop a circularity strategy focused on 
our products and operations. This will amplify our adoption 
of circular principles to move away from the ‘take-make-
waste’ model to an ‘eliminate-circulate-regenerate’ one. This 
is in line with the principles of the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation, of which we are a member. 

With our products, we have initiated projects to reduce our 
packaging, make it more reusable and increase 
recyclability and recycled content. This is an area where we 
have exciting opportunities to do more. 

Examples of how we already adopt circularity in our 
operations include converting spent grains into animal 
feed and human food sources, generating organic fertiliser 
from our wastewater sludge and recycling water within 
our breweries. 

2025 goal

Zero waste to landfill for all our 
production sites 
Beginning with our own operations, our goal is to send 
zero waste to landfill across all our production sites 
worldwide by 2025. 

Most of our production waste is comprised of 
biodegradable co-products like brewers’ grain, surplus 
yeast, anaerobic sludge from wastewater, spent kieselguhr 
and spent alcohol. We preserve the nutritional value of by-
products by recirculating them in animal and human food 
applications. Where this is not possible, we recycle them as 
bio-based materials or soil organic fertilisers, contributing 
to circularity and lowering carbon emissions. 

More than 40 of our operations spanning all regions now 
harvest the biogas from anaerobic digestion in our 
wastewater treatment plants as a renewable energy source. 

In 2022, 143 of our 186 sites were landfill-free (2021: 123 
sites) and 1% of our total waste ended up in landfill 
(2021: 1%). 

Destination of co-products
This table shows where our residual materials from 
production ended up in 2022 (the higher up in the 
hierarchy, the better).

Co-products and waste hierarchy
Destination ktonnes %     

1. Reuse 33,899 1%
2. Human consumption 64,292 1%
3. Animal feed 4,171,282 80%
4. Materials recycling 430,495 8%
5. Compost/soil improvement 365,454 7%
6. Energy (biogas) 34,930 1%
7. Combustion with energy recovery 60,493 1%
8. Combustion without energy 10,521 0%
9. Landfill (incl. dump and 
     unknown destination)

66,822 1%

Total 5,238,188 100%

In Nigeria, several sites are now landfill-free through 
actions such as substantially reducing the mixed waste 
stream and recycling waste labels into ceiling tiles, wall 
slabs, door inserts and other building materials.

Operating companies reduced their waste arising from the 
co-products of the brewing process and found opportunities 
to convert these co-products into valuable destinations. 

Papua New Guinea, although an isolated island, decreased 
the waste sent to landfill by more than 40% by connecting 
with farmers to use spent grain for animal feed and by re-
using cardboard, paper and wood.

We continuously look for ways to improve the circularity of 
our non-biodegradable outputs on-site and engage in 
closed loop projects with glass, plastic and paper waste to 
maximise reuse of our packaging materials.

In Poland, we increased the value of our pallet waste 
stream by moving away from incineration. The pallets are 
now reused to produce furniture. As a result the waste to 
incineration has substantially reduced to almost zero. 

2030 goal

Turn waste into value and close material 
loops throughout the value chain – 
strategy and targets in development
Taking a systemic approach, a cross-functional team is 
developing a circularity strategy looking at key 
opportunities to reduce our material footprint and 
improve reusability and recyclability.

Making our product packaging returnable is a key priority 
and approximately 38% of our packaging is now produced 
in a returnable format. We want to build on this by 
supporting existing and emerging deposit return schemes 
and other mechanisms to drive reuse at scale.

For example, we are involved in several initiatives across 
Brazil, for example: 

We are one of the main supporters of ‘Glass is Good’, led 
by the Brazilian Beverage Association (Abrabe) which 
promotes glass collection at bars and events across 16 of 
Brazil’s major cities. 

‘Ecogesto’ is a partnership which supports waste picker and 
recycling co-operatives across everything from licensing 
and worker safety to establishing solid waste delivery 
points and environmental education. 

Molecoola is a loyalty programme which allows consumers 
to earn points by depositing recyclable materials in 
containers at supermarkets which we are delivering in 
partnership with Carrefour. 

SO+MA Advantages aims to develop the glass recycling 
chain and support socioeconomic development in the city 
of Salvador. Registered users can exchange recyclable 
materials for courses, exams, basic food goods, 
experiences and discounts at supermarkets. Over 12,000 
families are now registered with the programme and more 
than 842,000 kg waste has been collected.

Towards healthy 
watersheds

The world’s freshwater ecosystems are under huge 
pressure from the competing demands of agriculture, 
business and communities. One of the primary effects of 
climate change is disruption of the water cycle and 
changing weather patterns are already making some 
places wetter and others much drier. 

From using 5 hl of water to produce 1 hl beer in 2008, we 
have improved our average water usage to 3.3 hl of water 
to produce 1 hl of our beer produced in 2022. We believe 
more needs to be done. 

Our 2030 water strategy – Towards Healthy Watersheds – 
looks beyond traditional water metrics to prioritise the 
health of local watersheds. We focus on positive water 
impact combining internal actions to ensure responsible 
water usage and wastewater management and to 
promote water security beyond our brewery walls, 
especially in water-stressed areas.

Our water strategy focuses on three goals with more 
ambitious ones for sites located in water-stressed areas.
– Reduce our water usage to 2.9 hl/hl beer globally and 

2.6 hl in water-stressed areas by 2030.
– Treat 100% of wastewater and maximise reuse 

and recycling. 
– Fully balance all water used in our products in water- 

stressed areas by 2030 through watershed 
protection programmes. 

Understanding our water risks
We have assessed water risks across our breweries and 
beyond since 2010 using a three-step approach which 
comprises internal and external assessments and 
verification. Every year, our operating companies conduct a 
local water security assessment. We also carry out a Global 
Water Risk Screening (GWRS) every five years with the latest 
completed in 2021. We use water risk mapping tools 
developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) to 
identify sites located at high water risk areas. In addition, we 
use geospatial data as an extra layer, to further understand 
water risks that are not accessible through the WRI tool. 

Sites that are identified as high water risk on the first two 
steps will be further evaluated through an in-depth local 
Source Water Vulnerability Assessment conducted by a 
credible third-party to confirm the water-stress conditions. 
These consider local water security issues and 
potential solutions.

Today, 31 sites in 12 countries are located in water-
stressed areas. From 2023, three additional sites will 
become part of our reporting scope for water-stressed 
areas. These are Vietnam (Tien Giang), Burundi (Gitega) 
and Haiti (Port-au-Prince). 

We also engage with barley, hop, maize and apple 
suppliers to assess potential water risks and management 
practices. We shared these outcomes this year to raise 
awareness among our suppliers on potential water risks. 

For more information, see page 156 in TCFD section.

Partnerships for change
We collaborate through local and global alliances to 
increase our reach and scale our positive impact. We work 
with like-minded partners to advance watershed 
protection in water-stressed areas. For example, we are 
partnering with WWF in Vietnam and Avina Fundación in 
Brazil, along with government agencies and local 
communities, to deliver watershed protection programmes 
beyond our brewery walls. 
We are also a member of the UNGC’s CEO Water 
Mandate Water Resilience Coalition, a global partnership 
between the UN, companies and NGOs collaborating to 
reduce water stress by 2050.
In addition, we are part of the Beverage Industry 
Environmental Roundtable (BIER), a technical coalition of 
leading global beverage companies working together to 
advance environmental sustainability within the 
beverage sector. 

Communities
We are one of the 25 global businesses and 15 water, 
sanitation and health (WASH) expert organisations that 
supported the WASH4Work business declaration at 
COP27 in Egypt. WASH4Work aims to create systemic 
pathways to increase water access for communities, in line 
with our goal of developing healthy watersheds beyond 
our brewery walls.

2030 goal

Reduce average water usage to 
2.6 hl/hl in water-stressed areas 
and 2.9 hl/hl worldwide 
In 2022, our global average water usage was 3.3 hl/h in all 
our breweries and 3.0 hl/hl in water-stressed areas. 

Our average water usage (hl/hl) has improved compared 
to last year. One contributing factor is the implementation 
of good water management practices. In 2022, more 
than 600 good practices were implemented worldwide. 

Meoqui, our most efficient brewery in Mexico, used less 
than 2 hl/hl of water to brew 1 hl/hl of beer in 2022. More 
sites in Mexico and Vietnam are following, with average 
water usage close to or below 2 hl/hl. 

In South Africa, we built a new water reclamation plant 
which reduces reliance on freshwater. It uses water 
recycling technology to reclaim wastewater, which is used 
for utilities and general cleaning.

2023 goal

Treat 100% of wastewater 
of all breweries 
Our brewery processes create wastewater that must be 
treated before discharge. Our ambition is to treat 100% of 
our brewery wastewater by 2023. 

At the end of 2022, 97% of our wastewater volume was 
treated before discharge (2021: 95%). Seven sites out of 
186 globally are without a wastewater treatment plant. This 
includes sites previously managed by a third-party that are 
transitioning towards HEINEKEN discharge quality 
standards and/or local regulations – whichever is higher. 
Total untreated wastewater was 3% of production sites 
volume (2021: 11 sites, 5% volume). At a number of our 
production sites, brewery wastewater is treated at third-
party wastewater treatment plants, or discharge is 
compliant to local regulation.

We have built three new wastewater plants in Haiti, Serbia 
and Nigeria, bringing us closer to our 2023 goal to treat 
100% of our wastewater. 

2030 goal

Maximise reuse and recycling in 
water-stressed areas by 2030
We see opportunities to create healthier watersheds by 
maximising water circularity. This means recovering, 
reusing and recycling our on-site and off-site treated 
wastewater for other purposes. 

We are at an early stage. For on-site circularity, we have built 
six water reclamation plants which treat and reuse 
wastewater for general cleaning to reduce reliance on 
freshwater. For off-site circularity, we are making progress 
while exploring ways to address local challenges such as 
limited infrastructure, perceptions and regulations. 

At one site in Mexico, adjustments were made to the 
pipeline of a third-party wastewater treatment services 
company. This company treats and recycles wastewater 
from our brewery and four other companies, and part of it is 
sent to a local paper mill for use. By collectively re-purposing 
wastewater, we are reducing reliance on freshwater.

This year, we worked with BIER to establish industry-
aligned Water Circularity Guidance which defines clear 
examples of water circularity. 

2030 goal

Fully balance water used in our products 
in water-stressed areas 
Our aim is to fully balance the water in our products we 
use in water-stressed areas. This means we will return to 
the local watershed every litre of water that goes into our 
product. We do this through water balancing projects that 
replenish water in the watershed that supports our 
operation. Projects range from nature-based solutions like 
large-scale reforestations and rainwater harvesting to 
infrastructure improvement projects which reduce 
water leakages. 

We use the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting 
standard launched by the World Resources Institute (WRI) 
to measure the outcomes and impacts of water balancing. 
By the end of 2022, 26 production sites in scope had 
started water balancing projects (2021: 23) and 29% of 
these sites are fully water balanced (2021: 32%). 

Our breweries in water-stressed areas have developed 
roadmaps which set out actions they will take to support a 
healthy watershed by 2030. Each watershed is unique, 
being shaped by the ecosystem and biodiversity it 
supports as well as local governance and stakeholders, 
among other things. Our sites must take a contextual 
approach and progress may be faster and more 
straightforward for some than others. 

In 2022, HEINEKEN Vietnam, WWF-Vietnam, the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Rural Development and local partners 
officially launched a water restoration programme to 
strengthen governance of Vietnam water resources. We 
will invest more than €1 million in this multi-year 
partnership to promote local water security.

In Brazil, we signed a partnership with Avina Fundación to 
deliver forest recovery and conservation by reforesting and 
increasing soil infiltration on-site to influence the long-term 
water cycle.

At some sites, we have faced challenges in establishing 
water balancing projects as reported in previous reports. 
We are pleased to share that, after considerable efforts, 
we have now signed MOUs with local implementation 
partners in Tunisia and Algeria to develop and commence 
water balancing projects.

Tackling social challenges 
and putting people first
Our business thrives on fairness, human connection and the joy of bringing people 
together. As the world struggles to manage the impacts of the pandemic, political 
instability and rising cost of living, we must work together to create a fairer, more 
equal and safer society.

We embrace fairness and inclusion in our 
operations and value chain. This includes 
aiming for gender balance at senior levels, 
paying all HEINEKEN employees a fair wage 
and demanding fair living and working 
standards for third-party employees and 
brand promoters. Our safety, health and well-
being strategy is focused on embedding a 
leading safety culture that ensures everyone’s 
leadership, engagement and participation. 
We are also becoming more strategic in how 
we deliver social and economic impact; our 
operating companies are developing social 
initiatives that support delivery of one or 
more of the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals and meet the needs of local 
communities.

Contributing to the UN SDGs – 
Path to an inclusive, fair and equitable 
company and world:

Embrace inclusion and 
diversity

Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) fosters a sense of true 
togetherness and drives us to seek deeper connection with 
our employees, consumers and customers. 

Aligned with our core value of ‘care for people’, our aim is 
to ensure every HEINEKEN employee feels a strong sense 
of belonging. We also want them to feel safe to speak up 
and help shape the future of our organisation. This is why 
we use employee engagement to amplify the voices of 
our workforce and enable people to act as catalysts for 
positive change. 

We believe diversity of thoughts leads to greater 
innovation and better performance. Inclusion also starts 
with courageous leadership which is why we nurture bold 
and brave leaders who create space for everyone, equally. 

The diversity of our people makes us as strong and unique 
as our brands. Providing fair and equal opportunities for 
our employees is a key driver for an inclusive environment. 

Our inclusion and diversity strategy focuses on three 
key areas: 

1. We accelerate I&D by starting with courageous 
leadership. 

2. We all contribute to fostering an inclusive environment. 
3. We create equal opportunity in the moments that matter. 

Listening to our employees
Inclusion starts with listening to everyone, not just the 
loudest voices. We foster a continuous listening approach 
to shape a culture where all people feel heard and valued. 

In 2022, our local operating companies and functions 
conducted 99 listening and dialogue sessions to 
understand the impact and progress of I&D action plans. 
Functional leaders were supported by I&D ambassadors to 
listen directly to employees to understand their views and 
inspire action.

Globally, we conducted live panel discussions and Q&A’s 
for all employees to address topics including gender 
balance, cultural diversity and inclusion of LGBTQIA+ in 
the workplace. More than 10,000 employees joined these 
events in total. 

I&D Councils
To ensure I&D is fully embedded in the organisation, our 
ambition is to set up I&D councils in all operating 
companies. Members work with the Managing Director to 
support the delivery of the global I&D strategy and 
roadmap, shape and deliver a local I&D action plan aligned 
to the global I&D framework. They also respond to local 
I&D contexts, engage and activate people throughout the 
operating company to deliver projects and inform the 
Region and the Global I&D team on local progress. By the 
end of 2022, 68% of our operating companies had an 
I&D Council.  

2025 goal

Gender balance across senior 
management: 30% women by 2025, 
40% by 2030
Our goal is to increase the number of women among our 
senior management population. To drive progress, we 
committed to have 30% women in senior management 
roles by 2025 and 40% by 2030, on the path to 
gender balance. 

This is a bold ambition and we are strengthening our 
pipeline of women talent at levels below senior 
management and ensuring we create fair and equal 
opportunities when we attract, develop and promote talent. 
Senior leaders in key functions have expanded their 
commitments to ensure we develop and support a diverse 
group of future senior managers. 

By the end of 2022, women representation at senior levels 
reached 27% (2021: 25%).

WIN (Women Interactive Network) is a global leadership 
development programme to level the playing field for 
women in leadership at HEINEKEN. Following two 
successful pilot editions which saw 40% of participants 
promoted, we partnered with an independent academic 
institute, IMD, and scaled up to include 100 participants 
from 36 nationalities. The aim is that every rising female 
leader will take part in the coming years. 

In 2022, we connected existing Women & Allies employee 
resources groups (voluntary, employee-led groups that 
promote a more diverse and inclusive workplace) from 
different countries and functions as part of the 
TogetHERness global community.  

As a result of our actions, HEINEKEN has been included in 
the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, as one of the 484 
companies worldwide committed to more equal and 
inclusive workplaces.

2023 goal

Cultural diversity: across each region, at 
least 65% of country leadership teams 
are regional nationals 
As the world’s most international brewer, we must reflect 
the world around us to brew enjoyment of life for all. This 
means embracing multiple cultures to create a sense of 
inclusion for everyone. 

Our goal is to balance the cultural diversity of our leadership 
teams in every region where we operate. By 2023, we aim 
to have at least 65% of country leadership teams across 
each region made up of regional nationals. 

At the end of 2022, two of our four regions reached this 
target – Europe and Asia Pacific. In recognition of World 
Day for Cultural Diversity, we hosted several initiatives to 
champion a culture of belonging for everyone by 
appreciating our cultural differences and debunking myths 
and stereotypes. This included a Global Mix and Match 
initiative which connected employees from different parts 
of the world, a webinar on communicating inclusively with 
different cultures, and a multi-company panel discussion. 

Our employee resources groups in Brazil and the US 
continued to work on fostering a more inclusive workplace 
for diverse ethnicities. In Brazil, we are part of Mover – an 
initiative that brings together more than 47 companies 
committed to having 40% black and brown people in 
middle management positions by 2030. Its aim is to 
create opportunities for three million people in the coming 
years. We are focused on delivering attraction, retention 
and development plans to support the target. Our actions 
will include developing awareness and training materials, 
mentoring for 500 black women, and external 
communications such as a webinar about racial diversity. 

In the US, we have partnered with Black Ambition to 
Support Minority Entrepreneurs to provide funding and 
mentorship opportunities to Black and Latinx founders. 
The partnership builds upon our responsible stewardship 
commitment to support the economic development 
and empowerment of under-represented and under-
resourced communities.

2023 goal

100% of our managers trained in 
inclusive leadership by 2023
Launched globally in 2020, the HEINEKEN Inclusive 
Practices are designed to spread awareness and 
understanding of how to practice inclusion. The message 
is shared through e-learnings and workshops focused on 
the ‘what, why and how’ to apply each inclusive practice. 

Our operating companies continue to train employees on 
the Inclusive Practices. In some countries, such as in 
Singapore and Ethiopia, 100% of people managers have 
now been trained.

A new ALL-Inclusive Leadership e-learning was launched in 
October 2022. It is an engaging and interactive e-learning 
module which is mandatory for all people managers and 
available to everyone in the organisation. By the end 
of 2022, 16% of our people managers had completed 
the module. 

LGBTQIA+ inclusion
Our employee resource group, HEINEKEN Open and Proud 
(HOP), has continued to be active across our operating 
companies. In 2022, we celebrated Amsterdam Pride, one 
of the most iconic demonstrations of love. In other places 
like the UK, we created a HOP local charter and in France 
we celebrated an event for Pride with several artists from 
the LGBTQIA+ community.  

In Brazil, Amstel is committed to spend 10% of the brand’s 
media budget to raise awareness and support the 
LGBTQIA+ community. The brand helped 800 trans people 
change their names to reflect their true identity by bringing 
the registry office to the streets during the 2022 Sāo Paolo 
Pride Parade. The ERG Além do Colorido has been very 
active in increasing awareness and inclusion of LGBTQIA+.

A fair and safe workplace

We are raising the bar to create a fair and safe workplace for 
our employees and those working adjacent to our business.  

We will ensure that all our employees worldwide earn at 
least a fair wage and that we continue to act on our 
journey to achieve equal pay for equal work between 
female and male colleagues. Ensuring fair living and 
working standards for third-party employees and brand 
promoters is an important part of our responsibility. 

We focus on shaping a leading health and safety culture 
fully embedded in our ways of working, counting on 
everyone’s leadership, engagement and participation.

2023 goal

Fair wage for employees: close any gaps 
Our ambition is to ensure all our employees worldwide 
earn at least a fair wage by 2023. A fair wage is often 
higher than the minimum wage and should be sufficient 
for a decent standard of living, covering the basic needs of 
the employee and his or her family – from food, housing 
and education to healthcare, transportation and some 
discretionary income and savings. 

To determine the fair wage amount per country, we have 
partnered with the Fair Wage Network, an independent 
NGO. A fair wage is constantly increasing with the cost of 
living and other economic factors, making this an ongoing 
process of assessment and adjustment. Our goal is to assess 
and close any wage gaps by the end of 2023. To achieve 
this, we assess wages across all operating companies 
against the Fair Wage Network annually. We started 
assessments in 2021 with our operating companies in 
developing countries where the challenges are the greatest. 

In 2022, we assessed the Europe region for the first time, 
following unprecedented inflation. We also re-assessed our 
operating companies in Asia Pacific, Africa, Middle East & 
Eastern Europe and the Americas. Out of this total, we 
identified fair wage gaps for our direct employees in seven 
operating companies and have closed the gaps in five. 
This means that we assessed all our operating companies 
and 99.96% of direct employees earn at least a fair wage, 
according to the Fair Wage Network. 

Following an independent assessment of our business 
units in the Africa, Middle East & Eastern Europe region, 
our efforts were recognised with the Fair Wage Network 
certification as a living wage employer.

2023 goal

Equal pay for equal work: assessments 
and action 
We recognise the importance of equal pay and aim to 
drive this ambition within and beyond our organisation. 
Our goal is to ensure equal pay for equal work (or work of 
equal value) between female and male colleagues. 

By 2023, assessments and actions will be in place to close 
any gaps. Action plans focus not only on potential pay gap 
by job grade, but also gender representation, performance 
assessments and salary increase, opportunities for 
promotions and gender balance in management teams. 

We recognise the importance of equal pay for equal work 
in our rewards processes. For every moment in the 
employee lifecycle where salary decisions are made, a fair 
and neutral decision must be assured. 

In 2022, we assessed progress across all our operating 
companies to track and monitor improvements on the 
path to equal pay for equal work. By the end of 2022, 
100% of operating companies have been assessed and 
100% have action plans in place. As part of this 
assessment, we looked at whether action plans in place 
are effective or needed to be refined and whether 
year-on-year progress has been made. 

In 2023, we will focus on operating companies with higher 
pay gaps and work with them to close any gaps to 
remediate the identified gaps to drive year-on-year progress.

2030 goal

Ensure fair living and working 
standards for third-party employees 
and brand promoters
Looking beyond our direct employees, our goal is that third-
party employees delivering labour-based services (catering, 
cleaning and security) on our sites and brand promoters 
benefit from fair living and working standards.  Third-party 
employees are an important part of our Company and we 
take responsibility for making sure they work reasonable 
hours in a safe, healthy and decent environment and earn a 
fair wage. These topics are embedded in our definition of 
fair living and working standards. To meet our goal, the 

SMART Outsourcing programme and guidelines are 
designed to map third-party service providers and their 
employees. We assess a sample of these against our fair 
labour principles and work with service providers to close any 
gaps. We also continually embed learnings to improve 
contract management of outsourced service providers and 
workplace practices. 

Raising standards with service providers 
Social sustainability and human rights are a foundation 
of how we do business with third-party service providers 
in Africa. We conducted our third round of assessments 
in 2022, when 12 of our largest businesses in Africa 
were assessed.

Globally, in 2022, 31% of our operating companies 
were assessed. We accelerated the programme to 
include the Asia Pacific region, completing assessments 
of 18 operating companies.

In 2023, we will expand assessments beyond the Africa 
and Asia Pacific regions. Our aim is for all operating 
companies to have had an initial assessment by the end 
of 2025, with actions to close gaps and embed into 
business as usual, running until 2030.

We have seen encouraging improvements since we first 
embarked on this initiative. In Nigeria, we have worked 
with 76 outsourced service providers who employ 10,000 
people over the last three years. Together with the service 
providers, we have improved management systems and 
business process to systematically improve the living 
standards and working conditions of third-party workers. 
This has resulted in wage payments that are 70% above 
the national minimum, provision of medical insurance, 
pension, and other benefits.  

2030 goal

Create leadership capacity to drive 
zero fatal accidents and serious 
injuries at work
We have significantly reduced the accident frequency in 
our operations since 2015. However, we still experience 
incidents as a result of our business. We remain committed 
to doing our utmost to ensure all our colleagues and 
contractors return home safely every day. 

We continue to strengthen and build from our HEINEKEN 
Safety Leadership framework, where we are taking our 
management teams through a safety leadership 
experience designed to make a safe working culture 
personal, and part of the way we do business.  

We work diligently to integrate safety leadership into our 
global programmes (e.g. through competence building, 
leadership programmes, etc.). Our tools enable our 
operating companies around the world to assess their 
current status, identify gaps and develop improvement 
plans to close gaps.

We will launch the Safety Leadership standard in early 
2023 to monitor progress as part of our global health and 
safety management system. 

Grow leadership capacity to develop world-class 
safety culture and performance 
Our safety, health and well-being strategy reflects our 
Company value of Care. We focus on shaping a leading 
safety culture and ensuring it is fully embedded in our 
ways of working. This requires everyone’s leadership, 
engagement and participation.   

Our team of more than 400 health and safety 
professionals around the world work together to 
implement best-in-class processes and programmes, 
build internal capabilities and develop talent to achieve 
a world-class safety culture and performance.

Our strategy targets our highest risks – namely road safety 
and driving, forklift safety, contractor safety and process 
safety. Centres of Excellence focus on these priority areas, 
identifying gaps, developing improvement plans and 
monitoring implementation and progress of plans. We 
continuously improve our safety performance by 
executing major risk reduction programmes focused on 
each of these risks.  

Life Saving Commitments
The Life Saving Commitments (LSCs) are based on our 
operation’s highest risk activities and apply to anyone 
working on behalf of our Company, employees and 
contractors, on or off premises. We expect everyone’s 
personal commitment and actions to comply with the 
LSCs and HEINEKEN’s safety standards.

We have developed specific guidelines for people 
managers who play a crucial role in the health, safety and 
well-being of employees and contractors. Safety must be 
included in all business decisions and all employees and 
contractors must be supported to adhere to the LSCs.

The newly launched Golden Principle is the overarching 
principle through which we empower and ask everyone to 
stop work and speak up when work cannot be executed 
safely, or if it is not possible to adhere to the LSCs. 

In 2022, we launched the Life Saving Commitments 
e-learning for all people managers. It is designed to equip 
the learner with the knowledge to recognise and apply the 
LSCs and Golden Principle. The LCS e-learning has been 
completed by 80% of our people managers. We aim to train 
the remaining people managers before the end of 2023.

We also launched an LSC e-learning for all employees to 
ensure understanding of the 12 Life Saving Commitments 
and the Golden Principle across our operating 
companies globally.

3 The reporting period of the safety data presented in this chapter is December – November with the exception of fatal accident data which reflected the full year period.
4 The reported absolute accidents and related relative values for 2021 have been aligned with the 2022 reported numbers which is based on the inclusion of all 

lost times cases in the Company.

Fatalities and serious injuries
We deeply regret that two people lost their lives while 
working for us in 2022 (2021: 2), both working as 
contractors. Every fatality is thoroughly investigated by an 
independent investigation team to identify and 
understand the root causes. We take action to prevent 
recurrence and share learnings with corrective and 
improvement actions followed up until closure.  

Our injury (accident) rate in 2022 was 1.01 per 100 FTE 
(2021: 0.89). 

The increase in the accident rate is related to the inclusion 
of the acquired India business and the ‘positive’ impact of 
COVID-19 on the 2021 figures. 

There were 877 injuries that resulted in 725 with lost time 
injuries among our employees. 484 of these injuries were in 
logistics and distribution, 125 in commerce, 230 in 
production and 38 in other functions.  

The main types of work-related injuries are cuts by sharp 
objects (e.g. glass), injuries while lifting or carrying objects, 
slips or falls, hits by moving falling objects or vehicles 
(e.g. forklifts).

Positive impact in our 
communities

With operations spanning the globe, HEINEKEN can be a 
positive force for change. This is especially relevant in a 
world where income inequality and injustice see increasing 
numbers of people facing challenges to afford a decent 
standard of living. 

Many of our Brew a Better World ambitions directly touch 
local communities. From guaranteeing a fair wage for 
employees and raising working and living standards for 
third-party employees to contributing to healthy 
watersheds, supporting smallholder farmers in Africa and 
working with partners to address harmful use of alcohol – 
our actions aim to have a positive impact on communities 
as well as our business. 

As a major employer and purchaser of raw materials, our 
biggest contribution to the social and economic well-being 
of communities is through the jobs we create, the 
businesses we support and the taxes we pay. 

Sustainable and transparent tax strategy 
We believe in responsible tax behaviour as an essential part 
of our sustainability strategy. The taxes we pay contribute 
to local economies and support the development of the 
many countries in which we operate. We support stable, 
transparent and predictable tax regimes that incentivise 
long-term investment and economic growth. 

Our sustainable and transparent tax strategy is based on a 
number of key principles: 
– Our commitment to comply with relevant tax laws and 

international regulations – we aim to comply with the 
letter as well as the spirit of the law.

– Compliance with the HEINEKEN Code of Conduct and 
VNO-NCW Tax Governance Code.

– Expectation that we will pay tax in the country where 
our activities take place. We fully support and follow the 
OECD transfer pricing guidelines and transactions 
between our operating companies are based on the 
‘arm’s length’ principle.

– Not using tax havens for tax avoidance purposes.
– Open and constructive dialogue with tax authorities 

that is based on mutual respect, transparency and trust. 
We have co-operative compliance relationships with tax 
authorities in various countries.

HEINEKEN Africa Foundation
The HEINEKEN Africa Foundation (HAF) supports the 
health and well-being of communities in sub-Saharan 
Africa by providing vital access to healthcare and 
clean water.  

The HAF completed the final actions of our two-year 
COVID-19 emergency response in the first half of 2022. 
Together with our partners, WaterAid and World Vision, 
we committed €5 million to programmes in seven 
countries reaching over 37 million people with crucial 
hygiene messages via TV, radio and print campaigns. Over 
1,400 handwashing stations were installed in markets, 
schools and health centres, giving 1.7 million people the 
ability to wash their hands. We also provided training for 
1,800 people to promote good hygiene and brought clean 
water to 108,000 people. In collaboration with Mercy 
Corps, we completed the renovation of the Bushara water 
reservoir which was damaged by the eruption of the 
Nyiragongo volcano. The reservoir supplies water to over 
500,000 people in the city of Goma, DRC. 

We continued to support local communities with donations 
of €2 million in 2022. In Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, 
Mozambique, Rwanda, Burundi and Sierra Leone we 
continued work with WaterAid and World Vision to provide 
WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene). We also launched 
three projects to improve public health centres in Amhara 
(Ethiopia), Bujumbura (Burundi) and Kisangani (DRC).

€17.8m
committed to 146 health and water projects 
since the start of the foundation in 2007 

2030 goal

A social impact initiative in 100% of our 
markets every year
Our goal is that 100% of markets will have a social impact 
initiative in place each year. We want to make a positive 
difference based on what matters most for each 
community. That is why we require initiatives to support 
one or more of the UN SDGs, as relevant to the 
specific community.

By the end of 2022, 100% of our markets in scope had a 
social impact initiative in place. Many of these 
partnerships work to reduce social inequality, from 
improving access to the labour market to empowering 
women and indigenous communities. In Nigeria and the 
US for example we support the development of 
entrepreneurs that have limited access to capital and 
resources. Other initiatives focus on the restoration and 
preservation of natural habitats. In Vietnam for example 
we started a partnership with WWF to restore ecosystems 
in three critical river basins while supporting local 
livelihoods. In Surinam, we joined a partnership with the 
team of Professor Sieuwnath Naipal to plant mangroves 
for coast protection and biodiversity support. In total, the 
initiatives in place in 2022 represented a total investment 
of €5.5 million. 

We are constantly looking for ways to bring our Company 
purpose, The Joy of True Togetherness, to life in a world 
where people are hyper-connected yet increasingly isolated. 
For example, our partnership with NGO, The Human Library, 
hosts personal conversations designed to challenge stigma 
and stereotypes. We also brought together a cross-section 
of HEINEKEN colleagues and external thought leaders to 
explore how we can catalyse the joy of true togetherness in 
an increasingly polarised world.

Supporting refugees from Ukraine
When Russia invaded Ukraine, we partnered with Habitat 
for Humanity in a co-ordinated effort to help Ukrainian 
refugees find emergency accommodation and longer-
term shelter in Ukraine’s neighbouring countries.

Through a global fundraising effort, we contributed over 
€1 million which enabled Habitat to support over 4,500 
refugees with free short-term accommodation, 1,200 with 
subsidised mid-term accommodation, and 10,000 with 
shelter services at the border. 

We also donated €700,000 to 20 local NGOs in the four 
neighbouring countries. Immediate relief efforts were 
focused on transport and legal assistance, 
accommodation in hotels and apartments, medical and 
psycho-social support, and access to reliable information. 
Employees also opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees 
and we provided support for Ukrainian colleagues to 
relocate their families.

2025 goal

Local sourcing of agricultural ingredients 
in Africa: 50% increase in volume  
Our local sourcing projects in Africa have created jobs, 
supported sustainable development of the agricultural 
sector and improved the lives of rural communities. Our 
approach has embedded local sourcing through a 
business-led programme, which nowadays spans 30 value 
chains across 12 operating companies. 

Local sourcing brings benefits to farming communities, 
governments and our Company alike. Substituting imports 
also reduces the demand for hard currency (Forex), which 
is a challenge in many markets.

However, creating stable agricultural value chains is 
complex and increasingly impacted by climatic, socio-
economic and political volatility. We have learned that 
resilience and long-term persistence is critical to success. 
For example, through our barley sector development 
programme in Ethiopia we have increased local sourcing 
from less than 5% in 2018 to more than 70% in 2022. 

Raising the bar on local sourcing
Our aim is to increase volume of agricultural raw materials 
sourced locally in Africa by 50% by 2025 compared to 
2020. In 2022, we achieved an estimated 26% increase – 
almost 60,000 tonnes – above the 2020 baseline year. 

This is driven by an over 40% increase in domestic raw 
materials, notably from growth in Ethiopia, South Africa, 
Egypt, Mozambique and Ivory Coast. The localisation of 
barley and malt in Ethiopia continues to grow rapidly, with 
a recent IFC report highlighting that the malting and 
brewing sectors contributed close to ETB 18 billion in tax 
revenue in 2021 and saved nearly USD 800 million in 
import substitution. 

Conversely, regional raw materials have declined by 
almost 40%, largely because the scarcity of African sugar 
has resulted in a need to switch back to imported sources 
of supply.

Our local sourcing programme resulted in agricultural 
raw material purchases with a total value of around 
€250 million, which is double the value sourced in 2021. 
This value is shared across our end-to-end supply chain, 
benefiting farmers, aggregators, transporters and 
processors, as well as their families and wider communities.

The introduction of barley as a new crop for farmers in 
Africa continues to gather momentum, with varieties 
registered in nine countries in 2022. This will help to ensure 
our local sourcing keeps pace with the increasing demand 
for local barley and malt, which is driven by 
premiumisation of our brand portfolio across Africa.

We continue to work with partner experts in the local 
sourcing programme, including the Wageningen 
University on climate resilience and with IFC on the barley 
development programme in Ethiopia.

Raising the bar on 
responsible consumption

We believe alcohol, when consumed 
in moderation, can be part of a well-
balanced lifestyle. That’s why we are 
dedicated to leading the debate on 
responsible consumption and are 
taking action to decrease harmful 
consumption. 
Using the strength of our brands, we 
aim to reach 1 billion consumers every 
year by being bold in how we 
communicate a zero tolerance attitude 
towards harmful drinking. This includes 
directing 10% of Heineken® media 
spend towards promoting responsible 
consumption. We are also empowering 
consumers with our growing low- and 
no-alcohol portfolio to ensure they 
always have a choice. Advocating for 
labelling transparency is an important 
part of ensuring consumers can make 
an informed choice about the products 
they consume.

Contributing to the UN SDGs – Path to 
moderation and no harmful use:

Learn more about our actions in the Responsible 
section of our website 

Always a choice

As society evolves, the number of adults who wish to 
reduce their alcohol consumption continues to grow in 
markets around the world. The trend towards moderation 
continues with research showing that 67% of people who 
consume alcohol are either moderating or looking to 
moderate their consumption of alcohol. 

We are actively building a positive choice for consumers 
with our 0.0 beer portfolio of brands, recognising that this 
is where we can have a real impact. Our aim is to empower 
consumers by making it easier to select the right beer for 
the right occasion, everywhere and at any time of day – be 
that with or without alcohol. 

Our 0.0 portfolio now includes global and local propositions 
spanning a variety of taste profiles (lager, flavoured, non-
lager, etc.). 2022 saw the launch of the new Heineken 
campaign – ‘Cheers To No Alcohol’ – which addresses the 
feeling of exclusion that individuals often experience when 
choosing not to drink alcohol at social occasions and shows 
that Heineken® 0.0 gives everyone the opportunity to 
enjoy social drinking moments together.

We also launched our global multi-brand always a choice 
campaign, ‘The Choice Is Yours’. Applying a creative spin to 
relatable occasions, the campaign reminds consumers that 
they always have a choice between alcoholic and non-
alcoholic beverages.

2023 Goal

A zero alcohol option for two strategic 
brands in majority (90%) of markets
Our ambition is to serve 0.0 always, everywhere – ensuring 
our consumers around the world have a choice. This means 
investing in building the category and developing 
outstanding 0.0 beverages so that a non-alcoholic 
alternative is always available where we sell beverages. 

In 2022, our operating companies with a zero alcohol 
option for at least two strategic brands represented 46% 
(2021: 43%) of our total beer and cider volume. 
Heineken® 0.0 was available in close to 110 markets by the 
end of the year (2021: 100).

Building on this, our zero alcohol beverages category had 
289 zero alcohol line extensions across 125 brands. The 
next step in our journey is to focus on more brands tackling 
the moderation agenda and bringing the messaging to a 
new level.

Our focus on closing the gap between alcoholic and non-
alcoholic beer penetration resulted in strong double-digit 
revenue growth in key markets such as Brazil, UK, 
Netherlands, Germany and Hungary.

We brought existing propositions to new markets (such as 
Ecuador and Mozambique) and introduced new brand 
extensions such as Cruzcampo Gran Reserva 0.0, 
Desperados Virgin Mojito 0.0 and Zlaty Bazant Fresh Apple 
Radler 0.0%.

2023 goal

Clear and transparent consumer 
information on 100% of our 
products in scope
We advocate for labelling transparency so that 
consumers can make an informed choice about the 
products they consume. Responding to the evolving 
landscape, we are aiming for clear and transparent 
consumer information on 100% of our products in scope 
by the end of 2023, including full nutritional information 
and ingredients on pack, recycling and legal drinking age 
symbols and a QR code on pack that links to further 
information on alcohol and health.

In 2022, 24% of our products in scope have fully compliant 
labels. The initial focus was on designing a label that could 
be used effectively across the business. A global working 
group is in place to support all operating companies to 
implement the labelling changes and ensure full compliance 
by the end of 2023. Nevertheless, we anticipate challenges 
in the regulatory fields and our supply chain that might 
impact our journey. 

Address harmful use

Harmful drinking is damaging to the people directly 
involved and their communities, as well as our industry and 
our reputation. We have set up partnerships around the 
world to tackle harmful use such as drink driving, under-
age drinking, excessive consumption, drinking while 
pregnant and alcohol addiction. 

Alcohol abuse is a complex societal issue and there is no 
simple solution or one-size-fits-all approach. Different 
regions have their own cultural attitudes towards alcohol 
and the issues vary across countries and markets.  

Because of this, tackling harmful drinking requires a 
concerted effort by diverse stakeholders including 
government, NGOs, consumer groups, police forces, 
legislators, retailers, hospitality venues, communities, 
schools and more. 

Community engagement is key as local stakeholders know 
what the issues are in their community and how best to 
address them. 

2030 goal

100% of markets in scope have a 
partnership to address 
alcohol-related harm
We develop partnerships together with governments and 
society as the best way to make a difference. We have 
made significant progress through our partnerships to 
reduce harmful consumption and 100% of our markets 
had a partnership by the end of 2022. 

Underage drinking is a serious societal issue in many 
countries and our operating companies are addressing the 
issue through local initiatives. 

In Croatia, our 10-year partnership with the 
TESA Psychological Centre supports parents and teachers 
to have meaningful conversations with teenagers. 
58 schools applied to be part of the programme in 2022 
and it continues to grow every year. 

In Mexico, TECATE® 18+ is a nation-wide campaign in 
partnership with SIX to invite Mexican adults to be part of 
the solution. Limited-edition packaging directs consumers 
to educational content and invites them to sign a pledge 
and commit to the cause.

We believe that a combined industry effort will drive a much 
bolder impact. This is why we participate in the International 
Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD), a not-for-profit 
organisation through which leading global beer, wine and 
spirits producers work together to combat harmful drinking. 
IARD works and collaborates with the public sector, civil 
society and private stakeholders to advance this mission.  

Make moderation cool

We have a long history of using our brands to make 
moderate, responsible consumption cool. We leverage the 
strength of our brands and ensure our message resonates 
with consumers by creating innovative campaigns that 
lead the debate. 

To connect with the right audiences, we design Heineken® 
campaigns to reflect different contexts and use a range of 
digital media platforms and advertising assets. 

Over the years we have created ground-breaking 
campaigns such as ‘Sunrise Belongs to Moderate Drinkers’, 
'Dance More, Drink Slow’ and ‘When You Drive, Never 
Drink’. Each looks to change habits by advocating positive 
behaviour rather than using criticism or shaming people. 

2030 goal

10% of Heineken® media spend invested 
in responsible consumption campaigns, 
reaching 1 billion consumers  
In 2022, our operating companies invested more than 11% 
of Heineken® media spend in our two latest campaigns 
dedicated to responsible consumption. In total, we reached 
over 1.2 billion unique consumers worldwide within the 
country borders of 47 operating companies. This outcome 
is calculated using the Sainsbury Formula method which 
allows us to estimate audience duplication to ascertain net 
reach across multiple markets and digital media channels/
platforms. The approach has been validated by third-party 
independent media auditors such as Ebiquity. 

Introducing our new campaigns
‘When You Drive, Never Drink’ is our long-standing flagship 
campaign which promotes an anti-drink driving message. 
In 2022, we launched two new campaigns to deliver this 
important message in an engaging and impactful way.

The Great Drivers campaign addresses one of the biggest 
reasons for drink driving – overconfidence after drinking 
alcohol. Research shows that 81% of people become 
overconfident when they drink, believing they are a better 
driver than they are. The campaign tackles this issue with 
the help of faces from the world of F1® and W series: 
McLaren Driver, Daniel Ricciardo, Oracle Red Bull Racing 
Driver, Sergio Perez, and W Series Ambassador and Racing 
Driver, Naomi Schiff. In the US, an activation was 
deployed where consumers were given a chance to be 
picked up in a McLaren supercar for taking an Uber after 
drink, with 22,000 Uber codes redeemed. 

We also launched ‘Riding Is Still Driving’, as more people 
are preferring to use alternative modes of transport from 
bicycles to e-scooters, but many don’t see these as ‘driving’ 
neither as a problem with using them while drinking. 
However, with alcohol-related accidents increasing, we are 
future-proofing our point of view that riding is still driving. 
In Canada, ‘Riding Is Still Driving’ was amplified with a 
campaign targeting bike stations in key cities across 
Canada. And in the Netherlands, we activated the 
campaign around the Dutch GP in Zandvoort, including an 
Uber in-app activation and rewarding thousands of visitors 
coming to the event by bike with a Heineken 0.0.

We will use what we learn from our campaigns and their 
outcomes as a foundation for making moderation cool 
over the next decade.

Responsible



Foundation:
Our ways of 
working
We know that we can only be 
successful if we lead with integrity and 
fairness, with respect for people, the 
law and our values.
This is the purpose of our Foundation 
which guides our day-to-day decisions, 
actions, engagement and governance. 
Our ways of working apply to all our 
operating companies globally and 
everyone who works at, or on behalf of, 
HEINEKEN.

Responsible business 
conduct

We are committed to conducting business with integrity 
and fairness and with respect for people, the law and our 
values. Our business conduct framework ensures that we 
conduct business around the world in a responsible manner, 
following the principles of the UN Global Compact and the 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 

Code of Business Conduct 
The HEINEKEN Code of Business Conduct sets out the 
basic principles that we require every employee to observe 
when acting for, or on behalf of, HEINEKEN. Underlying 
policies available in 40+ languages give further guidance 
on specific topics outlined in the Code. 

We are in the process of reviewing and updating the Code 
of Business Conduct as part of the regular monitoring and 
updating of our compliance framework. The new Code of 
Business Conduct will be launched in 2023.

Business conduct training for employees
We provide annual mandatory Code of Business Conduct 
training to all employees worldwide. The training presents 
practical dilemmas to encourage participants to explore a 
range of responsible business conduct topics. In 2022, 
almost 81,000 employees completed the training. 

We take every opportunity to raise awareness and keep 
employees engaged with understanding and applying the 
principles for responsible business conduct. In 2022, this 
included celebrating World Whistle Blower Day in June and 
a campaign during the Week of Integrity in December.

Zero tolerance of bribery 
and corruption  
As a multinational company operating in more than 70 
countries, we pay close attention to potential exposure to 
bribery and corruption. Our principle is never to engage in 
bribery and our anti-bribery framework is designed to 
prevent, detect and respond to bribery and corruption 
threats. The framework includes risk-based third-party due 
diligence and internal and external awareness and training. 

Training employees on anti-bribery 
and corruption
Anti-bribery and corruption e-learning equips selected 
employees to recognise and deal with potential bribery 
challenges that they may encounter during their work. In 
2022, almost 10,000 employees completed the training. 
Anti-corruption policies – which cover bribery and other 
topics such as conflicts of interest, fraud, money 
laundering and gifts, entertainment and hospitality – 
are also addressed in the mandatory Code of Business 
Conduct training for employees. 

We also require third-parties that may be exposed to 
corruption risks to complete our third-party anti-bribery 
and corruption training. This training reiterates our zero 
tolerance of corruption policy and explains how to 
recognise and resist bribery and speak up where needed. 
In 2022, around 130 third-party employees completed 
this training. 

An effective Speak Up framework
Transparency and trust are a crucial foundation of our 
culture and values. We encourage everyone to speak up 
when they have questions or concerns about potential 
misconduct such as fraud, discrimination, harassment 
or corruption. 

Multiple channels are available for employees and people 
outside the Company to communicate concerns in 
confidence and without fear of retaliation. Requests for 
advice and sharing concerns are treated confidentially and 
people can make reports anonymously. 

Our Speak Up channels include a network of trusted 
representatives (employees selected and trained to receive 
and help register potential Speak Up reports) and an 
external Speak Up service. This is run by an independent 
service provider and is available 24/7, 365 days a year. 
Speak Up channels are regularly communicated to 
employees and third-parties to encourage their use. 

In 2022, we carried out pulse surveys in more than 
30 countries to understand potential barriers that may 
prevent employees from speaking up. We are taking action 
in response to the findings including further clarification on 
various aspects of Speak Up and non-retaliation. 

In 2022, we received over 2,400 reports of suspected 
misconduct through Speak Up (2021: 1,700).  

Reports received concerned allegations of fraud (25%), 
discrimination and harassment (35%), conflicts of interest 
(6%) and other issues (34%). 81% of the cases reported in 
2022 have been closed and 19% are pending closure. 60% 
of fraud cases, 42% of discrimination and harassment, 
36% of conflicts of interest and 39% of other issues were 
fully or partly substantiated, which led to an overall 
substantiation rate of 46%. 

Where appropriate corrective and preventive actions were 
taken. Such actions include process and control 
improvements, awareness-raising, training, coaching and 
disciplinary measures ranging from issuance of a warning 
to termination of employment. 

We were not subject to any criminal or regulatory 
investigations on the grounds of corruption including 
bribery, facilitation payments, extortion, money laundering 
and collusion. 

Robust internal controls
Robust internal controls ensure we keep reasonable and 
proportionate oversight of activities related to the 
implementation and effectiveness of our business 
conduct framework.

Respecting human rights

Respect for people’s dignity and human rights is a 
foundation of how we do business – both in our own 
operations and across our entire value chain. 

We follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights and OECD Guidelines for multinationals. 
Our Code of Business Conduct, Human Rights Policy and 
Supplier Code guide how we assess, understand, avoid and 
address human rights-related risks around the world. These 
are available in 40 languages to ensure information is 
accessible to intended audiences. 

Tackling human rights issues requires multi-stakeholder 
collaboration and sharing of expertise internally and within 
and beyond our industry. 

Addressing human rights in operating companies
To date, we have carried out on-site human rights risk 
assessments and action planning workshops with 16 
operating companies. These are followed up with actions 
to address salient risks. Risks differ by country and include 
topics such as discrimination, excessive working hours, 
harassment, road safety and working conditions of third-
party employees and farm workers.

In 2022, we took the time to reflect on the outcomes of 
workshops and to evaluate the capabilities of our operating 
companies for managing human rights risks. As a result, we 
decided to strengthen governance and support operating 
companies to further embed the Human Rights Policy 
before proceeding with more workshops. 

We launched a standalone internal Human Rights control 
for operating companies to self-assess standards and 
accountability for implementation of our Human 
Rights Policy. 

In 2022, we also updated and published Human Rights 
Policy implementation guidelines which provide practical 
advice on implementing our Human Rights Policy. We 
have published the guidelines on our Company website. 
In 2023, we plan to develop a human rights e-learning 
module and re-launch workshops in a refreshed format.

Human rights audits 
Human rights remain as a top risk and awareness and focus 
on the topic has increased significantly in the last three 
years. We have performed 30 human rights reviews to 
assess performance across all four regions since 2019. We 
use the information provided to address human rights issues 
and risks. HEINEKEN employees and on-site outsourced 
employees are within the scope of these assessments. 

In 2022, we completed nine reviews spanning the Europe, 
Americas and Asia Pacific regions. In the Africa, Middle 
East & Eastern Europe region, we worked closely with 
social assessment experts, Partner Africa and Elevate to 
conduct human rights audits in the Africa, Middle East & 
Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific regions.

These audits have resulted in 107 findings (29 high- and 
78 medium-risk findings) since 2019. Findings differ per 
country and include topics such as excessive working 
hours, insufficient policy awareness, discrimination, 
working conditions of third-party employees, etc. We use 
the findings to take action with operating companies and 
inform our overall human rights approach.

In 2023, we plan to conduct a root cause analysis to 
identify and explore risks and recurring patterns found in 
the past four years, along with a risk-based review of 
internal management systems and controls related to our 
supplier code of conduct.  

Respecting human rights in high-risk contexts 
When we enter a market, we become part of the economy 
and are embedded in the local market. Some countries will 
go through periods of volatility which can present 
significant challenges and dilemmas for governments, 
citizens and long-term investors like us.

Experience has shown that we need to be prepared to deal 
with high-risk contexts that could impact our business and 
the human rights of our employees and people connected 
to our business. The risk of human rights violations can be 
disproportionately high in areas of poor governance, 
volatility and political instability. We constantly review 
whether we can continue to operate in such contexts and, 
if so, how we can manage risks to people.

When identifying volatile countries, and specifically what  
a volatile context could look like for our business, we are 
guided by external experts to consider conflict, security 
and factors such as governance, socioeconomics and 
potentially vulnerable groups. Countries included in this 
category will change over time and in relation to our 
portfolio of operating companies.

To guide operating companies that are operating in volatile 
locations, we include specific information on respecting 
human rights in high-risk contexts in our global Human 
Rights Policy. We have also designed a set of ‘Golden 
Principles’ and corresponding actions and conducted 
workshops on how to operate in high-risk contexts. 

In 2022, we developed and launched a Volatile 
Environments playbook. It provides clear guidance for 
operating companies on how to identify and navigate 
volatile circumstances in line with applicable standards 
and guidance from external experts. The playbook steers 
local action to understand  context and impact, get to 
know and connect with stakeholders, develop governance 
structures and train employees. 

We are now implementing action plans and will include 
new operating companies within the scope of the initiative 
should their environment become volatile or more volatile. 

Security and human rights training 
We have developed an operational framework that 
supports operating companies to maintain the safety and 
security of people and assets with respect for human rights 
at its centre. 

We launched new trainings for security staff in line with 
the Voluntary Principles on security and human rights, 
focusing on operations in volatile environments. This 
training is designed to ensure security service providers 
have the knowledge and understanding to conduct daily 
tasks in compliance with international standards on 
security and human rights and with our policies regarding 
human rights and ethical conduct. 

Trainings are in person and have now been conducted in 
five operating companies including Ivory Coast, Democratic 
Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Burundi and Mozambique in 
2021/2022. We aim to conduct further training in 2023.

Human rights supplier due diligence 
Our impact on human rights can occur wherever and 
however we operate – including through the activities of 
our direct suppliers and their own suppliers. 

We are committed to conducting business with integrity 
and fairness and with respect for people, the law and our 
values. We expect our suppliers to commit to responsible 
business conduct at all times. Our Supplier Code 
Compliance Procedure is implemented across all global 
operating companies.

In 2022, we teamed up with a new partner to enhance the 
procedure and began piloting an end-to-end third-party 
risk management platform to perform environmental, 
financial and human rights screening and due diligence 
for suppliers. 

These structural changes to our third-party risk 
management aim to provide the foundation for better 
insights, data and supply chain transparency. 

Creating systemic social change and improving labour 
conditions of workers in our value chain and around the 
world requires proactive collaboration with our suppliers 
and many other stakeholders. In 2022, we co-sponsored 
an AIM-Progress Supplier Capability Building event in 
Brazil. The focus was on health and safety, human rights 
due diligence, working hours, remuneration and benefits, 
water resilience and management of subcontractors.

Taking action on 
climate risk
In April 2021, we announced our Brew a Better World 
2030 strategy to raise the bar on HEINEKEN’s 
environmental, social and responsible consumption 
ambitions. The strategy underpins our focus on climate 
action and translates our ambition into targets and 
action plans to reduce emissions, help restore healthy 
functioning watersheds and maximise the circularity of 
products and processes.

We are committed to following the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) which aim to advance global 
efforts to improve quality and consistency of climate-
related information. We actively support the move to 
universal and comparable disclosures and see the 
TCFD recommendations as an important step towards 
fully embedding climate-related risks and opportunities 
into business risk management and strategy.

Why climate risk assessment is important 
for HEINEKEN and its stakeholders
Climate change is a global threat to humanity that will 
shape the way we do business in the coming decades. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth 
Assessment Report, published in 2021, states that human-
induced climate change is causing dangerous and 
widespread disruption to nature and affecting the lives of 
billions of people, despite efforts to reduce the risks. 
Urgent action is required to avoid mounting loss of life, 
biodiversity and infrastructure. As highlighted by our most 
recent materiality assessment, climate change and its 
implications on our business are a material topic for 
HEINEKEN and its stakeholders.

In 2021, we set our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
targets for 2030 in line with the goals of the Paris Climate 
Agreement and the IPCC report. These targets have been 
validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). 
Our goal is to reach net zero emissions by 2040 across our 
value chain, 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate 
Agreement deadline. To drive progress, we set an interim 
target to reach net zero in scope 1 and 2 and reduce scope 
3 emissions by 21% by 2030. Overall, this means we will 
aim to reduce absolute emissions across our value chain 
by 30% by 2030.

Our journey to net zero will be challenging, requiring 
co-ordinated action with suppliers, academics, customers 
and other stakeholders. As well as tackling our climate 
impacts, we will use our voice as a global company to 
influence public policy and help drive the transition to a 
low carbon future. 

How HEINEKEN addresses climate risks 
and opportunities
Our road to net zero emissions represents a major 
transformation in the way we operate and means we 
must continuously evaluate our impact on climate change 
and how it affects us. Risk management is an inherent 
element of doing business at HEINEKEN and it is 
supported by strong governance. This includes addressing 
climate risks and opportunities as an integral part of 
EverGreen, our balanced growth strategy.

The Financial Stability Board’s TCFD recommendations 
guide companies to provide clear and transparent 
disclosure of their governance, strategy, risk management, 
metrics and targets in relation to climate change risks, 
opportunities and action. We followed TCFD guidelines to 
identify relevant climate-related risks for our business. 
For the top three identified risks we assessed financial 
impact considering two global trajectories; one 
corresponds to the baseline goals of the Paris Climate 
Agreement to limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C 
compared to pre-industrial levels, while the other 
corresponds to the implications of a society failing to 
deliver enough decarbonisation efforts, leading to a global 
temperature increase of 3-4°C. 

First year assessment
This is HEINEKEN’s first TCFD-based analysis. Conclusions are 
based on high-level estimations and assumptions, given the 
uncertainties related to applied factors and evolving 
methodologies. Therefore, this year we reported financial 
impacts of selected climate-related risks qualitatively and 
comparatively to each other and not wider business risks.
Next steps for 2023 and beyond will include enhancing accuracy 
of impact assessments and integrating the actions of this analysis 
in our operational model and decision-making processes.

Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)



Strong governance for sustainability, which includes climate-related risk, is crucial for enabling success of our overall 
business strategy. Sustainability has been included as part of the Green Diamond, a ‘North star’ of the Company’s 
EverGreen strategy and long-term value creation model, alongside top-line growth, profitability and capital efficiency. 
The broad range of sustainability issues, including identification and monitoring of climate risks, are embedded in 
HEINEKEN’s governance. The governance bodies presented in the below overview are key forums where sustainability 
is discussed. Climate-related risks and other information are discussed by these bodies as and when required in the 
course of the Company’s business.

Supervisory Board level committees
Supervisory Board
The role of the Supervisory Board is to supervise the 
management by the Executive Board as well as the 
general affairs of the Company and its affiliated 
enterprises. As part of this role, it has oversight of, amongst 
others, sustainability matters including climate risk.

The Sustainability and Responsibility Committee 
focuses on supervising the activities of the Executive Board 
with respect to environmental, social and responsible 
consumption matters. This includes a periodic review and 
evaluation of the Company’s sustainability and 
responsibility performance and progress against its 
objectives, including climate risks. The Committee meets 
four times per year.

The Audit Committee supervises the activities of the 
Executive Board with respect to the publication of financial 
information and other areas like governance, risk 
management, non-financial reporting, and compliance 
with internal and external audit recommendations for 
these areas. The Committee meets at least twice a year.

The Remuneration Committee, meeting at least once a 
year, makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board 
on target setting, including for sustainability matters.

Executive Board level committees
Executive Board
The primary duties of the Executive Board are to initiate and 
set the corporate strategy and to manage the Company, 
including the sustainability strategy which is one of the 
Company’s  top priorities. Material climate-related topics are 
subject to approval by the Executive Board.

Executive Team
The role of the Executive Team in the sustainability area is 
to ensure effective implementation of our Brew a Better 
World strategy across the organisation. Several members of 
the Executive Team are members of the Executive Board 
level committees and the Managerial level committees.

The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO), regularly reviews the group’s risk assessment 
that summarises the Company’s key risks, associated 
mitigating actions and monitoring activities. Climate risks 
are considered among the top risks. The Risk Committee 
meets three times per year.

The Sustainability and Responsibility Steering 
Committee (S&R SteerCo), chaired by the CEO, is central 
to climate-related risk management across the organisation. 
The S&R SteerCo oversees the execution of the Brew a 
Better World agenda including delivery of the climate 
strategy and adequacy of response to identified climate 
risks. The SteerCo gathers at least every quarter.

The Disclosure Committee reviews and advises on 
material public disclosures, including TCFD reporting.

Topics considered by the Board committees in 2022 
included, amongst others, our strategy, goals and 
performance on scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions and 
water protection, related investment plans, climate-related 
risks and other TCFD implementation and disclosure aspects.

Managerial level committees
The Carbon Steering Committee informs the S&R 
SteerCo and reviews the progress of our net zero carbon 
programme towards set targets. The Towards Healthy 
Watersheds Steering Committee informs the S&R 
SteerCo and reviews the progress of our water programme 
towards set targets. Amongst other matters, the SteerCos 
consider the impact of climate-related risks and monitor 
progress through tracking tools and dashboards. The 
Carbon SteerCo gathers every six weeks. The Towards 
Healthy Watersheds Steering Committee gathers at least 
three times a year. The CSRD Steering Committee, 
which will focus on monitoring implementation of the 
upcoming EU CSRD/ESRS requirements, started its activities 
in February 2023.

We link targets to remuneration
In early 2022, following the proposal of the Remuneration 
Committee, the Supervisory Board proposed to align the 
remuneration policy of the Executive Board to the 
EverGreen strategy and our Brew a Better World strategy. 
The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders subsequently 
approved the introduction of ESG-related performance 
measures in the long-term incentive plan of the Executive 
Board in April 2022. Long-term incentive remuneration is 
tied to two environmental targets (on carbon and water 
usage) and one social target (on gender balance). The 
sustainability-tied part of the long-term incentive plan 
accounts for 25% and is linked to the performance over a 
three-year period. These targets are cascaded to the senior 
management community.

Climate-related risk governance



How climate-related risks were identified
Identification and assessment of climate risks and their 
impacts is a new and complex exercise. To identify and 
assess the key risks, a dedicated task force team was set 
up. This included risk management specialists, internal and 
external subject matter experts and business strategy 
specialists. We performed scenario analysis following 
TCFD recommendations and analysed impacts of 
identified risks in line with our risk assessment 
methodology. Explanation of the methodology used for 
financial assessment of the three key climate-related risks 
is provided in the following sections of this report.

Based on the methodology applied and impact and 
likelihood analysis, we have added climate change in the 
risk management section of this report, highlighting 
carbon pricing, water stress and climate-related barley 
yield losses as the main elements.

The identified risk went through the established levels of 
approval as per the risk management governance 
(approved by the S&R SteerCo and the Risk Committee 
and reviewed by the Supervisory Board S&R Committee) 
and was included in our general risk management process. 

How climate-related risks are managed 
We continuously monitor and evolve our climate risk 
management and mitigating actions. Throughout the 
year, the Risk Committee reviews relevant risks to assess 
their potential impact on our business model, operations, 
performance, stakeholders, values and solvency or 
liquidity. Due to their specific and broad reaching nature, 
the identified climate-related risks are also regularly 
discussed at meetings of the S&R SteerCo and managerial 
level committees like Carbon and Towards Healthy 
Watersheds Steering Committees. 

Climate risk management is integrated into our overall 
governance process to ensure we achieve our strategic 
GHG reduction goals and prepare for how climate change 
will impact our operations and value chain. A climate risk 
conscious approach is also being embedded in our ways of 
working, recognising that a proactive attitude towards 
managing climate risks is essential in our day-to-day 
operations to ensure delivery of our strategic objectives.

Due to the high uncertainty of climate factors, monitoring 
the significance of risk categories will be an ongoing 
process considering changes in external conditions and 
scenario assumptions. We will revise and update our 
detailed scenario analysis every two years and reassess 
identified climate risks annually. This scenario analysis and 
climate-related risk assessment may be conducted more 
frequently in the event of significant political and 
economic changes or a drastic change in climatic factors.

Read about the Company’s Risk management 
framework on pages 34–39

How we used scenario analysis 
We conducted our first detailed scenario analysis for 
climate risks following the TCFD guidance in 2022. When 
developing relevant scenarios based on the IPCC1 and IEA2 
scenario models, we considered two climate scenarios, 
to test a full range of impacts:

– the global temperature increase of 1.5°C to preindustrial 
levels as the baseline goal of the Paris Climate 
Agreement; and

– the 3-4°C scenario reflecting the implications of a 
society failing to deliver enough decarbonisation efforts.

Every company selects its own time horizons for scenario 
analysis and must factor in the specifics of its operations 
and features of corporate governance and planning. For 
the purpose of the development of the two scenarios and 
the assessment of HEINEKEN’s exposure and financial risk, 
we applied the long-term timeframes 2040 and 2050. 

The scenarios were developed to assess HEINEKEN’s 
exposure and financial risk in a structured way, through 
the following activities:

1. Scenario scoping was conducted by identifying macro-
level driving forces. These can be described as 
underlying reasons of change and may relate to 
changes in technology, customer preferences, 
government interventions through regulation, 
competitor moves, and supplier or sourcing instabilities.

2. Forward-looking data from recognised scientific sources 
such as IPCC1, IEA2, NGFS3, WRI4 and FAO5. This 
includes climate models and projections which were 
used to inform the two scenarios.

3. PESTEL6 analysis was performed to describe each of the 
dimensions for the two scenarios: political; economic; 
social; technological; environmental and legal.

Input from HEINEKEN’s strategy, risk management and 
sustainability teams led to the selection of a range of risks 
for qualitative impact assessment, as presented in the 
charts on this page.

From the list of highly rated risks, we selected three most 
material risks for financial impact quantification based on 
the above-described scenarios. These three risks are 
related to: 

– carbon pricing impact on value chain and 
own operations;

– water stress impact on own operations; and
– climate-related barley yield losses. 

Other risks and opportunities identified as potentially 
relevant and material are monitored and will be further 
assessed during the next stages of our TCFD analysis.

Strategy and climate-related risk management



A high-level assessment of gross financial implications of the three risks is presented below. This does not take into account mitigation strategies being implemented across the business and supply chains. Given the assumption-based approach 
and wide range of uncertainty on financial impact, we present results qualitatively. The financial impact overview in the table below shows the comparative impact of climate-related risks in relation to each other, not wider business risks. Going 
forward, we will deepen granularity and increase assessment accuracy of the financial implications of our ambition to transition to net zero by 2040 in line with the new SBTi1 Net-Zero Standard.

1.5⁰C scenario 3-4⁰C scenario

Selected potential risks 2040 2050 2040 2050 Risk drivers and assumptions

Carbon pricing on supply chain and 
own operations
Regulatory events to drive change 
in energy/supply costs Higher Higher Medium Higher

– Changing and more constricting regulations and (climate) ambitions could drive implementation of taxes or market schemes. This could translate into 
rising direct and indirect costs linked to carbon emissions, where the strongest impact would likely be on costs of sales linked to raw materials, production 
and distribution emissions.

– Development of HEINEKEN’s future GHG emissions in line with regular business growth.
– Percentage of emissions subject to carbon pricing. For the purpose of the analysis, it is assumed that all emissions are covered.
– Development of future carbon prices based on the IEA, IPCC and NGFS.
– Extent of suppliers’ cost increase passed on to the Company. In this first analysis we assumed that all costs are absorbed by HEINEKEN.

Water stress on own operations
Price increase due to instability 
in supply and regulations Higher Higher Higher Higher

– Risks related to water may be experienced through exposure to water-related challenges – for example water scarcity, water stress, flooding, droughts – 
that may affect our manufacturing facilities’ ability to supply water-based products due to lack of freshwater supply.

– Development of HEINEKEN’s future water footprint in line with regular business growth.
– Development of future water prices based on water stress levels and maturity of different technological solutions.
– Development of regulatory water usage restrictions during extended periods of extreme water stress and high seasonal variability 

(assumed that up to 100% of water usage is reduced for 14-30 days).

Climate-related barley yield losses
Low yield to impact agri-commodity 
prices and volatility Lower Lower Lower Lower

– Elements of climate change such as increased temperature, extreme weather events and water scarcity are likely to impact barley yield. 
– While average yield losses are relatively limited, annual variability is expected to strongly increase. This could have an impact on price.
– Future development of key commodity requirements against regular business growth.
– Climate change crop yield factor: development of agricultural yield based on FAO and W. Xie et al. (2018) future projections.
– Price response factor: direct 1:1 inverse relationship between crop yield and price.

Climate-related risk assessment outcomes



Impact of carbon pricing
Carbon pricing, taxation and emissions trading schemes 
are anticipated to be the primary levers through which 
governments around the world will regulate emissions and 
incentivise decarbonisation. This will impact our business 
and value chain throughout the world, potentially 
increasing the price of (amongst others) raw materials, 
energy and equipment.

Key implications
– Prices within climate models account for direct taxation, 

regulatory measures and secondary market effects.
– Impacts are modelled on HEINEKEN’s energy and 

supply costs.
– This assumes all sectors – including the agricultural sector 

which is largely exempt from carbon pricing schemes 
today – will be covered by carbon pricing schemes.

– The impact on HEINEKEN can be high in the 1.5°C 
scenario. Under this scenario, the strategic importance 
of delivering on our net zero strategy to mitigate carbon 
pricing impact is key.

– The main uncertainty of the 1.5°C scenario is whether 
agricultural emissions will be included in future carbon 
pricing schemes.

energy-model/macro-drivers

 NGFS Scenario Explorer https://data.ene.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/

How the risk develops in two scenarios
1.5°C scenario:
– Steep carbon pricing of all activities across the 

value chain is used to incentivise businesses to 
meet 1.5°C goals.

– Price levels increase, ranging from €50 – 760/
tonne1, depending on the IPCC or IEA data source 
and region of emissions.

3–4°C scenario:
– Carbon pricing schemes differ regionally and prices 

remain low, with a smaller percentage of value 
chain activities covered by carbon pricing.

– Price levels range from €0 – 80/tonne1 depending 
on data source and region. 

Our strategy to address the impact of carbon pricing
We aim to be net zero across our value chain by 2040. 
To achieve this goal, we have set an intermediate target to 
reduce 30% of absolute emissions across our value chain 
by 2030, and we aim to reach net zero in scopes 1 and 2 
also by 2030. To achieve these goals, we are optimising 
our beverage production processes and reducing energy 
consumption. We will replace our remaining energy 
demand using renewable sources for both electricity and 
thermal energy as much as possible. To reach 100% 
renewable electricity, we are adopting an array of on-site 
and off-site solutions – from solar, wind and hydro power 
to procuring Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC) in markets 
where we face challenges to signing Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPA). For thermal energy, we are developing 
roadmaps for investment in distinct technologies such as 
bioenergy (biomass, biogas, biomethane), heat pumps 
and solar thermal.

In parallel to reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions, we are 
working with suppliers to implement new capabilities, 
optimise processes and encourage them to set SBTi 
approved targets to reduce our scope 3 emissions across 
all categories. We have developed roadmaps with our top 
16 operating companies for scope 3 emissions reduction 
including, amongst others, low carbon farming 
programmes, efficient fridge adoption, shift to low-
emission vehicles and light weighting packaging.

We have financed a climate school for 40 of our strategic 
suppliers to educate them on GHG emissions, climate risk 
and science based targets. Finally, we collaborate with 
various platforms (RE100, BIER, The Climate Pledge) to 
move the sector towards decarbonisation. In Q4 2022, we 
reviewed our scope 3 strategy and identified focus areas 
to be implemented to reach our 2040 target, including 
supplier and customer decarbonisation, portfolio 
management and focus on specific markets.

We will follow the SBTi Net-Zero Standard, compensating 
for any residual carbon emissions we have not been able 
to reduce or replace as a last resort by investing in verified, 
high-quality carbon credits. 

Development of emissions against average carbon prices
Forecast of carbon prices development towards 2040 mapped vs. reduction of carbon emissions in line with our 
net zero strategy goals, which aim to mitigate the carbon pricing risk impacts.

In addition to the above, we are a member and follow the 
guidance of the RE100 initiative to adopt a hierarchy of 
solutions that prioritises new assets.

Gradually reducing our carbon footprint and introducing 
cutting-edge technologies will mitigate our impact on the 
environment and contribute to the goals set by the Paris 
Climate Agreement. It will also enhance our resilience to 
transitional risks such as the carbon cross-border tax and 
national quotas for GHG emissions.

Resilience to climate-related risks



Impact of water risk
Periodic insufficient local water availability could lead to 
inability to meet operating demand for water at 
HEINEKEN locations, especially those in water-stressed 
areas. This is likely to limit our manufacturing sites’ ability 
to produce products due to potential regulatory 
restrictions and prioritisation of water use for local 
communities during extreme drought periods. At the same 
time, water prices are likely to rise with increased levels of 
water stress in the form of taxes and tariffs to compensate 
for technologies to sustain freshwater supply, further 
impacting operating costs.

Key implications
– Insufficient local water availability during certain 

periods results in inability to meet operating demand at 
HEINEKEN’s locations.

– Forced operational disruptions due to regulatory 
restriction of water use leads to loss of business revenue.

– Sudden increases in water prices in the form of taxes 
and tariffs push up operating costs.

– Physical water stress is expected to be worse in a 3-4°C 
scenario depending on locations (in general according to 
IPCC, wet regions will get wetter and dry regions drier).

– The combined water stress impact of financial and 
physical exposures is estimated to be higher globally in 
a 1.5°C scenario due to increasing international 
regulatory restriction on water use, expansion of water 
pricing mechanisms and extraction regulations.

How the risk develops in two scenarios
1.5°C scenario:
– Nearly a fifth of HEINEKEN’s sites (31) are currently 

exposed to water-stress.
– An increase in water-stressed sites is expected.
– Main impact is through the regulatory restrictions 

and access protection.
3–4°C scenario:
– Water stress is expected to worsen under a 3–4°C 

scenario in some countries where we operate, based 
on the WRI Water Risk Aqueduct.

Our strategy to address water risk
We continue to focus on delivering our Towards Healthy 
Watersheds strategy to protect the watersheds from which 
we source our water and build resilience to water 
availability and pricing risks. Our ambition is to fully balance 
and replenish 100% of water used for our products back to 
the watershed by 2030 through multi-year water balancing 
activities and collective action in water-stressed sites. 26 of 
our 31 sites located in water-stressed areas have started 
watershed protection programmes with the aim to fully 
balance our water use in production by 2030. Our next 
steps will include deep-dive analyses for the significantly 
exposed countries identified based on a long-term outlook, 
assess the impact of climate change on water across our 
value chain and map water-stress exposure against 
mitigation actions. On pricing, we will conduct a true cost of 
water exercise to apply internal water pricing for 
investments, especially in water-stressed areas.

We anticipate that our future water withdrawal will 
increase, driven by organic and inorganic business growth. 
We will continue to drive water usage reduction by 
implementing good practices and treating our wastewater 
across our operations. In water-stressed areas, we manage 
risks through a combination of water usage, water 
circularity and water balancing to protect the overall 
watershed health.

We will continue our three-step water risk screening 
approach to understand watershed risks to support 
prioritisation of interventions and stakeholder engagement 
in water-stressed areas.

These are:

– Annual water security assessment by the local team.
– Risk screening every five years using tools such as the 

WRI Water Risk Aqueduct, and geospatial data 
mapping as an additional layer of information on 
watershed risks.

– Source Vulnerability Assessment, which is a detailed 
analysis of a watershed, its impact and possible 
solutions conducted by an independent third-party with 
hydrogeological experience.

All sites are assessed for physical water quantity risk, 
physical quality risk and regulatory and reputational risk. 
Datasets from the risk screening help us to shape a 
contextual approach when supporting watershed health 
and develop roadmaps for action through to 2030.

Strategic partnerships enable us to deliver Towards Healthy 
Watersheds: for example, we are part of the UNGC’s CEO 
Water Mandate Water Resilience Coalition where we work 
together to identify collective action opportunities. We are 
also members of the Beverage Industry Environmental 
Roundtable (BIER) where we co-supported the 
development of industry guidance on water circularity.

In addition, we actively participate in several local water 
funds and alliances around the world, such as the Monterrey 
Metropolitan Water Air Fund (FAAMM) and the Indonesia 
Industry Water Coalition. We engage with suppliers of 
agricultural commodities ranging from barley, maize, apple 
and hops on water-related issues and request that our 
suppliers report on water use, risks and/or water-related 
management information through the Sustainable 
Agriculture Initiative Platform.

Resilience to climate-related risks



Impacts of changes of barley yield
High quality agricultural commodities such as malting 
barley and hops are essential for the production of our 
beers. Negative climate impacts on agricultural yield and 
quality will affect agricultural commodity prices and 
market volatility, increasing our future cost of supply.

Key implications
– Barley represents 70% by volume of agricultural 

commodities in our supply chain. As a result, the 
quantification of risk and impact is mainly focused 
on barley.

– Increasing negative climate impacts on agricultural 
yields and quality may result from changes in 
precipitation, temperature and evapotranspiration.

– This could impact agricultural commodity prices 
and market volatility, increasing cost of supply 
for HEINEKEN.

– Most of the exposure to yield impacts on barley is 
concentrated in Europe and Latin America.

– While average yield losses are relatively limited, 
annual variability is expected to increase significantly, 
which could affect price.

How the risk develops in two scenarios
1.5°C scenario:
– Increasing annual yield variability driven by climate 

change effects.
– Yield impacts fluctuate depending on 

sourcing country.
– Yield loss expected for some key sourcing countries.
3-4°C scenario:
– Increased annual yield and quality variability 

driven by climate change effects compared to 
1.5°C scenario.

– Yield impacts vary in higher ranges per 
sourcing country.

– Yield loss and impact on quality in all main 
sourcing countries.

Our strategy to address impact on barley yield
Climate change impact differs per country. Based on our 
climate study, we have identified countries that benefit 
from moderate temperature increases and others which 
suffer a decline. In response to that, HEINEKEN takes a 
number of actions.

In our current barley-sourcing regions, we are developing 
low carbon farming practices to deliver our goal of a net 
zero value chain by 2040. HEINEKEN’s Low Carbon 
Farming Programme (LCFP), launched in 2020, begins 
with pilot farms to test new practices, technologies and 
nature-based solutions to validate the impact. In most 
cases, we engage the farmers via our (processing) suppliers 
like maltsters. They advise farmers on different 
regenerative protocols (e.g. cover cropping, no tillage, 
organic matter use) and seeds/fertilisers that can be used. 
The farmers decide which protocols to apply, so they are in 
the lead of their farming and harvesting process. In 2022, 
we worked on more than 200 projects globally, including in 
Mexico, Brazil, France, UK, Ireland and Australia. Pilots in 
2021 show a 25% CO2 emissions reduction and 40% 
increase in CO2 sequestration. 

These measures bring us closer to regenerative agriculture 
initiatives which will cover wider areas such as water, 
biodiversity, soil health and farmer livelihoods.

We source barley from geographies including Western 
Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, UK, Scandinavia, 
Australia, USA, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and others. This 
brings flexibility to our supply chain which helps mitigate 
climate impacts globally. We are partnering with one of 
the leading research institutions in this field to assess the 
physical climate change risk for barley growing areas 
globally up until 2050, with deep-dive assessments in 
Europe and the Americas. Using an advanced cropping 
systems model and tailored crop, water and soil 
parameters, we are able to identify the risk of yield 
reductions and opportunities for the development of new 
barley sourcing areas. Developing responsible agricultural 
supply chains to increase our volumes of sustainable raw 
materials is a key priority for growing our business and a 
crucial lever for reducing our carbon footprint.

One of the targets of our Brew a Better World strategy is 
that 100% of our main ingredients – hops and barley – will 
be sustainably sourced by 2030. We aim to achieve this by 
increasing our support to suppliers and committing to 
higher agricultural standards. We base our standards for 
sourcing sustainably cultivated crops on the globally 
recognised Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform. 
This requires the efficient production of safe, high quality 
agricultural products in a way that protects and improves 
the natural environment, social and economic conditions 
of farmers, their employees and local communities, and 
safeguards the health and welfare of all farmed species.

Resilience to climate-related risks



We believe that adopting the TCFD recommendations will 
help HEINEKEN to provide its stakeholders with robust 
information on climate-related risks and how we are 
managing them in the short, medium and long term. We 
are also embedding a climate-conscious approach to key 
decision-making processes, especially those that involve 
significant investment such as the development of 
greenfield projects. 

We will continue to develop our assessment of climate 
change-related risks and opportunities, enhance the 
quality of our scenario modelling and impact 
quantification, and further embed our approach to risk 
management and mitigation throughout HEINEKEN. The 
wide geography of our operations means it is crucial to 
monitor and analyse climate change impacts at regional 
and country levels. 

One of our main goals is to make climate change-related 
risk and opportunity management an integral part of our 
operational model across our global organisation. This is a 
constantly evolving process with the quantification of 
financial impact and methodologies, which are being 
continually refined. We will actively engage in discussions 
with internal and external stakeholders and experts to 
develop our understanding of climate risks, support action 
and inform decision-making as we progress towards our 
2040 ambitions.

Disclaimer
This disclosure is focused on climate-related risks and 
opportunities following the recommendations of the TCFD.
This disclosure contains forward-looking statements based 
upon current expectations, high-level estimations and 
assumptions regarding anticipated developments and other 
factors and focuses its scope on key risks. These forward-looking 
statements and resulting scenario analyses are based on both 
publicly available and internal information and are intended to 
estimate the circumstances of HEINEKEN. Although we 
endeavour to provide accurate and timely information, there 
can be no guarantee that such information is accurate as of the 
date it is received or that it will continue to be accurate in the 
future, as this is subject to risks and uncertainties that could 
cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in 
the forward-looking statements and scenario analyses. 
Many of these risks, expectations and uncertainties relate to 
factors that are beyond HEINEKEN’s ability to control or 
estimate precisely, such as future market and economic 
conditions, the behaviours of other market participants, 
changes in consumer preferences, costs of raw materials, 
interest-rate and exchange-rate fluctuations, changes in tax 
rates, changes in law, the actions of government regulators and 
physical impacts of climate change.
No one should act on or place undue reliance on such 
information, which speaks only as of the date of this Annual 
Report, without appropriate professional advice after a 
thorough examination of a particular situation. HEINEKEN aims 
to evolve its disclosures in the future to provide meaningful 
information to stakeholders by adapting it to new facts and 
regulation impacting the changing climate landscape.

Freshwater availability Water usage and withdrawal in water-stressed areas
Company risk factor and opportunity disclosures that clearly identify the principal material 
risks and opportunities facing the company specifically (as opposed to generic sector risks), 
the company appetite in respect of these risks, how these risks and opportunities have moved 
over time and the response to those changes. 
These opportunities and risks should integrate material economic, environmental and social 
issues, including climate change and data stewardship. 

Supporting healthy watersheds is a key strategic priority of our Brew a Better World 2030 strategy. See the section 
‘Towards healthy watersheds’ for details and current results of our water stewardship strategy. 

We are in a process of assessing our average water usage across the value chain, closely working with our suppliers. In the meantime: 
– We work with suppliers that comply with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative platform (SAI), an organisation of multinational 

food companies working towards a more sustainable food chain. The Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) framework aims to 
assess, improve and validate on-farm sustainability in our supply chain, including such areas of water management as water 
management practices, irrigation methods, fertiliser management and soil pollution. 

– In 2022, 73% of our barley and 96% of our hops came from sustainable sources. Overall, 67% of our raw materials came from 
sustainable sources. 

– In 2021, we conducted global water risk screening in key sourcing areas by working with our suppliers. In 2022, we communicated 
the outcomes to suppliers to build awareness, especially in locations that are potentially water-stressed. We will conduct one-to-one 
sessions with suppliers in water-stressed areas to share best practice guidance on water risk management.

Pay equality (%)
Ratio of the basic salary and remuneration for each employee category by significant 
locations of operation for priority areas of equality: women to men, minor to major ethnic 
groups, and other relevant equality areas. 

By 2023, ongoing assessments and actions will be in place to close any pay gaps between female and male colleagues. Action plans 
will focus on improving equal pay and gender representation, opportunity for promotion and gender balance in management teams. 

In 2022, we continued to assess the progress across all our operating companies to track and monitor improvements on the path to 
equal pay for equal work. By the end of 2022, 100% of operating companies have been assessed and 100% have action plans in place. 

See the section ‘A fair and safe workplace’ for further equal pay strategy information. 

Wage level (%)
Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage. Ratio of the 
annual total compensation of the CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all 
its employees, except the CEO. 

One of the key goals of our Brew a Better World 2030 strategy is to ensure all our employees worldwide earn at least a fair wage. A fair 
wage is often higher than the minimum wage and should be sufficient for a decent standard of living, covering the basic needs of the 
employee and him/her family from food, housing and education to healthcare, transportation and some discretionary income and savings. 

Data on what constitutes a fair wage around the world is obtained through the Fair Wage Network, an independent NGO. We assess 
wages across all operating companies against the Fair Wage Network annually. Our aim is to close any wage gaps by the end of 2023, 
we started with operating companies in developing countries where the challenges are the greatest. In 2022, we re-assessed operating 
companies in scope in Asia Pacific, Africa Middle East & Eastern Europe and the Americas. Companies in Europe were assessed for the 
first time.

We have identified fair wage gaps for our direct employees in seven operating companies since 2021 and have closed these gaps in 
five. 99,96% of direct employees across all HEINEKEN operating companies now earn at least a fair wage. 

See the section ‘A fair and safe workplace’ of our Sustainability review, for more information.

For the ratio of total annual compensation of CEO to median annual total compensation see the section ‘Remuneration Report’.

Health and well-being Risk for incidents of child, forced or compulsory labour
An explanation of the operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for incidents 
of child labour, forced or compulsory labour. Such risks could emerge in relation to:

a. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant) and type of supplier; and
b. countries or geographic areas with operations and suppliers considered at risk.

Respect for people’s dignity and human rights is a foundation of how we do business. We follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights. Our Code of Business Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Supplier Code guide us to understand, avoid and address 
human rights-related risks around the world, supported by a robust due diligence process. 

We consider suppliers that are producing goods or providing services in certain geographies as potentially high risk for incidents of child 
or forced labour based on indexes such as Fragile State Index, Global Resilience Index, Global Slavery Index and Child Labour Human 
Development Index. On top of that, we consider suppliers that are producing certain goods or providing certain services as potentially 
high risk for incidents of child or forced labour. For example, suppliers of merchandise materials or temporary labour. Our Supplier Risk 
Management process would flag these suppliers for further screening and due diligence process.

Average training and development expenditure per full time employee (total cost of training 
provided to employees divided by the number of employees).

We embrace the learning and growth of our employees, teams and organisation. Investing in the training and development of our 
people is a core priority. We follow the 70-20-10 approach recognising that around 70% of what people learn comes through the 
experience and practice of doing their jobs, 20% through engagement, networking and dialogue, and 10% through formal learning 
and training. 

In 2022, overall our employees received over 740,000 formal training hours. Our direct spend on the formal training was €31 million.

The EU Taxonomy Regulation
The EU Taxonomy Regulation, adopted by the European 
Commission on 4 June 2021, is a classification system 
which defines a list of environmentally sustainable 
economic activities intended to provide a common 
language to identify to what degree economic activities 
can be considered environmentally sustainable. The EU 
taxonomy is divided into six objectives:
1. Climate Change Mitigation (CCM);

2. Climate Change Adaptation (CCA);
3. Sustainable and protection of water and marine 

resources (Water);
4. Pollution prevention and control (Pollution);
5. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and 

ecosystems (Biodiversity); and
6. Transition to a circular economy (Circularity).

For each of these objectives, companies should assess if 
their economic activities are in scope. For HEINEKEN, this 
means assessing if the primary revenue generating 
activities (brewing and selling of beer and cider) are in 
scope of one or more of the six objectives. For activities in 
scope, HEINEKEN is required to report on how much of its 
turnover, CAPEX and OPEX is in scope, or ‘eligible’, and how 
much is considered ‘aligned’ with the EU Taxonomy. For 
an activity to be considered aligned, it should make a 
substantial contribution to one or more of the EU’s 
environmental objectives, providing it does not do 
significant harm (DNSH) to the other objectives and 
complies with the minimum safeguards.

CCM and CCA are in scope for reporting under the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation in 2022. The four remaining 
objectives are expected to come into effect in 2023. This will 
result in additional disclosures for HEINEKEN in the coming 
years.  Based on analysis of the draft documents available 
for the four remaining objectives (as published by the 
Platform on Sustainable Finance in March 2022, Part A and 
B), we conclude that HEINEKEN’s main revenue-generating 
activity is in scope for ‘Biodiversity’ and ‘Circularity’. Based on 
this initial screening, ‘Circularity’ is expected to be most 
relevant for HEINEKEN.

Climate change mitigation and 
climate change adaptation
We concluded that the main revenue generating activity 
of HEINEKEN is not included in the current parts of the 
regulation (CCM and CCA). Other activities were excluded 
from the analysis as these are considered immaterial. 
Refer to the table below for the share of eligible and 
non-eligible activities under CCM and CCA.

Share of eligible 
activities*

Share of non-eligible 
activities*

Turnover 0% 100%

CAPEX 0% 100%

OPEX 0% 100%

* As HEINEKEN does not have any eligible activities, we are not using the full 
   table as prescribed in article 2 paragraph 2 (EU regulation 2021/2178).

Assumptions applied in our eligibility analysis
The regulation is still being developed and there is limited 
market practice and guidance available on how to apply 
and report on the EU Taxonomy at this time. This may 
lead to different interpretations, assumptions and 
disclosures by companies. 

The key assumptions applied by HEINEKEN are: 

– An activity is in scope of the eligibility reporting if the 
activity is revenue-generating. Other non-revenue 
generating activities mentioned in the regulation, such 
as transportation and acquisition of new buildings, are 
not considered eligible. 

– CAPEX or OPEX are only reported for Taxonomy-eligible 
and Taxonomy-aligned activities.

Net zero carbon emission strategy
As part of Brew a Better World, we aim to reach net zero 
carbon emissions in scope 1 and 2 in 2030 and in scope 1, 
2 and 3 in 2040. 

Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and Energy Attribute 
Certificates (EACs) are an important part of our sourcing 
strategy to contract renewable energy and drive progress 
towards our net zero emissions ambitions in scope 1 and 2. 
While these steps contribute in decreasing our carbon 
emissions in scope 1 and 2, they are not part of the KPIs as 
reported under the EU Taxonomy.

The biggest part of our carbon footprint lies in our value 
chain beyond our owned production sites (scope 3). Any 
measures taken to reduce the carbon footprint in our value 
chain are also out of scope of the KPIs as reported under 
the Taxonomy.

More information on our net zero strategy and 
measures can be found on pages 134–137

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD)
The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) 
was adopted by the European Parliament on 
10 November 2022 and published in the Official Journal 
on 16 December 2022. 

Its purpose is to increase transparency on environment, 
social affairs and governance matters across companies. 
This should help to improve consistency and comparability 
in sustainability reporting and drive the quality of 
reporting against sustainability matters to the level 
achieved in financial reporting. It further promotes 
investment that supports the transition to a sustainable 
economy in line with the European Green Deal.

The CSRD will come into effect for HEINEKEN as of 
1 January 2024 and will require limited assurance in the 
2024 Annual Report (filed in 2025). 

The introduction of CSRD will significantly increase our 
disclosure requirements, as provided in the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The first set of 
ESRS were submitted by the European Financial Reporting 
Advisory Group (EFRAG) to the European Commission in 
November 2022. The European Commission is expected 
to adopt the final standards in June 2023. 

We are carrying out CSRD implementation activities 
towards CSRD compliance. This includes conducting a gap 
assessment of disclosure requirements on the April 2022 
Exposure Drafts, developing an implementation roadmap 
and starting the process for carrying out a double 
materiality assessment. 

As the CSRD will have a broad organisational impact, 
including on governance, strategy, systems, processes 
and controls, a cross functional team will manage the 
CSRD implementation.

We see it as imperative to integrate our Brew a Better World performance in our 
Annual Report and provide independent confirmation that the information in this 
report is reliable and accurate. As a result, Deloitte provides limited assurance on 
the most important non-financial indicators. This section provides an overview of 
the reporting scope, key definitions and measurement principles related to our 
Brew a Better World 2030 KPIs.
Reporting period and operating companies in scope
The non-financial indicators in this report cover the performance of all HEINEKEN consolidated entities from 
1 January 2022 up to and including 31 December 2022, unless otherwise stated. The scope of entities included in the 
reporting is equal to the basis of consolidation as per our financial statements, unless otherwise stated. Refer to note 5 
General accounting policies sub (a) of the financial statements for the consolidation principles and note 13.4 for the 
list of our significant subsidiaries.

Deviations from the reporting scope depend on the nature of each indicator and exceptions and limitations are 
explained per each indicator below. Units (countries, sites, suppliers, brands, etc.) which, for specific reasons, received 
formal derogations for compliance are excluded from the indicator reporting scope.

New acquisitions and greenfield breweries are included in the consolidated reporting after the first full calendar year 
of operation. In 2022, there were no significant acquisitions or disposals (refer to note 10.1 Acquisitions and disposals 
of subsidiaries and non-controlling interests). UBL, as acquired in 2021, will be included in the BaBW reporting in a 
phased approach. In the 2022 reporting some KPIs do not yet include data of UBL. In the definitions per KPI on the 
next pages it is indicated in the scope section which KPIs are not yet including UBL.

Indicators in scope
The content of this report is based on material aspects for our Company and stakeholders and is directly linked to our 
Brew a Better World (BaBW) strategy and 2030 goals. We have selected non-financial KPIs that are most material, 
based on the following criteria:

– The KPI is a BaBW goal or a new target we publicly disclose;
– The KPI is not related to a target but is part of a BaBW focus area and seen as important by our stakeholders;   

and/or
– The combination of KPIs should give a balanced, high level overview of our progress in 2022.

Scope and materiality of indicators may be reviewed by the Disclosure Committee and adjusted once a year with 
effect as of the following year.

As a part of the HEINEKEN Risk management process, we assess main risks that could hinder HEINEKEN in achieving 
its strategy and business objectives. This process includes identifying Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
risks. These main risks are included in this report (see the Risk Management section).

Reliability and accuracy of data
We have processes governing the collection, review and validation of non-financial data included in this report at 
both local operating company and global level. We apply uniform definitions and instructions for reporting purposes 
to improve the accuracy and comparability of data. Where possible, standard or automated calculations and validity 
checks are built into systems to minimise errors. The Global Sustainable Development team consolidates, analyses 
and further communicates data reported by operating companies and global functions on a quarterly basis and in 
the Annual Report. Subject matter experts are involved at various levels to validate and challenge the data and 
process. We are continuously strengthening our data collection processes and underlying controls. 

Our operating companies and data owners report fairly and in accordance with agreed procedures and instructions. 
However, it is not possible to ascertain full completeness and accuracy of data contained in our report. Operating 
companies are at different stages of maturity with regards to data collection and reporting processes. Where we 
have concerns, we highlight them in the report. HEINEKEN’s internal audit function, Global Audit, is involved in the 
annual review of the non-financial reporting process, including the quality of control processes at various levels and 
data ownership. Deloitte provides limited assurance on the indicators as described in detail in the Assurance report 
of the independent auditor.

Definitions per indicator
We gather data in accordance with guidelines and definitions based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 
Standards) Guidelines, unless stated otherwise. We aim to align with international standards (WEF Common 
Metrics, TCFD etc.), and, if not available, we work with industry partners such as the Beverage Industry and 
Environmental Roundtable (BIER) to develop common practices. 

‘Production site’ is used in various KPIs and refers to breweries, cider plants, soft drink plants, malteries, water plants 
and combinations of these at which malt, beer, cider, soft drinks, water or wine are produced. Production sites are 
only included when these are part of a consolidated entity.

Environmental – Reach net zero carbon

Reach net zero in scope 1 and 2 by 2030

Key performance 
indicator

Metric tonnes of CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions.

Baseline – 2018
– Baseline changes are implemented according to the GHG protocol.

Measurement/units – Tonnes of CO2-eq emissions (in metric tons).
– % of CO2-eq emissions reduction in production in the year compared to the CO2-eq emissions in production in 2018.

Key Definitions – To calculate the CO2-eq emissions, the GreenHouseGas (GHG) protocol is used, Corporate reporting scope 1 and 2 methodology.
– Formula: Volume produced (MioHL) x Energy used (MJ/MWh) x Energy Emission factor (MJ/MWh into CO2-eq).

– Energy Emission factor: converts energy to carbon, depending on the type of energy and related emissions. The energy emission factor is based on the IEA (International Energy Agency, 
https://www.iea.org/ ) for grid electricity, Defra (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, UK) for biofuels and IPCC 2006 report for fossil fuels. 

– Net zero as defined by SBTi Net-Zero Standard means reducing CO2eq (GHG) emissions to zero, or to a residual level, and compensating the residual emissions with a maximum of 10% of emissions.
– CO2-eq emissions: this includes emissions caused by direct emissions from combustion of fuels, indirect emissions from imported (purchased) heat and electricity, and emissions from refrigerant losses.
– The production sites represent 90% of scope 1 and 2 emissions. By reaching 0 emissions in production, HEINEKEN will decrease its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 90% in line with its science based targets.

Scope All production sites of consolidated entities.

Reduce scope 3 emissions by 21% by 2030
Reduce emissions across our value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) by 30% by 2030
Reach net zero across our value chain by 2040

Key performance 
indicator

– Metric tonnes of CO2-eq emissions.
– % of CO2-eq emissions reduction in the value chain in the year compared to the CO2-eq emissions in value chain in 2018.

Baseline – 2018
– Baseline changes are implemented according to the GHG protocol.

Measurement/units – Total CO2-eq emissions (in metric tons).
– % of CO2-eq emissions reduction in value chain in the year compared to the CO2-eq emissions in value chain in 2018.

Methodology – The Company Carbon Footprint includes CO2 emissions from all the activities linked to making and selling our products across the entire barley to bar value chain. We have identified seven phases in the life 
cycle of a beverage: agriculture, raw materials processing, beverage production, packaging, logistics, cooling and other emissions. A full description of the coverage of the workstreams is given in the life cycle 
definitions below. 

– We started measuring our carbon footprint in 2010 when only a few of our operating companies were included and a specific methodology was not yet available. Since then, our scope has expanded and the 
methodologies we use have improved. Today, our Company Carbon Footprint includes our entire value chain – from our own operations to suppliers, subcontractors and customers, across activities including 
manufacture and recycling of packaging and cooling beverages at points of sale. We continue to develop it in line with new methodologies, availability of better data sources and alignment with industry 
best practice.

– HEINEKEN’s calculation scope and principles are compared to the requirements of three relevant protocols: the GHG protocol Product standard, the GHG protocol Corporate Standard (scope 1 and 2) and the 
GHG protocol Corporate standard (scope 3). HEINEKEN accounts for relevant GHG emissions along its production: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). HEINEKEN has worked closely with BIER (Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable) to develop GHG emissions sector guidance to standardise 
GHG reporting. We adhere to the BIER protocol, version 4.1.

Key Definitions Life cycle definitions:
– Agriculture covers all activities for land-bound inputs used for beverage production, for example cultivation of barley, hops, sugar beets, fruits. The impact related to land use change is included in this life cycle 

stage.
– Raw materials processing covers all processing of inputs before the beverage production stage, for example malting barley, concentrating hops, producing sugar syrup or fruit concentrates.
– Packaging material production and disposal covers all activities for packaging material production, generated at the packaging suppliers. This includes raw materials, energy used and the recycled material 

used. The disposal (recycling) of packaging materials are calculated with the “Circular Footprint Formula” (as per the Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) and includes country- and 
material-specific recycling rates). 

– Logistics covers both inbound transport of raw agricultural inputs, processed inputs and packaging materials to our breweries as outbound distribution of beverages to the point of sale consumer, and 
warehouse energy consumption. It includes the logistics network, both controlled and not controlled by HEINEKEN, to get the finished product to the point of sale and back (returnable packaging).

– Cooling covers the emissions from cooling the beverages. This can be cooling in draught beer installations (DBIs), cooling in fridges in bars and restaurants and home cooling by consumers.
– Other emissions cover: Purchased goods and services, Capital goods, Business travel, Commuting, Upstream leased assets and Investments.
Emission categories: As per GHG Protocol requirements we split our emissions into scope 1, scope 2 and different scope 3 categories.  
– Scope 1 emissions are emissions from fuel combustion and fugitive emissions at our production plants and own transport. 
– Scope 2 emissions are emissions from acquired and consumed electricity, steam, heat.
– Scope 3 emissions fall under different categories: 

– Category 1 – upstream emissions from production of raw and packaging materials, external processing, co-packing and municipal water intake. The end-of-life treatment of packaging materials is also 
included in this category;

– Category 2 – emissions from capital goods (purchased Property, Plant & Equipment);
– Category 3 – upstream emissions of fuels, electricity and heat used by own production sites, warehouses and transport;
– Category 4 – emissions from inbound and outbound transportation;
– Category 5 – emissions from solid waste and wastewater;
– Category 6 – emissions from business travel; 
– Category 7 – emissions from employee commuting;
– Category 8 – emissions from leased cars (fuel);
– Category 9 – emissions from transportation to end customer;
– Category 11 – emissions of fridges, DBIs and home cooling;
– Category 12 – end-of-life treatment of sold products emissions are included in category 1. (Category 12 cannot be separated at the moment. This will be separated as per next year’s reporting.); 
– Category 15 – emissions of joint ventures and associates.

Significant 
estimates and 
judgements

– HEINEKEN strives to report the Carbon Footprint as accurately and completely as possible. Due to inherent limitations in relation to the uncertainty of measurement equipment and/or availability of actual 
data we apply extrapolations, use estimates, assumptions and judgements in our reporting. Estimates, assumptions and judgements are based on historical data. As such, emissions reporting provides 
inherent limitations to the accuracy of information. We used the following significant estimates to report our emissions:
– To calculate emissions of our own production operations, we use data provided by our energy and fuel suppliers. If this data is not available, we use the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse 

Gas Inventories for emission factors of fossil fuels, most recent International Energy Agency data (September 2022) for country grid emission factors and UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural 
Affairs (DEFRA) emission factors for biofuels;

– The transport emissions reporting has limitations for all transport modes. For fleet within our control, we have started to use Fuel Based data in countries where  we have telematics systems in place. For 
contracted partners where have the data of kilometres driven and type of vehicle used, we calculate emissions based on a Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) framework accredited emission factor 
gCO2-eq/km. For contracted partners where data on distance travelled is not available, calculations are based on estimates. For inbound transport, emissions are calculated for our biggest categories such 
as glass bottles, aluminium cans, malt and adjuncts;

– Emissions at outsourced logistics sites also have limitations. For such sites where data on electricity (KWH) consumption and fuel consumption for Forklift trucks is not available, estimations are used.
– Packaging emissions are based on a circular carbon footprint formula (as per PEFCR) incorporating upstream production, use and end of life of the product. As glass bottles and aluminium cans are 

HEINEKEN’s most significant emissions contributors, suppliers making up 80% of these emissions provide information about the carbon intensity of their production locations supplying HEINEKEN. For 
the remainder of our Packaging materials , an industry approved PEFCR emissions factor is applied; 

– Agriculture and processing emissions reporting has limitations. We use external party inputs for land use change (LUC) emission factors per country and per crop. Based on the available data per country 
and per crop in the external party database, a weighted average emission factor per crop is calculated (for Barley we have data available for 61% of the total volume). This weighted average emission 
factor is applied to calculate the emission per crop for all countries. For processing, we collect data from suppliers. In case there is no data available, we estimate the emission factor per material group.

– To calculate cooling emissions, we assume the lifetime of fridges and DBIs to be seven years. We calculate DBI emissions based on the assumption of the percentage of sales that goes via keg packaging 
type in each country. The rest of the volume sold is used to estimate the emissions from fridges and home cooling;

– For the other emissions category we also apply assumptions and judgement. For goods purchased for resale, we assume that these have a similar carbon footprint as our own produced products. For 
assets under construction (purchased Property, Plant and Equipment), we assume that these have a similar carbon footprint as our capitalised assets. For employee commuting distance and 
methodology, we use regionally produced government statistics. For emissions factors, we use those published by parties like DEFRA – with a frequency of update to match the change scale. 

Scope – UBL is not included in the reporting scope.
– We calculate the CO2 emissions for the largest CO2 emitting operating companies and extrapolated the obtained results to reach the absolute total amount. Every year we add entities in scope of the 

calculation and at the same time decrease the extrapolated amount. calculation (e.g. pubs and bars in UK). Russia has been excluded of scope calculation and included in the extrapolation due to 
unavailability of actual information.

Key Definitions – Sustainable volume: measured in accordance with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI): The efficient production of safe, high quality agricultural products, in a way that protects and improves the 
natural environment, social and economic conditions of farmers, their employees and local communities, and safeguards the health and welfare of all farmed species.

– The compliance with SAI is monitored via a 3rd party. On an annual basis, the third party performs random on site visits for supplier verification on a number of suppliers and their farmers.
– SAI: A food industry organisation aimed to support the development of sustainable agriculture, involving stakeholders of the food chain. For more details see www.saiplatform.org.
– Sustainable ingredient: An agricultural material that was produced in a manner which produces safe, high quality agricultural products, protects and improves the natural environment and the social and 

economic conditions of farmers and their communities.
– Mass balance approach: HEINEKEN applies the Mass Balance approach for the calculation of sustainable volumes in the supply chain. This entails that the inputs into a process must be equal to the outputs, 

plus any losses or accumulation in the process.

Scope – The reported volume includes both the volume purchased for our consolidated entities, as well as volume purchased centrally on behalf of some joint ventures and associates.

Appropriation of Results



To the shareholders and the Supervisory Board of Heineken N.V 

Report on the audit of the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2022 included in the annual report 
Our opinion 
We have audited the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 of Heineken N.V, based in 
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements and the 
Company financial statements. 

In our opinion:

– The accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Heineken 
N.V as at 31 December 2022, and of its result and its cash flows for for the year ended 31 December 2022 in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with 
Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

– The accompanying Company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Heineken N.V 
as at 31 December 2022, and of its result for for the year ended 31 December 2022 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 
2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

The consolidated financial statements comprise:

– The consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022.
– The following statements for 2022: the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the 

consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows.
– The notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 

The company financial statements comprise:

– The Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2022.
– The Company profit and loss account for for the year ended 31 December 2022.
– The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of 
our report. 

We are independent of Heineken N.V in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory 
audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 
Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance- opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the 
Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch 
Code of Ethics).

We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Information in support of our opinion
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our 
opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion was addressed in this context, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.

Materiality
Based on our professional judgement we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a whole at

€ 210 million (2021: €170 million). The materiality is based on 5% of profit before tax from continuing operations using 
net revenue as supporting benchmark. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements 
that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons. The increase compared 
to 2021 is predominantly the result of stronger performance, and the impact of newly acquired entities on the financial 
statements of Heineken N.V.

Audits of group entities (components) were performed using materiality levels determined by the judgement of the 
group audit team, having regard to the materiality of the consolidated financial statements.

Component materiality for our three largest components was € 65 million, and our materiality for other components did 
not exceed € 45 million.

We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of €10.5 million, which are identified during the audit, 
would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.

Scope of the group audit
Heineken N.V is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated 
financial statements of Heineken N.V.

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are responsible for directing, supervising and performing the 
group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out on the 
entities. Our group audit is mainly focused on financially large entities in terms of size and financial interest or where 
significant risks or complex activities were present, leading to full audits performed for 27 (2021: 28 components) 
components, including 2 non-consolidated components.

We have performed audit procedures ourselves at Heineken N.V., corporate entities and certain operations in the 
Netherlands. Furthermore, we performed audit procedures at group level on areas such as consolidation, disclosures, 
impairment testing for intangible assets (including goodwill) and non-current assets held for sale, joint ventures, financial 
instruments, acquisitions and divestments. Specialists were involved amongst others in the areas of treasury, information 
technology, forensics, tax, accounting, pensions and valuations. For the selected component audit teams, the group audit 
team provided detailed written instructions, which, in addition to communicating our requirements of component audit 
teams, also detailed significant audit areas and information obtained centrally relevant to the audit of individual 
components, including awareness for risks related to management override of controls.

Furthermore, we developed a plan for overseeing each component audit team based on its relative significance and 
specific risk characteristics. Our oversight procedures included (virtual) meetings with the component auditor and 
component management and physical or remote working paper reviews for The Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, 
Spain, Italy, Austria, Poland, Brazil, Mexico, USA, Nigeria, Vietnam, South Africa and India. We also reviewed component 
audit team deliverables for the countries listed above and the additional countries in scope to gain a sufficient 
understanding of the work performed based on our instructions. The nature, timing and extent of our oversight 
procedures varied based on both quantitative and qualitative considerations. For smaller components, we have 
performed review procedures or specific audit procedures.

By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures at group level, we 
have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an 
opinion about the consolidated financial statements.

Audit approach fraud risks
In accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, we are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements taken as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. Inherent to 
our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements, there is an unavoidable risk that material misstatements go 
undetected, even though the audit is planned and performed in accordance with Dutch law. The risk of undetected 
material misstatements due to fraud is even higher, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Also, we are not responsible for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and non-compliance with all laws and regulations. Our audit procedures differ from a forensic or legal investigation, 
which often has a more in-depth character.

We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit 
we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, 
including the risk assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the 
system of internal control and how the supervisory board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer to section 
Risk management of the annual report for the

Executive Board's (fraud) risk assessment and section To the Shareholders (paragraph Audit Committee) of the 
Supervisory Board report in which the supervisory board reflects on this fraud risk assessment. We note that 
management regularly updates on its risk assessment including fraud and updates its risk and control framework.

We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk 
assessment, as well as the Code of Business Conduct, Company Rules, Speak Up policy and incident registrations. We 
evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness, of 
internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks. Further, for certain selected speak up cases, we evaluated 
management’s response and remedial actions and measures.

As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, 
misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated 
whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due fraud is present.

Following these procedures, and the presumed risks under the prevailing audit standards, we considered fraud risks 
related to management override of controls. Our audit procedures to respond to these fraud risks include, amongst 
others, an evaluation of relevant internal controls and supplementary substantive audit procedures, including detailed 
testing of journal entries and post-closing adjustments based on supporting documentation. Data analytics, including 
selection of journal entries based on risk-based characteristics, form part of our audit approach to address the identified 
fraud risks.

Additionally, we performed further procedures including, among others, the following:

– We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit 
procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or noncompliance.

– We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant key management personnel, the Executive Board 
and the Supervisory Board.

– We tested the appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and other adjustments made in the 
preparation of the financial statements.

– We evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the group, particularly those related to 
subjective measurements and complex transactions, may be indicative of fraudulent financial reporting.

– We evaluated whether the judgments and decisions made by the Executive Board in making the accounting 
estimates included in the financial statements indicate a possible bias that may represent a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. The Executive Board’s insights, estimates and assumptions that might have a major 
impact on the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3 of the financial statements.

– We performed a retrospective review of management judgments and assumptions related to significant accounting 
estimates reflected in prior year financial statements.

Certain management estimates and judgements are considered most significant to our audit. Reference is made to the 
section ‘Our key audit matters’ for further details on those estimates and judgments.

For significant transactions such as various business acquisitions during the year, we evaluated whether the business 
rationale of the transactions suggest that they may have been entered into to engage in fraudulent financial reporting or 
to conceal misappropriation of assets.

This did not lead to indications for fraud potentially resulting in material misstatements.

Audit approach compliance with laws and regulations
We assessed the laws and regulations relevant to the Company through discussion with, amongst others, the Executive 
Board, Group Legal Counsel and those charged with governance, reading minutes of board meetings and reports of 
internal audit. We also involved our forensic specialists in this assessment.

As a result of our risk assessment procedures, and while realizing that the effects from non-compliance could considerably 
vary, we considered the following laws and regulations: adherence to (corporate) tax laws and financial reporting 
regulations, the requirements under the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(EU-IFRS) and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code with a direct effect on the financial statements as an integrated 
part of our audit procedures, to the extent material for the related financial statements.

We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding provisions of those laws and regulations generally 
recognized to have a direct effect on the financial statements.

Apart from these, Heineken N.V is subject to other laws and regulations where the consequences of non- compliance 
could have a material effect on amounts and/or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance, through imposing 
fines or litigation.

Given the nature and complexity of Heineken N.V’s business, we considered the risk of non-compliance in the areas of 
competition, data protection, human rights, tax and other applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we considered 
major laws and regulations applicable to listed companies.

Our procedures are more limited with respect to laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the 
determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Compliance with these laws and regulations 
may be fundamental to the operating aspects of the business, to Heineken N.V’s ability to continue its business, or to 
avoid material penalties (e.g., compliance with the terms of operating licenses and permits or compliance with 
environmental regulations) and therefore non-compliance with such laws and regulations may have a material effect on 
the financial statements. Our responsibility is limited to undertaking specified audit procedures to help identify non-
compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements.

Our procedures are limited to (i) inquiry of key management personnel, the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and 
others within Heineken N.V’s as to whether the Heineken N.V is in compliance with such laws and regulations and (ii) 
inspecting correspondence, if any, with the relevant licensing or regulatory authorities to help identify non-compliance 
with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements.

We remained alert to indications of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit.

Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of (suspected) fraud or non-compliance with laws 
and regulations have been disclosed to us.

Audit approach going concern
Our responsibilities, as well as the responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, related to going 
concern under the prevailing standards are outlined in the “Description of responsibilities regarding the financial 
statements” section below. In fulfilling our responsibilities, we performed procedures including evaluating management’s 
assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and considering the impact of financial, operational, 
and other conditions. Based on these procedures, we did not identify any reportable findings related to the entity’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.

Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are 
not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.

The below identified key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Impairment testing of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment — Refer to Notes 8.1 and 
8.2 to the financial statements
Key audit 
matter 

Intangible assets (including goodwill) and property, plant and equipment amounted to EUR 35,031 
million at 31 December 2022 and represented 67 percent of the consolidated total assets. Following 
Russia’s military actions and the ongoing war in the Ukraine, HEINEKEN decided to leave Russia and 
transfer its business to a new owner. Pending completion of the envisaged transfer, non-current assets 
of EUR 255 million related to HEINEKEN’s business in Russia have been recognised as held for sale. 
This resulted in a total amount of assets and disposal groups held for sale of EUR 315 million.
For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated and monitored on a (groups of) Cash 
Generating Unit (‘CGU’) level. Other intangibles and property, plant and equipment, are grouped to 
CGUs. For goodwill, management is required to assess the recoverable amount of the respective 
CGUs (or groups of CGUs). Recoverable amounts of other non- current assets are assessed upon the 
existence of a triggering event. For assets or disposal groups held for sale, an impairment loss is 
recognised should the carrying amount exceed the fair value less cost to sell.
In view of the inherent uncertainties, including those related to the current macro- economic 
environment and geopolitical climate related to Russia, the projection of sales volumes, revenue, 
margins and discount rates in management's impairment tests, involved an increased level of 
judgement. As a result of the impairment testing for the current year, management concluded on 
impairment losses of EUR 126 million and a reversal of EUR 258 million. Further details on the 
accounting and disclosures under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets are included in notes 8.1 and 8.2 to 
the financial statements. Further details on the accounting and disclosure under IFRS 5 Non-current 
Assets Held for Sale are included in note 10.2 to the financial statements.
Given the increased level of judgement made by management to estimate the recoverable 
amounts used in management’s impairment tests for intangible assets (including goodwill) and 
property, plant and equipment and the fair value less cost to sell for HEINEKEN’s business in Russia, 
procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of projected sales volumes, revenue and discount rates 
required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort, including the need 
to involve our valuation specialists.

How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter

Our audit procedures related to the projection of sales volumes, revenue, margins and discount 
rates used by management included the following, amongst others:
– We obtained an understanding of management's process over the impairment trigger tests 

and the resulting impairment tests.
– We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to 

management’s historical forecasts.
– We evaluated sensitivities in management’s projections, including those potentially related to 

climate risk factors, that could cause a substantial change to the impairments recorded, and or 
cause headroom to change in an impairment.

– We evaluated sensitivities in management’s estimate of the fair value less cost to sell including 
the impact of current and expected uncertainties around Russia.

– We evaluated projected cash flows by:
– Comparing the projections to historical forecasts, historical growth rates, including 

assessing the effects of the current macro-economic and geopolitical climate, and 
information included in HEINEKEN’s internal communications to the management and 
the Executive Board.

– Challenging management’s ability to price adjust for expected inflation rates and 
comparing projected sales volumes, revenue and margins to, for example, external 
economic outlook data, analyst reports and external market data on the beer market.

– We evaluated the fair value less cost to sell of the Russia disposal group by challenging 
management’s assumptions related to HEINEKEN’S plan to leave Russia and transfer its 
business to a new owner.

– With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of discount 
rates, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates, 
testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent 
estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.

Observation  Applying the aforementioned materiality, we did not identify any reportable findings in 
management’s assessment of the recoverability of intangible assets (including goodwill) and property, 
plant and equipment, the fair value less cost to sell for assets or disposal groups held for sale, the 
impairments recorded and the disclosures in Notes 8.1, 8.2 and 10.2.

Management judgement related to the provisions for uncertain tax positions and the recoverability of 
deferred tax assets — Refer to Notes 9.2 and 12 to the financial statements
Key audit 
matter 

HEINEKEN operates across several tax jurisdictions and is subject to periodic challenges by local tax 
authorities during the normal course of business. In those cases where the amount of tax payable is 
uncertain, management establishes provisions based on its judgement of the probable amount of 
the related tax liability. Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable income will be available, against which unused tax losses can be utilized. This 
assessment is performed annually and based on budgets and business plans for the coming years, 
including planned commercial initiatives and the impact of macro- economic uncertainties.
HEINEKEN recorded uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets for an amount of 
EUR 371 million and EUR 618 million, respectively, as of 31 December 2022.
The accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets, as detailed in Notes 9.2 and 12 
to the financial statements, inherently requires management to apply judgement in quantifying 
appropriate provisions (including assessing probable outcomes) for uncertain tax positions, and in 
determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Given the significant judgement applied by management, performing procedures to evaluate the 
reasonableness of probable outcomes for uncertain tax positions and the recoverability of deferred 
tax assets based on budgets and business plans, required a higher degree of auditor judgement, an 
increased extent of effort and a need to involve our in-country tax specialists.

How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter

Our audit procedures to address management’s judgements related to the provisions for uncertain 
tax positions and recoverability of deferred tax assets included the following, amongst others:
– We obtained an understanding of management’s tax process related to the assessment of 

uncertain tax positions and the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
– We involved our in-country tax specialists to assess tax risks, tax carry forward facilities, 

legislative developments and the status of ongoing local tax authority audits.
– We challenged, with the help of our tax specialists, management’s judgement applied in 

quantifying provisions for tax uncertainties and assessing probable outcomes based on 
correspondence with tax authorities, case law and opinions from management’s tax experts.

– We evaluated management’s ability to forecast taxable income accurately by comparing prior 
forecasts on future taxable income with the actual income for the year.

– We evaluated management’s recoverability assessment, including the likelihood of generating 
sufficient future taxable income based on budgets, business plans, and tax losses carry forward 
facilities in the various tax jurisdictions (including expiry dates).

Observation Applying the aforementioned materiality, we have audited the provisions for uncertain tax positions 
and the valuation of deferred tax assets as well as the related disclosure in Notes 9.2 and 12 and 
have no reportable findings.

Report on the other information included in the annual report 
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contain other information 
consists of:

– Report of the Executive Board.
– Report of the Supervisory Board.
– Other Information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
– Other information included in the Annual Report.

Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:

– Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatement

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the 
financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.

By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the 
Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in 
our audit of the financial statements.

The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the report of the Executive 
Board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and the other information as required by Part 9 of 
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF
Engagement
We were engaged by the Supervisory Board as auditor of Heineken N.V on April 24, 2014, for the audit of the year 2015 
and have operated as statutory auditor ever since that financial year.

No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.

European Single Electronic reporting Format (ESEF)
Heineken N.V has prepared its annual report in ESEF. The requirements for this are set out in the Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic 
reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).

In our opinion, the annual report, prepared in XHTML-format, including the (partly) marked-up consolidated financial 
statements, as included in the reporting package by Heineken N.V complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.

The Executive Board is responsible for preparing the annual report including the financial statements in accordance with 
the RTS on ESEF, whereby the Executive Board combines the various components into a single reporting package.

Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the annual report in this reporting package 
complies with the RTS on ESEF.

We performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N ‘Assurance-opdrachten 
inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument’ (assurance 
engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting).

Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements
Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements
The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance 
with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such 
internal control as the Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Executive Board 
should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Executive Board either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Executive Board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability 
to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and 
appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all 
material errors and fraud during our audit.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of 
identified misstatements on our opinion.

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit, in 
accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included 
among others:

– Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

– Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control.

– Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the Executive Board.

– Concluding on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue 
as a going concern.

– Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures.
– Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 

achieves fair presentation.

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the 
group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group 
entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group 
entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.

We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identified during our 
audit. In this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU 
Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public- interest entities. The information included in this 
additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.

We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor's report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not 
communicating the matter is in the public interest.

Assurance Report of the Independent Auditor (of non-financial indicators)



Basis for our conclusion
We have performed our review of the KPIs in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3000A ‘Assurance-
opdrachten anders dan opdrachten tot controle of beoordeling van historische financiële informatie’ (Assurance 
engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information). This assurance engagement is aimed at 
obtaining limited assurance. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the ‘Our responsibilities for 
the review of the KPIs’.

We are independent of Heineken N.V. in accordance with the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants 
bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) 
and other relevant independence regulations in The Netherlands. This includes that we do not perform any activities that 
could result in a conflict of interest with our independent assurance engagement. Furthermore we have complied with 
the ‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

Reporting criteria  
The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the KPIs are disclosed on pages 167–183 of the annual report in the 
section ‘Reporting basis of non-financial indicators’. 

The absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for 
different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.

Consequently, the KPIs need to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria used. 

The references to external sources, third parties or websites in the sustainability report  are not part of the KPIs as 
reviewed by us. We therefore do not provide assurance on this information.

Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the KPIs 
The Executive Board of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the KPIs in accordance with the reporting 
criteria as included in the ‘Reporting Criteria’ section, including the identification of the intended users and the definition 
of material matters. The Executive Board is also responsible for selecting and applying the reporting criteria and for 
determining that these reporting criteria are suitable for the legitimate information needs of stakeholders, taking into 
account applicable law and regulations related to reporting. The choices made by the Executive Board regarding the 
scope of the KPIs and the reporting policy are summarised on pages 167–183 of the annual report.

Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of the KPIs that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or errors.

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the reporting process of Heineken N.V.

Our responsibilities for the review of the KPIs
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the limited assurance assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient 
and appropriate evidence for our conclusion.  

Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed to determine the plausibility of information and 
vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of 
assurance obtained in review is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in an audit.

We apply the ‘Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen’ (NVKS, Regulations for quality management systems) and 
accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the review, in 
accordance with the Dutch Standard 3000A, ethical requirements and independence requirements.

Our review included among others:

– Performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant social themes and 
issues, and the characteristics of the company including a media search to identify relevant risks and issues within the 
scope of the assurance engagement during the reporting period;

– Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures for 
the KPIs.  

– Obtaining an understanding of the reporting processes for the KPIs, including obtaining a general understanding of 
internal control relevant to our review;  

– Obtaining an understanding of the procedures performed by the internal audit department
– Identifying areas of KPIs where a material misstatement, whether due to errors of fraud, are most likely to occur, 

designing and performing procedures responsive to these areas, and obtaining information that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

– Evaluating the consistency of the KPIs with the information in the annual report which is not included in the scope of 
our review.  

– Evaluating the presentation, structure and content of the sustainability data;  
– Considering whether the sustainability information as a whole, including the disclosures, reflects the purpose of the 

reporting criteria used.

Glossary



This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions with regard to 
the financial position and results of HEINEKEN’s activities, anticipated developments and other factors. All statements 
other than statements of historical facts are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking 
statements also include, but are not limited to, statements and information in HEINEKEN’s non-financial reporting, such 
as HEINEKEN’s emissions reduction and other climate change related matters (including actions, potential impacts and 
risks associated therewith). These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as 
“aim”, “ambition”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “goals”, “intend”, “may”, “milestones”, “objectives”, 
“outlook”, “plan”, “probably”, “project”, “risks”, “schedule”, “seek”, “should”, “target”, “will” and similar terms and phrases. 
These forward-looking statements, while based on management's current expectations and assumptions, are not 
guarantees of future performance since they are subject to numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and 
uncertainties, which may change over time, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or 
implied in the forward-looking statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond 
HEINEKEN’s ability to control or estimate precisely, such as but not limited to future market and economic conditions, the 
behaviour of other market participants, changes in consumer preferences, the ability to successfully integrate acquired 
businesses and achieve anticipated synergies, costs of raw materials and other goods and services, interest-rate and 
exchange-rate fluctuations, changes in tax rates, changes in law, environmental and physical risks, change in pension 
costs, the actions of government regulators and weather conditions. 

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of 
this Annual Report. 

HEINEKEN assumes no duty to and does not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements 
contained in this Annual Report. Market share estimates contained in this Annual Report are based on outside sources,
