About this Report 
Since 2021, Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A., as well as its affiliates and subsidiaries (“Itaú”), has been issuing 
sustainable bonds and, in 2022, it also started to carry out other funding operations for this purpose, thus 
reinforcing its ESG strategy.   Currently, it has a total of R$3,481 billion in debts issued under the  
Sustainable Finance Framework (Jan/2021). 

In line with the 4th pillar of the Sustainability Bond Guidelines1 managed by the International Capital 
Market Association (ICMA), this report intends to provide transparency for investors, disclosing the 
allocation of funds from funding operations, as well as the main indicators of the impact associated with 
the eligible investments.  

At the end of this report, you will find: (1) The Auditor’s Report related to the allocation of funds 
(Appendix I to the Auditor’s Report), as described in the Sustainable Finance Framework, and (2) the 
annual review regarding the alignment of the eligible investments with the Allocation of Funds section 
issued by the same independent consulting firm that issued the second opinion on Itaú’s framework.2 

ESG Strategy 

For many years, Itaú has been incorporating EGS issues into its business and operations. As a result of this 
historical commitment to the sustainability agenda, Itaú has launched the Positive Impact Commitments, 
which convey its ambition and contribution to the world and society.   

Its ESG strategy is connected with the center of our business. As a demonstration of the sustainability 
practices, we have the commitment to finance positive impact industries, with the target of originating 
R$400 billion by 2025 to promote a sustainable, greener and inclusive economy.  

This amount will be reached taking into account the 3 main business fronts:

Financing operations for wind power

Casa dos Ventos

Casa dos Ventos is a Brazilian company that develops, builds, and operates energy 
generation projects from renewable sources. The company is a protagonist in the energy 
transition in the country and is positioned as a platform of solutions to promote the 
decarbonization of businesses in different sectors of the economy. 

Responsible for the largest wind measurement campaign ever undertaken in the world, 
the company was responsible for the development of one in every four wind power 
projects in operation in Brazil. Casa dos Ventos has already deployed 2.1 GW (eight wind 
complexes), is building 736 MW in wind projects, and has the largest renewable pipeline in 
Brazil with 50.9 GW of wind and solar projects developed and under development. 

The Umari project consists of 4 plants: Canuto IV, Guilherme, Jeremias, and Galdino, and is 
located between the municipalities of Monte das Gameleiras, São José do Campestre, and 
Serra de São Bento (RN). The complex is composed of 45 wind turbines and has a total 
installed capacity of 202.5 MW, with the capacity to avoid the annual emission of 
approximately 90,000 tons of CO2 equivalent into the atmosphere. 

In all its projects, Casa dos Ventos maintains a transparent and collaborative relationship 
with the communities where they are located, seeking to train and privilege the hiring of 
local labor, besides investing in social projects that reduce the lack of local infrastructure 
and promote the improvement of quality of life in the communities. These initiatives are 
mainly linked to issues such as water availability, technical training and education, and 
projects to foster the local economy. Besides generating jobs, the investments benefit 
thousands of families who take advantage of the potential of their properties and start 
receiving additional income as lessees of the projects. They are investments that 
contribute to the energy transition and combat climate change, besides bringing relevant 
socioeconomic development in remote regions of the country.

To the Management 
Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. 
São Paulo - SP 
 
 
 
 
Scope 
 
We have been engaged to present our limited assurance report on Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. ("Itaú 
Unibanco")'s Management Assertion (Attachment I) on the allocation of the total proceeds raised by 
Itaú Unibanco from the Sustainable Funding issued in the period from January 1, 2021 to December 
31, 2022 and allocated to projects on December 31, 2022 ("Assertion"). The proceeds from the 
Sustainable Funding should be applied exclusively to finance or refinance green projects, social 
projects, or a combination of them by means of credit operations granting, as set out in the document 
"Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. Sustainability Finance Framework", dated January 8, 2021 (hereinafter, 
"Sustainability Finance Framework" or "Framework"), as described in the Attachment II to this report 
("Criteria").  
 
Management's responsibility 
 
The management of Itaú Unibanco ("Management") is responsible for the Management Assertion, 
summarized in the Attachment I, in accordance with the Criteria established in the Attachment II to 
this report. This responsibility includes maintaining the operating structure and controls necessary to 
ensure that the information included in the " Sustainability Bond Annual Allocation and Impact 
Report” of Itaú Unibanco Holding is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
The Management of Itaú Unibanco is also responsible for defining, implementing, adapting, and 
maintaining the management systems from which to obtain the information necessary for the 
preparation of the mentioned Assertion, as well as for reviewing and updating the Framework. 
 
Our independence and quality control 
 
We comply with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Brazilian Accounting 
Standards ("NBC"), NBC PG 100 and 200 and NBC PA 291, which are based on the principles of 
integrity, objectivity, and professional competence and which also consider the confidentiality and 
behavior of professionals.  
 
 



Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. 
 
 

3 of 14 

We apply the international quality control standards established in NBC PA 01 and, therefore, we 
maintain an appropriate quality control system that includes policies and procedures related to the 
fulfillment of ethics requirements, professional standards, legal requirements, and regulatory 
requirements. 
 
Responsibilities of the independent auditor 
 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion as to whether nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that Itaú Unibanco's Management Assertion on the allocation of the total proceeds 
from the Sustainable Funding issued in the period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022 and 
allocated by Itaú Unibanco to projects to finance or refinance green projects, social projects or a 
combination of them by means of credit operations granting on December, 2022 is not adequate in 
accordance with the criteria set out in the Attachment II to this report, which were selected to enable 
Itaú Unibanco to comply with certain requirements of sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 of the Framework, 
dated January 8, 2021, whose link is in the Attachment II to this report. 
 
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the Brazilian Accounting 
Standard NBC TO 3000 - "Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews" issued by the 
Federal Accounting Council (CFC), which is equivalent to the international standard ISAE 3000 - 
"Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information", issued by 
the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). These standards require that we 
plan and perform our procedures to obtain limited assurance that Management’s Assertion is adequate 
to allow compliance with the criteria of sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 of the Framework, dated January 8, 
2021, and included in the Attachment II to this report. 
 
The procedure applied in a limited assurance engagement is less detailed than those applied in a 
reasonable assurance engagement. Therefore, a lower level of assurance is obtained than it would be 
obtained in a reasonable assurance engagement. 
 
The procedures selected, summarized in the Attachment III to this report, depend on the independent 
auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks that the operating structure, including 
policies, procedures and/or controls established by Itaú Unibanco to allow Management’s Assertion 
and the allocation of the total proceeds from the Sustainable Funding, is not adequate, in accordance 
with the criteria presented in the Attachment II to this report. Our procedures did not include tests of 
the operating effectiveness of the controls and, consequently, we do not express a conclusion on this 
aspect. 
 
Our engagement comprised the following steps: (a) planning the work; (b) obtaining an understanding of 
the operating structure established by Itaú Unibanco for compliance with sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 of the 
Framework, dated January 8, 2021, including the policies and procedures to comply with the aspects 
described in the Attachment II; consequently, permitting such Management Assertion described in the 
Attachment I to this report; and (c) performing the engagement in accordance with the procedures set 
out in the Attachment III to this report. 
 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
conclusion. 
 
 
 
 
 



Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. 
 
 

4 of 14 

Inherent limitations 
 
Our limited assurance engagement considered the operating structure of Itaú Unibanco necessary for 
the allocation and such Management Assertion on the total proceeds raised from the Sustainable 
Funding issued in the period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022 and allocated to projects on 
December 31, 2022, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Attachment II to this report, which 
were selected to comply with certain requirements of the Framework and did not include other 
technical and qualitative aspects of the operating structure of Itaú Unibanco related to the allocation of 
the total proceeds from the Sustainable Funding issued.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on our limited assurance engagement, we are not aware of any deviations that causes us to 
believe that the Itaú Unibanco's Management Assertion, as described in the Attachment I to this 
report, on the allocation of the total proceeds from the Sustainable Funding issued in the period from 
January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022 and allocated to projects on December 31, 2022 is not adequate, 
in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Attachment II to this report, 
which were selected to enable Itaú Unibanco to comply with certain requirements of sections 3.1, 3.2 
and 3.4 of the Framework dated January 8, 2021.  
 
Other matters 
 
Any party other than Itaú Unibanco that obtains access to our report, or to a copy of it, and relies on 
the information contained therein (or any part thereof) will do so at its own risk. We do not accept or 
assume any responsibility and deny any liability to any party other than Itaú Unibanco for our 
engagement, for the limited assurance report or for our conclusions.

Introduction 

Between January 2021 and December 2022, Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (“Itaú” or the “Bank”) issued several 
funding instruments1 (collectively, the “sustainability issuances”) aimed at financing projects that comply with 
the eligibility criteria defined under the Itaú Unibanco Holdings S.A. Sustainability Finance Framework (the 
“Framework”).2 Sustainalytics provided a Second-Party Opinion on the Framework in January 2021.3 In April 
2023, Itaú engaged Sustainalytics to review the projects funded through the sustainability issuances and 
provide an assessment as to whether the projects met the use of proceeds criteria and the reporting 
commitments outlined in the Framework. Among the available eligibility categories, the Bank focused on 
financing renewable energy and extending financial services to micro, small or medium enterprises (MSMEs). 
This is Sustainalytics’ second annual review of allocation and reporting of the instruments issued under the 
Framework, following a previous review in January 2022. 

Evaluation Criteria 

Sustainalytics evaluated the projects funded with proceeds from the sustainability issuances, based on 
whether the projects: 

1. Met the use of proceeds and eligibility criteria defined in the Framework; and 
2. Reported on at least one key performance indicator (KPI) for each use of proceeds category defined 

in the Framework. 

Table 1: Use of Proceeds Categories, Eligibility Criteria and Associated KPIs 

 

1 The Bank raised a total of USD 667.3 million which includes USD 500 million through its first sustainability bond in January 2021, USD 80.7 million through 
a sustainability loan, USD 24.1 million through ESG certificates and USD 62.5 million via a green bond through private placement.

4 The increase in energy sources, such as wind and solar in the generation of electric energy and the increase in the supply of biomass from sugarcane 
and biodiesel contributed to the Brazilian energy matrix to remain at a renewable level much higher than the level observed in the rest of the world. Public 
policies adopted in recent years favored the entry of renewable sources, such as biodiesel, whose consumption grows year after year in Brazil. Hydraulic 
power generation, the main source of electricity generation in the country, together with other renewables, represented 84.3% of all national generation in 
2019 according to the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil. Transmission lines are fundamental elements to give stability to the electrical system of 
Brazil, with a large share of renewable energy that are, by nature, intermittent and interdependent. The increase in the share of renewable energy in the 
Sistema Interligado Nacional (SIN) must be accompanied by expansion of transmission systems to reduce losses and congestion, as well as to guarantee 
flow and energy security. Distribution systems are responsible for connecting to the transmission to final consumers, and are also important elements to 
ensure that sources reach users in a safe way (EPE, 2017 (https://goo.gl/Z8XmKf ); IEEFA, 2018 https://bit.ly/2Ch6hDb ). Therefore, in local context of 
Brazil, there is no possibility that the investments done in electric energy transmission lines will distribute electric energy from carbon intensive sources 
in rates superior than the renewables under normal conditions.

Issuer’s Responsibility 

Itaú is responsible for providing accurate information and documentation relating to the details of the funded 
projects, including description of projects, amounts allocated and project impact. 

Independence and Quality Control 

Sustainalytics, a leading provider of ESG research and ratings, conducted the verification of the use of 
proceeds from Itaú’s sustainability issuances. The work undertaken as part of this engagement included 
collection of documentation from Itaú and review of said documentation to assess conformance with the 
Framework. 

Sustainalytics relied on the information and the facts presented by Itaú. Sustainalytics is not responsible nor 
shall it be held liable for any inaccuracies in the opinions, findings or conclusions herein due to incorrect or 
incomplete data provided by Itaú. 

Sustainalytics made all efforts to ensure the highest quality and rigor during its assessment process and 
enlisted its sustainability issuances Review Committee to provide oversight of the review. 

 

5 According IFC´s definition of micro and small companies, the annual revenue threshold for this segment is USD 3 million. Those companies may face 
challenges related to limited access to financial services, such as affordable loans and payments solutions due the lack of collateral or minimum use of 
access of technology. 
6 According IFC´s definition of Medium Enterprise, the annual revenue threshold for this segment is from USD 3 million to USD 15 million. Medium 
companies in Brazil face similar issues as Micro and Small Enterprises in terms of access to financial services, specially in some regions in Brazil that 
lack infrastructure and economic opportunities. 
7 According to IFC's definition, an enterprise qualifies as a woman-owned enterprise if: (a) ≥ 51% owned by woman/women; or (b) ≥ 20% owned by 
woman/women; and (i) has ≥ 1 woman as CEO/COO/President/Vice President; and (ii) has ≥ 30% of the board of directors composed of women, where a 
board exists. Entrepreneurship is a way and alternative for needy families and minority groups to guarantee income, while it benefits the community around 
them. 
8 According to UN development agency, Brazil´s HDI as of 2015 was 0.755. 
9 A company with Restricted access to credit is any company that has less than USD 1 million in loans with the bank. Small and medium enterprises have 
the potential to drive much-needed job creation and economic growth, but considering their size, they could have little access to the capital they need to 
thrive. Improving those companies’ access to credit could expand their businesses, creating significant numbers of jobs, and providing essential goods 
and services to their local populations. Also, financing those companies is aligned with the concept of IFC’s Inclusive Business concept, whereby we (Itau) 
aim(s) to bring the underserved into value chains as suppliers, distributors, retailers, or customers by creating better conditions for them to achieve 
commercial viability. 

Inclusive 
Finance  

Investments seeking social development and 
inclusion, that can be related to job 
conservation or creation, revitalizing of 
economically depressed areas, inclusion of 
minority groups, inclusion of groups with lack 
of access to financial services and economic 
opportunities. 

Eligible investments shall be related to the 
following criteria:  

• Micro and small enterprises;5   

• Micro, small and medium6  enterprises that 
additionally meets one of the following 
requirements:  

o Are women-owned companies7  

o Located primarily in North and 
Northeast region of Brazil, or in 
municipalities, or states with human 
development index (HDI) below the 
total of Brazil’s HDI average8  

o Have restricted access to credit9 

• Number/ volume of loans provided 
to target group 

• Number of new businesses created

Conclusion 

Based on the limited assurance procedures conducted,10 nothing has come to Sustainalytics’ attention that 
causes us to believe that, in all material respects, the reviewed projects do not conform with the use of 
proceeds criteria and reporting commitments in the Framework. Itaú has disclosed to Sustainalytics that it 
raised a total of USD 667.3 million through the sustainability issuances and the proceeds were fully allocated 
as of 31 December 2022.

11 This is in line with the lookback period of 3 years defined in the Framework. 
12 The projects’ currency is BRL and the USD/BRL exchange rate of 31 December 2022 is used for calculating the allocated amounts.  
13 Itaú has communicated to Sustainalytics that the emissions factor of the National Interconnected System or Sistema Interligado Nacional (SIN), to 
which the transmission line projects are connected, is in a downward trajectory and below the limit of 100 gCO2/kWh in the last 5 years. Between December 
2020 and September 2021, the number of green users represented 72.47% of the total number of users connected to the SIN.
