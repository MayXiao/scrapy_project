Brookfield 
Corporation 
at a Glance
Brookfield Corporation1, with a 100+ year 
heritage as an owner and operator of real 
assets, has a proven track record of deploying 
capital to build market leading businesses 
that generate stable, growing cash flows 
and attractive long-term total returns. 
Today, our capital is invested across three 
businesses—Asset Management, Insurance 
Solutions, and our Operating Businesses2.

Our capital is invested across businesses that help form the 

backbone of the global economy. The cash flows generated 

from our businesses are generally underpinned by stable, 

inflation-linked, largely contracted and growing revenue 

streams, and high cash margins. We leverage our global 

presence, the synergies of our businesses and large-scale, 

flexible capital to achieve strong returns across market cycles. 

On their own, each of our market-leading businesses have a 

strong growth profile but together they generate synergies 

which significantly enhance their growth. By leveraging the 

global reach and expertise of our asset management busi-

ness, our goal is to identify new investment opportunities 

that provide strategic value for Brookfield and the poten-

tial for attractive returns over the long-term.  

 

Our conservatively capitalized balance sheet provides 

downside protection and our scale, stability, and diversifi-

cation create a differentiated business model, positioning 

us well as a partner of choice for the global buildout of 

infrastructure, the transition to a sustainable energy future, 

and take-private opportunities.   

 

Sound environmental, social and governance (ESG) prin-

ciples are integral to building resilient businesses and 

creating long term value for our investors and other stake-

holders. As a result, we seek to embed these principles into 

all our activities—including our investment process—and 

conduct our business in a sustainable and ethical manner. 

An emphasis on diversity and inclusion reinforces our cul-

ture of collaboration. It strengthens our ability to develop 

our people and maintain an engaged workforce focused 

on serving as a trusted partner and first-choice provider of 

investment solutions.  

 

Our Asset Management business includes managing long-

term private funds, perpetual strategies and liquid strat-

egies on behalf of our investors and ourselves, as well as 

our share of the asset management activities of Oaktree. 

As this includes substantially all of Brookfield’s investments, 

this report describes in detail our approach to ESG through 

the lens of our asset management business. For further 

detail of our organizational structure, please refer to the 

Brookfield Corporation Annual Report. 

Brookfield’s current and former 
senior executives own approxi-
mately 20% of the business, and 
Brookfield shares comprise a 
significant portion of long-term 
compensation for our business 
leaders. This provides a long-
term focus, a culture of owner-
ship and strong commitment to 
alignment with stakeholders.

1 “Brookfield,” the “company,” the "firm", “we,” “us” or “our” refers to Brookfield Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The “Corporation” is comprised of ownership interests in our asset management, insurance solutions and 
operating businesses. Our “capital” includes Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P., Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and Brookfield Business Partners L.P., which are separate issuers included within our Renewable Power and Transition, 
Infrastructure and Private Equity segments, respectively, Brookfield Corporation ULC, which is included in our Asset Management segment, and issuers in the Brookfield Property Group, which are included in our Real Estate segment. 
Additional discussion of their businesses and results can be found in their public filings. Throughout this report we refer to our business groups, which represent people from our Renewable Power & Transition, Infrastructure, Private Equity 
and Real Estate businesses. As well, throughout this report, we use the term portfolio company, which may refer to an investment in a property, asset, or business. We use “private funds” to refer to the real estate funds, transition funds, 
infrastructure funds and private equity funds of our asset management business. Our other businesses include our corporate activities.

Our focus over the next few years will be to continue 

formalizing and implementing a systematic decarbonization 

approach to accelerate our net-zero progress. 

We have invested significantly in enhancing internal climate 

governance and in our people. In 2022, we established the 

Brookfield Net Zero Operational Committee, bringing 

together functional and sector expertise from senior levels 

of the organization to lead the execution of decarbonization 

strategies across all our platforms, as well as the measurement 

of our progress. 

We have provided training covering a range of key 

climate-related topics—including our net-zero ambition, 

climate risk assessments, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 

measurement and emission reduction strategies. We have 

also produced thought leadership on climate-related issues 

through the Brookfield Insights program and via our new 

podcast, Brookfield Perspectives, which devoted its first 

season to examining the topic of decarbonization.

Our investment activity is also contributing to accelerating 

the global transition to a low-carbon economy. Our renewable 

power platform owns and operates one of the world’s largest 

fleets of clean energy assets and is set to grow significantly. 

A Leader in Decarbonization 

Governments and businesses around the world have 

committed to limiting global warming to well below 2°C, 

aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and  

adopting ambitious targets to reduce their carbon  

footprints to net-zero emissions. Over $200 trillion of 

investment is needed by 2050 to drive the decarbonization 

of our economy and energy systems, with a rapid redirection 

of capital required to cut global carbon emissions by 45% 

by 2030.1 Three-quarters of global emissions trace back to 

energy consumption, making clean energy and electrification 

critical first steps towards the net-zero transition.2 

In light of these industry trends, we believe that Brookfield 

is well-positioned to play a leading role in driving global 

investment in decarbonization solutions. Brookfield is a 

signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative 

and has aligned itself with the ambition to reach net zero 

by 2050 or sooner. In May 2022, we published our interim 

target, setting out our commitment to reduce emissions 

across $147 billion (approximately one-third) of our assets 

under management by 2030 from a 2020 base year. We 

are committed to increasing the proportion of our assets 

under management to be included in our NZAM target to 

100% over time.

Further, we have adopted the recommendations of the 

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

(TCFD)—including by way of the enhanced disclosures 

reflected in this report.

To achieve our net-zero ambition, we have been focused 

on putting plans into action. We are an active asset 

manager, so we will partner with our portfolio companies 

to guide them on a detailed decarbonization pathway.

Letter to 
Stakeholders
For over 100 years, Brookfield has invested in the backbone of the global 
economy—the places where people live, work and play, the energy 
sources powering those places and the ways in which information and 
goods are transmitted and transported around the world. That means 
sustainability is not a new imperative for us—it has always been key to 
our approach to owning and operating real assets and essential services 
over the long-term, as well as creating value for all our stakeholders. 

Over $200 trillion of investment 
is needed by 2050 to drive the 
decarbonization of our economy 
and energy systems.

B R O O K F I E L D  C O R P O R A T I O N

In 2021, we launched the Brookfield Global Transition 

Fund I (BGTF I), the first in a series of funds dedicated to 

accelerating the transition to a net-zero economy by 

catalyzing businesses onto net-zero pathways aligned with 

the goals of the Paris Agreement. As of Q1 2023, BGTF I 

has invested or committed over $11 billion across 19 

investments, while offering over $4 billion in co-underwrite 

and co-investment opportunities, targeting to avoid approxi-

mately 53 million mtCO2e by 2033—equivalent to 100% of 

New York City’s annual emissions.1 Following the success 

of BGTF I, in May 2023, we launched the fundraise of BGTF II 

targeting a meaningfully higher fund size in a continuation 

of the same strategy of its predecessor. We view transition 

investing as a $200 billion opportunity for Brookfield and 

we intend to maintain our lead in this critical asset class.

Highlighting our strategy of “going where the emissions 

are,” in March 2023, we announced a landmark transaction 

together with institutional partners to acquire the Energy 

Markets division of Origin Energy, Australia’s largest 

integrated power generator and energy retailer. Through 

our access to large-scale capital and renewable power 

expertise, we intend to help accelerate the buildout of 

significant renewables and storage capacity in Australia. 

This will enable the retirement of one of the country’s largest 

coal plants and reduce reliance on a carbon-intensive 

grid, which is projected to decrease absolute emissions 

produced by the business by more than 70% by 2030.

In other parts of our business, we are also deploying 

capital to drive sustainable solutions. Recognizing that 

there is “no transition without transmission,” over the past 

several years, we have invested in several electricity 

transmission businesses in North America, Brazil and 

Australia. Our capital will drive the development and 

upgrading of transmission lines to facilitate clean energy 

transmission. In recent years, we have also built a global 

residential decarbonization infrastructure platform, with 

presence in North America and Europe, to deliver low-carbon, 

high-efficiency, in-home solutions, as we see consumers 

increasingly inclined to support housing models that can 

alleviate the high up-front costs of new technologies like 

heat pumps and solar panels. 

We are also committed to being a leader in sustainable 

finance, facilitating investors' and portfolio companies' 

contribution to a sustainable market economy and helping 

to address climate-related challenges. To this end, in 

2022 we issued approximately $7 billion in green bonds, 

sustainability-linked debt and green preferred securities. 

We are continuing to explore ways to expand our portfolio 

of high-quality, sustainable assets and investments while 

continuing to deliver strong risk-adjusted performance 

and downside protection for stakeholders across market 

cycles. As we partner with both our operating businesses 

and portfolio investments in the journey to net zero, we 

remain focused on managing our assets in a responsible 

manner as a key aspect of creating long-term value. We 

firmly believe that, through proper management and 

stewardship, both our investments and Brookfield’s 

businesses will continue to grow stronger and more 

valuable over time. 

Strengthening Our Culture 

At Brookfield, we view our people as our greatest asset. 

We have long believed that diversity, equity and inclusion—

as well as clear paths to career advancement—are critical 

to our success as a firm, and we have focused on broadening 

our representation at all levels of the organization.

These efforts have led to a significant increase in female 

representation at the most senior levels of the organization. 

These results are particularly notable as we have more 

than doubled the total employee population at Brookfield 

over the past five years. For example, Managing Partner 

and Managing Director female representation grew from 

10% to 19%, while Senior Vice President representation 

increased from 17% to 32% during this time. Meanwhile, 

the percentage of our employee population representing 

ethnically diverse individuals reached 40% in 2022.2

Key to our efforts at recruiting and developing talent for the 

long-term is a culture defined by mutual respect, teamwork 

and passion. Senior leaders work side by side with  

colleagues throughout the organization, emphasizing a goal 

of shared success. Our organization is and always has been 

results oriented—responsibility is earned through initiative 

and hard work rather than job title. Through mentorship, 

continual informal training and knowledge sharing, team 

members share an awareness of and commitment to 

generating superior long-term returns for our investors. 

At the same time, operating on the ground in more than 

30 countries on five continents not only enables us to 

We firmly believe that, through proper management and stewardship, 
both our investments and Brookfield’s businesses will continue to 
grow stronger and more valuable over time.

stay close to our clients and provides us with an edge in 

investing—it also creates a unique pipeline of talent from 

around the world, reflecting a vast universe of perspectives. 

We further cultivate this global exchange of ideas through a 

fluid organizational structure that encourages our employees 

to move across regions, functions and groups to pursue 

their interests and broaden their knowledge. We pride 

ourselves on a workplace in which our people learn—and 

are challenged—every day. 

We are committed to conducting our business activities 

with honesty and integrity. During 2022, we further 

developed our vendor management program, including 

adopting a Vendor Code of Conduct that sets out our 

expectations of vendors that provide goods or services 

to Brookfield, including, where applicable, to have the 

necessary policies and procedures in place to support 

such commitments within their supply chain.

Looking Ahead

Regardless of the broader trends and current challenges 

facing the global economy, we remain disciplined in our 

focus on ensuring that the assets and businesses we 

own are positioned for long-term success—and that we 

continuously strive to positively impact the environment 

and communities in which we operate. Given our history 

as owners and operators, we are well accustomed to 

providing strong stewardship of long-life assets and 

businesses in a manner that creates value—and devoting 

the resources necessary to ensure that value is sustained 

over the long-term.

Our Guiding 
ESG Policy
Our ESG strategy is centered on supporting 
business resilience and creating value for 
our investors and stakeholders—now and in 
the future. 

We manage our investments with integrity, combining economic 

goals with responsible citizenship. This is consistent with our 

longstanding philosophy of conducting business with a long-term 

perspective in a sustainable and ethical manner. It also requires 

operating with robust ESG principles and practices, and maintaining 

a disciplined focus on integrating these into everything we do. 

While ESG principles have always been embedded in how we run 

our business, we formalized our approach with the publication of 

Brookfield’s ESG principles in 2016. In 2022, we developed a global 

ESG Policy that formalizes our practices related to operationalizing 

our ESG principles. Our ESG Policy codifies our longstanding com-

mitment to integrating ESG considerations into our decision-making 

and day-to-day asset management activities. This policy is reviewed 

annually and updated on an as-needed basis by senior executives 

at Brookfield, as well as each of Brookfield’s business groups. 

Our ESG Policy outlines our approach to ESG and is based on the following guiding principles:

• Strive to minimize the environmental impact of operations 

and improve our efficient use of resources over time. 

• Support the goal of net-zero GHG emissions 

by 2050 or sooner.

Mitigate the impact of our 
operations on the environment

• Foster a positive work environment based on respect for 

human rights, valuing diversity, and having zero tolerance for 

workplace discrimination, violence or harassment. 

• Operate with leading health and safety practices to 

support the goal of zero serious safety incidents. 

Ensure the well-being 
and safety of employees

• Operate to the highest ethical standards by conducting 

business activities in accordance with our Code of 

Business Conduct and Ethics. 

• Maintain strong stakeholder relationships through 

transparency and active engagement. 

Uphold strong 
governance practices

• Ensure the interests, safety and well-being of the 

communities in which we operate are integrated into  

our business decisions. 

• Support philanthropy and volunteerism by 

our employees.

and Partnerships 
Through our engagement with ESG frameworks and 
sustainability organizations, we continue to be actively 
involved in discussions to advance ESG awareness 
across private and public markets, and we are 
enhancing our ESG reporting and protocols in line 
with evolving best practices.

We have been a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) ini-
tiative since 2021and are committed to supporting the goal of net-zero 
GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner, emphasizing our alignment with 
the Paris Agreement. For further details on our commitment and prog-

ress, refer to Metrics and Targets.

We are members of the IFRS Sustainability Alliance (IFRS), previously 
known as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). IFRS is 
a global membership program established to develop globally accepted 
accounting and sustainability disclosures, and whose industry-specific 
standards are designed to be evidence-based and market-informed. 
Where appropriate, we may utilize the SASB Engagement Guide as part 
of our investment due diligence protocols, to help identify sector specific 

considerations in identifying material climate risks and opportunities.

In 2021, we became supporters of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD aims to guide companies in 
incorporating considerations relating to the effects of climate change 
into business and financial decisions to help facilitate the transition 
to a more sustainable, lower-carbon economy. We have issued our 
inaugural TCFD disclosures this year, included in the Putting Plans 

into Action section of this report.  

We have been signatories to the Principles for Responsible Investment 
(PRI) since 2020, which reinforces our longstanding commitment to 
responsible investment and ESG best practices. The PRI is one of the 
world’s leading proponents of responsible investing, with an emphasis on 
understanding the investment implications of ESG factors and supporting 
an international network of investor signatories incorporating these 
factors into their investment and ownership decisions. Our first formal 
reporting submission to the PRI for the 2022 fiscal year is underway and 
our score is expected to be published in Q4 2023. The transparency report 

from the submission will be available to signatories via the PRI website.

We joined the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) Diversity in 
Action (DIA) initiative, which brings together limited and general part-
ners who share a commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclu-
sion in the private equity industry. Joining the DIA initiative underscores 
our commitment to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, both within 

our organization and the industry more broadly.

We have been involved with the Sustainable Markets Initiative’s (SMI) 
Private Equity Task Force (PESMIT) since 2021 and in 2023 became 
formal members. PESMIT brings together private equity firms to 
identify ways that the industry can accelerate progress towards a 
more sustainable future. Focusing on climate change, biodiversity and 
sustainability related metrics for private markets, it leverages expertise 
within each member firm and works with the other Sustainable  
Markets Initiative Task Forces.

In addition to our own partnerships, a number of our 

businesses are associated with industry organizations and 

frameworks that promote responsible business practices. 

Examples include:

• Many of Brookfield Properties' portfolio companies 

report voluntary environmental disclosures through 

The Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark 

(GRESB), an investor-driven organization that assesses 

the sustainability performance of real estate portfoli-

os and assets. 

• To help progress a commitment to protect biodiversity, 

our renewable power portfolio assesses nature- 

related physical and transition risks and opportunities 

in line with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 

Disclosures (TNFD) recommendations. The TNFD is 

a risk management and disclosure framework for 

organizations to report and act on evolving nature-re-

lated risks, with the ultimate aim of supporting a shift 

in global financial flows away from nature-negative 

outcomes and toward nature-positive outcomes. In 

2022, Brookfield Renewables assessed its biodiversity 

strategy against the draft TNFD recommendations.

• Brookfield Properties has adopted the WELL 

Health-Safety Rating, a global sustainability designation 

that recognizes buildings that support the long-term 

health and well-being of their occupants. The rating 

was developed by the WELL Building Institute, an 

organization focused on improving human health and 

well-being through the built environment.

Please refer to Our Climate Strategy for details on our 

climate-related engagements.

BROOKFIELD

Our Investment 
Approach

Brookfield Corporation 
Board of Directors 

Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is focused on maintain-

ing strong corporate governance and prioritizing the inter-

ests of our shareholders and other stakeholders. The Board 

has oversight of our business and affairs, reviews progress 

on major strategic initiatives, and receives progress and sta-

tus reports on the firm’s ESG initiatives throughout the year.   

Board Composition

Our Board comprises 14 directors, nine of whom are inde-

pendent. The Audit Committee, Governance and Nominat-

ing Committee, Management Resources and Compensation 

Committee, and Risk Management Committee, all consisting 

exclusively of independent directors, exercise oversight of 

our operations and initiatives. Our Board conducts annual 

reviews of our Board and committee charters, which outline 

the responsibilities of the Board and its committees.

We believe that our business benefits from diverse back-

grounds, experiences and perspectives. We work to ensure 

that our Board includes individuals with diverse business 

expertise and international experience, and who are repre-

sentative of the communities in which we operate in terms of 

gender and ethnic diversity. Our Board Diversity Policy drives 

progress toward our goals and underscores our commitment. 

75% of our independent directors are women and 43% of the 

entire Board of Directors are women. 14% of our Board of 

Directors self-identify as ethnically-diverse. 

Responsibility & Oversight 

The Board oversees Brookfield’s ESG strategy and leverages 

management’s monitoring processes. The Board and its 

committees review and approve significant policies relating 

to ESG and monitor progress towards ESG goals. The Board 

has delegated responsibility for oversight of different ESG 

areas to various board committees, which receive quarterly 

updates on ESG initiatives and outcomes. 

• Governance and Nominating Committee (GNC): The 

GNC provides direct oversight of Brookfield’s ESG strat-

egy and priorities. The Committee also ensures that rel-

evant ESG skills and considerations are integrated into 

Board practices, including the nomination of directors. 

• Audit Committee: The Audit Committee oversees the 

management of risks related to Brookfield’s systems and 

procedures for external financial reporting, including any 

related requirements for the inclusion of ESG information.

• Management Resources & Compensation Com-
mittee (MRCC): The MRCC oversees human capital 

strategy and management resource planning, includ-

ing succession planning, executive compensation and 

senior executives’ performance, which integrate diversi-

ty, equity and inclusion considerations.

• Risk Management Committee (RMC): The RMC is 

responsible for overseeing Brookfield’s risk manage-

ment strategies, including reviewing management’s 

assessment of the current and emerging financial and 

non-financial risks and related mitigation strategies 

such as climate, bribery and corruption, cyber, and 

health and safety. 

Executive Oversight

Brookfield’s ESG program is overseen by senior executives 

at Brookfield, including its Chief Administrative Officer 

(CAO) (Governance and Risk Management), Head of 

Transition Investing (Decarbonization and Investment) 

and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (GHG Reporting and 

Measurement), with the support of Brookfield's Head of 

ESG Management. Alongside this group, our ESG program 

has sponsorship and oversight from each business group 

CEO, COO and ESG lead. Since ESG covers a vast range 

of priorities that are varied in scope, we believe that ESG 

initiatives should be overseen by individuals closest to the 

particular business activity. Functional leads are respon-

sible for developing, implementing and monitoring 

relevant ESG factors within their functional area. For 

example, diversity, equity and inclusion considerations 

and initiatives are integrated into our human capital 

practices and are overseen by our CAO, who is responsi-

ble for the Human Resources team. Similarly, managing 

bribery and corruption, climate, and health and safety 

risks are coordinated by the Risk Management team, 

which is also overseen by the CAO. Our CFO ensures that 

regulatory reporting requirements related to ESG are 

incorporated into our reporting processes.

Board Position Descriptions

Program Leads & Management Committees

Management teams and committees bring together the 

required expertise to manage key ESG areas, ensuring 

appropriate application and coordination of approaches 

across our business and functional groups. 

• ESG Management Team: The ESG Management team 

is accountable to Brookfield’s CAO and has the respon-

sibility of ensuring that there is a holistic approach to 

ESG. The team is charged with working with senior 

executives of each of the business groups in identifying 

and articulating the strategic direction for ESG, as well 

as ensuring coordination of efforts across all aspects of 

the business. This involves working across all functional 

and business groups on ESG-related topics to oversee 

these initiatives and their integration into our process-

es, products and investment activities. 

• Investment Committees: The Investment Commit-

tees, which comprise senior executives across different 

business groups and geographies, consider applicable 

ESG risks and opportunities when evaluating invest-

ment opportunities, including climate change and social 

and governance considerations, which are incorporated 

into the due diligence process for each potential invest-

ment. The relevant investment committee reviews 

material findings from due diligence and associated 

mitigation and integration plans as part of the invest-

ment approval process.

• Safety Leadership Committee: Our Safety Leadership 

Committee comprises senior operating executives from 

our business groups and regions and drives our strate-

gic health and safety framework.

Our Investment 
Approach

• The Committee promotes a strong safety culture, mon-

itors safety trends, and sponsors strategic initiatives 

related to health, safety, security and environmental 

matters, as well as ensuring that lessons learned and 

best practices are shared across the business groups 

and our portfolio companies.

• Net Zero Steering Committee: The Net Zero Steering 

Committee oversees Brookfield’s decarbonization strat-

egy and initiatives. See Our Climate Stategy for more 

information on Brookfield’s decarbonization efforts.

Working Groups

Supporting our Program Leads and Management Commit-

tees, we have working groups dedicated to specialized areas 

with the objective of ensuring that key priorities for Brookfield 

are being advanced.

• ESG Working Group: Our ESG working group com-

prises representatives from across business groups 

and functional areas to develop and coordinate ESG 

initiatives. The Working Group also ensures that sector 

and market trends are considered. The diverse nature 

of this group, with varying areas of expertise and back-

grounds, ensures there is a wide range of representa-

tion when considering Brookfield’s ESG opportunities 

and risks. This group meets, at minimum, monthly and 

reports on the progress of the working group’s initia-

tives to the executive team on a regular basis.

• Finance ESG Working Group: This working group 

comprises senior finance professionals from Brookfield 

and its business groups, with a mandate to develop and 

implement a coordinated approach to climate-related 

financial disclosures.

• Net Zero Operational Committee: This group com-

prises functional, sector and technical experts across 

the organization with a mandate to execute the prior-

ities set out by the Net Zero Steering Committee. See 

Putting Plans into Action: Climate Governance for more 

information.

Business Groups

Within our business groups, ESG priorities are set and 

driven by the COO and designated group ESG lead, with 

oversight from the group’s CEO. Supporting this group, we 

have ESG-focused professionals or functional experts across 

ESG-related priorities. Collectively, this group works with 

our Program Leads, Management Committees and Working 

Groups to drive ESG-related initiatives.  

Portfolio Companies

Portfolio company management, specifically each company’s 

CEO and their team, are responsible for the development 

and execution of an ESG strategy for their business and are 

accountable for the portfolio company's performance. Port-

folio companies are supported by investment and operations 

professionals and subject matter experts within our business 

groups. Asset management professionals within our business 

groups are responsible for driving ESG initiatives within the 

portfolio companies they oversee based on business imper-

atives, industry developments and best practices. They also 

provide strategic oversight and ensure that portfolio company 

ESG initiatives and practices are aligned with Brookfield’s ESG 

principles. This approach leverages Brookfield’s extensive 

industry and operational expertise to achieve our ESG priorities.

We seek to embed material ESG consid-
erations and evaluate risks and value 
creation opportunities throughout our 
investment process. We actively look to 
advance ESG initiatives and improve ESG 
performance in driving long-term value 
creation throughout the lifecycle of our 
investments. Our investment processes 
align with the PRI.

Due Diligence

During the initial due diligence phase, we proactively 

identify material ESG risks and opportunities relevant to 

the particular investment. Guided by Brookfield’s ESG 

Due Diligence Protocol, we leverage our investment and 

operating expertise and utilize industry-specific principles, 

which may include the incorporation of SASB guidance 

and, where applicable, a human rights and modern 

slavery risk assessment as supported by the related policy. 

Where warranted, Brookfield performs deeper due 

diligence, working with internal experts and third-party 

consultants as needed.

Investment Committee Approval

All investments must be approved by the applicable 

Investment Committee. Investment teams outline for 

the Investment Committee the merits of the transaction 

and material risks, mitigants and significant opportu-

nities for improvement, including those related to ESG, 

such as bribery and corruption, health and safety, and 

environmental and social risks.

Ongoing Management

As part of each acquisition,1 investment teams create 

a tailored integration plan that includes, among other 

things, material ESG-related matters for review or 

execution. We believe there is a strong correlation 

between managing these considerations and enhancing 

investment returns. 

It is the responsibility of the management teams 

within each portfolio company to manage ESG risks 

and opportunities through the investment’s lifecycle, 

supported by the applicable investment team within 

Brookfield. The combination of local accountability and 

expertise in tandem with Brookfield's investment and 

operating capabilities is important when managing 

a wide range of asset types across jurisdictions. We 

leverage these capabilities in collaborating on ESG ini-

tiatives, where appropriate, to drive best practices and 

assist with any remediation. As it relates to ESG, where 

appropriate, we encourage our portfolio companies to 

organize training for relevant staff. 

To mitigate risks and execute on opportunities, we seek 

to support the implementation of best practices and 

development of internal capabilities at our portfolio 

companies. We aim to achieve this in several ways, 

including by encouraging training, providing technical 

expertise on certain ESG related matters, facilitat-

ing connections to experts on ESG issues in relevant 

sectors, sharing of institutional knowledge of best 

practices and leveraging other firm resources including 

cross-portfolio collaboration. 

Management teams regularly report to their respective 

boards of directors both from financial and operating 

perspectives, including key performance indicators 

(“KPIs”) that incorporate material ESG factors, such as 

health and safety, environmental management, compli-

ance with regulatory requirements, and, increasingly, 

GHG emissions. 

For investments where Brookfield has a non-controlling 

interest, where we are a debt holder or in other circum-

stances where Brookfield does not have the ability to 

exercise influence through its contractual rights, Brook-

field actively monitors the performance of its invest-

ments and, where appropriate, utilizes its stewardship 

practices to encourage ESG outcomes that are aligned 

with Brookfield’s ESG approach. Where applicable, 

certain strategies may have Strategic Implementation 

Guidelines articulating Brookfield’s stewardship and 

engagement process. 

Exit

When preparing an asset for divestiture, we outline poten-

tial value creation deriving from several different factors, 

including relevant ESG considerations. Where applicable, 

we also prepare both qualitative and quantitative data 

that summarize the ESG performance of the investment 

and provide a holistic understanding of how we have 

managed the investment during the holding period.

Stewardship 
and Engagement
Stewardship is an important element of 
our ESG strategy, and we have defined it in 
alignment with the PRI. We seek to do this 
through engagement with our portfolio 
companies and collaboration with indus-
try peers to help inform and improve our 
ESG strategies and practices. Though the 
majority of our investments are in private 
markets, we will use our Proxy Voting Guide-
lines, where applicable, and ensure our dis-
closures address how we incorporate ESG 
factors into our investment process.

In managing our assets, we utilize our significant influence 

and investing and operating capabilities in collaborating 

with our portfolio companies to encourage sound ESG 

practices that are essential for resilient businesses, while 

seeking to create long-term value for our investors and 

stakeholders. See ESG Integration into Our Investment 

Process for further detail. As well, through our ongoing 

engagement with portfolio companies, we may partner 

with or support our portfolio companies to facilitate 

discussions with external stakeholders with the intent of 

positively influencing industry standards or practices 

that are aligned with our ESG principles. 

With respect to collaboration with outside stakeholders, 

including industry groups, we encourage our business 

groups to participate in knowledge sharing practices, at 

Brookfield’s or its business groups’ discretion. This is either 

facilitated through our Frameworks, Memberships and Com-

mitments (as outlined in ESG Affiliations and Partnerships) or 

directly through Brookfield or by our business groups, and 

as described in our Climate Group Memberships.  

Proxy Voting

In early 2021, Brookfield established new Proxy Voting 

Guidelines. These guidelines are intended to ensure that 

we vote proxies in our investors’ best interests, in accor-

dance with any applicable proxy voting agreements and 

consistent with the investment mandate. 

Brookfield assesses a variety of ESG factors in determining 

whether voting a proxy is in a client’s best interests. Our 

guidelines cover information about our Proxy Voting 

Committee and conflicts of interest, as well as key voting 

issues. These voting issues could include ESG issues, 

director elections, director independence, board effec-

tiveness and diversity, board compensation, over-board-

ing and executive compensation, among other topics. 

The guidelines also uphold our strong commitment to 

ESG practices, and our positions concerning climate risk, 

human rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. 

All proxy votes are reviewed and voted on by the leaders 

of the respective business groups and their associated 

teams. These teams retain ultimate responsibility for 

determining how to vote each proxy, taking into consid-

eration the investment mandate, contractual obligations 

and a review of all relevant information. In addition, the 

Proxy Voting Team will maintain a log to track all proxies 

and document the basis for the vote, which serves as a 

record of Brookfield’s votes. As part of our Proxy Voting 

Guidelines, Brookfield has created a Proxy Voting Commit-

tee to oversee proxy voting across our holdings. Compris-

ing senior executives across Brookfield, this committee 

meets annually to review the guidelines, evaluate the 

effectiveness of their implementation and confirm wheth-

er they continue to be designed to ensure that proxies are 

voted in the best interests of investors.

We recognize that risks to our business—including ESG-related risks—are constantly evolving, and our 

risk management program aims to monitor and proactively mitigate and manage them over time.

As an asset manager, the objectives of our risk management program are to align risk appetite and 

business strategy, reduce operational surprises, allocate resources effectively, enhance decision-making 

and visibility, identify and manage risks efficiently and improve communication surrounding risk.

Our risk management program addresses strategic and operational risks, with an emphasis on 

the proactive management of both current and emerging risks. We also monitor our risk program 

to address the evolving needs of our business and ensure that we have the necessary capacity to 

respond to changes. 

A fundamental principle of our approach is that risk should be managed as close to its source as 

possible and by those who have the most knowledge and expertise in the specific business or risk 

area. Senior management and functional groups in our portfolio companies are therefore respon-

sible for managing the risks facing their businesses and tailoring a mitigation plan to each specific 

risk area. Brookfield, in its capacity as an asset manager, provides strategic input and support through 

regular monitoring and reporting processes, and facilitating the sharing of best practices, including 

through its representation on boards of directors and other governance structures. We regularly 

review our risk management program and processes, including those relating to ESG risks such as 

climate change, and implement improvements, as required. See Climate-Related Risk Management 

for further information on our risk management approach to climate change.

For details on our governance practices in monitoring and overseeing our risk management 

program, please refer to the ESG Organization and Governance section.

Brookfield’s foundation is investing in businesses and assets forming the 
backbone of the global economy—places where people live and work, 
ways in which they transport themselves and their goods, and ways in 
which they power their lives. 

That means sustainability is critical to what we do. Sound ESG practices, 
including net zero and climate-related risk management, are essential to 
building resilient assets and businesses—while also creating long-term 
value for our investors and stakeholders. We are focused on this 
approach and have a long track record of executing this strategy.

Climate Strategy

As described in ESG Organization and Governance, our 

ESG program, including our climate strategy, is overseen 

by senior executives from Brookfield (CAO, CFO, Head of 

ESG Management) and each of our business groups (CEO, 

COO, ESG Leads). This executive leadership team sets 

the overall strategic direction of Brookfield’s climate-re-

lated commitments and ensures coordination across our 

various climate initiatives. The group is supported by the 

ESG Management Team, which coordinates with senior 

executives to ensure that climate considerations are 

integrated into our products and investment activities. 

The ESG Working Group leads measurement processes 

for climate-related metrics. Regular updates on climate 

initiatives are provided to the Board and its committees.

Decarbonization

Supporting our overall climate strategy, in 2022, we estab-

lished the Brookfield Net Zero Operational Committee, 

which includes senior representatives from across the 

business, including sector and functional experts. This 

Committee leads the execution of decarbonization strat-

egies, as well as the measurement of our progress. 

The Committee’s mandate is to:

• Ensure alignment and consistency in approach across 

our businesses 

• Share best practices and information on portfolio 

company initiatives

• Measure and report results

The Net Zero Operational Committee meets monthly to 

discuss and share best practices and experiences related 

to net zero and related value enhancement initiatives. 

This monthly forum also generates cross business group 

development opportunities and partnerships with the 

common objective of decarbonization and facilitates training 

leveraging both internal and external expertise.

The Net Zero Operational Committee is overseen by the 

Net Zero Steering Committee, which comprises Brookfield’s 

Head of Transition Investing, CAO and the COO of each busi-

ness group and receives monthly updates from the Net Zero 

Operational Committee. Business group COOs are respon-

sible for decarbonization initiatives within their businesses, 

including setting decarbonization strategies and evaluating 

performance; the Steering Committee ensures coordi-

nation of net-zero efforts across groups. The Net Zero 

Steering Committee meets regularly and provides periodic 

updates to the Board. 

Risk Management

The Risk Management team coordinates the development 

and implementation of Brookfield’s climate risk man-

agement approach and methodology, which includes a 

framework for evaluating climate opportunities and risks in 

the investment due diligence process. The team works with 

our business groups to assess, on an ongoing basis, climate 

opportunities and risks across our businesses and seeks 

to ensure that risks are being managed to an appropriate 

level. Risk assessment results are presented annually and 

updates on other climate risk management initiatives are 

reported quarterly to the applicable board committee.

The business group risk management teams implement 

the risk management methodology and investment due 

diligence framework within their businesses and support 

their investment and operations teams with execution. 

The investment teams are responsible for assessing 

material climate risks and opportunities of prospective 

investments and developing mitigation strategies and 

integration plans as part of the process. These results 

are presented to the Investment Committees as part of 

the investment approval process. Ongoing identification, 

assessment, management and monitoring of climate risks 

and opportunities is integrated into business groups’ over-

all risk management process.

Financial Reporting

Brookfield’s CFO and the Finance ESG Working Group mon-

itor external financial reporting requirements with respect 

to climate-related information and, if and when required, 

will support the integration of these requirements into our 

financial reporting processes, along with the appropriate 

control framework. The Audit Committee is responsible for 

overseeing the reporting process and control framework, 

as well as any related external audit requirements.

Climate-Related 
Risk Management
Our approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities 
is consistent with and integrated into our overall risk management 
approach. We manage these risks and opportunities in our 
asset management activities and throughout the lifecycle of our 
investments. Given the diversified and decentralized nature of our 
operations, we seek to ensure that risk is managed as close to its 
source as possible and by the management teams that have the 
most knowledge and expertise in the specific business or risk area.

As such, climate-related risks and opportunities are generally 
managed at the portfolio company level, as these considerations 
vary based on the nature of each business. At the same time, we 
monitor climate-related risks and opportunities organization-wide 
to ensure adequacy of risk management, identify asset and business 
level enhancement opportunities, and promote sharing of best 
practices.

Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion is 

focused on our approach to managing climate-related 

risks and opportunities for the investments where we 

have control or significant influence.1 These invest-

ments represent the substantial majority of assets 

under management across our Renewable Power & 

Transition, Infrastructure, Private Equity and Real Estate 

investment strategies.

Climate-Related Risk Management 
in the Investment Lifecycle 

As described in ESG Integration Into Our Investment 

Process, climate-related considerations are an important 

component of our investment process.

Due Diligence and Investment Committee Approval

The focus of our climate-related diligence efforts is to 

identify material risks and opportunities. Our ESG Due 

Diligence Protocol includes a comprehensive climate 

change risk and opportunity assessment, which is aligned 

with our climate change risk management methodology 

that is described in Ongoing Management. We have a 

number of internal subject matter experts who support 

our investment teams throughout the diligence process 

by providing technical expertise, reviewing findings and 

contributing additional insight to ensure completeness 

of the analysis undertaken. Where warranted, we engage 

external experts to perform a more detailed review. 

To support the diligence process for physical risk, our 

investment teams also have access to third-party sources 

providing location-specific projections of physical risks 

under a range of climate change scenarios. 

Material climate-related risks, opportunities and mit-

igants identified during the diligence phase, as con-

sidered relevant to the business, are outlined for the 

applicable Investment Committee and considered in 

the investment decision. If the investment is approved, 

the investment team creates a tailored integration plan 

that includes, among other considerations, strategic 

and operational plans to address the material risks and 

opportunities identified. These plans are developed 

based on an assessment of the different mitigation or 

adaptation options available.  

1 For investments where, due to our ownership stake or governance rights, we have more limited access to information, climate-related risks and 
opportunities are predominantly considered as part of the due diligence process. We will continue to consider ways to further integrate climate-related 
considerations into our risk management processes for these investment types, including the incorporation of our own learnings and best practices.

Ongoing Management 

Climate-related risks and opportunities are identified, assessed and managed using our climate 

change risk management methodology. 

This methodology is consistent with our broader risk management methodology, which is 

designed to enable comprehensive and consistent monitoring and management of risk across 

the organization. Climate risk assessment results are an input into our enterprise risk assess-

ment, which is used to inform a holistic view of our risk profile and mitigation strategies.  

1. Set Context: 
We consider climate-related risks and opportunities over three time periods (short, medium 

and long-term) as the nature of these risks and opportunities can differ depending on the 

time period considered. Time periods are set to reflect the long-life nature of our assets and 

the fact that climate impacts are expected to occur over decades, extending well beyond our 

typical risk assessment timeframes. 

2. Identify Risks and Opportunities: 
Physical and transition risks are categories in our risk inventory, which is used in our enterprise 

risk assessment process. We have defined a detailed climate taxonomy to facilitate consistent 

definition, assessment and reporting of these risks and opportunities. Our climate taxonomy 

incorporates and is consistent with the recommendations provided by the TCFD.

3. Assessment Screens:  
We use screening-level climate scenario analysis to:

I. Assess, on a pre-mitigation basis, the overall level 

of climate-related risk and opportunity of our 

investments and understand their key drivers 

II. Identify and prioritize businesses or assets for 

further analysis or engagement 

Potential physical risks and transition risks and opportu-

nities are assessed based on two dimensions—exposure 

and vulnerability. 

Exposure

Vulnerability

Is the source of risk or opportunity due to climate change 
(e.g., exposure to extreme heat, carbon prices or renew-
able energy demand). Scenario analysis helps to assess 
how exposures may change under different future climate 
trajectories.

Exposure is primarily geographic 

Refers to “how” the asset is impacted by the changing expo-
sure (e.g., due to extreme heat, additional cooling needs to 
be provided; due to carbon pricing, a business has increased 
costs; or due to increases in renewable energy demand, a solar 
panel manufacturer sells more product).

Vulnerability is primarily asset type or sector specific

30

2 0 2 2  S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  R E P O R T

B R O O K F I E L D  C O R P O R A T I O N

Our intention is to update our analysis when there are sig-

nificant changes to scenario data or our investment mix. 

Results from our latest assessments follow in “Assessment 

Screens Using Scenario Analysis”. 

4. Portfolio Company/Asset Level Assessment 
and Engagement:  
Results from our screening assessments are reviewed 

by our risk management, ESG and operations 

professionals, who sit with and work alongside our 

investment teams. In reviewing and assessing results, 

current and planned mitigation and adaptation strat-

egies are considered along with historical experience 

at the portfolio company and asset level (e.g., GHG 

emissions reduction plans, structural characteristics 

of or hardening activities associated with an asset). 

If additional information is required, as determined 

by the teams, a more detailed review at the portfolio 

company or asset level may be conducted. 

Screening assessments, coupled with operational and 

strategic insights, are used to form an assessment of 

our post-mitigation risks and opportunities, as well as 

the resilience of our business under different future 

climate pathways. Where incremental mitigation and 

adaptation strategies or value-add enhancement 

opportunities are identified, our operations teams 

work closely with senior management of the portfolio 

companies to support and oversee the development 

and implementation of business improvements. While 

enhancement opportunities may differ across indus-

tries and geographies, they generally involve a combi-

nation of strategic repositioning, focus on operational 

excellence and strengthening asset resilience. 

5. Ongoing Monitoring and Continuous Improvement: 
We review our climate change risk management 

methodology at least annually and implement 

updates where required. As climate-related risk 

management is an area that is rapidly evolving, 

requiring specialized knowledge and having the 

potential to impact all of our businesses and our 

reputation, we are committed to continually learning 

and evolving our understanding of climate-related 

risks and opportunities and their impact on our busi-

ness. We will continue to focus on enhancing our 

climate risk management processes and consider 

ways to further our engagement with our portfolio 

companies and, as such, our approach to risk man-

agement and reporting may change over time.              

Risk Management and Our Decarbonization Strategy

While climate-related risks and opportunities will gener-

ally vary based on the nature of a business, we view GHG 

emissions as a potential source of transition risk for all 

of our portfolio companies. As described in Our Climate 

Strategy, we are actively engaging our portfolio compa-

nies to help them develop decarbonization strategies. 

Our climate risk management approach and efforts to 

operationalize decarbonization are related and closely 

aligned. For example, GHG emissions data collected from 

our portfolio companies will be used not only to develop 

specific decarbonization plans and related targets but are 

also incorporated into our scenario assessment screens. 

Furthermore, portfolio company decarbonization strat-

egies are considered in our post-mitigation assessment 

of climate-related risks and opportunities and the overall 

resilience of our business.    

1 Future time horizons for physical risk represent an average over thirty-year periods as follows: 2030 time horizon (2015-2044); 2040 time horizon (2025-2054), and 2050 time horizon (2035-2065). The transition 
analysis assesses changes in transition indicators from the present to 2030, 2040, and 2050, respectively. 
2 The NGFS is a global network of central bankers and supervisors that developed scenarios, in partnership with academic organizations, to provide a common starting point for analyzing climate risks to energy markets and to 
economic and financial systems. 

Assessment Screens Using  
Scenario Analysis

As recommended by the TCFD, we have begun to incorpo-

rate the use of physical and transition scenarios into our 

risk management process. Due to the inherent uncertain-

ties around the future course of climate change, scenario 

analysis helps us to assess our potential climate-related 

risks and opportunities and the resilience of our business 

under different future climate trajectories. Scenarios 

are narratives of plausible future outcomes and are not 

designed nor intended to provide precise predictions or 

forecasts. The degree of potential risk identified at a 

screening level does not consider mitigation or adap-

tation strategies that may be in place or are being 

implemented at the portfolio company or specific 

asset. As such, potential risks are, in many cases, like-

ly to be lower than indicated by the screen. 

Our latest assessment screens were based on our 

investments as at December 31, 2022 and completed 

with the assistance of global engineering and profes-

sional services firm WSP. Three transition and two 

physical scenarios were considered, across three time 

horizons: short-term (2030), medium-term (2040) and 

long-term (2050).1 

Transition Risks and Opportunities

For our transition screens, we selected three divergent 

scenarios developed by the globally recognized Network 

for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)2—“Current 

Policies”, “Net Zero 2050” and “Delayed Transition”. These 

scenarios cover a range of plausible transition pathways

and outcomes and vary in the extent of climate policy 

implementation, changes in energy markets and impact 

to the overall economy. Data from the NGFS was supple-

mented by additional resources, where relevant.

For each scenario, we screened for potential risks and 
opportunities across our investments by considering two 
dimensions: 1) exposure (to select economic, regulatory 
and reputational factors at a regional level), and 2) 
vulnerability (to these same factors at the sector level). 
Exposure was assessed using specific indicators of 
economic (e.g., GDP, electricity demand), regulatory (e.g., 
carbon price) and reputational factors as outlined by the 
scenarios. Vulnerability was assessed based on a qualita-
tive determination of whether the business would be 
positively or negatively impacted by changes in the 
exposure to the relevant indicators, and the extent of 
such impact. Screening was performed for portfolio companies 
considering both their operating sectors and geographic 
locations, resulting in a company level composite score. 
To the extent available, company GHG emissions data 

was used to conduct the analysis.

Transition Scenarios Assumptions 

A summary of the NGFS scenario assumptions and 

examples of the indicators used in the transition screen-

ing assessment is presented in the table.

or Opportunity

Example 
Indicators1 

Current 
Policies (3°C +)2

Delayed 
Transition (1.6°C)2

Net Zero 
2050 (1.4°C)2

The only policies in place through-

out the scenario are those currently 

implemented. As a result, there are 

limited GHG reductions globally.

New climate policies are not introduced 

until 2030 and the level of action differs 

across countries and regions. As a result of 

the delay, more aggressive and disruptive 

climate policies are required to meet global 

climate goals in a shorter period of time.

The application of stringent climate policies 

and innovation result in a 50% chance of 

limiting global warming to below 1.5°C by 

the end of the century. There are significant 

changes to global energy systems and econ-

omies to facilitate a transition.

Carbon pricing Effective carbon price in 

$/tCO2e

Carbon prices globally remain 

relatively low and do not exceed 

the prices currently in place in 

select regions.

Carbon prices remain low until 2030, after 

which the rapid implementation of climate 

policies leads to very high global carbon prices 

in all jurisdictions over the long-term. 

An immediate strengthening of near-term 

mitigation actions and stringent long-term 

climate policies, including high carbon prices 

in the near term, and increasing in all juris-

dictions over the long-term.  

Energy demand 
and pricing

Demand for fossil fuels 

(e.g., oil, natural gas, coal) 

and renewables (e.g., solar, 

wind and hydropower); 

Investments in renewable 

energy; Electricity pricing

The share of fossil fuels in the 

global energy mix stays roughly 

constant from the 2020s to 2050.

From 2020-2030, fossil fuel sources contin-

ue to dominate the energy mix. In 2030-

2050, contributions from fossil fuels rapidly 

fall and are replaced by low-carbon sources 

such as renewables.

The global energy mix undergoes a steady 

transformation as low-emission energy 

sources gradually displace fossil fuel 

sources.

Drivers of real 
estate demand 
and pricing

Building carbon intensity 

(tCO2e/square foot) relative 

to a transition pathway

Real estate properties face moder-

ate pressure to decarbonize, with 

carbon intensity playing a limited 

role in market values. 

The demand for low-carbon buildings 

rapidly increases following the onset of the 

delayed transition, creating high value for 

low-emitting properties. 

Properties face pressure to decarbonize and 

properties that meet net-zero benchmarks 

experience strong market demand.  

Impacts to 
economic 
output

National gross domestic 

product (GDP); Transpor-

tation demand (in bpkm/

year); Country-level 

transition readiness

Due to limited climate policies, 

there is only minor impact to 

economic growth. 

Policies necessary to meet a low-carbon 

transition must be more aggressive due to 

the delay in climate action. As a result of 

the rapid change in economic and energy 

systems, many regions experience negative 

impacts to economic growth.

A more orderly transition allows countries to 

adapt economic systems towards a low-carbon 

economy, creating opportunities for economic 

growth in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdic-

tions experience negative impacts.

Pre-Mitigation Transition Opportunity and Risk Screening  

INCREASING OPPORTUNITY INCREASING RISK

A summary of the pre-mitigation transition screening results is presented in the chart below. Results reflect the potential global transition impacts at a sector level across sectors and geographies in which we invest.1 Screening 

level results help us to understand potential risks that may be common across industry sectors and regions, as well as to identify risk areas that may warrant additional review. The results do not consider mitigation strate-
gies, such as decarbonization plans, in place at the portfolio company level and, as such, post-mitigation risk levels are generally likely to be lower. The sector results presented below are not weighted by asset value, 

and do not reflect Brookfield’s amount of investment in each sector.

The pre-mitigation assessment screens highlight significant transition opportunities, as we invest across many sectors that will be critical to a transition to a lower carbon economy.

1 Transition impacts were assessed at a sub-sector level for each portfolio company. Sector results reflect an average impact score across all portfolio companies analyzed within each sector.

Transition Risk and  
Opportunity Assessment 

The pre-mitigation assessment screens highlight signif-

icant transition opportunities as we invest across many 

sectors that will be critical to a transition to a lower 

carbon economy. These opportunities are projected to 

be present under each scenario and increase more sig-

nificantly in the medium and longer-term under both the 

Net Zero 2050 and Delayed Transition scenarios.

To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, there must be a 

transformation of the global electricity capacity mix with 

the share of renewable energy shifting from approximately 

29% to more than 60% by 2030.1 The development of new 

renewable energy capacity and grid infrastructure is critical 

to the net-zero transition and meeting future electricity 

demand. We are one of the world’s largest owners and 

operators of renewable power assets and set a goal in 

2021 to develop an additional 21,000 MW of new renewable 

energy capacity by 2030, which represented a doubling 

of the operating portfolio, at the date the target was set, 

to 42,000 MW. Moreover, nuclear power is also expected 

to play an important role in a lower carbon transition, 

by providing baseload low-carbon power to support the 

growth in intermittent renewable power sources.2 Finally, 

advancements in technologies related to energy storage 

will also be critical to support renewable power growth 

as these assets will be needed to provide key ancillary 

services such as grid stabilization, backup capacity and 

balancing. We believe that Brookfield is well-positioned 

to capitalize on these transition opportunities through 

our expertise and investments in the renewable power, 

nuclear energy services, battery and pumped storage and 

carbon capture, usage and storage sectors. 

Transition opportunities across other sectors in which we 

invest include businesses in the electricity transmission 

and distribution sector, which will be vital to supporting 

increased demand for electricity as a result of a continued 

shift towards electrification. Electrification can only be 

successful if the appropriate infrastructure is in place, 

through the expansion and modernization of global 

transmission grids. Telecommunications providers and 

data centers will also play a meaningful role in transitioning 

to a low-carbon and energy efficient future by, for example, 

supporting increased process efficiency in industrial 

applications. Our companies in the manufacturing and 

construction services sectors that are focused on reusable 

packaging, modular structures and construction materials 

and services that support a circular economy may also 

benefit from increased demand for lower carbon alterna-

tives to existing products and services.

Sectors in which we invest that screen as having higher 

potential pre-mitigation transition risk include energy 

transmission, distribution and storage, as well as other 

energy-related businesses. The potential for a transition 

away from higher carbon fuels may impact these sectors as 

a result of lower demand for fossil fuels and/or increased 

carbon pricing. The potential risks are higher in the longer-

term under both the Delayed Transition and Net Zero 2050 

scenarios, with lower risks observed in the Current Policies 

scenario. The majority of our investments in these sectors 

are related to natural gas. The scenarios suggest that the 

transition away from natural gas may be more gradual 

than for other traditional fuel sources, since natural gas is 

expected to play a role providing baseload power and 

replacing higher carbon fuels, such as coal, as the economy 

transitions to renewable power sources. Our investments 

that support the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) will 

help in this transition, particularly for countries that are 

currently more reliant on higher carbon intensive sources 

of energy. Also, our assets generally have indirect exposure 

to natural gas, as they provide infrastructure for natural 

gas producers, and may be repurposed as part of a 

transition to a lower carbon economy. We are engaging 

with our portfolio companies in these sectors on decarbon-

ization strategies, as well as exploring new markets for their 

products and services. We believe that decarbonization and 

repurposing efforts will mitigate the potential longer-term 

transition risks for many of our portfolio companies in 

these sectors. For example, see Case Study—Midstream: 

Moving Fuel for the Future, which highlights some of the 

transition strategies being explored by our midstream 

companies. Moreover, our exposure to fossil fuel-related 

industries is relatively low at less than 11% of our assets 

under management.3  

GHG intensity may be a source of risk for real estate 

assets due to the possibility for operating costs to 

increase from carbon pricing, as well as potential market 

preference for low GHG intensity or net-zero aligned 

assets. We believe our real estate portfolio is well-posi-

tioned in this environment, given its current GHG inten-

sity profile and the geographies in which our assets are 

located. In addition, our Real Estate group has developed 

a net-zero decarbonization strategy, which includes plans 

for the procurement of clean energy, additional retro-

fits, and operational energy reduction initiatives. Other 

sectors in which we invest, such as financial and real 

estate services, and IT and other services, have limited 

risks associated with a transition, with the source of risk 

or opportunity generally being indirect. Indirect transi-

tion impacts may include macroeconomic factors such 

as changes to GDP growth or energy pricing, which vary 

by country depending on their transition readiness.4 For 

example, countries with a high level of transition readi-

ness may experience positive effects on their economic 

growth during a transition, which in turn creates growth 

opportunities for companies operating in those regions. 

Companies in this category may thrive in a transition 

if they are able to adapt their operations and business 

model to become low-carbon and to serve low-carbon 

industries.  

The ultimate path of a transition to a net zero economy is 

highly uncertain and will vary by sector and geography. We 

believe our strategy, along with the profile of our invest-

ments, is resilient across a range of possible transition 

scenarios and that we are well-positioned to capitalize on 

transition opportunities.

Midstream:  
Moving Fuel 
for the Future 
Natural gas is a key piece of the decarbonization equation due to its  
reliability, ease of transport and lower GHG emissions, typically 
emitting almost 50% less GHG emissions than coal.1 Combined, these  
variables mean that natural gas is expected to remain an economical 
and secure source of energy for countries regardless of their stage  
of decarbonization.

As the world transitions towards net zero, it is anticipated 

that renewable and other lower GHG emitting energy sources 

will become more prevalent, which is why midstream 

assets screen as higher risk under the Net Zero 2050 and 

Delayed Transition scenarios in the longer-term; however, 

the screens do not contemplate the ability for these assets, 

which have extensive fixed infrastructure, to adapt their 

pipelines to carry newer fuel types, such as hydrogen.  

Our midstream assets operate by centrally controlling the 

volume of each type of product through their pipelines 

based on the demand of their customers. In a given quar-

ter, customers might require different blends of product 

and our assets are equipped to be agile in meeting these 

needs. Looking to the future, this same operating strategy, 

which has been in place for decades, will be critical as new 

fuel products enter the marketplace and use the existing 

infrastructure of our midstream assets to reach consum-

ers. For example, an emerging trend in the industry that 

our assets are poised to address is hydrogen. Examples of 

hydrogen initiatives under evaluation and in action at our 

midstream businesses include:

• Evaluating the use of hydrogen by-product yielded from 

existing facilities as a new product to be transported.

• Participating in pilot projects to produce, transport 

and burn hydrogen, with future blue hydrogen antici-

pated for consumption in above-surface processes.

As our midstream assets continue to support the use of 

natural gas as a transition fuel, they are considering ways 

to meet the needs of the future, as well as lowering their 

own GHG emissions. For example, we are continuing to 

focus on enhancing maintenance programs to mitigate 

potential leaks from our natural gas pipelines, including 

leveraging the use of technology. One such example is at 

our U.K. regulated utility business, SGN, where iron mains 

are being replaced with new polyethylene pipes. These 

enhancements lower methane leakage and support the 

potential for these networks to transport hydrogen and 

green gases in the future. 

We are also actively supporting our businesses to 

further develop their decarbonization strategies, 

including through carbon capture, facility upgrades, 

electrification, incorporation of renewable energy and 

other capital improvement projects in order to adapt to 

changing market trends. Our midstream assets have a 

long and established history of providing the means for 

the required fuel mix to reach consumers and keep our 

economy and communities powered. We believe this 

operating record will continue into a net-zero future, as 

the vital infrastructure our midstream assets contribute 

continues to adapt to suit the needs of customers.

Physical Risks

Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and 

severity of extreme weather events such as floods and 

wildfires (acute risks). It is also expected to result in more 

gradual changes, such as higher average temperatures 

and increased or decreased precipitation (chronic risks). 

Physical climate scenarios define possible climate conse-

quences under different levels of future warming resulting 

from increased GHG emissions. For our screening analysis, 

we selected two contrasting physical climate scenarios 

using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) frame-

work featured in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The SSPs 

consider possible changes in population, economic growth, 

education, urbanization and the rate of technological chang-

es, all of which influence global GHG emissions trajectories. 

The resulting emissions trajectories are used as inputs into 

climate models to assess possible changes to climate haz-

ards1 over time. The two scenarios selected were:

For each scenario and time period, we screened for 

potential risks across our investments by considering 

two dimensions: 1) exposure, (to eight physical hazards 

based on location), and 2) vulnerability, (to the physical 

impacts of those hazards based on asset type (e.g., an 

office building, warehouse or manufacturing facility)). 

Exposure was assessed considering both: i) historical 

exposure (recent past) to the noted climate hazards, 

which provides an indication of current risk, and ii) the 

potential for increasing exposure due to climate change 

using data from global climate models. Vulnerability was 

assessed based on a qualitative determination of how 

exposure to the relevant physical hazard would impact 

the asset from a cost, business continuity and legal and 

reputational perspective. 

Data on over 12,000 locations across our businesses were 

included in the screen, which provided a comprehensive 

view of potential risk areas. Where specific asset location 

data was not available or where screening additional loca-

tions was not additive to the analysis (e.g., the locations 

were of the same asset type and in the same geographic 

area), sampling or regional analysis was conducted. For 

linear assets (e.g., transmission lines, rail, pipelines), 

locations were spatially sampled at intervals of 25 km. 

The screens helped us to understand, on a pre-mitigation 

basis, the overall potential for and drivers of physical risks 

across our investments and potential areas of concentra-

tion, as well as to supplement our capabilities in identify-

ing and prioritizing assets or businesses that may benefit 

from further analysis or engagement. 

1  We used the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (GDDP) dataset, (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6), which is comprised of global downscaled climate scenarios derived from the General Circulation 
Model (GCM) runs conducted under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and across two SSPs.

2 For simplicity, references to risk “mitigation” in the physical risk assessment refer to both mitigation and adaptation, as applicable.

Higher emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)
a pathway where there is fast and unconstrained growth 

in energy consumption and economic output, mostly 

met with fossil-based fuels, leading to a global average 

temperature rise of 3.3 ºC to 5.7 ºC by 2100 compared to 

pre-industrial times.

Lower emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6)
a pathway where climate policies are implemented, 

technological growth to mitigate climate change is rapid 

and GHG emissions are significantly reduced, limiting 

global average temperature rise to 1.3 ºC to 2.4 ºC by 2100 

compared to pre-industrial times.

Physical Risk Assessment 

The results of our physical risk screening analysis iden-

tified locations across our businesses that may be at 

risk of particular physical hazards. While we continue 

to focus on the localized physical risks at our assets, 

our geographic diversification has the effect of lowering 

potential impacts of physical risk across our investments. 

Furthermore, because the vulnerability of our assets 

to each physical hazard varies significantly, depending 

on the type of asset and its individual characteristics, 

the sectoral diversity of our investments also helps to 

mitigate risk. Our post-mitigation analysis also takes into 

account mitigation and adaptation strategies that are 

currently in place. Overall, no pervasive or systemic risks 

were identified across our investments. 

Structural integrity of an asset under different weather con-

ditions is an area of focus during acquisition, due diligence 

and ongoing portfolio management. Maintenance and capi-

tal expenditure programs focus on ensuring that assets are 

resilient through changing conditions. In addition, future 

resilience to changes in the physical environment is typi-

cally considered when defining standards for the design, 

build and enhancement of assets, and business continuity 

plans are implemented across our portfolio companies to 

mitigate disruptions from severe weather events.

See Physical Risk Assessment: Summary of Key Observations 

for a summary of our screening results and selected 

examples of mitigation and adaptation2 activities being 

pursued. The summary is reflective of the results from 

our current (based on historical data) and longer-term 

(2050) higher emissions scenario screens and consider-

ing asset type characteristics. 

Under the lower emissions scenario, similar trends are 

generally observed. Most of the risks identified in the 

assessment were also identified during our initial due dil-

igence or as part of our ongoing portfolio management 

activities. We will continue to work with our portfolio 

companies in further enhancing their physical risk mit-

igation and adaptation strategies, by providing support 

for operational and other improvements, and the sharing 

of best practices.

To illustrate the screening approach, an example of 

the results for our core office assets is presented in the 

graph. This graph shows the distribution of potential 

physical risks by climate hazard for the sampled assets 

under i) current climate conditions (baseline period 

from 1986-2014) and ii) the long-term time horizon 

(2050) for both the lower (SSP1-2.6) and higher (SSP5-

8.5) emissions scenarios. Overall, physical risks are low 

in the current and projected periods under both the 

lower and higher emissions scenarios. 

Brookfield is aware of these risks, having already 

performed a physical climate change risk assessment 

across its office portfolio in 2021 and in several pri-

or analyses. We are aware of extreme heat affecting 

certain assets, including concentrated clusters of assets 

in Australia, Los Angeles and Houston, but consider the 

potential risk low overall. We are mitigating risk at the 

property level, where possible, by investing in heat resil-

iency measures, including advanced cooling technol-

ogy, creating shade and preserving open space where 

possible, developing assets with heat-smart orientation, 

shape and massing, and activating operational strat-

egies to minimize energy use in heat stressed regions 

while still providing our tenants with a cool, comfort-

able environment. 

Similarly, we are aware some of our assets are exposed 

to increased rainfall risk, which we consider minimal, 

and are mitigating at our properties, where possible, by 

investing in flood barrier systems, protecting essential 

building infrastructure and by having strong emergency 

management plans in place in case of flooding. 
Given the diversified nature of the types of assets in which we invest and the differing vulnerabilities of these asset types to each physical hazard (for example an office building 

compared to a section of rail), aggregated results across different asset types does not provide particularly meaningful information. As such, we have chosen to provide an example 

of the screening output and present key observations from our assessment in the summary table that follows.

Extreme 
Heat

The results of our screen indicated that the occurrence of extreme heat is projected to increase over the longer-term 
across many parts of the world where we operate; however, most of our businesses are not highly vulnerable to this 
hazard. Where extreme heat is projected to be most pronounced for our investments, these businesses are, for the 
most part, already experiencing a warmer environment and implementing mitigation strategies. For example, in our 
healthcare and senior living businesses, mitigation strategies include ongoing maintenance to ensure that air cooling 
systems and generators are in good working order and appropriate for both the local and changing climate condi-
tions. Another area of focus is ensuring health and safety programs protect people from the risk of extreme heat, 
including work restrictions during peak temperature hours, as required.

Landslide The results of our screen indicated that landslide risk is not projected to increase significantly in the longer-term 
under the higher emissions scenario compared to historical experience. Landslide risk predominantly exists for 
portions of our linear1 infrastructure assets and for certain renewable power assets in Brazil, India and the United 
States. Linear infrastructure assets are spread across very large geographic areas and landslides, should they 
occur, would be expected to impact only a small segment of operations at any given point in time. Where feasible, 
mitigation measures have been implemented to protect against landslide, for example, through the installation 
of netting in locations with higher potential exposure. Mitigation strategies for our other assets vary by asset 
type. For example, for hydroelectric power assets, risk is mitigated through measures such as stringent design 
standards, annual dam safety assessments and hillside vegetation planning and slope protection. As landslides 
are local, risk across our investments is further mitigated by the geographic diversity of the assets screening at 
risk for this hazard.   

Wildfire Wildfire exposure is based on a proxy that represents the conditions required for a wildfire to start and spread. The 
results consider ecoregion classifications to assign wildfire risk to assets that are near a fuel source; however, it does 
not consider the likelihood of an ignition and, therefore, does not project changes in frequency or intensity of wild-
fires. Modelling wildfires is complex and there are limitations to our ability to accurately screen for this risk. 

Assets screening at potential risk of wildfire were predominantly associated with portions of our linear infrastruc-
ture assets and for certain renewable power assets. Wildfire risk has been an area of focus for these businesses 
and mitigation strategies are in place and continue to be improved, including, where applicable, vegetation 
management plans that adhere to industry standards, installation and maintenance of firebreaks, and where fea-
sible, hardening standards to reduce the impacts of wildfire (e.g., using concrete rail ties), ensuring operational 
recovery systems are in place and training employees to proactively identify and mitigate hazards that could lead 
to or exacerbate the impacts of wildfire. Linear assets generally span wide geographic areas and wildfire, should 
it occur, would be expected to impact only a segment of operations at any given point in time. The number of 
assets exposed to wildfire risk was not projected to change significantly in the longer-term under the higher 
emissions scenario.

Riverine 
Flood

Riverine flooding is caused by an overflow of fresh waterbody such as a river. A portion of our assets, across 
various asset types and regions, screened as potentially at risk of riverine flooding. The occurrence of assets 
screening at risk in the long-term time horizon was consistent with the historical period. Mitigation strategies 
in place across our investments vary by asset type. For example, at our real estate properties, keeping essential 
building infrastructure, such as generators, on higher floors. At our hydroelectric power assets, maximum 
inflows are monitored compared to dam capacity and flood map studies and inflow design flood calculations 
are updated on a regular basis. Another example of a mitigation strategy is ensuring that rail ties are construct-
ed to standards appropriate for local flood conditions and checked regularly, as part of regular maintenance 
programs to ensure they remain secure. In addition to varying asset level mitigation measures in place that 
serve to lower the risk associated with flooding, risk across our investments is further mitigated by the geo-
graphic diversity of our assets.

Tropical 
Storm

Given the lack of modeling data for future periods, our assessment of tropical storms was based on historical 
data. Overall, only a small number of assets screened at potential risk for tropical storms. These assets are 
located in the Asia-Pacific region, the United States and the Caribbean. Tropical storm risk at these locations has 
previously been identified and the affected assets are typically built to standards that consider potential storm 
risk. Furthermore, where applicable, business continuity plans are in place to minimize disruption from storms.

Drought Overall, the current and projected risk of drought across our investments is low. Where relevant, for example in 
our manufacturing and real estate businesses, drought mitigation measures may include the implementation 
of water management plans along with other water conservation measures. Reducing the impact of our overall 
water consumption is an important area of focus for our portfolio companies as further described in Water & Waste.

Coastal 
Flooding

Coastal flooding risk affects only a small portion of locations screened. The affected assets are diversified by sec-
tor and geography, thereby limiting any potential impact. The number of assets exposed to coastal flooding risk 
was not projected to change significantly under the long-term higher emissions scenario. Risks were previously 
identified and mitigation strategies vary by asset type. For example, at certain of our port assets, quay heights 
have been or can be raised. Other mitigation strategies include ensuring operational recovery and inventory 
management systems are in place, and leveraging local flood management and defense system plans, such as 
locks and sea walls.  

Extreme 
Rainfall

Extreme rainfall events may cause pluvial flooding, which is flooding that occurs independent of an overflowing body of 
water. A portion of our assets screened as potentially at risk to extreme rainfall across multiple asset types and coun-
tries. The occurrence of assets screening at risk increased slightly in the long-term time horizon. Mitigation strategies 
in place across our investments vary by asset type. For example, at our hydroelectric power assets, maximum inflows 
are monitored compared to dam capacity and flood map studies and inflow design flood calculations are updated on a 
regular basis. Certain of our manufacturing facilities and warehouses store critical equipment on elevated racking sys-
tems or higher floors and can utilize backup facilities in the event of a local disruption. In addition to varying asset level 
mitigation measures in place, that serve to lower the risk associated with extreme rainfall, risk across our investments is 
further mitigated by the geographic diversity of our assets.

Limitations to the Analysis 

Climate risk and opportunity management is an evolving aspect of our business. We 
will continue to refine our understanding of how transition and physical climate issues 
may impact our portfolio companies and assets and we expect to continue making 
enhancements to the way we assess, manage and report on climate-related risks 
and opportunities as we learn from our own experiences and incorporate advance-
ments in climate science, relevant standards and best practice. 

As a result, we expect that certain information presented in this report and in our 
other ESG-related publications may be updated or restated in the future as the quality 
and completeness of our data and methodologies continues to improve.

Our Climate 
Strategy
We are committed to contributing to a low-carbon 
economy. Our climate strategy is informed by our 
risk and opportunity assessment and is comprised 
of four components:

I. Supporting the World’s Transition to a Net-Zero Economy 

a. Operationalizing Decarbonization 

b. Leading in Transition Investing and 
Clean Energy Development  

c. Driving Sustainable Financing 

II. Encouraging Conservation of Biodiversity  
and Our Ecosystems

III. Enhancing Value and Building Resilience by Managing 
the Risks and Opportunities of a Changing Climate

IV. Facilitating Knowledge Sharing and Engagement with  
External Stakeholders

I. Supporting the World's Transition to a Net-Zero Economy

Brookfield is aligned with the global imperative of decarbonization and has set an ambition to achieve net zero across all assets under management 

by 2050. To achieve this global ambition, it will require tremendous financial investment, a paradigm shift in how assets are managed, and govern-

ment support through policy and regulation. We intend to support this goal by contributing operational and investment expertise to execute practi-

cal decarbonization strategies that will prepare businesses for the future economy. We also believe that decarbonization is an important long-term 

transition risk mitigation strategy that is complementary to preserving and enhancing value. 

As we assist our operating companies in this journey, we remain focused on our ESG approach, which at its core is to balance our fiduciary duty to 

create long-term value for our investors and stakeholders, while managing our businesses responsibly. We will continue to buy long-life assets and 

businesses that can generate stable cash flows that grow over time. We believe that with proper management and stewardship, including preparing 

them for a low-carbon future, these assets will tend to increase in value over time. 

We are utilizing the following levers to accelerate our efforts towards our 2050 net-zero ambition:

Ia. Supporting the World's Transition to a Net-Zero Economy: Operationalizing Decarbonization

With our 100+ year history as an owner-operator, we are well-positioned to identify decarbonization opportunities and are putting plans into action 

to transition our portfolio companies accordingly.

The imperative of decarbonization has been gaining significant momentum in recent years; however, managing businesses sustainably has been 

our operating approach for many years. This is not just through executing opportunities to power Brookfield businesses with energy generated by 

our renewable power operations, but also in our real estate business, which has a leading worldwide portfolio of high-quality, core office properties, 

with 100% of our North American core offices holding at least one sustainability certification (including LEED, BREEM and NABERS) and our infra-

structure business, which acquired and significantly expanded an innovative deep-lake water district heating and cooling business until its successful 

disposition in 2021. We will take the same pragmatic approach in deploying our decarbonization strategy.

Across most of our portfolio companies today, decarbonization is already under way at varying levels. Brookfield owns a widely diversified portfolio of assets, and we recognize 

that there cannot be a “one size fits all” approach to decarbonization. Our role as operators is to formalize our approach, facilitate knowledge sharing and develop repeatable 

strategies across our broader asset base—what we refer to as operationalizing decarbonization—to catalyze carbon reduction solutions. 

Operationalizing decarbonization  
is made up of a five-step cycle:

Step One: Commit to net-zero ambition and 
set near-term targets 

To ensure our portfolio aligns with climate action best 

practices, we have set an ambition to reach net zero by 

2050 or sooner. Over the next 30 years, many factors 

will impact how we action our climate strategy and our 

ability to achieve our goals and business plans, including 

demographics, technological advances and government 

policies, to name a few. To ensure that we remain on track 

to reach our ambition and to maintain transparency with 

our stakeholders, we will strive to use the achievement of 

near-term targets to demonstrate progress. 

Supporting our net-zero ambition, Brookfield became 

a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) ini-

tiative in 2021. As part of joining the NZAM initiative, we 

committed to: 

• Put in place concrete action plans, consistent with 

an ambition to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 or 

sooner across all AUM;

• Set an interim target of a specific proportion of our 

assets to be managed in line with net zero, with tar-

geted emissions reduction by 2030; and

• Review this interim target at least every five years, 

with a view to increasing the proportion of AUM cov-

ered until 100% of assets are included. 

1 Based on AUM as of December 31, 2022, excluding Oaktree Capital Management.

Step Two:  Share best practices and  
operational excellence

A vital component of operationalizing decarbonization 

is to drive organizational culture change. We believe 

that we can guide this shift by informing how our 

investment and asset management professionals, and 

portfolio companies consider climate opportunities and 

carbon reduction initiatives. We take an active approach 

in engaging our portfolio companies, focusing initially 

on investments in which we have a position of control, 

which represent over 70%1 of our assets under man-

agement. We have created the Net Zero Operational 

Committee which will have oversight of these activities 

(see Climate Governance section).

Step Three:  Apply a net-zero framework

Demonstrating progress on reduction initiatives is imperative to achieving our net-zero ambition; however, we do not believe progress is defined solely by yearly reductions in 

absolute emissions or in emissions intensity. As a value investor, we recognize that the energy transition is not linear and may require investment in higher emitting assets. This 

may result in investments in businesses requiring significant help decarbonizing and de-risking their operations. This necessarily may result in increases in emissions at the time 

of investment. For example, in the case of BGTF, we may pursue higher emitting assets and use our clean energy and operational capabilities to decarbonize the businesses in line 

with a Paris-aligned pathway.

We intend to use the NZAM-endorsed Paris Aligned Investment Initiative (PAII) Net Zero Investment Framework (NZIF) methodology for our net-zero commitment. We also rec-

ognize that before our portfolio companies can commit to aligning to a net-zero target, we will need to guide them through a preparatory process, similar to the steps Brookfield 

took prior to becoming an NZAM signatory. As a result, we have designed a framework, which we have referred to as the Achieving Net Zero Framework, which prescribes a phased 

approach in a portfolio company’s net-zero journey. This framework is intended to complement NZIF and to set a strong foundation to achieve each portfolio company’s long-term 

net-zero goals. This framework is designed to attain two objectives: (1) it serves as a tangible roadmap for businesses to get themselves on a pathway to achieve net-zero emis-

sions, and (2) it will be an important tool that we will use to articulate progress to stakeholders, especially as our assets under management continue to grow.

Our Framework incorporates NZIF’s recommended phases and supplements it with additional steps 

to help bridge portfolio companies from the beginning of their journey to being able to set a net-zero 

ambition consistent with the ‘Committed to Aligning’ category:

grate into business plans

4. Planning for implementa-

tion and review of available 

science-based targets

Companies that have not yet 
begun the process to reach  
net zero, including defining 
their ambition

Companies that have set a clear 
long-term 2050 goal consistent with 
achieving global net zero

Companies working toward a 
net-zero pathway, including:

• Setting a short- or 
medium-term target

• Disclosure of Scope 1, 2 and 
where available, material 
Scope 3 emissions data

• A plan for how the company 
will achieve these targets

Companies that are aligned meet all 
the previous criteria plus: 

• Emissions (intensity) performance 
for Scope 1, 2 and material 
Scope 3 relative to targets

Companies with emissions intensity 
at or close to net-zero emissions 
with a plan to continue to achieve 
that goal over time

Step Four: Measure and report 

We are committed to transparency and will report our 

progress through our TCFD disclosures going forward, 

which will be available to all our stakeholders. The 

measurement of emissions remains an important met-

ric. Along with emissions monitoring, we will utilize our 

Achieving Net Zero Framework to show how companies 

are advancing on their net-zero journey.  

We have invested heavily over several years, collaborating 

with our people, portfolio companies and climate advisors, 

to develop a systematic methodology for aggregating a 

comprehensive inventory of emissions across our busi-

nesses. In developing this methodology, where possible, 

we have taken a bottom-up approach, obtaining data from 

our portfolio companies, which can be highly complex due 

to the scale and diversity of the assets that we own. We 

track and measure GHG emissions as informed by the GHG 

Protocol and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials 

(PCAF) Standards. We will utilize this foundational approach 

to measure and report emissions. We will then use the 

emissions inventory to develop specific decarbonization 

plans and related targets as appropriate. We expect to 

refine our measurement methodology as we gain better 

access to data and to align with industry best practices as 

they continue to evolve. 

Step Five: Evaluate our net-zero ambition and 
reset near-term targets

As our portfolio of assets continues to grow and as we 

make progress in advancing existing investments on their 

decarbonization journey, we expect to iterate this five-

step process continuously. We are committed to regularly 

evaluating our net-zero progress and resetting near-term 

targets in line with our long-term ambition in accordance 

with our NZAM commitment.

years, collaborating with our people, 
portfolio companies and climate 
advisors to develop a systematic 
methodology for aggregating a

Operating Levers 
for Decarbonization
As owners and operators of assets and businesses that 

help form the backbone of the global economy, we seek 

to achieve our decarbonization ambition thoughtfully, 

alongside the communities in which we operate and other 

stakeholders. Our emission reduction strategy varies 

across businesses and incorporates a variety of initiatives. 

We focus on an operations-oriented approach to actively 

manage our assets, including carbon-intensive assets. 

We are leveraging this operational expertise with a goal 

of placing all assets on a pathway to reducing emissions, 

utilizing capital investment and process-intensive decar-

bonization methods. We are initially prioritizing assets 

where we have control to implement emission reduction 

strategies and where we can influence outcomes. 

Our primary focus is on emission reductions. Even after 

taking every possible measure to reduce a company’s 

emissions, there may still be residual emissions. We are 

committed to exhausting all other means of decarbon-

ization and expect to utilize carbon offsets in instances 

where there are no technologically and/or financially 

viable ways to eliminate residual emissions. Therefore, we 

expect that carbon offsets will not represent a material 

portion of our decarbonization strategy.

Renewable Energy
Executing opportunities to power Brookfield 

businesses with green energy generated by 

our leading renewable power operations. 

Electrification
Modifying or replacing traditional fossil fuel con-

suming processes with electrification methods. 

Capital Allocation
Investing capital towards maintenance or 

growth capital expenditure projects that can 

result in more efficient emissions intensity.

Abatement
Reducing or ceasing of activities 

contributing to GHG emissions. 

Green & Transition 
Technology
Utilizing newer, lower-emitting technologies, 

including alternative sources of fuel,  

carbon capture and sequestration. 

We are concentrating on the following decarbonization categories:

Renewable Energy
Brookfield Real Estate is committed to executing clean energy 
initiatives across its portfolio, driving its overall carbon footprint reduction.

U.S. As we execute our long-term strategy to deliver net-zero emissions across our business by 2050 or sooner, we are reducing our 

Scope 2 and 3 emissions by powering 100% of Brookfield’s U.S. Office portfolio with predominantly clean energy sources by 

2026. Brookfield will predominantly leverage power purchase agreements (PPAs) to decarbonize its operations, ensuring that 

we source electricity from the same power grid in which we will use the electricity, further incentivizing the development of new 

clean energy sources. Clean energy sources for procurement include hydropower, solar, wind and nuclear power. Brookfield’s 

U.S. office portfolio will procure 600 GWh of clean electricity, reducing GHG emissions by 260,000 mtCO2e annually (the equivalent 

of avoiding burning 300 million pounds of coal). Clean Power Sources by City:

• DENVER: Renewable electricity from local wind power facilities.

• HOUSTON: Newly built, Texas-based solar power plant, with its construction initiated by Brookfield Properties. 

• LOS ANGELES: Newly built, California-based solar power plant, with its construction initiated by Brookfield Properties.

• NEW YORK: In-state, run-of-river hydropower facilities. 

• SAN FRANCISCO: Solar and wind farms through the CleanPowerSF SuperGreen program.

• WASHINGTON D.C.: Nuclear power facilities equipped by Brookfield’s Westinghouse Electric Corp. 

INDIA Accelerating our progress, in 2022, Brookfield Properties India committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 across 

its entire portfolio of 50 million square feet ("sf") in India, which includes locations in which we have an operating presence. 

Brookfield Properties India’s strategy to achieve net zero is focused on energy efficiency, reducing water consumption, 

promoting recycling, and improving indoor air quality, which benefits all its tenants. 

U.K. Brookfield Renewable will supply Brookfield Canary Wharf with clean energy beginning in 2026, providing 80 GWh of 

annual electricity needed with power generated from the development of our new, onshore windfarm in Scotland. 

CHINA Brookfield’s newly opened mixed-use complex in Shanghai, One East, uses renewable energy to collaborate on net-zero strat-

egies with tenants. During construction, Brookfield installed solar panels on the roof of the complex’s retail area, which is visible to 

the tenants of both office towers. The solar panels generate 260 MWh of energy per year, which reduces the building’s GHG 

emissions by over 5,000 metric tons a year. Beyond supplying a portion of the complex’s energy, the solar panels are a con-

versation starter on how we develop sustainable real estate in alignment with China’s National Energy Administration policy.

Capital Allocation
Brookfield Infrastructure’s AusNet Allocates Maintenance 
Capital Expenditure Towards Efficient Emissions
Brookfield Infrastructure’s regulated utility business, AusNet, is allocating capital to perform a critical upgrade of the Vic-

toria transmission network by building approximately 200 km of new transmission lines under the “Western Renewables 

Link” project. This project supports Brookfield and Australia’s stated goals of lowering emissions intensity.

This maintenance capex project will contribute to the successful transition from coal-generated to wind and solar-generated 

renewable energy. Once complete, the additional capacity from the transmission lines will enable the growth of up to 

900 MW of new renewable generation assets in northwest Victoria, providing economic benefits to communities along 

the route. 

AusNet works with surrounding local communities, traditional owners, and regional leaders to reduce project impacts, under-

stand priority needs, and establish mutually beneficial relationships.

Electrification
Brookfield Private Equity’s Investment in  
BrandSafway Developing LAX’s Automated People Mover Project

Electrification is critical to modifying or replacing traditional fossil fuel consuming processes. BrandSafway has supported 

the development of the Automated People Mover (APM) construction project currently underway at Los Angeles 

International Airport (LAX). The APM is an electric train system that will transform the efficiency of one of the world’s 

largest airports, by providing free and reliable access to LAX while greatly reducing vehicle traffic to and from the airport. 

The APM will reduce the airport’s carbon footprint and is designed to be LEED Gold certified. 

BrandSafway is supplying scaffolding and stairs across five APM stations and pedestrian walkways, as well as using the 

QuikDeck® Suspended Access System—a state-of-the-art modular access system—on the undersides of structures to 

keep the roadways beneath them open.

The train system will be on a 2-mile elevated guideway with six stations total. In addition to being free, the train will operate 

24/7 and have the capacity to carry 200 passengers per train, with trains operating every two minutes during peak hours. 

The APM project is anticipated to be operational in 2024 with an estimated use of 30 million passengers per year, resulting 

in approximately 117,000 fewer vehicle miles traveled per day. The command center and maintenance facility is expected 

to generate nearly half its power from solar energy while the train cars will generate a portion of their own power through 

regenerative braking.

Green & Transition Technology
Brookfield Renewable Invests in a Leading Agricultural 
Renewable Natural Gas Platform, CalBio

One of Brookfield’s operating levers for decarbonization is to utilize new, low-emitting technologies such as alternative fuel 

sources. Brookfield Renewable invested in one such company, CalBio, a developer, owner and operator of renewable natural 

gas (“RNG”) facilities. CalBio is one of the largest agricultural RNG platforms in the U.S., with approximately 50 digesters under 

operation, producing 3 billion cubic feet of annual production. CalBio has partnered with utility companies to advance future 

projects, such as gas interconnection and electricity.

CalBio generates renewable natural gas or electricity by collecting manure waste from existing dairy farm operations, 

which is then passed through an anaerobic digestor to create biogas. By capturing this biogas, CalBio prevents the release 

of this methane into the atmosphere. This results in renewable natural gas or electricity, which can be used to power 

trucks, buses or cars.

Demand for agricultural renewable natural gas is expected to outpace other biofuels over the next decade as corporates 

and utilities seek to decarbonize gas supply to meet voluntary and government-mandated net-zero targets. Manure manage-

ment is one of the most promising methods currently available to decarbonize agriculture and help address global methane 

reduction objectives. Brookfield’s investment in CalBio supports reduced GHG emissions from the agricultural sector by abating 

methane released on farms and displacing fossil fuels in the transport sector. Beginning in 2026, we expect our capital will 

result in six million MMBtu of renewable natural gas production and 2.2 million mtCO2e of GHG emissions abated annually, 

the equivalent of 612 wind turbines running for one year.

Abatement
Brookfield Renewable Partners 
with TransAlta to Retire and Convert Coal Production 

TransAlta is one of Canada’s largest producers of wind power and Alberta’s largest producer of hydroelectric power. In 2020, 

Brookfield Renewable closed a C$400 million investment, injecting capital required for TransAlta’s coal-to-gas conversions and to 

fund the build-out of TransAlta’s renewable electricity portfolio.

Since Brookfield Renewable’s investment, TransAlta has completed the conversion to gas at their Alberta facilities formerly 

fueled by coal, and retired their Highvale coal mine effective December 31, 2021. In total, TransAlta has retired 3,904 MW 

of coal-fired generation capacity since 2019 while converting 1,659 MW to natural gas. As a result, TransAlta has reduced 

their total GHG emissions by over six million mtCO2e, a 37% reduction in two years, while increasing their renewable ener-

gy capacity to 2,900 MW, enough to power 1.8 million homes.1 

Today, TransAlta’s diversified renewable fleet makes the company one of the largest renewable power producers in North 

America, wind power producers in Canada and hydro power producers in Alberta.

Approach to Fossil Fuel Investments 

We do not have a firmwide exclusion policy on coal or 

other fossil fuel investments. Similarly, we do not believe 

in divestment of high emitting industries. Rather, we 

believe that there is significant value in supporting 

decarbonization of the highest-emitting sectors, where we 

can deliver the greatest level of impact. Our fossil fuel 
exposure is less than 11% of our business in terms of 
assets under management.1 Our current fossil fuel 

exposure is largely associated with midstream businesses, 

primarily in natural gas.

We focus on investing in high-quality midstream assets that 

will generate an appropriate risk-adjusted return during 

our hold period, notwithstanding terminal value expectations. 

In this process, we may consider decarbonizing, repurposing, 

repositioning, or phasing-out approaches, depending on the 

nature and specific economic circumstances, that are aligned 

with net-zero expectations.

These businesses represent unique infrastructure that is 

strategically located to serve attractive supply and 

demand centers. While our pipelines facilitate the movement 

of natural gas today, providing important transition fuel 

and energy security, we believe there is a tremendous 

opportunity to repurpose our pipelines to transport 

alternative fuels in the future. An example of this is our 

investment in one of the U.K.’s largest gas distribution 

networks. This business is playing a leading role in 

delivering pilot projects for the delivery of hydrogen for 

use in home heating and thereby facilitating a wider 

transition in line with the U.K.’s net-zero goals.

Ib. Supporting the World's Transition to a Net-Zero 
Economy: Leading in Transition Investing and Clean 
Energy Development

As outlined in our climate risk and opportunity assessment, 

a transition to a lower-carbon economy presents significant 

opportunities and we are well-positioned to take a leading 

role in transition investing and clean energy development. 

We launched BGTF I two years ago, the first in a series of 

funds for our transition strategy that is dedicated to 

accelerating the transition to a net-zero economy by 

catalyzing businesses onto net-zero pathways aligned with 

the goals of the Paris Agreement.  

Through BGTF, we are utilizing our leadership in renew-

able power and deep operational capabilities to scale 

clean energy operations and “go where the emissions 

are” to invest in emissions-intensive businesses and set 

them on a path to net zero. To illustrate, in 2023, BGTF I 

announced its plans to acquire Origin Energy’s Energy 

Markets business. This opportunity represents a land-

mark agreement that will accelerate decarbonization of 

the energy grid and help Australia progress towards its 

net-zero goals. BGTF I intends to significantly reduce Origin’s 

carbon emissions and invest at least $20 billion in the 

buildout of up to 14 GW of newly developed renewables 

and storage capacity in Australia over the next decade and 

reduce the absolute emissions produced by the business 

by more than 70% by 2030. Moreover, our investment is 

intended to help facilitate a responsible transition away 

from coal. While we will be increasing the amount of 

GHG emissions into our inventory in the first few years of 

acquisition, we expect to use our operational expertise to 

facilitate a responsible phase out of coal energy production 

and ultimately contribute to a lower emissions trajectory 

during the hold of our investment. The phase out of 

carbon-intensive energy production will play a meaningful 

part in our overall decarbonization strategy. 

Consistent with its dual objectives of pursuing industry-leading 

returns and generating a measurable positive environmental 

change, this fund will report to investors on both its finan-

cial and environmental impact performance and will follow 

leading global frameworks for impact measurement and 

management and disclose quantitative impact results. 

Since its inception, BGTF I has deployed $11.2 billion, 

representing approximately 86% of its capital, signaling 

our commitment to financing the energy transition. This 

includes $5.2 billion towards clean energy development 

opportunities, such as a utility-scale wind and solar and 

distributed generation, $2.5 billion towards power transfor-

mation services, $1.4 billion towards nuclear energy services 

and an additional $2.1 billion towards a diverse set of other 

sustainable solutions, including battery storage, carbon 

capture, usage and storage, biofuels, and recycling solutions. 

Brookfield has also announced the fundraising launch of the 

second vintage of the fund and is targeting a meaningfully 

higher fund size in continuation of the same strategy of its 

predecessor. For more details on BGTF, please refer to the 

Brookfield Renewable Partners ESG Report.

In addition to driving impact through transition investing, 

we are one of the world’s largest investors in renewable 

power globally. We plan to continue to support growth in 

renewable power by developing new clean energy capacity 

equivalent to doubling the size of our 2021 operating 

1 As of March 31, 2023, excluding Oaktree Capital. Fossil fuel is defined based on the MSCI definition of fossil fuel exposure which includes companies with evidence of fossil fuel reserves and deriving revenue from business 
segments associated with energy application of fossil fuels.
2 Our avoided emissions are based on our long-term average generation and the Global Grid Average Emission Factor (IEA 2021).

Ic. Supporting the World's Transition to a Net-Zero
Economy: Driving Sustainable Financing

We continue to be a leader in sustainable finance, 

enabling investors and portfolio companies to contribute 

to a sustainable market economy and support adaptation 

to global climate change challenges. 

Brookfield issues green bonds, preferred shares and other 

instruments to fund the development of green energy 

technologies and to finance other eligible investments. 

Brookfield established a Green Bond Framework and crite-

ria for green (ICMA) Green Bond Principles. These include:

• Use of proceeds

• The process for project evaluation and selection

• Management of proceeds

• Reporting

The Capital Markets and Treasury (CMT) team, including 

senior executives from the Finance leadership team, 

oversees the evaluation and selection of green bonds 

and other products.

In 2022, we issued approximately $7 billion in green bonds, 

sustainability-linked debt and green preferred securities.

In November 2022, Brookfield Renewable issued C$400 

million aggregate principal of green medium-term notes, 

offered with a 10-year fixed rate term. This transaction 

was oversubscribed, including approximately 50 major 

institutional investors. Brookfield Renewable used the 

proceeds to make eligible green investments (as defined 

in Brookfield Renewable’s Green Bond and Preferred 

Securities Framework dated February 2021).

In addition, we continue to explore ways to expand our 

portfolio of sustainable assets and investments across 

Renewable Power & Transition, Infrastructure, Private 

Equity and Real Estate.

II. Encouraging Conservation of 
Biodiversity and our Ecosystems

Our Approach to Biodiversity

Encouraging conservation of biodiversity is an important 

component in achieving net zero and managing physical 

risks. We view the protection of the ecosystems surround-

ing our businesses as a high priority. Our businesses 

represent critical infrastructure and enterprises that 

surrounding economies and communities depend on. 

We strive to protect biodiversity and ecosystems near 

our businesses, and we acknowledge that factors such as 

habitat degradation and loss, pollution and climate change 

contribute to decreasing global biodiversity. 

We aim to protect biodiversity throughout the lifecycle of 

our investments and we encourage the inclusion of biodi-

versity considerations when evaluating new investments. 

With the development of greenfield assets, while there is 

a critical need for infrastructure to facilitate an increase in 

renewable energy to mitigate climate change, we recog-

nize that our activities could have a negative effect on 

biodiversity if not addressed. For example, in our Renew-

able Power & Transition, Infrastructure and Real Estate 

businesses, where we have a meaningful greenfield devel-

opment pipeline, we conduct environmental assessments 

prior to project commencement to understand baseline 

conditions and, where applicable, key biodiversity and 

ecosystem sensitivities. These environmental assessments, 

in some cases, consider proximity to protected areas and 

the presence of sensitive, threatened, or endangered 

species. Where appropriate, we engage local stakeholders 

and experts to monitor biodiversity and conduct studies 

to further our conservation efforts. 

As a responsible owner and operator, we monitor relevant 

measures of environmental preservation on an ongoing 

basis across our businesses. In considering biodiversity, we 

are also conscious of the risk of deforestation associated with 

our businesses. Today, Brookfield does not have any invest-

ments in forest-risk agricultural commodity industries and 

therefore does not have direct exposure to deforestation. 

While we have not identified deforestation as a significant 

risk to our business, Brookfield is working to understand the 

amount of any indirect exposure to deforestation risk within 

its supply chain. Looking ahead, we are continuing to evaluate 

how we can enhance our processes and further incorporate 

biodiversity considerations throughout our investment and 

asset management process.

In late 2022, Brookfield Private Equity’s La Trobe Financial announced a partnership 
with Taronga Conservation Society Australia (Taronga) for the support of Australia’s 
unique and iconic, but critically endangered Regent Honeyeater. The Regent  
Honeyeater is a bird that inhabits temperate woodlands and open forests on the 
inland slopes of southeast Australia, with a range that has contracted dramatically 
in the last thirty years.

La Trobe Financial has joined state and federal governments to support the conservation of the Regent Honeyeaters, 

recognizing Taronga’s important role and responsibility in the protection and restoration of nature through targeted 

action. The goal is for the Regent Honeyeater to not only persist in the wild, but for their populations to increase, by 

improving habitat quality and connectivity whilst improving their post release survival and breeding success rate. The 

Regent Honeyeater's conservation status remains critically endangered and La Trobe Financial will continue to fight for 

these magnificent birds.

Bees are a vital part of our ecosystem and urban communities. Providing a safe place 
for bees to build their hives on our office property rooftops benefits not only the bees 
themselves, but also our communities. Honey bees play a vital role as pollinators and 
help to maintain biodiversity, which is especially important in urban environments. 

Bee colonies flourish in urban areas as they require an environment that fulfills three criteria: the absence of pesticides, an 

abundance of water and floral resources, and a temperate climate. Our office property rooftops are an ideal, safe place for 

these pollinators to call home. 

We currently have 60 honey bee hives throughout our U.S. office property portfolio across 33 locations in New York, Wash-

ington D.C., Houston, Denver and Los Angeles. We have adopted an estimated 3 million honeybees throughout our hives, 

and in 2022 they pollinated 300+ square miles, producing 4,900 jars of local raw honey. 

In addition, in 2022 we conducted 29 workshops with Brookfield Properties’ tenants to educate them about biodiversity 

and the importance of pollinators, engaging over 350 people in our communities. We first began our honey bee program 

in Washington D.C. in 2015 and will continue to expand the program in markets across our portfolio.

As Brookfield continues to focus on encouraging conservation of biodiversity and 
ecosystems near our businesses, we are conscious of the risk of deforestation and 
monitor relevant measures of environmental preservation. 

Brookfield invested in Arteris in 2012, a diversified portfolio of seven Brazilian toll roads with 3,200 km in operation. 

Throughout its operating history, Arteris has planted more than 2 million native seedlings, or the equivalent to 1,200 

hectares of reforested areas.

Beginning in 2016, Arteris began work on the Restinga Viva (or Living Coast Forests) Project, a habitat restoration 

project covering 166 hectares where Arteris operates, to replant native species, while removing the harmful invasive 

species. The project focuses on conservation, the recovery of degraded environments and increasing biodiversity and 

education. Partnering on this project reflects Brookfield’s focus on striving to protect biodiversity throughout the lifecycle 

of our investments.

Water & Waste

Reducing the impact of our overall water consumption and waste generation helps build efficient systems, resiliency in our businesses and contributes to a sustainable future. We utilize 

industry best practices to efficiently monitor and manage performance and work to ensure continual reduction.

Our portfolio companies consider water risks through the lens of quality and scarcity. We consider forward-looking risks related to climate change. In addition to water considerations, 

many of our businesses are seeking ways to reduce their waste to avoid negative impacts on our local ecosystems and communities. We adhere to all applicable local and regional waste 

regulations and track waste and recycling metrics. We work towards a circular economy by reducing, reusing and recycling our waste, where possible. Each business understands the 

importance of measuring these metrics and we continue to support their efforts for continual improvement in this area.

Waste Reduction Strategies at Brookfield’s 
Private Equity and Infrastructure Portfolio 
Companies

Across our businesses we are examining waste manage-

ment opportunities to reduce negative impacts on local 

environments and communities.

Our Private Equity business’ global lottery services com-

pany, Scientific Games, achieved its target of zero waste 

at its Leeds manufacturing site. It implemented a waste 

segregation process, ensuring that waste slated to leave 

the site was diverted or treated to become a resource for 

other industries. Waste segregation and collection points 

were provided across the manufacturing facility, with 

employees trained on the correct means of disposal. 

Within Brookfield Infrastructure, our European telecom-

munications business, Telia Towers, has developed, as 

a part of the Telia Group strategy, a solution to combat 

excess waste generated by network infrastructure to 

achieve its goal of net-zero waste through a circular 

economy by 2030. It set an interim milestone to reuse 

or recycle at least 85% of materials by 2025. Its Prevent, 

Reduce, Reuse, Recycle model addresses the significant 

amount of e-waste generated by infrastructure network 

equipment. Telia reuses network equipment and recy-

cles all end-of-life towers and batteries. The first-ever 

recycled tower was installed in 2022; Telia has several 

recycled towers in its pipeline for 2023.

A second Infrastructure portfolio company, SGN, our U.K. 

regulated utility business, is working to expand its abili-

ty to provide green gas to customers to supply 450,000 

homes by 2026. In 2022, a new biomethane anaerobic 

digestor site was connected to the SGN network. It applies 

circular economy concepts by using waste produced from 

a brewery onsite as feedstock for the plant. The site has 

the potential to supply 3,995 domestic customers.

Brookfield Renewable Tackling Reuse, 
Recycling and Recovery of Materials

Brookfield Renewable is working on opportunities to 

reuse, recycle or recover materials from major compo-

nents in its solar, wind and hydro operations to support 

its goal of diverting these materials from landfills. 

One of Brookfield Renewable’s preferred strategies to grow 

its generation portfolio is to take advantage of opportu-

nities to repower existing assets and extend their useful 

lives. They take available technologies and opportunities to 

recycle all end-of-life major components from those assets, 

ultimately reducing their environmental impact. 

In 2022, Brookfield Renewable completed the repowering 

of more than 300 turbines for the 845 MW Shepherds Flat 

wind project in Oregon. As part of the project, Brookfield 

Renewable’s supplier, GE, put in place plans for wind tur-

bine blades and the majority of other composite materi-

als removed during repowering activities to be recycled. 

Rather than disposal in landfills, the blade materials were 

shredded into Repurposed Engineered Material (REM) and 

used to produce and augment cement products.

In addition, in 2022 Brookfield Renewable engaged directly 

with their supply chain and peers to understand their initia-

tives and goals in recycling and recovering materials from 

major components. Brookfield Renewables worked with 

trade associations including Wind Europe and the Solar 

Energy Industries Association (SEIA) to progress industry 

solutions, including SEIA’s National PV Recycling Program, 

which identifies and qualifies recycling companies. 

These engagements informed the development of its major 

component plans for solar panels and wind turbines. For exam-

ple, Brookfield Renewable’s Canadian platform was able to recy-

cle a hydro unit, which was at the end of its useful life, resulting 

in the recycling of 1,996 tons of end-of-life components.

Leveraging Technology at Brookfield 
Properties’ Ecoworld to Achieve Zero Waste  

Brookfield utilizes industry best practices to ensure the 

continual reduction of waste. Within Brookfield’s real estate 

portfolio, Ecoworld is an office campus development in Ban-

galore focused on integrating sustainability. This includes 

an efficient energy footprint, water conservation and holis-

tic waste management. 

The Ecoworld team created a waste management strate-

gy based on three waste classification tiers: wet, dry, and 

waste rejects. Wet waste is processed through an on-site 

composting facility, with liquid wet waste processed using

a biogas composting plant. Dry waste processing includes 

secondary sorting into twenty individual waste streams. 

Various dry waste types are sent to authorized recyclers of 

specific materials. Waste rejects are redirected to cement 

facilities for processing, rather than being sent to a 

landfill. Ecoworld works with tenants who produce waste 

rejects to modify their supply chain and consumption 

patterns to reduce waste generation.

Ecoworld leverages a systems approach to quantify daily 

waste data. Initially, 60% of the building’s waste was 

classified as waste rejects, or landfill waste. The Ecoworld 

team embarked on a mission to reduce waste rejects from 

60% to less than 5% of total waste generated, ultimately 

succeeding in reducing landfill waste to 3%, with Ecoworld 

repurposing the remaining waste. The strategy diverts 20 

tons of waste from landfills each month, reducing GHG 

emissions by 1,030 kg CO2e annually. The Indian Green 

Building Council awarded Ecoworld its Net-Zero Waste 

Platinum Certification for closing its waste generation 

loop, making it the first commercial office property in 

India to obtain this certification.

III. Enhancing Value and Building Resilience 
by Managing the Risks and Opportunities of 
a Changing Climate

Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon econo-

my present potential risks and opportunities for our port-

folio companies and assets. Our approach to identifying, 

assessing and managing these risks and opportunities is 

described in Climate-Related Risk Management. Based on 

our climate risk and opportunity assessments, we have not 

identified any systemic climate-related risks across our busi-

nesses and have identified many opportunities. Where value 

enhancement opportunities are identified, our operations 

teams work closely with senior management of our portfolio 

companies to support and oversee the development and 

implementation of business improvements.

IV. Facilitating Knowledge Sharing and 
Engagement With External Stakeholders

Partnering with our internal and external stakeholders is 

an essential element of our climate strategy. We believe 

it is important to share our approach to climate, including 

best practices and progress, with our clients, employees, 

portfolio companies and industry groups. We actively facil-

itate knowledge sharing and advocate, where necessary, 

across multiple channels.

With over 2,500 employees worldwide, our people are 

Brookfield’s most valued asset. We provide relevant 

training and promote internal discussions to facilitate a 

learning culture. As it relates to climate, we facilitate train-

ing in two ways: through formal training sessions, utilizing 

both internal and external expertise; and through working 

group discussions.

In 2022, Brookfield facilitated training, covering a broad range of sustainability related topics including our net-zero ambition, climate risk assessments, GHG emissions mea-

surement, and emission reduction strategies. Employees receiving training span all management levels throughout the organization and across functions, including our asset 

management, investment, finance and ESG focused professionals, as well as portfolio companies. Additionally, in 2022 we facilitated a session with our board of directors on 

climate risks and opportunities and our approach to decarbonization.

Portfolio and External Stakeholder Engagement

We utilize our active asset management approach to collaborate with our portfolio companies and encourage  
sound ESG practices that are essential for resilient businesses, while creating long-term value for our investors 
and stakeholders. Where we can exercise control or significant influence, we work with our portfolio companies to 
measure and report both historical and forecasted GHG emissions and develop plans that consider decarbonization 
initiatives. Through our ongoing engagement with portfolio companies, we may partner with or support them to 
facilitate discussions with external stakeholders, with the intent of positively influencing industry standards or 
practices that are aligned with our ESG principles. For investments where we do not have control or significant 
influence, we seek ways for targeted engagement. 

We collaborate regularly with outside stakeholders, including industry groups, and we encourage our businesses 
to participate in knowledge sharing practices. We believe external collaboration with stakeholders in public and 
private sectors is critical to uncovering solutions to existing challenges in the energy transition. We seek opportunities 
to work with public stakeholders where we can help shape public opinion and influence government actions and 
decisions in ways that protects and aligns with Brookfield’s business interests and reputation. We are members of 
various industry-leading groups that we believe are aligned with our overall climate goals and contribute to 
industry-led publications. Sharing our expertise is a priority and we will invest time to contribute to key climate 
initiatives and stakeholder discussions that are aligned with our ambition and can help accelerate decarbonization.

The U.S.’ historic IRA is one of the most important pieces of legislation around the 
world designed to spur investment in clean energy. It has set long-term tax incen-
tives for renewable energy such as wind, solar and hydropower, as well as new 
incentives for energy storage, clean hydrogen production, and the domestic man-
ufacturing of renewable energy equipment. In all, the IRA includes $370 billion of 
such tax credits, grants, loans and subsidies.1

Throughout 2022, Brookfield Renewable worked alongside trade groups and 
industry coalitions to advocate for passage of the Act. Brookfield Renewable ad-
vocated within Congress and to the Biden administration on the importance of 
policy certainty and fair treatment across renewable energy technologies.

3  Primarily includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions of Portfolio Companies where Brookfield has economic control and significant influence, and some in 

investments where Brookfield does not have control.

Metrics 
and Targets
We have prioritized improving the 
quality of our GHG emissions data in 
recent years as we believe it will provide 
quantitative direction on our climate 
strategy and performance. These figures 
are assessed regularly by senior 
management and through the  
governance channels discussed earlier. 

NZAM Commitment and Interim Target

We are a signatory to NZAM and, in May 2022, we sub-

mitted our interim target, setting out our commitment 

to reduce emissions across $147 billion (approximately 

one-third) of our assets under management by 2030 

from a 2020 base year.1

We continue to work towards finalizing our analysis of 

in-scope assets in our interim target and we look for-

ward to sharing the progress in our 2023 NZAM Interim 

Progress report later this year. Since publishing our 

interim target in 2022, AUM for our business has grown 

nearly $190 billion, of which we currently expect to add 

$54 billion of assets to our NZAM interim target. The major-

ity of the increase in AUM of in-scope assets is attributable 

to net new assets being added, with the remaining increase 

represented by accretion in value of previously in-scope 

assets. Newly added assets were selected as we believe 

that they have started to develop transition plans in line 

with our Achieving Net Zero Framework described earlier. 

With this addition, our in-scope assets will rise to $201 

billion or approximately 34% of AUM.2

As the assets under management included in our NZAM 

target continue to grow, our target is to have these 

assets reduce their emissions by at least 50% or more by 

2030. Our net-zero interim target includes Scope 1 and 2 

emissions of Brookfield’s portfolio companies, which also 

represents the majority of Brookfield’s Scope 3 Category 

15 “financed emissions”.3 

To fulfill this commitment, we have been focusing on 

portfolio company emissions, forecasting emissions within 

their business plans and prioritizing emissions reduction 

across our portfolio companies.

Our interim emissions target comprises assets across 

our businesses, including Renewable Power & Transition, 

Infrastructure, Private Equity and Real Estate. We 

developed our net-zero strategy based on NZIF and are 

setting science-based targets for assets that comprise the 

interim target.

NZAM Interim Target

In setting our interim target, we focused on investments 

where:

I. We have control and therefore sufficient influence 

over the outcomes; 

II. We could identify and implement actionable initiatives 

in the near term; and 

III. We assessed it to be value-accretive to do so over the 

life of the investment.

We are initially focusing our carbon reduction efforts on 

portfolio companies where we have a control position, as 

this is where we can exercise significant influence. 

Our interim target includes one-third of Brookfield’s AUM, 

however, as mentioned, our intention is to increase the 

proportion of assets to be managed in line with net zero 

annually or as frequently as possible, consistent with our 

ambition to reach 100% over time. In doing so, our focus 

is equally on operationalizing decarbonization.

Our Decarbonization Journey 
Is More Than Just Our NZAM Target

• Our net-zero ambition and our NZAM target are complementary

• Achieving net zero by 2050 or sooner is a global imperative and requires significant effort from companies, governments and individuals

• We have commenced our decarbonization journey to deliver on our net-zero ambition

• As our assets develop their decarbonization plans, more should progress towards or align to science-based pathways, enabling us to increase our NZAM target

• Today, assets within our NZAM target represent only a portion of these decarbonization plans; over time, however, they should converge

Measuring Our Progress Against the 
Achieving Net Zero Framework

We have focused on developing our Achieving Net-Zero 

Framework and are working towards assessment of the 

status of each of our portfolio companies against this 

framework. Of the businesses we have assessed, we have 

observed that the path to net zero may not always be linear 

or binary. Each of our portfolio companies are embarking 

on their individual journeys—commencing with measuring 

emissions, working to identify levers, and ultimately setting 

and implementing science-based targets. Going forward, 

for companies with which we exercise control and can 

therefore influence outcomes, we will aim to implement 

steps 1 through 3 under the Transition Plan Development 

phase within two to three years of acquisition, whereafter 

we will internally assess their readiness for inclusion in the 

NZAM interim target. 

In the meantime, key procedural programs set in place 

this year across our businesses are highlighted below:

• Increased engagement with portfolio companies 

across all business groups to support increased 

reporting of GHG emissions data. Engagement 

includes providing training and sharing of best 

practices on emissions measurement and reduction 

strategies with portfolio companies. 

• Each business group has implemented, or is working 

towards implementing, a requirement for each of 

their portfolio companies to develop five-year carbon 

forecasting plans and to start identifying carbon 

reduction opportunities.

Over the coming year, our focus will be on complet-

ing an assessment of our portfolio companies against 

the Achieving Net Zero Framework and reporting on 

those results. As well, we will help our portfolio companies 

advance their progress through the Framework. As we 

gain experience working with these businesses, we will look 

to formalize a consistent approach across all our assets. 

Our Emissions 

We have been measuring and tracking emissions across 

our business groups for several years. Our focus over 

the last three years has been on refining our approach 

to data collection. We have calculated our emissions

profile for each of our businesses—Renewable Power & 

Transition, Infrastructure, Private Equity and Real Estate. 

As mentioned earlier, the GHG Protocol and PCAF meth-

odology have informed our measurement approach. We 

have developed this data set utilizing the best information 

available and a bottom-up approach. We expect our infor-

mation on annual emissions to improve in the future as 

data quality and quantity increase. We will strive to report 

transparently on any adjustments that we may implement 

as we refine these emission disclosures and report on our 

progress against targets. 

Current year GHG emissions are 11.8 million mtC02e 

compared to base year emissions of 12.1 million mtC02e. 

The decrease of 0.3 million mtC02e is predominantly due 

to carbon reduction initiatives and a change in business 

activity following the global COVID pandemic. Total 

emissions for assets included in our NZAM commitment 

were 1.4 million mtC02e in 2022 compared to base year 

emissions of 1.7 million mtC02e.

1 Our GHG emissions calculation is guided by the principles of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard issued by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resource 
Institute.

2 Base year figures disclosed represent 2020 with the exception of Real Estate for which the base year is 2019. Base year emissions are recalculated where there are significant changes to the data, inventory boundary, 
methods, or any other relevant factors, which could be triggered by structural changes, changes in methodology and new or additional data.

3 Scope 2 emissions are a combination of location-based and market-based emissions.

4 Total emissions currently include Scope 1 and Scope 2. We intend to include material Scope 3 emissions at a future time when we are able to gather sufficiently high-quality data.

Putting Plans into Action

We have been focused on supporting our businesses on 

their decarbonization journey. The below are select case 

studies showcasing how our portfolio companies are 

evolving towards committing or aligning to net zero.

Driving Lowered Emissions Across  
Our North American Railroads

In 2018, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired its rail business, 

Genesee & Wyoming ("G&W"), which owns over 13,000 

miles of track across North America, providing a  

fuel-efficient form of surface transportation.

Over the last year, G&W took meaningful steps towards 

decarbonization and recently established a Paris- 

aligned net-zero target. In 2022, G&W submitted a 

decarbonization plan articulating an approximate 42% 

GHG emissions intensity reduction target by 2035 to the 

Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), which is currently 

under review.

In the meantime, the business has been actively executing 

its decarbonization initiatives. In 2022, G&W continued to 

upgrade its locomotive fleet with new purchases and 

conducted overhauls to increase emissions efficiency—it 

purchased 27 new locomotives and overhauled five 

locomotives. It enhanced its Automatic Engine Start/Stop 

(AESS) Systems and the Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) on 

more than 25% of its locomotive fleet. These improve-

ments reduced G&W’s North American locomotive fleet’s 

emissions intensity by approximately 4% compared to its 

2020 baseline. 

Facilitating Clean Energy Solutions 

Westinghouse is a global leader in providing mission 

critical technologies, products and services to the 

nuclear power industry. The business was acquired 

by Brookfield Private Equity in 2018 and in 2022 an 

agreement was reached for it to be sold to a strategic 

consortium led by Cameco Corporation and Brookfield 

Renewable Partners.

Nuclear is essential to the achievement of reliable, 

affordable and sustainable energy and will be needed 

to enable the global transition to net zero.1 As part of 

its longstanding support for global climate ambitions, 

in 2022 Westinghouse committed to achieving net-zero 

GHG emissions by 2050. Management is working to lay 

the foundation to identify an interim net-zero target by 

2024 and to develop certain site-specific energy reduction 

and climate action plans as part of the company's overall 

internal decarbonization strategy. In addition, in 2022 

Westinghouse initiated programs to evaluate energy use 

at key operating facilities to identify opportunities for 

efficiencies and operational improvements. 

Partnering to Support Climate Goals

In 2022, Brookfield Renewable formed a partnership with 

InterEnergy, a leading utility and independent power 

producer with operations in the Caribbean and Latin 

America. Brookfield Renewable aims to help InterEnergy 

accelerate its energy transition plan to a net-zero busi-

ness as well as support regional decarbonization through 

the planned buildout of significant renewable energy by 

2030. As part of the investment, InterEnergy has adopted 

interim and long-term targets aligned with the goals of the 

Paris Agreement. These are integrated into a Paris-aligned 

business plan that includes broader efforts to support 

delivery of the targets including the formation of a new 

sustainability committee. The committee has representa-

tion from both Brookfield Renewable and InterEnergy and 

regularly reviews progress against the carbon reduction 

targets and wider ESG initiatives.

Developing a Strong Emissions Baseline to Drive Reductions

In 2022, Brookfield Real Estate issued an Environmental 

and Climate Metrics Policy for its global real estate port-

folio. The policy requires Brookfield Real Estate portfolio 

companies to report GHG emissions data on an asset level 

basis, across Scope 1, Scope 2, and meaningful Scope 3 

sources. Guidance was developed to assist in interpret-

ing the policy and aligning business practices, ensuring 

portfolio managers were well equipped to collect, analyze, 

and subsequently submit their GHG emissions. Several 

advisors provided assistance on the implementation of 

the policy. The policy serves as an accountability mecha-

nism and enables Brookfield Real Estate to set targets and 

track decarbonization progress.

Having a solid baseline of emissions data has enabled 

several Brookfield Real Estate portfolio companies 

to significantly advance their net-zero strategies. For 

example, Brookfield’s U.S. office portfolio has com-

mitted to procuring 100% of its electricity from clean 

energy sources by 2026. The commitment to procure 

600,000 MWh of zero emissions electricity ensures that 

all the electricity procured will be sourced within the 

same power grid in which the electricity is used, further 

incentivizing the local development of new clean energy 

sources. Through this commitment, Brookfield expects 

to reduce its GHG emissions by 260,000 metrics tons 

each year, reflecting a decrease in emissions of ~60% 

from 2019 levels.

Brookfield Real Estate has also executed a programmat-

ic agreement with Brookfield Renewables to implement 

rooftop solar panels on select logistics facilities in the 

United States. The project leverages over 14 million sf 

of vacant rooftop space to install solar panels across an 

initial 34 assets, creating 250,000 MWh of annual energy 

production, which is expected to be sold to communi-

ty solar programs. We are evaluating the potential to 

direct a portion of the rooftop-generated energy for 

onsite use by tenants, contributing to Brookfield's and 

our tenants’ decarbonization goals. 

Several additional renewable energy procurement 

opportunities between Brookfield Real Estate and 

Brookfield Renewable are under development.

has committed to procuring 100% 
of its electricity from clean energy 
sources by 2026.

Brookfield Renewable Progressing  
Decarbonization Initiatives

In 2022, Brookfield Renewable worked with each of its 

regional businesses to continue to develop detailed 

decarbonization plans and execute emission reduc-

tion initiatives. Their emission reduction initiatives 

are tailored to the unique challenges of each region 

and business. These initiatives include:

• Purchasing renewable energy attributes to reduce 

Scope 2 market-based emissions to zero at its Canadi-

an regional business and at its Cork office.

• Reducing the emissions in their Chinese region-

al business through decreasing fugitive losses of 

sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) related to the operation of 

circuit breakers.

• Reducing their vehicle fleet in Brazil and, within 

Europe, making electric vehicles available for field 

employees in Saeta Yield and Sunovis.

• Implementing a new anti-freezing strategy at its con-

centrated solar power plants in Spain to reduce the 

fuel used during the winter months.

This year, Brookfield Renewable saw an 18%1 reduction 

from their base year emissions. While they have imple-

mented several initiatives to reduce their emissions in 

2022, emissions may fluctuate year on year in response 

to operating conditions and energy demand. This was the 

case for their facility in New York state, which increased 

generation in 2022 to provide power to the grid during 

peak load periods to meet higher energy demand, result-

ing in a marginal increase in their Scope 1 emissions.

Brookfield Renewable’s carbon intensity continued to decrease in 2022 by approximately 14% compared to 2021 and is 

over 148 times lower than the global average grid intensity.2

Our Corporate Operations Emissions

We acknowledge the importance of putting our corporate operations on a pathway to net zero, alongside the assets we 

oversee. Below is a summary of the GHG emissions from our corporate operations:

Brookfield's Scope 1 and 2 emission levels have remained relatively flat, despite growing the size of our business over the 

past year. We have observed a steady recovery of travel over the last years, in line with pre-COVID levels. Across our corpo-

rate operations, Brookfield’s most material emissions are from its sources of energy consumption (Scope 2) and business 

travel (Scope 3). To date, we have focused our efforts on lowering our firm’s emissions, including finding ways to power our 

office sites with clean energy. Over 80% of Brookfield’s employees are represented in office locations managed by Brook-

field Properties, which are included in our NZAM interim target. As a result, we expect that our emissions will be reduced 

by approximately two-thirds in the next seven years. 

Our focus for the next 12-18 months will be to define a net-zero plan for our corporate operations globally and in the 

meantime, continue our progress to minimize our current footprint.

Data Quality and  
Improvement Opportunities

We place priority on the source of our emissions data, 

leveraging information obtained directly from portfolio 

companies. Where we are not able to obtain information 

from our portfolio companies, we utilized proxy data 

based on similar assets within our own portfolio with 

emissions developed using a bottom-up approach; in 

other cases we may leverage emissions data from public 

sources based on companies of a similar profile.

Our focus over the next year is to continue rolling out 

our targeted engagement strategy, which includes prior-

itizing our highest emitting assets across Brookfield for 

decarbonization initiatives, as well as working with those 

companies that are currently in-scope under our interim 

net-zero target. In line with our continued improvement 

of GHG emissions, we plan to enhance our inventory of 

forecasted emissions, which also helps our portfolio com-

panies better understand the impact of their business 

operations and capital expenditure decisions. Leveraging 

the Achieving Net Zero Framework, we aim to assess 

how our portfolio companies are progressing across the 

Framework and, where applicable, help accelerate their 

progress and advance through the Framework over time. 

Additionally, while the bulk of our emissions lies in 

the portfolio companies we manage, we also intend to 

more formally review our corporate operations glob-

ally and continue our progress toward minimizing our 

carbon footprint.

Human Capital 
Development 
We value our people and support their long-term success by seeking 
opportunities for them to grow and develop professionally. This 
reinforces strong succession and ensures that we maintain an  
engaged workforce.

We support and develop our people leaders in these key areas:

Ensuring the mandate of a people leader is clear:  
We aim to provide a work environment that is conducive to 
learning and development and one in which people feel safe 
when stepping outside their comfort zone. This is critical to 
our success in developing our people.

Offering training that clarifies the leader’s role in creating 
an environment that supports the continued progression 
of their team members.

Providing feedback to our people leaders to enhance 
their development. 

Our employees drive our success and ensure that we deliver on our commitments to investors and other stakeholders. We 

seek to create a positive, open and inclusive work environment that enables employees to develop. 

Inclusive leadership and disciplined talent management processes are critical to our success. Inclusive leadership starts 

with a strong tone at the top. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Positive Work Environment Policy set a 

consistently high standard for how we are expected to interact and collaborate with one another and reinforce a work 

environment conducive to learning and development. 

Disciplined talent management processes support our people 
leaders and ensure these processes are equitable and focus on 
developing our people.

Recruitment
We proactively recruit people who are aligned with our 
culture and have the potential to develop within the 
Brookfield organization. This includes a focus on diverse 
representation of candidates in our recruitment process. 
Brookfield is committed to a hiring process that is fair, 
objective, equitable, non-discriminatory and in 
compliance with all applicable legislation and good 
governance. The following are key activities that have 
been instrumental in our progress: 

• Taking the time to ensure our candidate slates 
include qualified candidates that are diverse. This 
approach is embedded in how our internal and 
external recruitment teams conduct their searches.  

• Developing objective criteria for each role to 
evaluate all candidates. 

• Ensuring diverse representation within the 
Brookfield teams that interview candidates and 
ultimately make the hiring decisions.

We continue to add discipline to our process for assessing 

performance and potential. 

Brookfield provides performance criteria for virtually all roles. 

These criteria clearly define what good performance entails 

and enable objective and consistent assessments across 

Brookfield. They also clarify the key indicators required for 

promotion to the next level. 

We provide annual training for people leaders on how to 

assess their team members, mitigate the impact of bias in their 

assessments and provide constructive feedback that is clear and 

focused on development. Within certain businesses, and where 

we feel it is appropriate, an impartial observer may sit in to chal-

lenge any unconscious bias in their assessment of performance. 

All people leaders conduct annual performance reviews with 

their team members, providing an opportunity to discuss 

feedback on prior year performance, while allowing the 

opportunity to set priorities for the upcoming year.   

Note: All promotions were awarded in February 2023.

The combination of recruiting the right people and the discipline 

in our performance assessment process is a key factor in our 

ability to develop our people and retain strong performers. Our 

grow-from-within talent strategy prioritizes internal mobility to 

provide opportunities to expand professional experience and 

enhance collaboration across the business. This includes transfers 

between geographies, business groups, functions and to or from 

portfolio companies. 

Over the last five years, we have more than doubled our employee 

population, which means we have many people in new roles. An 

additional 7% of the average employee headcount has taken on 

new opportunities under our internal mobility program and over 

50% of those opportunities were provided to females in 2022. In 

recent years, we launched a number of new businesses, including 

the Insurance Solutions and Transition businesses, which has led 

to a large number of opportunities to transfer people between 

business groups.  

We continue to benefit from strong 
retention. Our Managing Partners 
have worked together for 13 years 
on average and our senior leadership 
team has more than 21 years of 
experience working together.

People Development 

We seek to provide a working environment that fosters 

collaboration and continuous development for our peo-

ple. All our offices globally are intentionally designed as 

open-concept to allow for discussions between all levels 

of employees. We pride ourselves on a working environ-

ment that allows people to learn everyday.  

We provide formal training on a wide range of topics, 

depending on function and level of development. Train-

ing topics include manager and leadership training, 

compliance topics, anti-bribery and corruption, cyber-

security, harassment prevention, positive work envi-

ronment policy and more. We also provide job related 

technical training to maintain or upskill our employees’ 

knowledge. Some examples of these trainings include 

presentation and business writing skills, negotiation 

workshops, and Excel and PowerPoint workshops, to 

name a few. 

Another important element of our organization’s 

culture is a strong team environment. Each business 

group and function facilitate periodic retreats, offering 

the opportunity for employees to network with team 

members, attend educational sessions and participate 

in team building activities.

Employee Engagement  

We encourage and welcome employee feedback. 

We connect with our employees in a variety of ways, 

including direct engagement, events and employee sat-

isfaction surveys. The purpose of these engagements 

is to share context, receive constructive feedback 

from employees and identify measures to improve our 

employees’ experiences. Employees also have the 

opportunity to engage with leadership through town 

halls, which we hold in each region.  

Brookfield’s employee engagement survey focuses on 

the following: 

• Overall Employee Engagement: The extent to which 

employees are motivated to contribute to organiza-

tional success. 

• Job Enablement: To gauge if employees feel ade-

quately supported to perform their roles. 

• Manager Effectiveness: Feedback on how the manag-

er is perceived to manage both people and their work 

and the impact this has on engagement. 

• Inclusion: How much people feel that their ideas, 

opinions and perspectives are valued and that they 

are treated with respect. 

All employees that have been with Brookfield for over six 

months are invited to participate in this survey, with our 

last survey having a response rate of over 80%. Survey 

results are disseminated by business group, function and 

geography and action plans are developed as appropriate.

Benefits and Employee Well-Being 

The health and well-being of employees is vital to our 

success. Brookfield provides a comprehensive benefits 

package for all our employees. The benefits vary by 

location based on local market practice for each location 

in which we operate. The plans are broadly consistent 

across all employees (there is no separate executive 

plan). These benefits include health benefits, life and 

disability insurance, retirement savings contribution, 

parental leave and an employee wellness program, to 

name a few.

Building a 
Diverse and 
Inclusive 
Environment  
Building a diverse, equitable and inclu-
sive work environment reinforces our 
culture of collaboration and strengthens 
our ability to develop and promote all of 
our people to their potential. 

Our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion is deliber-

ate and integrated into our human capital development 

processes and initiatives. 

Over the past five years, our primary focus has been on 

gender diversity. Our efforts led to a significant increase 

in female representation at the senior levels. We have 

more than doubled our employee population and signifi-

cantly increased our female representation at the most 

senior level of the organization during this period—Man-

aging Partner/Managing Director female representation 

increased from 10% to 19%. In addition, Senior Vice Pres-

ident representation increased from 17% to 32% during 

this time. The discipline embedded into our recruiting 

and performance management processes has been 

instrumental in this progress. 

In addition to disciplined human capital processes and the 

aforementioned development activities, we undertake other 

activities to reinforce the importance of diversity, equity and 

inclusion in our business: 

• We continue our global process for employees to 

self-identify their ethnicity. This information assists 

us in identifying specific areas of focus related to 

increasing ethnic diversity. Our overall response rate 

was 93%.

• Our succession process includes identifying a diverse 

slate of candidates and focusing on the development 

of early career candidates through stretch roles and 

exposure.  

• We support a number of Employee Resource Groups 

organized by employees around shared interests, char-

acteristics or experiences. We established a structure 

for each of these groups to ensure the mandate is clear, 

aligned with our values, appropriately supported by the 

organization, and provides opportunities to demon-

strate leadership, develop relationships and collaborate. 

• We are involved with several organizations to promote 

diverse representation in our talent pool, including 

summer interns and MBA Associates. We hope these 

opportunities will promote the development of ethni-

cally diverse groups in the private equity industry.

Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion in Action 
at Our Portfolio 
Companies 
Fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce is an important priority 
across our portfolio companies. We have many programs in place to 
support this initiative.

• Our Colombian natural gas distribution operation, 

Vanti, partnered with a public education institute, 

SENA, to create a training program for women 

focused on improving their access to traditional-

ly male-dominated roles in the field. The program 

offered training to nearly 50 female participants, who 

are on track to complete approximately 2,200 hours 

of theoretical and practical education. Participants 

receive support payments to increase the accessibility 

of the program.  

• Elera, our Brazilian renewables operations, worked 

with an external human resources consulting firm to 

create a “Women in Leadership” program for its Rio 

de Janeiro office. The program includes workshops, 

individual and group coaching, and specialized indi-

vidual plans, all focused on supporting the careers 

and progress of Elera’s female workforce. 

• In 2022, Tegra, a Brazilian homebuilding company, 

created the “Muheres Integradas,” an initiative that 

provides an electrical and NR-10 training course for 

women in vulnerable situations. The aim of the pro-

gram is to increase the program participants' employ-

ability who are often hired at Tegra’s construction 

sites and partner companies. Through the program’s 

pilot course, Tegra hosted 16 Venezuelan refugees 

who successfully completed the program.  

• Brookfield Real Estate’s goal is to develop properties 

that enhance the fabric of our communities. India’s 

population includes a relatively high rate of people with 

disabilities, and this number is expected to rise in years 

to come. Brookfield Properties in India committed to 

making their assets universally accessible, and have incor-

porated the following universal design interventions:  

 − Preferred parking spaces that enable easier 

entrance access and automatic entrance doors  

 − Tactile indicators from the asset entrances to des-

ignated elevators 

 − Non-slip ramps with handrails  

 − Braille and audio assistance in elevators; elevator 

controls at accessible height  

• TDF, our French Telecom business, sponsored ARPEJEH, 

an association active in finding jobs for students with 

disabilities. TDF took part in several programs, including 

the Disabled Jobs Forum and the European Disabled 

Employment Week, to help disabled people throughout 

the recruitment and training process. It also made a 

commitment to job retention of disabled employees.

Employee Resource Groups

Brookfield has employee resource groups that reinforce 

an inclusive workplace and sense of community, provide 

volunteer and networking opportunities and share best 

practices globally. These groups are grounds-up initia-

tives—organized regionally by employees based on their 

shared interests, characteristics or experiences in each 

office, and represent perspectives of a globally diversified 

employee base. Each group has a mandate that is clear, 

aligned with our values, appropriately supported by the 

organization and provides opportunities to demonstrate 

leadership, develop relationships and collaborate. 

All employees, whether they identify with a specific 

resource group or not, are welcome to join any group of 

their interest. We have a few employee resource groups 

that are consistent across the globe including the Brook-

field Women’s Network, Brookfield Cares and Brookfield 

(bNext), as described below. Where it relates to other 

elements of diversity, some offices have organized 

groups that promote diversity in different ways that best 

supports the employee composition of the region. As an 

example, our larger U.S. offices have groups to support 

its diverse employee base, including Brookfield Pride 

and Brookfield Asian Professionals, to name a few, while 

offices in other regions have chosen to combine interests 

under broader diversity groups. Some of our employee 

resource groups include:

• Brookfield Women’s Network: provides learning 

and networking opportunities, and a community to 

share ideas and best practices, for women in various 

roles and at all levels of the company, across Brook-

field’s business groups. We have a chapter of the 

Women’s Network in each of our large offices globally.

• Brookfield Pride Network: focuses on fostering a 

culture of inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees, providing 

support and a sense of community for employees 

and allies while empowering employees to bring their 

whole selves to work.

• Brookfield (bNEXT): brings together colleagues in the 

early stages of their careers who want to engage with 

and learn from each other. This group was initiated 

in our U.S. offices and other regions are considering 

adopting a similar program.

• Brookfield Asian Professionals Network: serves as 

an employee resource group, led by our people in 

our U.S. offices, for employees and allies of the 

Asian American and Pacific Islander communities 

and aims to enhance the awareness and inclusive-

ness of our workforce.

• Brookfield Black Professionals Network: is a U.S.-

led employee initiative that focuses on attracting and 

retaining Black professionals and aims to enhance the 

awareness and inclusiveness of our workforce, while 

providing a forum for employees to share and learn 

from the experience of others.

• Brookfield Cares: is the corporate philanthropic pro-

gram for Brookfield employees. Philanthropic activities 

are an important aspect of employee engagement; 

they enable our employees to build meaningful rela-

tionships, foster personal growth and benefit from the 

communities in which we operate. Our global matching 

program allows employees to donate to a not-for-

profit of their choice and Brookfield will match their 

donation. In addition, each office supports the causes 

that are most important to our people.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Partnerships

Brookfield is involved with several organizations to support our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. To highlight, Brookfield has been active in the following 
programs supporting the development of a strong and diverse talent pool.

SEO Alternative Investments 
Our partnership with SEO began in 2018 and provides us with access 

to a diverse set of individuals who are provided mentorship and career 

opportunities, creating a pipeline of diverse candidates, with the aim 

of increasing diversity in the alternatives space. 

Over the past five years, Brookfield has hired nine interns through 

SEO, 67% of whom have become full-time hires.  

Girls Who Invest & Women in 
Asset Management (WAM) Program 
In 2022, Brookfield developed a partnership with Girls Who Invest, 

which provides paid internship opportunities to primarily female and 

ethnically diverse college sophomores at a leading investment firm. 

Last summer, Brookfield hosted four interns on our investment teams 

across Private Equity and Real Estate. Brookfield has expanded the 

program to our Infrastructure, Public Securities Group and Brookfield 

Hedge Solutions investment teams for Summer 2023.  

Brookfield has partnered with leading Canadian business schools 

to provide a paid summer internship through the Women in Asset 

Management program. This program is geared towards investing in a 

future pipeline of young female professionals in the asset management 

industry in Canada. The summer program includes a four-week class-

room experience to provide interns the opportunities to learn technical 

and soft skills that can be incorporated in the work environment.  

Brookfield hosted its first intern in 2022 within the Infrastructure group. 

The program saw great success—the intern took a gap year between her 

third and fourth year in school to complete a one-year contract with the 

same team. Following this success, Brookfield has expanded the program 

in the current year and is expecting to take on two interns.  

MBA Associate Program 
Over the years, Brookfield has partnered with leading business schools 

to host MBA summer associates through our MBA Associate Program. 

We engage with the diversity resource groups within the universities to 

promote our program and encourage a diverse slate of candidates.  

In 2019, Brookfield hosted two associates who both received full-time 

employment offers at the end of the program. We have since expand-

ed the program and in 2022, we had 12 associates across Infrastruc-

ture, Private Equity and Real Estate in various regions, including 

Toronto, New York, Houston and London.  

Of the 12 associates we hosted this year, more than 50% are women 

or part of an ethnically diverse group, of whom 8 (75%) have become 

full-time hires.    

All Stars Project (ASP) Development 
School for Youth 

Brookfield has partnered over the past few summers with The All Stars 

Project (ASP), a 40-year-old national nonprofit organization whose 

mission is to transform the lives of youth and poor communities, using 

the developmental power of performance, in partnership with caring 

adults. ASP reaches over 10,000 inner-city youth and their families with 

free development programs every year. 

Brookfield helps to facilitate ASP’s Development School for Youth 

(DSY), where young people ages 16-21 partner with corporate leaders 

and learn to perform as business professionals through paid summer 

internships at their companies.

The Brookfield Women’s Network (BWN) is dedicated to attracting, developing, and 
motivating a community of women across Brookfield’s business groups. It aims to en-
gage and inspire employees with initiatives that support career growth and leadership. 
Its areas of focus include professional development, mentorship, networking, business 
and industry education and philanthropy. The BWN has ten regional chapters across 
Brookfield’s global offices in 2022 that coordinated on themes and best practices. 

In 2022, BWN fostered professional development globally through its mentorship program for developing specific skills; a 

business school-style negotiation workshop; small group workshops on confidence building, personal finance, influencing 

others and a more extensive workshop on identifying and leveraging professional strengths to complement teams.  

BWN offers exposure to leaders and networking through a senior speaker series, its new hire welcome program, its Moms’ 

Group and events with peer firms and portfolio companies. Past speaker events include fireside chats with the female directors 

from our Board, with each speaker sharing insights on her career and strategies for female advancement in the workplace. 

BWN focused on volunteerism and charitable giving by providing interview preparation coaching for women experiencing 

homelessness, partnering with Oasis for Girls to offer a career day for young women of color from under-resourced com-

munities and serving meals to individuals experiencing homelessness.

Pay Equity

Brookfield believes that all employees should be treat-

ed equitably and seeks to ensure that the appropriate 

processes are in place to support this priority as it relates 

to compensation of its people. Brookfield prohibits pay 

discrimination on the basis of gender and any other class 

protected under federal, state and local law. This applies 

to employees in the same work location who perform sub-

stantially equal work that requires substantially an equal 

skill set, effort and responsibility and is performed under 

similar working conditions. In such cases, employees 

should be paid at the same rate regardless of their gender 

or status within a protected class, except where differenc-

es in pay are based on a factor other than an employee’s 

gender or status within a protected class, including (but 

not limited to) seniority, merit, and past work experience.

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety 
Managing health and safety risk is an 
integral part of the management of our 
business and the portfolio companies in 
which we invest. 

We have implemented a health and safety governance 

initiative to propagate a strong health and safety culture, 

encourage the sharing of best practices, support the 

continuous improvement of safety performance and help 

eliminate serious safety incidents. The initiative is overseen 

by the Safety Leadership Committee, which comprises 

senior operations executives from across our business 

groups and regions. Reports on health and safety trends 

and key initiatives are provided to the Board as part of the 

quarterly operational risk update. 

Our goal is to have zero serious safety incidents. 

Health and Safety Principles 

To achieve this goal, Brookfield has adopted a common 

set of health and safety principles, which guide the health 

and safety practices of our portfolio companies:  

• Senior executives are accountable for the health and 

safety of their individual businesses. 

• Systems are tailored to company-specific risks and 

integrated into the management of the business. 

• Performance is measured and systems are reviewed 

regularly to identify areas for improvement. 

• Policies and procedures apply to employees, 

contractors and subcontractors, and take into  

consideration the protection of the public in general. 

• Training programs ensure that employees have 

the necessary skills to conduct their work safely 

and efficiently.

• If a serious safety incident occurs, senior leadership 

of the individual business conduct an in-depth inves-

tigation to determine root causes and formulate 

remediation actions. 

• Transparency and learning from experience and 

sharing best practices are promoted to continuously 

improve systems and performance. 

Health and Safety at 
Our Portfolio Companies 

Portfolio company management is responsible for ensur-

ing that their company’s health and safety policies and 

systems are developed, operationalized, and reviewed 

regularly to address their specific risk areas. Portfolio 

company CEOs report to their respective board of direc-

tors on safety performance, incidents, and the status of 

improvement initiatives. 

Examples of portfolio company health and safety initia-

tives and key practices include: 

• Workshops on hazard and risk identification and 

assessment processes. 

~2.7M
hours of occupational health and safety training 
completed across Brookfield’s portfolio companies

• Training on job planning procedures and use of per-

sonal protective and other safety equipment. 

• The ability of workers to “stop work” on a site, if there 

are any health and safety concerns. 

• Reporting hotlines that allow for anonymous 

reporting of health and safety concerns. 

• Joint health and safety committees, where workers 

provide input on health and safety programs. 

• Access to resources and assistance related to 

mental health. 

• Leveraging technology to improve safety.

Let’s Save Lives 
Hackathon   
As part of Brookfield’s IT Talent Development Program, in 2022, we 

hosted the Let’s Save Lives Hackathon event. Hackathon events allow 

high-performing technical talents to originate innovative solutions for 

worthy causes like Health and Safety.

2 0 2 2  S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  R E P O R T

B R O O K F I E L D  C O R P O R A T I O N

The hackathon in 2022 was targeted to develop ideas around supporting our objec-
tive of having zero serious safety incidents. The participants proposed applying data 
analytics to predict and prevent potential incidents accurately by: 

• Identifying the root causes of high-risk incidents that cause fatalities and injuries. 

• Preventing and proactively addressing the root causes of high-risk incidents to reduce fatalities and injuries.  

• Using natural language AI and search to automate tracking and reporting of related safety activities and incidents. 

• Applying visual monitoring solutions to enforce correct safety practices and personal protection equipment in real time. 

The participants observed that traditional approaches to safety often involve putting a physical barrier between the worker 

and the hazard, which can slow down productivity. The participants presented several new approaches to safety, which 

include the adoption of new safety technologies as outlined below. 

• Wearable Technology: Technology-enhanced PPE with the Internet of Things (IoT) enables continuous monitoring and 

alerts. 

• Better Training: Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) assisted training.  

• Worksite Automation: Technology solutions to help workers with challenging, dangerous, or repetitive tasks, such as 

collaborative robots (cobots).

• Smart CCTV: Identify potential hazards, check and continuously monitor PPE and safety-practice compliance, raise alerts to 

dispatch emergency response, etc. 

The participants of the hackathon will continue to collaborate on safety innovations from the proposed solutions to 

build a one-prototype solution for all Brookfield portfolio companies to leverage in 2023. We plan to continue the 

Hackathon event in 2023 with the Let’s Save the Planet Hackathon to drive and support Brookfield’s net-zero efforts.

Local 
Communities 
We are dedicated to engaging with and 
providing value to the communities in 
which we operate. We proactively engage 
with communities and strive to create 
shared value. We believe having  
transparent and well-established rela-
tionships with communities and other 
local stakeholders is key to successfully 
developing and operating our facilities. 

Stakeholders can include communities, landowners, busi-

ness owners, municipalities, NGOs or others potentially af-

fected by or interested in our operations. We seek to work 

with local stakeholders to ensure that their interests and 

safety are appropriately integrated into our decision-mak-

ing, developments and operations.  

We help support local communities in key areas, such as 

economic development, education, health and well-being. 

We foster open dialogue, striving to create an environment 

where community members feel comfortable expressing 

their needs and expectations, working to incorporate com-

munity feedback into our business practices.  

We recognize the importance of developing and main-

taining strong relationships with Indigenous communities 

and respect that each Indigenous community has its own 

distinctive culture, traditions, values and aspirations. We 

value consultation and communication with Indigenous 

peoples regarding project development and operations.  

Employees serve local communities through volunteer 

work. These volunteering efforts reflect our employees’ 

dedication to supporting positive, sustainable change in 

the communities in which we operate. In 2022, Brookfield 

contributed approximately ~10,800 volunteer hours across 

its offices to support communities and encourage strong 

relationships with organizations around the world.

Our French Telecom Infrastructure business, TDF, recently implemented a “Pass 
Fiber” training program to provide training to unemployed community members to 
improve their job prospects as technicians. The training program allows job seekers 
to try a fiber technician job for a day. This involves work site visits and workshops 
on cable pulling and fiber soldering, giving real-time education on what a job as a  
technician entails. Following the training program, TDF’s suppliers can engage with 
TDF to staff their own teams.

Changing Local 
Communities with 
Renewable Power: 
Standard Solar’s 
Skyward Project

In keeping with Brookfield’s dedication to engaging with and providing value to the 
communities in which we operate, Brookfield Renewable’s portfolio company, Stan-
dard Solar, funds projects making it possible for individuals, government entities, 
schools, businesses and more to purchase renewable solar energy generated in 
their community. Standard Solar is one of the leading solar and storage developers 
in the United States. 

In 2022, Standard Solar completed Skyward Community Solar, its first community solar project in Oregon, which will 

generate 3.6M kWh of clean energy annually, replacing fossil fuel and reducing emissions and pollution across the 

community. The Skyward Project established Standard Solar’s footprint in Oregon, which requires 50% of electricity from 

renewable sources by 2040. 

Subscribers receive a contracted monthly discount on electric bills and Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) proportional to 

their share of the project’s energy generation. 10% of Skyward generation is allocated to qualified low- and moderate-income 

households, resulting in a substantial discount on their electric bills. Additionally, it provides 25 commercial entities, such as 

Microsoft, Kaiser and Nike, with access to renewable power. The Skyward Project expands the vision for a sustainable future 

by achieving environmental goals while supporting low-income residences with clean, affordable energy.

Corporate 
Governance 
and Ethics 
Strong governance is essential to sus-
tainable business operations and we aim 
to conduct our business according to the 
highest ethical and legal standards.   
 

Our governance practices are the foundation upon which 

we operate our business. We continue to adapt and en-

hance our policies to meet evolving standards and regula-

tions in our industry, including legislation, guidelines and 

practices in all jurisdictions in which we operate.  

Key regulations include the E.U. Sustainable Finance 

Disclosure Regulation, E.U. Taxonomy Regulation and U.K. 

TCFD; key reporting standards and frameworks include 

the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) 

Sustainability Reporting Standards. We seek to continu-

ously improve and refine our processes by actively partic-

ipating in the development and implementation of new 

industry standards and best practices. 

Our corporate governance policies and practices are 

comprehensive and consistent with the guidelines for 

improved corporate governance in Canada adopted by 

the Canadian Securities Administrators and the Toronto 

Stock Exchange, as well as the requirements of the U.S. 

Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock 

Exchange, and the applicable provisions under the U.S. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We continuously assess our 

governance practices and disclosures with specific atten-

tion to evolving Canadian and U.S. guidelines, as well as 

developments in other jurisdictions in which we operate.

Brookfield is committed to conducting its business activ-

ities with honesty and integrity, and in compliance with 

applicable legal and regulatory requirements. During 

2022, we further developed our vendor management pro-

gram, including adopting a Vendor Code of Conduct that 

sets out our expectations of vendors that provide goods 

or services to Brookfield, including, where applicable, to 

have the necessary policies and procedures in place to 

support such commitments within their supply chain.  

The following policies provide guidance for vendor 

engagements, to the extent applicable: 

• Anti-bribery and corruption  

• Data protection 

• Enterprise information security 

• Anti-money laundering and trade sanctions 

• Anti-slavery and human trafficking 

In 2022, 100% of our controlled 
portfolio companies had an  
Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Policy and a Code of Conduct.

Business 
Ethics 
Strong ethical practices are core to our 
operating philosophy. Honesty, integrity 
and respect are important elements of 
our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
(Code of Conduct). 
 

We conduct our activities to comply with all applicable 

legal and regulatory requirements, and in accordance with 

our Code of Conduct. Our Code of Conduct applies to all 

Brookfield directors, officers, employees and temporary 

workers, wholly owned subsidiaries, and certain publicly- 

traded controlled affiliates who have not adopted their 

own Code of Conduct or other policies that are consistent 

with the provisions of Brookfield’s Code of Conduct. 

Our Code of Conduct outlines expectations with respect to: 

• Acting responsibly in our dealings with stakeholders; 

• Protecting the Firm’s assets, resources and data; 

• Managing conflicts of interest; 

• Providing a positive work environment for our employees; 

• Ensuring accuracy of books and records and public 

disclosures; and 

• Complying with laws, rules, regulations and 

internal policies. 

The Board annually reviews the Code of Conduct and 

considers any necessary changes in the firm’s standards 

and practices. 

Brookfield is committed to an environment where open 

and honest communications are the expectation, not 

the exception. A significant component of fostering a 

positive work environment is ensuring multiple means 

by which employees are able to raise concerns both 

informally (by fostering a culture of respect, openness 

and collaboration), and formally (through an ethics 

hotline that permits anonymous reporting). Our Whis-

tleblowing Program encourages employees to raise 

concerns as soon as possible and to feel safe in doing so.  

We have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery, including 

facilitation payments. We mandate that all Brookfield 

employees complete annual anti-bribery and corruption 

(ABC) training and certify their compliance with our ABC 

Policy. In addition, ABC considerations are integrated 

into our investment due diligence and onboarding pro-

cesses, as outlined in our ABC Program.  

Our ethics hotline, managed by an independent third 

party, is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to 

facilitate the anonymous reporting of suspected unethical, 

illegal or unsafe behavior.  

In addition to Brookfield’s ethics hotline, we require 

all portfolio companies in which we have a controlling 

interest to adopt an appropriate Code of Conduct. We 

also require portfolio companies to implement an ethics 

hotline that is accessible to full-time employees, contrac-

tors and temporary workers, typically within six months 

of acquisition. In addition to the ongoing and timely 

independent review of employee reports, any signifi-

cant hotline reports are reported to Brookfield’s senior 

management and relevant committees of the Board on a 

quarterly basis at a minimum.

Human 
Rights and 
Modern 
Slavery
We are committed to conducting business in an ethical 

and responsible manner, including by carrying out our 

activities in a manner that respects and supports the 

protection of human rights, including but not limited to:  

• operating with leading health and safety practices to 

support the goal of zero serious safety incidents;  

• striving to ensure that the interests, safety and 

well-being of the communities in which we operate 

are integrated into our business decisions;  

• the elimination of discrimination in employment;  

• the prohibition of child and forced labor; and  

• the eradication of harassment and physical or mental 

abuse in the workplace.  

We strive to embed these standards into our core busi-

ness activities, including training, communications, con-

tracts and due diligence processes set out in our ESG Due 

Diligence Protocol and Vendor Management Program.  

Integrity, fairness and respect are hallmarks of our cul-

ture, including by carrying out our activities in a manner 

that respects and supports the protection of human 

rights. We seek to eliminate discrimination in employ-

ment, prohibit modern slavery, including child and forced 

labor, and eradicate harassment and physical or mental 

abuse in the workplace. Our Modern Slavery Policy aims 

to codify our approach to minimizing the risk of modern 

slavery within our business and supply chain. We also have 

specific tools and processes aimed at identifying human 

rights and modern slavery as part of due diligence for new 

investments and which include risk assessments, reme-

dies, training and governance.  

In addition, the policy consolidates the relevant commit-

ments set out in Brookfield’s Code of Conduct, ESG Policy, 

financial crimes policies, and Whistleblowing Policy. 

We also have several other policies and procedures that 

provide guidance on the identification of human rights and 

modern slavery risks and the steps to be taken to mitigate 

these risks. These include:  

• Code of Conduct 

• Vendor Management Program, including the 

Vendor Code of Conduct 

• ESG Due Diligence Protocol

• Anti-Money Laundering and Trade Sanctions Policy 

• Whistleblowing Program 

Our portfolio companies’ senior management teams are 

each responsible for identifying and managing the human 

rights risks, including modern slavery, for their individual 

businesses. We also added a separate human rights and 

modern slavery risk assessment to our ESG investment 

due diligence process, with the objective of mitigating the 

risks of modern slavery and human rights violations for 

potential investments, including in supply chains. Where 

required, we perform deeper due diligence, working with 

internal experts and third-party consultants as needed.  

All employees receive modern slavery training as part of the 

onboarding process and access ongoing training, as neces-

sary. Additional training relevant to applicable regions and 

roles, particularly in higher-risk functions such as procure-

ment is provided. We also encourage employees, suppliers 

and business partners to report concerns in accordance 

with our Whistleblowing Policy. We are cognizant of the fact 

that the risks of human rights, modern slavery and human 

trafficking are complex and evolving, and we will continue to 

work on addressing these risks in our business.  

The U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Australian 

Modern Slavery Act 2018 (together the “MSA”) require 

certain Brookfield entities to publish the steps taken to 

identify and mitigate the risks of slavery and trafficking in 

their business and supply chains in the U.K. and Australia 

(as appropriate). In accordance with the MSA, an annual 

statement is made publicly available on our website.

Human Rights and 
Modern Slavery: 
Brookfield Private Equity’s 
Cupa Group’s Approach 
to Human Rights 

Brookfield is committed to conducting business in an ethical and responsible man-
ner, including by carrying out our activities in a manner that respects and supports 
the protection of human rights. Brookfield Private Equity invested in Cupa Group 
(“Cupa”), the world’s largest producer of natural slate roofing tiles. Cupa holds 
meaningful reserves of natural slate, with operations in nine countries and 25 
quarries under long-term contracts. The company exports to more than 70 countries 
on five continents, employing over 2,200 people. 

EcoVadis awarded Cupa its Gold Medal in 2022 for the integration of ESG principles into its production processes and 

business management. It is in the top 5% of over 100,000 companies evaluated by EcoVadis globally and the top 4% of 

organizations in the mining sector, which includes stone, sand and clay extraction. This rating covers Environmental, 

Labor and Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement impacts.  

EcoVadis recognized Cupa for its progress in supply chain management, specifically sustainable procurement. Cupa has 

a Human Rights Policy designed in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor 

Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the U.N. Global Compact, and the U.N. Guiding 

Principles on Business and Human Rights. The Policy defines Cupa’s principles to ensure due diligence on human rights 

matters. This commitment goes beyond Cupa’s treatment of its direct employees; it includes those who collaborate 

along Cupa’s value chain and the communities where Cupa operates.

Responsible 
Contracting 
Brookfield continuously strives to achieve excellence 

with respect to our contracting practices because we 

believe that adequately compensated and trained work-

ers, operating in fair working conditions deliver high-quality 

products and services.  

Our business groups’ responsible contractor policies 

outline the procedures and requirements for selecting 

contractors and subcontractors (collectively, “contractors”) 

for required services, including construction, repair and 

maintenance projects at our portfolio companies. Con-

trolled portfolio companies are expected to select contrac-

tors in accordance with the following principles: 

• Demonstrated skill, experience, dependability and 

cost, with a safety record that is appropriate for the 

relevant project. 

• Provision of fair wages and fair benefits in the context 

of local market factors. 

• Observance of all local, state and national laws includ-

ing, but not limited to, those pertaining to withholding 

taxes, minimum wage, labor relations, insurance, 

health and occupational safety. 

• Provision of training, as necessary, to ensure that 

contractors’ personnel have the required skills and 

certifications to perform the assigned work. 

• Maintenance of a workplace health and safety pro-

gram that meets or exceeds applicable regulation. 

• Provision of a tolerant work environment free from 

discrimination and harassment, and fully inclusive of 

women and minorities. 

• Avoidance of discrimination against unionized contractors. 

The accountability and responsibility for these principles 

extends to individuals across Brookfield who are involved 

in the management of controlled portfolio companies that 

engage contractors.

Executive 
Compensation 
Brookfield’s approach to executive compensation is designed 

to reinforce long-term stewardship of the business in line with 

our goal of creating exceptional value for our shareholders 

and investors. The majority of our executives’ total compensa-

tion is awarded in the form of long-term compensation, which 

vests over a five-year period in arrears. This practice supports 

a strong alignment of interests between management and 

investors. The Board-level Management Resources and Com-

pensation Committee oversees risks related to Brookfield’s 

management resource planning. Since 2012, Brookfield has 

asked shareholders to cast an advisory vote on the Firm’s 

approach to executive compensation on an annual basis (a 

“Say-on-Pay” resolution), the results of which the Board and the 

Management Resources and Compensation Committee consid-

er when reviewing compensation policies and procedures, and 

when making decisions. Our executive compensation program 

is designed to reward only consistent performance over the 

long term.

Data Privacy 
and Security  
We have a responsibility to our stake-
holders to protect their personal data. 
 
Data Privacy 

Brookfield’s data protocols comply with all local and 

national regulatory requirements, including the European 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Cali-

fornia Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), the requirements 

of which are included in our global data protection policy.  

Our data protection and cybersecurity due diligence checklist 

ensures that our management of personal information com-

plies with legal and regulatory requirements. The checklist 

includes due diligence markers that seek to ensure fair pro-

cessing, international transfers, data processors and security 

measures to mitigate a possible personal data breach. 

Employee Awareness 

Employees are required to attend regular data protection 

awareness training, which covers: 

• The type of information Brookfield possesses; 

• The importance of using—and retaining—this infor-

mation only for the business purpose intended; and 

• How to secure this information.  

Brookfield employees are required to comply with all 

applicable data protection and privacy laws. An incident 

of employee non-compliance with our policy or unautho-

rized use or disclosure of confidential information may 

result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termina-

tion of employment. 

Cybersecurity 

Our data security program, overseen by our Chief Infor-

mation Security Officer seeks to ensure the security of 

both Brookfield’s data and that of our shareholders and 

other stakeholders. Our policies and procedures cover 

topics including security governance, security awareness, 

employee training, relevant access and end-point security, 

vulnerability management, penetration testing, security 

monitoring and incident response.  

Our Security Governance Committee oversees our cyber-

security functions and ensures that our program aligns 

with industry best practices and meets a high standard 

across all our businesses. We use automated technologies 

to optimize our security risk detection and response capa-

bilities, in addition to access controls and anti-malware 

protections.  

Our auditing and cybersecurity practices align with the 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 

Cybersecurity Framework. We review and update our 

cybersecurity program annually and conduct regular 

external-party assessments of our program maturity 

based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. We also 

regularly engage with third-party assessors to evaluate 

the strength of our program through penetration and/

or ethical hacking exercises. All employees regularly 

undergo mandatory continuing cybersecurity training. 

Employees in higher-risk functions receive additional 

training and cybersecurity awareness education. Audits, 

cybersecurity simulations and employee testing results 

indicate that our program is effective in protecting our 

stakeholders’ information.  

In 2022, we undertook initiatives to further enhance 

our data protection and threat-intelligence capabilities, 

and to improve our processes for third-party risk man-

agement. Finally, in addition to continued mandatory 

cybersecurity education for all employees, we enhanced 

our phishing simulations to include more advanced sim-

ulations and social engineering.

We believe GRI and SASB provide best-practice guidance 

on ESG disclosures that are most meaningful for our 

business to communicate and demonstrate accountabil-

ity for sustainability matters affecting Brookfield’s oper-

ations and our potential positive and negative impacts 

on the economy, environment and people, including 

impacts on their human rights. In addition, this report 

contains our inaugural disclosures consistent with the 

TCFD’s 11 recommendations. We continue to review our 

annual reporting and disclosures and will aim to make 

improvements in line with evolving best practices to offer 

greater transparency on our programs and performance. 

Throughout this report, we may refer to the term "material" 

and define it as something that may have a direct, 

substantial impact on the ability to create or preserve 

economic, environmental and/or social value for our 

businesses and their stakeholders.1

Materiality Assessment Methodology 

Brookfield is a global business, operating across diverse 

industries and sectors. As a result, some material topics 

are more relevant to certain business groups than oth-

ers. We conducted a materiality assessment leveraging 

feedback from our business groups, leaders across the 

organization, investors and other external experts. We 

recognize that the impacts of Brookfield’s corporate 

operations are comparatively minimal relative to those 

of our portfolio companies within each business group. 

Therefore, we aim to include topics relevant to our cor-

porate operations and across our investments. 

Environmental

We strongly value and understand the importance of mea-

suring our environmental impacts, reporting our progress 

Material Topics 
and Stakeholder 
Engagement
About This Report

This report covers the Firms’ ESG-related activities between January 1, 2022 
and December 31, 2022, unless noted otherwise. In determining the 
most important issues to our business, stakeholders and the industry, we 
continue to utilize the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and 
reference the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)  
standards for Asset Management & Custody Activities. 

and reducing those impacts over time. In working towards 

our net-zero ambition and in-line with our commitment to 

NZAM, we are increasingly focused on the measurement 

of climate-related KPIs and evaluation of our progress 

against past performance. KPI measurement is integral to 

identifying and managing climate-related risks and oppor-

tunities across our businesses. We have implemented 

processes to report our environmental impact data and 

are working to continuously improve the quality and level 

of detail in our disclosures. 

As a global investment firm, the majority of our direct oper-

ations are office-based and as a result, our environmental 

impacts from our corporate operations are relatively small. 

It is within our investments or from financed emissions 

(Scope 3, Category 15), where a majority of our GHG emis-

sions are produced. Aligned with our commitment, our firm 

is focused on mitigating risks but also on seizing opportuni-

ties where we can facilitate the transition to net zero. 

As a result, we believe the following GRI environ-
mental topics are most material to our business:

305: Emissions

302: Energy

304: Biodiversity*

303: Water and Effluents*

306: Waste*

*We have identified these topics to be most material within our 
operating business groups.

Brookfield’s history of owning and operating real assets 

and related businesses has taught us to leverage our 

operational expertise to enhance the value of our invest-

ments. Our business philosophy prioritizes a long-term 

perspective in terms of operating our investments in a 

sustainable and ethical manner. Focusing on doing good 

for our business generally results in outcomes comple-

mentary to value creation over time. 

We believe the following GRI economic top-
ics are most material to our business:

205: Anti-Corruption

207: Tax

Social

Throughout our operations and asset management 

activities, we are committed to supporting and enhanc-

ing the communities in which we operate. Whether 

they are our employees or investors, local community 

members or third-party vendors, the safety and well-be-

ing of these individuals is a top priority for Brookfield. 

Within our corporate operations, we regard human 

capital development as a priority. We value our people 

and support their long-term success for them to grow 

and develop professionally. 

As a result, we believe the following GRI social 
topics are most material to our business:

405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity

401: Employment

404: Training and Education

418: Customer Privacy

403: Occupational Health and Safety*

409: Forced or Compulsory Labor*

Stakeholder Engagement

Brookfield is one of the largest owners and operators of 

real assets globally. Our businesses operate across asset 

classes, creating a global network that is the Brookfield 

Ecosystem. This provides us with insights into how the 

world is changing, and we use this information to guide 

our investment decisions while adding value to our assets 

and businesses over the long-term. 

We engage with various stakeholders to help inform 

and improve our sustainability strategy, encourage 

sound ESG practices in our portfolio companies, maintain 

resiliency and create long-term value for our investors. 

See ESG Integration into Our Investment Process for 

further detail. 

Through our comprehensive communications program, 

our stakeholders receive regular updates on our per-

formance and progress toward our goals. This includes 

meetings, webcasts, annual filings, press releases and 

published reports such as our annual report and quar-

terly interim reports. This information and more can be 

found on our website, as well as our investor portal. We 

strive for full transparency and make our management 

available to communicate with investment analysts, 

financial advisors, rating agencies and the media.

When collaborating with external stakeholders, includ-

ing industry groups, we encourage our business groups 

to participate in knowledge-sharing practices facilitated 

through our ESG Affiliations and Partnerships and directly 

through Brookfield-coordinated engagements.

2-6 Activities, value chain and  
other business relationships

Sector in which Brookfield is active: GRI Sector: Capital Markets (Asset Owners and Managers)

For a more detailed description of our value chain, please see the Brookfield Corporation Annual Report pages 49-59.

Activities: Brookfield Corporation is focused on deploying its capital on a value basis and compounding it over the long-
term. 

Products & Services: This capital is allocated across its three core pillars of asset management, insurance solutions and 
its operating businesses. Employing a disciplined investment approach, we leverage our deep expertise as an owner and 
operator of real assets, as well as the scale and flexibility of our capital, to create value and deliver strong risk-adjusted 
returns across market cycles. Our products broadly fall into one of three categories: (i) long-term private funds, (ii) 
permanent capital vehicles and perpetual strategies and (iii) liquid strategies. These are invested across five principal 
strategies: (i) Infrastructure, (ii) Renewable Power and Transition, (iii) Private Equity, (iv) Real Estate, (v) Credit and other.

Markets Served: We operate in more than 30 countries on five continents around the world. We have incubated, built, 
and launched market leading businesses over the past 20 years, each of which has reached global scale and enables the 
Corporation to pursue acquisition or growth of the next market leader. Our existing relationships and reputation as a 
superior partner are true differentiators and have increasingly positioned us as the capital solutions provider of choice 
for major global brands.

Supply Chain: Brookfield works with a number of third-party service providers to support our business operations.

Downstream Entities:  When deploying capital, we seek to leverage our competitive advantages to acquire high-quality 
real assets or businesses that provide essential services that form the backbone of the global economy. We use our 
global reach and access to scale capital to source attractive investment opportunities and leverage our deep operating 
expertise to underwrite investments and create value throughout our ownership.

Other Relevant Business Relationships: Please refer to our ESG Affiliations and Partnerships for a description of our ESG 
business relationships. In addition, we believe our network of relationships drives proprietary information flow that 
helps guide our approach and adds value to our investments. These relationships include investors, portfolio companies, 
counterparties, government entities, tenants, communities, buyers and sellers and consumers across Renewable Power 
& Transition, Infrastructure, Private Equity, Real Estate, Credit and Insurance Solutions.

Significant Changes: At the end of 2022, we completed the distribution and listing of a 25% interest in Brookfield 
Corporation’s asset management business, through Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., giving investors direct access to 
the asset management business on a pure-play basis for the first time.

2-7 Employees Total number of investment and asset management employees as of 4/1/2023: 2,710 (45% female, 55% male)

Total number of investment and asset management employees as of 4/1/2022: 2,318 (45% female, 55% male)

% change in number of employees between 4/1/2022 and 4/1/2023: +17%

2-8 Workers who are  
not employees

We retain the services of consultants or contract workers from time to time to support our businesses. Generally, they 
provide specialized knowledge and/or skills that are not readily available within the organization, or allow  
specific tasks to be completed on an accelerated basis.

Information unavailable / incomplete We do not currently track this data.

2-15 Conflicts of interest The Brookfield Corporation Board of Directors Governance and Nominating Committee reviews and recommends 
the implementation of structures and procedures to facilitate the Board’s independence from management and to 
avoid conflicts of interest; reviews and conducts oversight of all significant proposed related party transactions and 
situations involving a potential conflict of interest that are not required to be dealt with by an “independent special 
committee” pursuant to applicable securities law rules (where appropriate under applicable laws, the Committee may 
sit as an independent special committee), and will ensure that no such transaction is inconsistent with the interests of 
the Corporation and its shareholders; and ) review and assess the Corporation’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
for directors, officers and employees (the “Code”) to confirm that it addresses, among other things, conflicts of interest, 
confidentiality, fair dealing, protection and proper use of the Corporation’s assets and opportunities, compliance with 
applicable laws, rules and regulations (including insider trading laws) and the reporting of illegal or unethical behavior, 
and establishes mechanisms to facilitate the effective operation of the Code and the granting of waivers of the Code.

Please refer to pages 11-19 of the Management Information Circular for details on cross-board memberships and 
the existence of controlling shareholders. Please refer to pages 103, 146, 152 and 226 of the Brookfield Corporation 
Annual Report for related parties, their relationships, transactions, and outstanding balances. Please note than cross-
shareholding with suppliers is not applicable to our business.

2-16 Communication of  
critical concerns

Please refer to page 2 of the Brookfield Corporation Board of Directors Charter. The Board meets regularly to review 
reports by management on the Corporation’s performance and other relevant matters of interest. In addition to the 
general supervision of management, the Board performs the following: in conjunction with the Audit Committee of 
the Board, establish whistleblower policies for the Corporation providing employees, officers, directors and other 
stakeholders, including the public, with the opportunity to raise, anonymously or not, questions, complaints or 
concerns regarding the Corporation’s practices, including fraud, policy violations, any illegal or unethical conduct, and 
any accounting, auditing or internal control matters. The Board or a committee thereof will provide oversight over the 
Corporation’s whistleblower policies and practices to ensure that any questions, complaints or concerns are adequately 
received, reviewed, investigated, documented and resolved.

2-17 Collective knowledge of the 
highest governance body

Please refer to pages 1-2 of the Brookfield Corporation Board of Directors Charter for a description of measures taken to 
advance the knowledge, skills and experience of the board on sustainable development.

Director Education and Orientation: The Corporation’s management team is responsible for providing an orientation 
program for new directors in respect of the Corporation and the role and responsibilities of directors. In addition, 
directors will, as required, receive continuing education about the Corporation to maintain a current understanding of 
the Corporation’s business and operations, industries and sectors in which we operate globally, material developments 
and trends in asset management and the Corporation’s strategic initiatives. The Board meets regularly to review reports 
by management on the Corporation’s performance and other relevant matters of interest. In addition to the general 
supervision of management, the Board oversees the Corporation’s approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance 
matters within its corporate and asset management activities as reported to the Board by the Governance, Nominating 
and Compensation Committee.

2-18 Evaluation of the performance 
of the highest governance 
body

Board of Directors Charter page 3, Management Information Circular, pages 29-38.

2-19 Remuneration policies The Governance and Nominating Committee recommends to the Board the compensation for non-management 
directors (it is the policy of the Corporation that management directors do not receive compensation for their service on 
the Board). In reviewing the adequacy and form of compensation, the Governance and Nominating Committee seeks to 
ensure that director compensation reflects the responsibilities and risks involved in being a director of the Corporation 
and aligns the interests of the directors with the best interests of the Corporation. Board of Directors Charter, 
Management Information Circular, pages 56-85.

2-20 Process to determine  
remuneration

Please refer to a description of the Board of Director's processes for determining renumeration in the Management 
Resources & Compensation Committee Charter and Management Information Circular, pages 24-26, 56-85. 

As noted in the charter, a Board of Directors committee of independent directors (the Management Resources 
& Compensation Committee) oversees the process. The Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate 
any independent consulting firm to be used to evaluate the CEO or the compensation of the CEO or other senior 
management. The Corporation has a policy providing that holders of Class A Shares have the opportunity to cast 
an advisory vote on the Corporation’s approach to executive compensation on an annual basis. This policy reflects 
the Corporation’s ongoing efforts to meet its objectives and ensure a high level of shareholder engagement. The 
results of the vote of holders of Class A Shares on the advisory resolution on the Corporation’s Approach to Executive 
Compensation at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 11, 2021 is noted on pages 24-26 of the Management 
Information Circular.

207-3 Stakeholder engagement and 
management of concerns 
related to tax

With regard to stakeholder engagement and management of concerns related to tax, Brookfield is committed to 
maintaining a cooperative and open working relationship with tax authorities globally and ensuring that any tax audits 
are managed effectively. We seek to make fair, accurate and timely disclosures in correspondence and tax returns and 
respond to queries in a timely manner.  
 
Brookfield regularly collaborates with government bodies in several countries regarding new tax legislation with a view 
to helping shape fair, effective and efficient regulatory frameworks.   
 
Brookfield regularly receives input, questions, and requests from various stakeholders regarding tax matters, 
including public shareholders and private fund investors. All requests are addressed on a timely basis, subject to any 
confidentiality constraints. The input from stakeholders is taken into account when developing tax strategies within the 
organization.

207-4 Country-by-country reporting Confidentiality constraints Please note that due to confidentiality constraints, 
we are not in a position to publicly disclose coun-
try-by-country reporting. 
 
Brookfield prepares and files a country-by-country 
(CbC) report each year with the Canada Revenue 
Agency (CRA) as required by tax law. The CbC report in-
cludes thousands of legal entities that are consolidated 
in our financial statements across multiple business 
groups and sectors. Further, the GRI Standard for CbC 
reporting includes information that is not prepared in 
the CbC report filed by Brookfield with the CRA and is 
not readily available. Lastly, Brookfield will fully comply 
with the E.U. public country-by-country reporting 
requirements once they become effective.

Our Investment 
Approach

1 The scope of offices reported was expanded in 2021 to cover all BAM offices. This ensures alignment with SBTi and GHG Protocol guidance requiring at least 95% of operational emissions to be captured, and the historical 
years back to 2019 have been updated to reflect this change. The decrease in office count from 2019 to 2021 is related to office consolidation and/or closure.
2 GHG emissions were measured consistent with the guidelines set out by the GHG Protocol.
3 E-waste volumes vary based on new technology deployment and collection in a given year; however, our target is to recycle 100% of e-waste created. Actual values were included where available; in some instances, data 
estimates were calculated based on internal and/or industry-average data, in line with leading industry guidance.
