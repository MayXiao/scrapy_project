Decarbonization Targets

As one of the world’s largest banks, we have a clear role to play in financing the transition to a greener economy. 
We have met the goal of being carbon-neutral in our own operations in 2020, but we aim to go further and raise 
our level of commitment

What do we want to achieve?

Additional targets on 
other material sectors 

like energy, aviation and 
steel have been published,

Decarbonization Targets

Our updated Environmental, Social and Climate Change Risk Policy covers all our lending practices to customers involved in coal 
fired power plants, and in the extraction, production and treatment of oil and gas, expressly prohibiting funding to (among others):

Sectorial policies

construction or expansion of oil & gas extraction from 

tar sands, fracking or coal bed methane

Power Generation

- From 2030, any entities with more than 10% of revenues, on a 

consolidated basis, directly derived from coal fired power 

generation

- Project-related financing for new coal-fired power plants 

projects worldwide, or for the upgrade and/or expansion of 

existing coal-fired plants

worldwide, except for transactions for the specific financing for 

renewable energy

Decarbonization Targets

As part of the NZBA, we have estimated the current and future emissions of our power generation portfolio and proposed 
the first GHG decarbonization targets for 2025 and 2030, further aligning our portfolio to the Paris Agreement

Further commitments

The emissions intensity of our 
power generation portfolio is 0.21 

tCO2e/MWh, based on 2019 
portfolio data. Santander is 

committed to reducing it to 0.11 
tCO2e/MWh by 2030, in line with

Decarbonization Targets

New commitments

* In last year’s Climate Finance Report, we assessed the 2019 financed emissions of our power generation portfolio, including guarantees and other types of off-balance exposure to our customers that do not entail current funding. Because,
according to the PCAF standard, such exposure should not be calculated if its attribution factor is “outstanding”, we were over-attributed with our corporate customers’ emissions. Therefore, the 2019 baseline emissions intensity has been
restated from 0.23 to 0.21. The target and climate ambition remains for this sector.
** Use of sold products

We have set new decarbonization targets according to our internal roadmap from last year’s Climate Finance Report.
They target the most carbon intensive and material sectors. These new targets have been set for 2030 against 2019,
for the energy (-29% absolute emissions), aviation (-33% emissions intensity) and steel sectors (-32% emissions
intensity)

Helping clients to transition
(transactions arranged and executed  by SBP)

• Poland’s energy mix is shifting away 
from coal to Renewable Energy Sources 
(RES)

• Santander Bank Polska (SBP) credit 
portfolio should be aligned with the 
coal-exit 2030 benchmark earlier than 
the deadline

• SCIB is the market leader in Green 
Finance with estimated market share 
exceeding 15%

• Government approved energy strategy 
plan (PEP2040) that assumes 17GW of 
new capacity in RES and gas by 2030

• It is estimated that the above plan will 
require between EUR 20 bn and EUR 32

800 MW offshore wind Project off the
coast of Massachusetts and the first large
scale offshore wind farm in the US.

Santander was mandated lead arranger in the
financing of Dogger Bank C, a 1.2 GW wind farm
being built off the coast of Yorkshire. It is the
largest offshore wind Project financing to date, and
is due to be the largest offshore wind farm globally.

We believe it is critical to protect the Amazon rainforest in order to tackle climate change. In July 2020, Santander 
Brazil announced a plan to promote sustainable development in the Amazon in collaboration with the two other largest 
private-sector banks in Brazil (Itaú & Bradesco)

Protecting the Amazon

Brazilian Amazon approach

Santander was the first private-sector Brazilian bank to
develop in 2002 credit analysis that considered environmental
and social risks, and in 2016, we were the first bank to formally
incorporate a sustainability rating into the credit score of our
Corporate clients

Actions taken:

• Loan requests by farmers & ranchers are checked for 
embargoes related to illegal deforestation

• Looking ahead we will expect beef processing clients in 
the Amazon to have a fully traceable supply chain that is 
deforestation-free by 2025, including indirect suppliers 
of cattle, as a prerequisite for granting credit

• Client’s practices are reviewed annually (more than 
2,000 clients), including beef processors, soy traders 
and logging companies

• Founders of The Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS)

The Plano Amazônia prioritizes eliminating deforestation from
the beef value chain, understanding the land ownership issue
and promoting the cultivation of local crops

• As part of its credit approval for loans to farmers and ranchers, 
Santander works with a satellite-imaging firm that monitors 17,000 
properties that are financed or that are taken as collateral

• For corporate clients across Brazil, not just in the Amazon, Santander 
has a set of processes and controls that take into consideration if our 
clients are legally compliant and have good practices

• Santander continues to engage with other concerned parties to stop 
deforestation. It was the first bank in Brazil to require native-species 
lumber companies to have the Forest Stewardship Certification (FSC) 
to become a client, as well as the RSPO (Round Table on Sustainable 
Palm Oil) and RTSR certifications

Note: FSC stands for Forest Stewardship Certification ; RSPO stands for Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil

We continue to help people access the financial system and set up micro-businesses while we provide them with the
appropriate tools to manage their finances. This is achieved through initiatives like Santander Finance for All:

Financial Inclusion & Empowerment - Global approach

Through this global strategy we address the needs of individuals and SMEs in Europe, Latin America and the US who have 
limited financial knowledge, financial difficulties or problems obtaining credit with 3 main lines of action:

Access Finance Resilience/Financial Education

We foster resilience through financial 
education, promoting skills and 

knowledge to support better informed 
financial decisions. Our programmes are 

diverse and target various groups

Financial Inclusion, Empowerment & Community support

Ensure financing for SMEs and 
entrepreneurs who have trouble obtaining 
credit, through microfinance and provide 
financing to cover the basic needs of low-

income households

We aim to guarantee basic financial services 
for everyone, promoting access to the 

Banking system and payment accounts. We 
also seek to guarantee financial products in 

sparsely populated, or remote areas

• 9 mn people financially empowered 
since 2019.

programmes were launched in Peru, 
Colombia and Chile and are now

We are proud to have developed financial inclusion initiatives that have been successfully implemented in the LATAM region

Financial Inclusion & Empowerment - Key initiatives

inclusion programme in Mexico for low-
income households, designed to make a 
positive impact by offering competitive

Prospera is the largest microfinance 
programme offered by a private bank in

without access to formal banking. Since 2015 
it has offered microloans and other products 
at social inclusion branches in Argentina, it 

was also launched in Uruguay in 2019, and in  
Colombia & Peru in 2021
